SPELL

From the moonlit brink of dreams 
        I stretch foiled hands to thee,
O borne down other streams 
        Than eye can think to see!
O crowned with spirit-beams! 
        O veiled spirituality!

My dreams and thoughts abate 
        Their pennons at thy feet,
O angel born too late 
        For fallen men to meet!
In what new sensual state 
        Could our twined lives feel sweet?

What new emotion must 
        I dream to think thee mine?
What purity of lust? 
        O tendrilled as a vine
Around my caressed trust! 
        O dream-pressed spirit-wine!
