Beauty and love let no one separate,
Whom exact Nature did to each ocher fit,
Giving to Beauty love as finishing fate
And to Love beauty as true colour of it.
Let he but friend be who the soul finds fair,
But let none love outside the body's thought,
So the seen couple's togetherness shall bear
Truth to the beauty each in the other sought.
I could but love thee out of mockery
Of love and thee and mine own ugliness;
Therefore thy beauty I sing and wish not thee,
Thanking the Gods I long not out of place 
        Lest, like a slave that for kings' robes doth long, 
        Obtained, shall with mere wearing do them wrong.
