The bridegroom aches for the end of this and lusts


To know those paps in sucking gusts,


To put his first hand on that belly's hair


And feel for the lipped lair,


The fortress made but to be taken, for which


He feels the battering ram grow large and itch.


The trembling glad bride feels all the day hot


On that still cloistered spot


Where only her nightly maiden hand did feign


A pleasure's empty gain.


And, of the others, most will whisper at this,


Knowing the spurt it is;


And children yet, that watch with looking eyes,


Will now thrill to be wise


In flesh, and with big men and women act


The liquid tickling fact


For whose taste they'1l in secret corners try


They scarce know what still dry
