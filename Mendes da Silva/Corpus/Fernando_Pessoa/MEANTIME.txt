MEANTIME

Far away, far away, 
        Far away from here...
There is no worry after joy 
        Or away from fear
Far away from here.

Her lips were not very red,
        Nor her hair quite gold.
Her hands played with rings. 
        She did not let me hold
Her hands playing with gold.

She is something past, 
        Far away from pain.
Joy can touch her not, nor hope 
        Enter her domain, 
        Neither love in vain.

Perhaps at some day beyond 
        Shadows and light
She will think of me and make 
        All me a delight 
        All away from sight.
