SONNET

Could I say what I think, could I express
My every hidden and too silent thought,
And bring my feelings, in perfection wrought,
To one unforced point of living stress;

Could I breathe forth my soul, could I confess
The inmost secrets to my nature brought,
I might be great; yet none to me has tought,
A language well to figure my distress.

Yet day and night to me new whispers bring, 
And night and day from me old whispers lakeâ€¦
Oh for a word, one phrase in which to fling

All that I think or feel and so to wake
The world, but I am dumb and cannot sing -
Dumb as you clouds before the thunders break.
