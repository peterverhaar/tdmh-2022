FRATERNITY? I have no reason to love mankind, Nor, alas! mankind one to love me; To all its vileness I am not blind, And all vileness it well can see. If my hatred in words ne'er wreak I know, as none do, ununderstood It is of all men; were I to speak, As unknown of them remain it would. So, all in instinct, a mutual hate, Hid under smiling, we bear each other. All mankind's kindness well I can rate; And I hate each man, and call him brother'.
