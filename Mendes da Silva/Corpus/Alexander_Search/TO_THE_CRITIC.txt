TO THE CRITIC

To its own father that child fair doth seem 
Which unbribed eyes may but indifferent deem; 
        Therefore this book, my child's first son too dear, 
        Do thou inspect with careful search austere. 
        If good, I better promise to indict; 
        If bad, I will not think thou sayest right. 
        'Tis not my pride, but human nature, friend, 
        Owning no wrong doth covertly amend.
