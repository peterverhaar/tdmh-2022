THE GIANT'S REPLY

I met a giant upon my way;
        He looked more wise than Nature.
«Tell me some truth», thus my tongue did betray
        My soul so that more than creature.
- «There is but one's, in an old voice strange
        He cried: «things are more, I say,
Than Time in which they seem to change
And than Space that seems more than they».
