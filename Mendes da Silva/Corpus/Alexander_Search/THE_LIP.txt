THE LIP One day in half‑slumbrous raving        Where I saw strange fancies skip,I saw in a dream, by no light's gleam,         A man with only one lip -        Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely,         Absolutely with only one lip. I remember well that he had no face        Nor a nose with a usual tip;He had nor eyes, nor cheks, nor hair         But only, only one lip -        Only one, only one, only one,         Only one, one, one lip. Can ye think of it without terror?        No other lip did slipInto the vision, nor was it a lack:         There was only, only one lip.Could you see him as I you would grow mad.        That man with only one lip.
