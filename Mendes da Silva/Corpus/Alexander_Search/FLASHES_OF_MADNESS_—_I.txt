FLASHES OF MADNESS    I.   Thy hand with its lovely fingers          And the heavy rings on them! How my soul over them lingers  Each finger with a heavy gem,  Each ring like a small diadem!   When thou and I are alone, One only wish my soul stings —  Holding thy hand in my own, All night, while the night-bird sings, To take off and replace thy rings.
