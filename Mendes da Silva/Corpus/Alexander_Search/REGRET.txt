REGRET   I would that I were again a child         And a child you sweet and pure, That we might be free and wild         In our consciousness obscure; That we might play fantastic games         Under trees silent and shady, That we might have fairy-book names,         I be a lord, you a lady.   And all were a strong ignorance         And a healthy want of thought, And many a [prank?], many a dance         Our unresting feet had wrought; And I would act well a clown's part         To your childish laughter winning, And I would call you my sweetheart         And the name would have no meaning.   Or sitting close we each other would move         With tales that now gone are sad; We would have no sex, would feel no love,         Good without fighting the bad. And a flower would be our life's delight         And a nutshell boat our treasure: We would lock it in a cupboard at night         As in memory a pleasure.   We would spend hours and days like a wealth         Of goodness too great to cloy, We would deep enjoy innocence and health         Knowing not we did enjoy... Ah, what bitterest is is that-alone         Now one feeling in me I trace - That knowledge of what from us hath gone         And of what it left in its place.
