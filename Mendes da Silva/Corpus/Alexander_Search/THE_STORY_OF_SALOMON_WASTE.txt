THE STORY OF SOLOMON WASTE   This is all the story of Solomon Waste.   Always hurrying yet never in haste,  He fussed and worked and toiled all frothing  And at the end of all did nothing.  This is all the story of Solomon Waste.   He lived in wishing and in striving,  And nothing came of all his living;  He worked and toiled in rain and sweat,  And nothing came out of all that.  This is all the story of Solomon Waste.   He thought much and had no conviction,  His feeling was at best affliction  Though tender he and hating evil  He might have gained the name of devil.  His every wish and resolution  Even in his mind was but confusion.  This is all the story of Solomon Waste.   And things begun and never ended,  And much undone and much intended,  And all things wrong yet never mended:  This is all the story of Solomon Waste.   Each day new projects did betray,  Yet each day was like every day.  He was born and died and between these  He worried himself himself to tease.  He bustled, worried, moved and cried  But in his life no more's descried  Than two clear facts: he lived and died.  This is all the story of Solomon Waste.
