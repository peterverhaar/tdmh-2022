@farrahakase I know. Such a tragedy. I barely began to be a fan of hers, barely a month. A tear runs from my eyes, cause I felt how special she was, from the first moment I saw her in the feud with Guilia. I was just watching the Stardom clips, then horrible news. Always remember #HanaKimura

@TheGreatFowler IMO if someone actually has the nerve to troll someone with bad health, they are pitiful and shameless and hide behind a keyboard and wouldn’t dare say things to people’s faces so I say if your getting trolled or bullied or teased simple reply #HanaKimura and leave it at that.

#HanaKimura https://t.co/U1yYrXIMWv
So the Terrace House clip that lead to Hana Kimura's suicide that got her maliciously cyberbullied ended up being staged by the show's producers. Terrace House's producers lead Hana Kimura to her death. This show should NEVER return. #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura #TerraceHouse
https://t.co/kkktD88dtu smh #HanaKimura
Man this was a heavy read 1. F**k The producers behind Terrace House 2. Massive respect to Kyoko Kimura for this candid interview 3. I hope to god that Kimura, Stardom or the combination of the two sue the ever-living hell out of FujiTV I hope #HanaKimura is at peace now https://t.co/jhMcUBCRXV

We talk a lot on Twitter. Sometimes for fun. Other times to mock haters. Unfortunately, the dark side is abuse that comes from mobs of hatred. Hatred that became too much for Reckful &amp; Hana Kimura. I hope we all strive to be kinder to each other. #RIPReckful #HanaKimura

To make someone feel alone and push them to the brink... It's despicable. And such actions led to a person in Japan take the extreme step of ending her beautiful life - you all best look up #HanaKimura #KimuraHana and reflect. Report Keem for what he is doing!

I will not stand for cyberbullying to commence again and take another victim ever since it led to the tragic death of #HanaKimura. Laura Bailey is a fantastic voice actress who doesn't deserve any of this. #WeLoveYouLaura
I didn’t notice that Kai was in this picture at first - after finding that out I’m deeply ashamed and disappointed in all of them, especially him. They couldn’t wait the 49 days in line with Hana’s mother’s Buddhist beliefs 💔 #RIPHanaKimura #HanaKimura #木村花 #TERRACEHOUSE https://t.co/qXiV1nBvsa

@diamond_I3itch It's terrible. It leads to so much self harm. We lost the exceptional wrestler #HanaKimura R.I.P. over hate, discrimination and prejudice and Cyber bullying. We must protect each other and not allow this to continue online, or anywhere else.
En los últimos días te he extrañado mucho. Nos haces mucha falta pero nos queda tu sonrisa en cada promo, tu entrega en cada lucha, tu enorme carisma que siempre ilumino todos los lugares donde te paraste. Una vez más, gracias por todo. YES SIR!🌸 #HanaKimura https://t.co/2Elo4N1sfC
I can't believe that a reality show forced an innocent and kind girl to be violent for their own business. How they can be so egoistic!? Did they think bout how her life will be changed?! Did they think how she'll feels after?! No. Ugh.. I'm done. #HanaKimura 🌺 #TerraceHouse 🖕🏻 https://t.co/m2aMnRYNPE
Very disgusted with the producers of #TerraceHouse. If the confrontation between #HanaKimura &amp; Kai over Hana's ruined costume (which caused the online bullying leading to Hana's death) was staged, then Hana's blood is also on the show producers' hands as well as the bullies'. 😠

La presion de las redes y la sociedad del hate acabaron con su vida. Era una gran promesa de la lucha libre femenina, te fuiste demasiado pronto Hana. Midan sus palabras. Lo que para ti es una broma, para otro puede significar mucho, suficiente para quitarse la vida. #HanaKimura https://t.co/tm4LO1gAOj
The Hana Kimura story is still so tragic and could've easily been avoided if people could be decent human beings. Just sad. She didn't deserve the hate she got. No one ever deserves to bullied. Especially, to the point that they take their own life. #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura
@farrahakase FUCK IT!!!! #HanaKimura deserved The BEST and so do ALL Female Pro-Wrestlers
@farrahakase I am just disgusted and hurt after reading this #HanaKimura deserved better
I knew it - the producers of Terrace House staged the whole costume incident (amongst MANY other things). The people responsible for this need to be held accountable. Fucking disgusting 💢 #JusticeForHana #HanaKimura #TERRACEHOUSE #木村花 #RIPHanaKimura #テラスハウス #フジテレビ https://t.co/DtLblFQBAH

@IamMikaze @voiceswrestling Look at #HanaKimura , I bet anything that the people behind the keyboards as she took her own life are still on the same @ or at a push on another @ and are terrorising other people on twitter. This shit needs to stop. Alexa Bliss has gone private &amp; psychos trying to hack her now
Why is there so much hate on @AlexaBliss_WWE recently? Leave her alone. Did the world not learn from the death of #HanaKimura?
I'm definitely gonna get a heat for this (it's a Twitter ffs) But something needs to be said and done #木村拓哉 #HanaKimura https://t.co/oRiBcIRpZ0

Miss you. #HanaKimura https://t.co/SGVN1UlJzI
Il y a quelques jours, on perdait #HanaKimura à cause du harcèlement systémique qu'elle a subit depuis son enfance et qui s'est renforcé depuis qu'elle est connue. Maintenant, c'est @AlexaBliss_WWE qui subit pareil. 1/2

@kimurarock I totally agree! All these shirts have flooded sites like eBay. I really wish @we_are_stardom would put out a design your family approves of and the proceeds go directly to you or a charity of your choosing! Every time I see these fake products they are reported. #HanaKimura #rip
Ay no.... me acabo de enterar que mi personaje favorito de #TerraceHouse tokio se suicido por bullying en internet después del reality.... Que triste... #HanaKimura #RIP https://t.co/WePZ9qSAGd
This is #HanaKimura mother. Devastating to see that people are using Hana to gain money. Please do NOT buy these shirts. It is people selling to gain money for themselves. https://t.co/097zJZTByS

Professional Japanese wrestler #HanaKimura, who reportedly experienced cyberbullying after her appearance in a reality show, has died of a suspected suicide. To end #cyberbullying, we should first act from ourselves. https://t.co/WE9ltELGqm
I don't really know why this has affected me as much as it has but, I only heard of #HanaKimura since her death. To those bastards who drove her to commit suicide (this is not a threat) you will get your comeuppance...

@watabe1972 People didn’t learn the lesson from Hana Komura tragedy. Even though there are some reasons, we don’t need to bully others. Other life is other’s, we don’t have the right to break other’s life. #stopbullying #bully #bullying #affair #HanaKimura
as far as I know...Terrace House did not provide psychological support for their members. ...whatever social media support that the members had...it was all on the member and their own personal agency. - @farrahakase #hanakimura https://t.co/U61CrkwSlx

If you see someone being harassed or bullied online don't be a bystander. Your support could be the difference and motivation someone may need to keep going. #UNPARALLELEDHUMAN #CyberBullying #HanaKimura https://t.co/0RVrSEWLs5 https://t.co/yS59v5Tsau
I hope such #HanaKimura or similar issues happened everyday in Japan should be solved very soon but we should punish the leaders at the intended groups..not punish the individuals involved coincidentally, or we can't solve this issue.
#NHK was picked up the #HanaKimura issue, they focus on 'disrespects by individuals', it was really bad. they should focus on 'disrespect by intended groups' because the leader/organizer should be 'most' blamed such issue.
The issue about #Hanakimura is 'disrespects by intended groups', that is, someone call for gathering and say 'let's disrespect $(person/company and etc..)', it is used to blind the fact and etc. of course, it is used 'hey, let's keep $(person/company and etc..) safe!'.
I was a victim such disrespected issue by a intended group a couple years ago. so I was really sorry #HanaKimura ,they dare to hide invisibly and disrespected too much like #ddos attack and disclose my personal informations..really hurt..
Still heartbroken. It took me a long time to realize her death and to finish this tribute which, I hope, will make everyone agree that in 2020 we must stop behaving like animals. #HanaKimura #TerraceHouse #riphana https://t.co/k1YSM1PYYV

So I think they, the show has lost respect and reverence from their own diehard fans. So it's, I highly doubt the show might even come back.... @farrahakase #japan #sports #hanakimura https://t.co/U61CrkwSlx

|🗒✍🏼: Tf is wrong with other parodies mentioning the word “suicide” like c’mon now we lost #HanaKimura and now some “Sonny” parody is being a bitch. Dude like c’mon quit being a bitch. Hana actually meant something to the world that is ‘pro wrestling’.

It’s ironic that everyone was on their soapboxes against bullying and trashing people online when #HanaKimura committed suicide, but suddenly bullying and online trashing is ok again regarding #JaxsonRyker... God forbid someone believes something different than you... hypocrites.

I love Rebecca Quin, aka Becky Lynch, and will continue to support/Stan her. But, let’s hold up on saying she was cyber bullied. #HanaKimura @SashaBanksWWE @NaomiWWE we’re bullied, Becky was criticized, not bullied. She realized her mistake and corrected it. That’s it.
2020 is proving to be the worst year ever, losing @Shadbeast #HanaKimura and now a man called #dannyhavoc. Things are just getting worse, I hope and pray things will get better 🙏 and my thoughts and prayers to Danny Havoc's family. #RIPDannyHavoc

Today I had a talk with my Japanese daughter about Terrace House &amp; #HanaKimura. I didn't know she was a fan. But not anymore. My JP family comes from a wrestling background so I think that's what makes this even harder.Nothing really else to say. Just something more than US news.

Muito triste o que aconteceu com ela, #HanaKimura. Que você tenha um lugar no céu, você não merecia o que aconteceu! 🖤
Yo, I didn't know anything about her until her unfortunate passing. But the trolls really fucked up bad w/ this one. How could you bully someone so fucking fine into suicide?! (It's wrong regardless) But looking beyond the ugly photo most outlets used, I'm speechless. #hanakimura https://t.co/atCe09BXVM

I’m very conflicted as to whether or not I should finish watching this season of #TERRACEHOUSE. I feel very deeply for #HanaKimura &amp; am strongly #AntiBullying. On one hand, I think I would feel guilty for watching. On the other hand, I feel like I owe it to her memory to watch.
C'était ma préférée de cette saison de Terrace House, si attachante et sensible. Un manque d'humanité chez l'être l'humain. RIP #HanaKimura https://t.co/pyHwMAEkSn

@Samuraigodzilla @Maydaysann Yeah, the agencies have very specific “standards” they force onto the industry. See #HanaKimura tragedy as well.
If you are alive, don't stay in Japan, most of your whole life, the Japanese people looked down on you, I am sorry what happened to you but know that you are loved and even though there are some bad seed in this world, never forget who you are but who knows #HanaKimura
#HanaKimura was a sweet girl, no matter what happened we need to decide which is important, living or dying. The decision we make is what define us. Whether you are alive or dead, the mess you leave in the end, goes to your love ones
Just now watching this week’s @WWENXT. Praise 2 the voice of #NXT, #MauroRanallo, 4 paying his respects to and honoring the memory of #HanaKimura on-air, and admonishing Cyber-Bullying. I’m sad he’s not on @Twitter anymore but I hope his fans c this. @TwitterForGood @WWEUniverse

Doing a write-up on what happened to #HanaKimura. I came across an interview she did on TV when she was 6. She was so adorable. The interviewer asked her if she wanted to be a wrestler. She said, "No! My dream is to become a marathon runner! I can run fast, you know!" https://t.co/bD5ckc4Kme

A prominent social figure dies after being cyberbullied, and the #bebest crowd stay silent? #flotus #HanaKimura
@njiska @thechadhugo @shiraishorizon @DantaroKujo I agree with you, I would even think he might get reprimanded for it. Mauro's all class, and what happened to #HanaKimura is terrible.
@YouTubeJapan and @YouTube Can you please let us know what you doing about this vile individual? @JapanGov said they are taking cyber bullying seriously after the death of #HanaKimura Myself &amp; many others have reported this channel. This man is an affront to common decency. https://t.co/Qeh7GW0C1R

https://t.co/DWvpwlBfQD Black man killed while resisting arrest. Riots, violence, stores burglarized. Beloved woman driven suicide due to bullying by anonymous users? No unrest. In both cases: Racial elements, warning signs ignored, and a life was taken too soon. #HanaKimura
I just found out about #HanaKimura today and I still can't believe it. She was my favorite member ever and I really admired her. It's such sad news. My heart goes out to her family and the other terrace house members. 💔
For the rest of the month I'm posting about #HanaKimura, because I want to focus on her life and not her tragic death. This is Day Five, which is a GIF of her outstanding missile dropkick. #RIPHanaKimura https://t.co/3W6yQl2KvW

Times have been tough for the family. A BBQ tank ran on empty, so it had to be replaced as well as bills that pile on. It's also been storming hard in my hometown. And me? I'm seeing things in a different light &amp; feeling calmer as a result. In honor of one #HanaKimura 4/
RIP, Hana. When I watched your episodes on TH, all I could do was SCREAM about how CUTE and AWESOME you were. I couldn't wait to watch more episodes to see if you found happiness with someone. This world took your smile away. I hope we can be better in your memory. #HanaKimura
Der offizielle #TerraceHouse Instagram-Account hat alle Beiträge zur aktuellen Staffel aus dem Feed entfernt. Grund ist der Suizid der Teilnehmerin #HanaKimura, die sich nach Cybermobbing-Attacken das Leben genommen hat. Leider ist dieser Move typisch für Japan. 😠

Hana was 22 years old. She took her life because you people need your reassurance by teaming up and bullying folks on social media. No one deserves to take their own life. She was such a soft, caring soul that cannot be replaced. #HanaKimura

The death of 22-year-old Hana Kimura, a Japanese pro wrestler who starred in the Netflix reality show Terrace House, is swiftly morphing into a narrative about the possible perils of cyberbullying. #HanaKimura #TerraceHouse #suicide #CyberBullying https://t.co/NUC4Vwb3Y1
@cmpuls3 @hanadayo0903 #HanaKimura
But also the fact that evolves out of this, is that Twitter works out to be of such a great value, because, though, it is known to drive people (celebrities) to suicide, for others (laymen) it serves as an anonymous channel for a person to express what one feels. #HanaKimura
I’m killing my #prowrestling “burner” accounts. I was never too harsh on anyone. But, after #HanaKimura and the whole thing with JD and Alexa I feel like accountability is important. From now on...real name, real face and STILL none will, or should, care. Be kind to each other. https://t.co/MygeATqGX7

@TerraceHouseCap A unique and sensitive soul, who, despite her strong outward appearance and persona, was looking for affection and care. She wanted someone to, “wrap their arms around my broad shoulders.” I hope you can feel the loving embrace of the world now. You didn’t have to go. #HanaKimura

#HanaKimura Cette analyse du mode troll par @RondaRousey est non seulement pertinente mais aussi bien tournée. https://t.co/VWM0fFzYKI
And I am 100% comfortable saying that #HanaKimura would be alive if it weren't for Terrace House and you fucking vultures. I hope you're goddamn happy
I'm comfortable with saying that pro wrestling lost a generational talent in #HanaKimura who could have brought pro wrestling back the prestige we saw in the late '80s. And it only could've taken a woman who understood what made pro wrestling work in the ring and out
Now I’m extremely sad about #HanaKimura She was only 22 and such a bright star. A fierce Japanese female, bucking stereotypes, looking for love in the wrong places but learning &amp; growing. Get to know her on #TerraceHouse and you’ll understand why the world is mourning her loss. https://t.co/FinN6EMmsu
it's a bit tired, but pro wrestling as an analogy for labor and the intimacy that comes when you entrust your life to another for the sake of a performance seemed to be a natural thought for #HanaKimura
Even at 22, #HanaKimura understood how important having even the slightest ability of forethought and empathy when working with other people was. the smallest lapse of judgement may lead to someone dying in the ring
For #HanaKimura, the smallest mistake in performing could easily lead to someone being hurt for a long time, making them lose out not only on money for a show... but even ending their livelihood for the rest of their life, or even worse killing them
Muchas veces hemos alertado de los peligros del ciberacoso. Esta vez, tenemos que lamentar el suicidio de la luchadora japonesa #HanaKimura que se ha quitado la vida tras unas semanas sufriendo acoso por la red. DEP https://t.co/W6CKKOixam vía @marca
For #HanaKimura, to perform and bring people joy on the stage/in the ring, an indispensable quality was to have enough awareness to have forethought, to take the time to think about how even the smallest action could affect the others you work with day in day out
I've never watched Terrace House but I did watch the clip that allegedly brought #HanaKimura over the edge with cyberbullying... Something that caught my eye was how mad she was that a performer would, in their daily life, be so inconsiderate about the people around them
But when you saw #HanaKimura you immediately got a sense of where the hell she was going in pro wrestling... vary rarely do you get a wrestler who could, in a comedy match, bring both sheer admiration while making you root against her in the ring
We miss you #HanaKimura 😔😔😔 I making this at VN Video Editor https://t.co/vPbImSKjwY
Last year golden week i went to my first stardom show. I thought i would have more chances to go back to Shinkiba in 2020 when i moved to Tokyo and more chances to see #HanaKimura wrestle https://t.co/5lhLN6zuOq
This person hasn't learnt ANYTHING from the incident. It was the mean menaces telling Hana to die that actually lead to this tragedy, the Kai incident only "activated" the haters. And then these "perfect" people do EXACTLY THE SAME to Kai. Just sordid. #HanaKimura #TerraceHouse https://t.co/4iQMHkUypU
Even the aftermath of #HanaKimura's suicide reveals the vileness of some people. So people knew about her conflict with #KaiKobayashi from #TerraceHouse and the wrestling gear. One telling Kai that it would be his fault and he was a murderer despite it is all wrong. Disgusting! https://t.co/Kqca11rR6Y
The # of comments bashing #HanaKimura on social media sometimes rose to about 100 a day, NHK reports. Her death is not officially ruled as a suicide yet, but police is investigating into the possibility she took her own life b/c of online harassment https://t.co/stIb9YrCvE

@kelto724 from instagram is one of the main bullies on Instagram that kept telling Hana to disappear and calling her “ugly.” She responded to them a few months ago as a cry for help and nobody really noticed. He deleted his account. #HanaKimura #HanaKimuraRIP #FlowersForHana https://t.co/okKS2dHdT5

I am so worrying about the way news present about #HanaKimura because suicide articles sometimes push people to commit suicide. Sometimes it is too convincing to think “hey, suicide a good option” for those people with problems. We really have to deal with the news carefully
You just gotta love the fakeness of normies on twitter where they express anger over CyberBullying which supposedly caused the death of #HanaKimura while then cyberbullying #DojaCat over dindu nuffin #millennialHypocrisy
#poll last week, we lost another person to #CyberBullying. #HanaKimura took her own live and left a suicide note. are there enough measures to prevent it? should online forum/social media sites be better regulated? thoughts?
Another life has been lost to #CyberBullying. 22-year-old Japanese female professional wrestler #HanaKimura succumbed to online bullying. Her death has sparked a public outcry of anger against cyber-bullying. @RealMickFoley &amp; @hatoyamayukio paid condolences at her death. https://t.co/ue76EOSbq8

I've had my criticisms of wrestlers which were unfounded &amp;, recently, revealed that they share the same struggles their fans do. Namely trying to maintain good mental health in the face of a cold world. A revelation that has made me see things differently. 3/#HanaKimura
@AlexaBliss_WWE I honestly thought that the wrestling community was going to try and be better for atleast a few weeks following the passing of #HanaKimura, but unfortunately when something bad happens nobody seems to learn. If you are currently in a position of sadness there is help out there.

@RealPaigeWWE @AlexaBliss_WWE In light of what happened with #HanaKimura, his comments aren't just in poor taste but defamatory to the point where @AlexaBliss_WWE wouldn't just bankrupt him but she could go Uncle Phil on his ass &amp; wrap him up in so much litigation his grandchildren would need lawyers

New character, Honoka! She's an athlete, interested in various sports but I kinda think about letting her try out wrestling, wearing this cute costume already. Maybe as a hommage to wonderful #HanaKimura who has sadly passed away on May 23 ... need to think about that. https://t.co/5nJMSdteD8
@AlexaBliss_WWE 1) This is why I hate the term “social media.” Anyone with a platform can run their mouth but THEY’RE NOT MEDIA! The term just facilitates this. 2) This guy, the people who pushed #HanaKimura to do what she did, and people like them all need to punched in the face several times.
I don't know if I have the right to say this since I never saw #HanaKimura perform, but I know a lot about bullying. The more I think about it the more I come to the conclusion that the people who cyber bullied her should be tracked down and charged with some form of murder

What really happened to Hana Kimura on Terrace house? #hanakimura #RIPHanaKimura #TERRACEHOUSETOKYO #TERRACEHOUSE #Hanakimurawrestler. https://t.co/ALavDzzbHc
Watching the japanese tv coverage of #HanaKimura'a death, the commentators/pundits tone of voice when they say "the BBC are saying she was harassed and bullied" really pisses me off. I half expect them to follow it with "But Japanese people don't do that!" Ignorant cunts.
How the fuck can someone justify victim blaming? Hana was a victim. You can’t say well she did this or she should have gotten off Twitter. Fuck you, she isn’t at fault for how shitty people are. Never blame a suicide victim. #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura
22 years too young I cant believe this story, She gone #HanaKimura

@sizzlinsalhoff @WWEHOFerSunny 1) I doubt she cares what you think. 2) You would think after the suicide of #HanaKimura that so called wrestling fans would be just a little kinder to those who contributed to the industry and just to people generally, why don't you try it. It costs nothing to be kind.

i know many still mourn #HanaKimura &amp; i think the best way to Honor her is by celebrating her life, being positive &amp; good to one another. because thats who she is a kind gentle soul. i don't think she'd want us sad. So for her sake &amp; her families, i will smile for hana
(...) THIS IS WHY cancel culture should be canceled! her passing really hits hard. i’ve been really sensitive about suicide in general especially after the death or Chester Bennington in 2017. may you rest easy #HanaKimura 😭😭 🙌💔
i’ve heard of Japanese pro wrestler #HanaKimura this morning when her death by suicide was announced. even for someone i’ve just heard of for the first time in my life, my heart bleeds for her and her loved ones. cyber bullying is NEVER acceptable (...)

what happened to #HanaKimura is heartbreaking, but let's not overlook that producers have a part in this as well. shows like @TerraceHouseCap, @BachelorABC, and @LoveisBlindShow make MILLIONS from these feuds. these are real people, and they need help long before the show airs.

Another young talent gone, she may had been another WWE or NJPW star, but internet bullyers with their hurtful words forced her to took her own life... it is so sad and I am so angry about it... #HanaKimura #StopBullying https://t.co/6U7iZIIKaJ
How can people be so mean? Whisking death to someone or being happy for someone taking his life? #HanaKimura there are such horrible people in this world. Please stop spreading hate.
Please celebrate Hana. Remember the way she lived. Share stories about the joy and smiles and laughter she brought all of us. #HanaKimura https://t.co/0iqJwhKovb

Words can hurt, devastate and in this case(as many others) it drove Hana to take her own life.Bullying in ANY form is NEVER ok &amp; cyber bullying is an extremely cowardly form of it! She seemed like such a sweet soul. I don’t understand peoples horrible behaviors😔R.I.P #HanaKimura https://t.co/DGDEFmeAQh
I've heard what happened to #HanaKimura and what cyber bullying pushed her to do. I saw the clip on Terrace House that started all of this, the reason she was cyberbullied is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. She's be terrorised because she smacked a dude's hat off? 1/
I'm heartbroken, no one should be bullied or harassed to the point they feel like they're no longer worth anything. She was such a strong inspiring young woman. I hope you're in a better place now #HanaKimura
Rest In Peace, Hana Kimura 😔 I wish someone could have reached out and given you a big hug, and said you will be fine. But for some reason, it just never seems to happen here... #HanaKimura #RestInPeace https://t.co/yP2kbvHtwr

#suicide of #HanaKimura is also responsible for Twitter’s administration. They should close attackers’ accounts and disclose attackers’ info to victims.
@AllEliteTiffany With everything that’s happened after the tragic death of #HanaKimura are people going to learn, BE NICE! @tonyschiavone24 said it best last night! Wrestling is scripted. But it’s also a community, a family and a way of life!! Don’t let anyone tell you how to be an adult!!

You cannot compare Dominic Cummings to Caroline Flack. He broke lockdown rules and we are holding him to account. If anyone should be mentioned in the same breath as Caroline this weekend, it's Japanese wrestler #HanaKimura. https://t.co/s1UWsvGFtj
@wcruz73 Just yesterday with the passing of #HanaKimura, I thought there should be a common # to use to highlight individuals for the greatness of being themselves. Family, friends... anyone you'd like to tell the world #whythematter. Sad to learn of great persons only upon their deaths.

Kindness is a choice, people often say negative comments for multiple reasons, most of which are non-justifiable so please just choose kindness above all, the world has enough negativity #HanaKimura
I don't know @AllEliteTiffany in real life, but scumbags like this are the reason the tragedy that befell #HanaKimura happened. So what if she's excited that her favorite, whom she has seen in person multiple times mind you, won the TNT championship? Let her be her! https://t.co/mSq7ZUNyTS

@PJPOLACO @FSqueazy You've only been doing that for what.. like 30 years? Your opinion is perfectly legit there's no right or wrong in this case I just want people to be civil on Twitter for god's sake. I'll always think about #HanaKimura before sending nasty shit and think better of it
#HanaKimura is the 2nd story this week of a celebrity being the victim of #cyberbullying. The first was #RubyRose &amp; now, similar actions are the suspected reason why this woman committed suicide. #WeCanDoBetterWeMUSTDoBetter! https://t.co/BRbagfrEiT
Stop thinking that words are harmless. Words can scar for life, especially on social media! I never do RIP but RIP #HanaKimura you didn't deserve that. Sorry you felt suicide was your only option. I'm sorry that human beings suck.
because of her mixed ethnicity. And now our writer claims they have all been deleted and nobody is addressing the racism issue because of the systematic racism in Japan. She's politicized #HanaKimura 's death with all assumption and no evidence. And it makes me mad.

#HanaKimura It's on you @netflix , it's on you. You do Nothing to protect those people. They are kids, you have to support them. I hope you will be sued. I hope you will make public apology. I hope you will do better. You are just lazy and a kid die.
During lockdown I got into the Japanese TV show Terrace House. While the calls for the stop of cyber bullying are fair and valid, the show’s commentators need to stop their bullying of the cast. They give basically a free pass for online mobbing. #HanaKimura
Another woman literally bullied to death. Leave women alone! RIP #HanaKimura 😢💔💔💔 Loved her on Terrace House, she was my favourite. Can't believe this has happened.
@sammandigee This is utterly sad and needless, fans or not #Cyberbullying is Not OK! RIP #HanaKimura #TerraceHouse this is a result of the lack of human decency.

Is it really that hard to not be miserable and redirect that personal misery onto others? Everyone has issues but that doesn’t give you the right to bully and be hurtful to others. As great as social media can be this is one of the many things wrong with it, sad. RIP #HanaKimura

I'm very sorry about the loss of #HanaKimura This is painful news
Rest in peace, #HanaKimura 🌺 All #CyberBullying is wrong, but women are more often the targets. Last year we also saw two women in K-pop, Sulli and Goo Hara, commit suicide because of it. Women are human, not objects. 💔 #cyberbullyingkills #sexnotgender https://t.co/fooWLwBLlD
I’m not a crazy supporter of feminism, but I respect how tough women of all ages really are. It struck me when I knew that a young lady (22 yrs old) committed suicide because she got bullied. Stop judging people, say something nice or shut up period #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura
The world has lost such a beautiful soul in a very cruel way. If only time could be turned back and you could have been saved. I'm sure you will be in the minds of thousands of people for a very long time to come. Rest in peace Hana Kimura xx #HanaKimura #RipHanaKimura
Stop and think about what your doing #HanaKimura took her own life because of these people like I said idk who they are and I'm not into wrestling but it's terrible to hear about this shit for the people who talked shit to her think about that you had a hand in making someone
Cancel culture has ruined people's lives and some took their like stop #jojiisamazingparty #HanaKimura I know who one of these people are joji and I recently heard about hana people just fucking stop
Could we save her? Want I can/will do is just being kind to other. Which is called common sense. Those who insulted her are going to face consequences.💩 RIP #HanaKimura

Online bullying is never okay. No matter how offended you are, you can't justify your stance when it results to another person's suicide. Hana Kimura didn't deserve such treatment. No one deserves such treatment. No one! May you rest in peace Miss Kimura. #HanaKimura
Most of you guys have no idea how much damage bullying can inflect until you go through that situation, it can kill you from the inside, it can ruin your life, it can simply drive you to the point where you commit suicide, it’s so tough and cruel! #RIPHanaKimura #HanaKimura https://t.co/7WEcUldgzy

#HanaKimura's death could have been prevented. Until we end the stigma and discrimination of mental health illnesses and disorders, we will continue to lose young people to suicide. Bullying and cyber-bullying needs to be taken seriously, and those that bully should be in jail.

Racism and cyberbullying has to STOP (worse when combined together). Look up #HanaKimura and her death. This is why reporting social media trolls is really important, and getting them banned and deplatformed from sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and more.
Unless I'm mistaken this was the only time I saw #HanaKimura compete. Check it out 👍 https://t.co/57OjfDE5Zk https://t.co/EXcLgyl6Ww

Se que Kai se ganó muchos fans porque es tierno, simpático y para muchos #HanaKimura se vio mal, pero no merecía ser atacada así, ni ser tratada así y que rabia, tristeza que hoy esté muerta 💀😭 https://t.co/INA3Nueckk

Eu fiquei mto abalada com a morte da hana☹ #HanaKimura
I am sorry to say this, but nothing is going to happen to any cyber bullies. Doesn't matter if its #HanaKimura bullies or anyone else. Take if from someone who has received actual death threats online. As the world goes online more, so does its freedom of speech. RIP Hana. https://t.co/SXpQ80klp7

Genuinely heartbroken upon learning of #HanaKimura passing. She had the brightest smile that brightened even the darkest of rooms. She worked so incredibly hard to get to where she was. Only 22 years old. All taken away by fucking cyberbullies. This can't happen anymore. It cant

@Shadbeast died a hero, @hanadayo0903 died due to villains. #ShadGaspard death was uncontrollable, but #HanaKimura death shouldn't have happened... Dark week in wrestling...
So sorry that #HanaKimura had to deal with the hateful words from the #IWC.
I cannot believe that #HanaKimura died so that the wrestling community trolls can make comments like @AEWrestling put the title on a "real woman" tonight. #FuckBullying #RIPHanaKimura #DoubleOrNothing

I’m the antidote to cyber bullying. I spread love to people I’m not even certain are people because there’s too much toxicity everywhere else. Don’t let another #HanaKimura situation happen again. One time is too much. #RIPHanaKimura
After today, After all the bullies still disrespecting #HanaKimura After making efforts to take down YouTube videos, tweets, I’m taking a break from social media. I’m in the mindset that I really want to do something bad to these people. #RIPHanaKimura
You didn’t deserve this.💔 Rest in love, Hana. #HanaKimura
She was 22 years old and cyber-bullied to death. Be gentle with your words. #HanaKimura

Cyberbullying is never ok. I hope you are all happy for what all the haters have said to her to make her do this. You are nothing but sick pathetic scumbags who have no respect for anyone. #HanaKimura you will be missed https://t.co/iM9LHkpg76
Hana Kimura’s passing is something that could of been avoided if some people weren’t such assholes. Words can hurt! Be nice to people for fuck sake! R.I.P Hana. #HanaKimura https://t.co/TuVheBJQlL
A pro-wrestler with a bright future ahead of her, #hanakimura was a ray of sunshine on #TERRACEHOUSE and I was so looking forward to seeing how things worked out for her. She didn't deserve this. Nobody does. She was only 22. 😢 RIP #StopCyberBullying https://t.co/ecXxUfGrID

#HanaKimura I know these words may never reach you, but i’m hoping wherever you are that you are at peace. I wish this wasn’t the answer, but just know that you’re loved. Thank you for being strong and may you rest in paradise. 🖤
#TERRACEHOUSE #HANAKIMURA But hopefully this is also a lesson that even though this is the tv show, and the goal is to make comments, i really hope that the commentators can be a little less harsh. It’s so hard to see the participants cry when hearing what they say about them.
#RIP #HanaKimura This is heartbreaking, I can’t begin to know the place she was in, but I know what it’s like to be so in your head that you’re angry at everything. This is a lesson to spread love and not hate on the internet and in life. Even when evil tempts you, be kind. Rip
#HanaKimura had mental health issues. She was bullied on social media. She committed suicide. We all have an opinion. Try to be as nice as possible even when you disagree with someone on here. If you need help talk to someone, anyone. https://t.co/uXPPSZtSzT https://t.co/0U6iQpStJB

It's sad when you're life ends at any age due to the sick fucks out here on social media pushing people to the point of taking their lives. I've seen a few of #HanaKimura's matches and she looked to have a great path in front of her. #EndCyberBullying

I wish people were more mindful of the fact that their words &amp; actions have considerable effects on people. Let's all try to do better in uplifting each other. The world would be much better. #HanaKimura was a talented woman that didn't deserve this fate. #RIPHanaKimura
So... are the wrestling fans going to give some respect to Nyla Rose and other wrestlers after today's tragic death of #HanaKimura or nah? #StopBeingFakeWrestlingFans
I personally didn't know her but I hope in heaven she is doing better. Bully should be punishable. Alot of people have been lost due to bully. #StopBullying. #HanaKimura rest in peace. Wrestling fans true Wrestling fans will miss you. You are in our prayers.
#HanaKimura Cyber Bullying needs to stop, killin yourself doesn't mean you out smarted the bully either, the bully got to you no peace for cowards, bullies are cowards and the ones that kills themselves are cowards
2 beautiful souls were lost, both far too soon. @Shadbeast was the epitome of what a father should be. #HanaKimura was a few years younger than me. Social media is an incredibly power tool, as such it requires the appropriate responsability of its users. https://t.co/yRnbwZF70p
#HanaKimura https://t.co/fYaxpaMZll
@mothfromdaflats @AEWrestling I always thought #HanaKimura could've been the future of wrestling she had alot of potential 2 be the greatest
That simple AEW #HanaKimura tribute broke me. My eyes hurt. Please be better to each other. Try a little more kindness. It saves lives.
Una stella del wrestling è volata via in cielo a soli ventidue anni. Ed a causa di cosa? Del dannato cyberbullismo che subiva ogni singolo giorno. Complimenti, oltre ad averla uccisa psicologicamente, le avete anche dato modo di togliersi la vita. VERGOGNATEVI. #HanaKimura
I learned about a female wrestler #HanaKimura who took her own life because she was bullied. That hurts me inside. I've been there many times in the past and at my weakest moments I was treated like garbage instead of with love and caring @AEWrestling #SickNotWeak #MentalHealth

#HanaKimura I’m not a Christian. But every Christian I know has said “God created us in his image.” Would your God bully someone because they were upset that someone ruined something they needed? Hana was my age. She had her whole life ahead of her. Don’t bully people. RIP
#HanaKimura, the #Japanese pro wrestler who starred in #Netflix's“#TerraceHouse," has died at the age of 22. The cause of Kimura's death was not confirmed, but she had posted messages on social media implying she had been bullied online. https://t.co/zC1YQU62wg https://t.co/rsy4okN8GV
I didn’t know her not watch any of her matches but may Hana Kimura Rest In Peace. 🙏🏽 Whether through the internet or in person bullying is never acceptable. We’re all human and have flaws. My Condolences to Kimura’s family and friends. #HanaKimura ❤️
She should be honor. Bless her with all the respect she need. We will remember her as a champion Hana Kimura.😥💔🙏 #HanaKimura https://t.co/pO3hZF35xQ

Just learned about #HanaKimura's death. Really, really blown away. She was 22 and a great professional wrestler. And cyberbullying drove her to her death. Fucking heartbreaking.

I’m so sad to hear of the sudden and unexpected death of Hana Kimura of Terrace House, one of my favourite shows. RIP to a sweet and lovely young lady. My heart is broken for her family and friends and fans. #HanaKimura
I had no idea who #HanaKimura was until today. My heart breaks for her and her family. I know all too well the impact of bullying. Bullying is why I have to deal with trauma from my past. There’s no need of it, especially in these times. Be kind or kindly fuck off.
A real tragedy!!!! She was a fave of mine on the show and a total bad ass! 💗💗💗😭😭😭 #terracehouse #HanaKimura #RIP https://t.co/GGlIwOR0SM

@piko3purej RIP #HanaKimura
I never understood how some fandom is more toxic than others. I guess Wrestling Otaku are the most toxic people. #HanaKimura must be a harsh lesson for all of us fans. No young person should EVER be treated that harshly. Words ALWAYS hurt. Try and remember that youngins.
#HanaKimura 🙏🏽😔 MALDITO CYBERBULLYING!!!!
#hanakimura Era para eu ser só uma dqlas plantas no Twitter, mas recebi essa notícia, e nn teve como eu nn falar. Hana era uma pessoa prfta, só q a mesma nn percebia isso. Isso é mais um efeito do bullying, e o q ele faz, mexendo com pessoas incríveis. Nunca esquecerei de ti. https://t.co/XLueezVkTg
My heart breaks. RIP #HanaKimura https://t.co/nYfT0sRRvs
I found this online, I am one of those survivors and stand behind this completely. #HanaKimura https://t.co/5f7Y6wMIag
It's sad that Hana Kimura lost her life because TOXIC, IGNORANT trolls have nothing better to do. Prayers goes to her friends and family. Wrestlers are human too, but some people tend to forget that. Social media can be fun at times, but also can be plain toxic too. #HanaKimura
A big FUCK YOU goes out to all these idiots , who think its funny to bully someone. You took a life with mere words, and I hate to say this , but you will get what you deserve. Not today , not tomorrow, but you will. Shame on you all. Hana, I miss you. Rest in love. #HanaKimura https://t.co/pgJwWTkgu3

So many thoughts come to mind about #HanaKimura. I can’t lie and tell you that I knew of her or was familiar with her work. All that happened that led to her passing is incredibly frustrating. 22 years old is just way too young to leave this world.
This makes me very sad. Rest in peace Hana Kimura. You were a shining star. 😢❤ #TERRACEHOUSE #HanaKimura https://t.co/7h9GFX3Bmh
For those of you who can’t read Japanese, here’s videos and uncensored faces of Japanese people who are openly celebrating Hana’s death. Luckily Japanese people are unhappy with them and openly calling them trash and disgraces to Japan. #RIPHanaKimura #HanaKimura https://t.co/8P6wxvwo1z
@kezandunicorns @leogohtw @RFelixFinch There is a huge difference between not agreeing with someone and their views, and being an outright cunt and making personal with personal attacks. These people who pushed #HanaKimura to suicide over a fellow reality contestant shrinking her wrestle kingdom outfit are horrid
This kind of being asshole on Twitter has got to stop now! Thoughts and prayers to #HanaKimura and her family. #RIPHanaKimura

After #HanaKimura I’m just not in a wrestling mood today. I’m sure I’ll see spoilers and what not for #DoubleOrNothing #AEW have fun tonight people. Or at least try to.
#HanaKimura My prayers go out to her dear parents. Her death is a loss to so many of us that loved her. I hope some justice is done in Japan. At least make public those horrible cowards that drove her to her death. She was so talented and full of life. This can’t even be real.
What sucks about the internet is that we have people whom are so self-righteous that they don’t really consider the consequences of what they say and do. #HanaKimura is one of those stories of cancel culture, ruining livelihoods. This toxicity needs to stop.
@RealPaigeWWE Please reach out to #asuka10272140, she tag team with #HanaKimura. It's a tragedy you didn't get to meet Hana, she had a great personality, and was a great and talented wrestler. R.I.P Hana. Be strong 💪 VENY/Asuka
Gone way too Soon... A great wrestler and a great human being. #HanaKimura was an amazing person. Bullying is no joke. Please, be kind and respectful to one another. As cliche as it is. If you don't have anything nice to say, than don't say it at all. #RIPHanaKimura https://t.co/10BWzDYqzM

@Corriere perdonami due appunti. Fare il wrestler è un lavoro vero, non merita le virgolette. E in Terrace House non esiste evil cut, anzi, #HanaKimura era un personaggio molto positivo e divertente, che sì, durante una lite ha dato il peggio.

Last summer I bought some DLC for a wrestling game that added a female federation from Japan. I didn't know the roster and picked the lady in colourful clothes with pink hair. Since then that lady and her Stardom family have reignited my love for wrestling. Thank you #HanaKimura https://t.co/lWmdNqGXk5

She was just 22 &amp; had a whole life ahead of her. It is so disheartening to hear demise of #HanaKimura due to cyberbullying. You heard it right, your hate words can have a stronger influence than you think! Spread love, not hatred, nobody is perfect! Gone too soon! #RIPHanaKimura

Rest in peace #HanaKimura I never knew who she is, but it angers me to be reminded of cyberbullying. She's only 22 years old and these people pushed her to the point where she has no hope. My heart goes out to her family, friends, and her cat. I've heard she is kind hearted.
The answer isn't blocking/ignoring. It isn't going to go away by calling them out and reporting it to anyone. Cyber bullying is done because they need to know they can affect your life. Either for power or obsession. Stop giving those people that power over you. #hanakimura
Stop Bullying. Please. #hanakimura Rest in love. https://t.co/rmncIBFlGo
The internet can be a very cruel place, largely undeserved. Online bullying is a serious problem and it's a shame tragedies like this are the only thing that bring it to light. Only 22 and insanely talented with her whole life ahead of her. Rest in power #HanaKimura! 😔

Rest in Peace #HanaKimura. People... Harassment can kill a person.
To tell your family and friends how much you care about them &amp; how much you love them not just today but all the time. Because you never know whether they’ll be there today or tomorrow. Sending my condolences &amp; prayers to the kimura family may Hana R.I.P 🙏🏽❤️ #HanaKimura
Keyboard warriors, those who hide behind fake profiles and bully, harass and literally take the lives of people for their own sick personal enjoyment, are the lowest form of scum on earth. Just 22 years old Rest in peace, 💐 #HanaKimura @we_are_stardom https://t.co/l6RLvX7Gl8

Couldn’t agree more. 2020 sucks. RIP #HanaKimura https://t.co/JOhzOoVbib
#HanaKimura I'm so sorry that a bunch of assholes made you feel less worthy. My heart breaks for your family. There’s no reason to ever make someone want to take their own life. Words matter.
از شنیدن این نوع خبرا خیلی خالم گرفته میشه. هانا کیمورا کشتی کج کار ژاپنی به خاطر آزار و اذیت مجازی بعد از گذاشتن یه پیام به زندگی خودش خاتمه داد. کاش همیشه درنظر داشته باشیم اثر حرفامون واقعی و جدی هست و میتونه عواقب بدی داشته باشه. باهم خوب باشیم... یادش گرامی #HanaKimura https://t.co/murHkXUH6A

The death of #HanaKimura is pretty sobering. For those of us that choose to put our lives on display for the entertainment of others, receiving hurtful words is part of the gig. But you must remember that we are still human beings and we still hurt. RIP baby girl.
Fuck people who think it's okay to harass PEOPLE online... #HanaKimura.. https://t.co/1ekK5RpCLh
#HanaKimura 3/3 last tip..... there isn’t one long tweet short it is easy to shout out cyberbullying and the verge definition of it. twitter, farcebook, shouldnt be allow to police speech and my tips if you do not say anything you can’t hurt someone can YOU.
it’s so sad that people feel empowered to come onto social media.. which is supposed to be a beacon for community and support, and instead turn it into a cesspool of toxicity and jealousy. Hana is gone way too soon and the sad part is, most wont change their ways. #HanaKimura RIP
A tribute from #WWE’s #Paige in honor of #HanaKimura calls online bullying ‘cruel' and ‘disgusting’ - https://t.co/dwNxjZEk6t https://t.co/4UPtlnlKLv
You will be missed by many, many people from around the world. Heartbreaking loss. #RIP #HanaKimura
I'm not familiar with Japanese wrestling at all, but the fact that #HanaKimura took her own life at age 22 due to cyber-bullying is HEARTBREAKING. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, &amp; it should NEVER be considered. Sadly, my mind has gone there more than once
#HanaKimura 2/3 2. if criticism is considered a attack a troll, and not the bloody obvious of name calling again you run the risk of being censorship and being a bully because you didnt agree with them. so tip number two just nod and walk away.
Big terrace house fan.. loved the series so far. So sad about this news 😭😭 RIP #HanaKimura

Somehow personally being affected by news of #HanaKimura &amp; acknowledge how severe her suffering was for something like this to happen
This world is becoming something far worse then expected, first the sad passing of #ShadGaspard and now finding out about #HanaKimura and what brought it upon her, this world sickens me, pro wrestlers are human beings treat them with respect (Hana) #RIPHanaKimura #RIPShadGaspard
#HanaKimura 2/4 1. cyperbully is a thing so they say so tip number one in fear of hurting easy sensitive leftists the easy of advice is do not speak. criticism can be seen as a attack That why censorship comes in.

rest in paradise #HanaKimura 🥺✨
@RealPaigeWWE 1st foremost you’re human also ! I didn’t know #HanaKimura but I m sad and angry for what happened
Tragically, we don’t always think about the effect our words on social media have on the human beings reading them. We can all honor #HanaKimura by remembering that our words have real consequences. Stop the hate &amp; cruelty. Nothing good comes of it. God bless Hana &amp; her family🙏
#HanaKimura addio incantevole anima che aveva un futuro meraviglioso e pieni di successi davanti spezzato da persone che non meritano di essere considerate tali.

Un pensiero a te. #HanaKimura. Ti ho seguita e stimata tantissimo, ti meritavi di più. Spero che prendano coscienza dello schifo di esistenza a cui sono costrette le persone che fanno cyberbullismo. Spero che si lotterà di più per riuscire a punire severamente chi lo causa.
@baguettedeux Your “spill" is much needed. She achieved more in 22 years than most of us will achieve in 90. No matter what anyone says, she was not weak. #HanaKimura

The death of #HanaKimura shows the need for change on social media especially @Twitter. The cyber bullying needs to stop. She was needlessly attacked over something on a reality show. She didn't deserve it. A bright future that was cut short. Rest easy. #RIP #RestinPeace
On a day the wrestling community should be remembering and mourning Owen Hart, we are now mourning #ShadGaspard and #HanaKimura too This week sucks so much 💔
I don’t often speak about my enjoyment of wrestling, but it’s been a hard week for the squared circle. 2 great wrestlers were lost this week in tragic ways. #ShadGaspard and #HanaKimura will always be remembered for their work. Let’s all be better in light of their passing.

I watched Terrace House and I liked Hana as she was an honest, cute and strong girl. The last available episode on Netflix showed how she confessed to Kai, and I was so happy for her.

@AmbassadorAew @AEWrestling She achieved nearly the impossible in such a short life. If you believe this happened because she was raised to be weak, then you don't understand mental illness. I'd wager she was “tougher" than any of us on our best day. #HanaKimura

Twitter did not kill #HanaKimura. It was a means no different than a gun, car, or knife. Hana died because people chose to be cruel and inflict pain on a stranger they assumed they knew because she was famous. People cause death not objects or social media. Choose to be kind.
#HanaKimura suicide illustrate the dangers of unrelenting #CyberBullying that occurs. The anonymity that allows for those w courage only behind the keyboard to hurt others reminds us that we should rethink social media &amp; actually become better at interacting w people for real..
My heart aches for hana 😭😭😭 #HanaKimura she was too young, we have to do better.
My heart is heavy, she was only 22, had her whole life ahead of her, and she ended her life, all because of cyber bullying 😞. She didn't deserve to be treated that way, nobody does. You will be missed Hana! ❤ #HanaKimura https://t.co/lssGmEhGsx

There aren't really appropriate words for the loss of a stranger. However, when the stranger affects the lives of others in such a positive way, I think it's ok to use the words that you can. The loss of #HanaKimura will reverberate through the whole wrestling community.
Thank you, Hana. Rest well, Warrior. #HanaKimura #RIP #Wrestling https://t.co/myYZ2BZk5v

Не успело мировое рестлинг-сообщество переварить трагическую смерть Шэда Гаспарда (пожертвовал собой, спасая сына), как сегодня стало известно, что небезызвестная Хана Кимура покончила с собой (затравили в интернете). Очень-очень жуткий год... #ShadGaspard #HanaKimura

Damn. RIP #HanaKimura . Thank you for all the energy and love you brought us.
I had never heard of Hana Kimura -- but, the news of her death is troubling. Some reports are pointing toward online bullying as a reason. If you fear you would rather die than be alive, talk to someone. Reach out. Get help. Also, social media is not real life. #HanaKimura
#HanaKimura is dead. She posted that she didn't want to be human anymore. I loved her on #TERRACEHOUSE. I am so sad. Hana, I'm so sorry you had to die. I wish I could've protected you from the #cyberbullies. Fuck you, guys. Be nice for God's sakes. You killed her. https://t.co/qWEQufpPwW

Im sorry but online bullying will never stop. If you are suffering, distance yourself from social media and talk to someone face 2 face or call a professional. SM can be fun yes but also very dangerous. I dnt know #HanaKimura but im still sad of what happened. #RIPHanaKimura https://t.co/BR326bcTtO
RIP to the beautiful #HanaKimura, and love to her family. And to every single bullies on the planet, go hang yourself. Motherfuckers.

I didn't realize this would shake me up as much as it has. But damn, I am an emotional wreck right now. Hold others accountable for their words. Please. #HanaKimura is not the first person to be dead because of bullying, and she won't be the last unless we all do better.

I didn’t know much about #HanaKimura but I know that she should still be alive. If you took part in this, I hope you have a long life full of bad days.
The suicide of #HanaKimura hit especially hard since it was around a year ago I left the mental hospital after severe suicidal thoughts. It's saddening to remember how I felt the weeks prior and how she must've felt something even worse.

I have DMs open so ppl and media can contact us. I've enabled filters and turned off mail notices b/c the hate and death threats were getting to me. And I'm a man. It's 10x worse for women and POC. This isn't okay. #hanakimura #誹謗中傷
She was just trying to find love on Terrace House. Why do people even cyber bully?? She was 22... RIP #hanakimura https://t.co/8bWqXuCWsS
So the aholes that bullied Hana Kimura have deleted their social media. That's what cowards do. They talk shit online and then run. May God have mercy on your souls whoever you are. #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura
Literally every time a Terrace House member mentions the fans, it's about how much harassment they're receiving from them. This has been the obvious outcome for ages. If it wasn't #HanaKimura it was going to be another one. But I really wish it wasn't Hana.

And yes, I think we can all (def myself included) think more deeply about how we talk to each other online. The people who attack others, spew racism, hurl death threats etc, need to stop. But in the end, they're still people, albeit deeply damaged ones. #HanaKimura

RIP #HanaKimura 💔 It breaks my heart to see another young soul lose their life to suicide. The world has become so demanding/pressuring. We've become so critical for perfection in ourselves and others. Its time we remember to give ourselves and others a break.
I hope this tragedy makes us all rethink how we treat each other, in person and online. There is never any reason to be cruel to each other. Rest in peace, Hana. We'll always remember you. #HanaKimura
To everyone that that says ignore the trolls, this is true to an extent. Not everyone can though, Let's all come together and be awesome. To all of hana's fans she was an amazing wrestler and i bet an even better person RIP #HanaKimura

Seen what happened to #HanaKimura and frankly, none of this will change if we continue to accept and excuse shitty behavior in our society. Shitheads need to get exposed, embarrassed and shamed for trying to act like internet thugs online. #RIPHanaKimura

Bottomline, I may, for myself, stop watching reality TV shows from now on. Without us watching, may be there won't be shows like this for much longer. One can hope! I'm just not going to be part of "that" anymore. Will try. Will see. #InMemoriam #TerraceHouse #木村花 #HanaKimura

This youtuber who comments on wrestling said a house mate in her reality tv show shrunk her clothes, it turned into an argument and ever since then she's been getting a lot of hate mail and comments online. Must've been girls hating. 🙄 #HanaKimura https://t.co/cvlhWBG326

This fucking hurts. Be kind to people. As much as it can feel like wrestlers are larger than life and somehow more than human, they're still people. And just because someone smiles, doesn't mean they're okay. 1-800-273-8255 #RIPHanaKimura #SuicidePrevention #HanaKimura https://t.co/oG8hMOKbtZ
#HanaKimura and many more young people have committed suicide for so much hate received how is possible that in just days you can destroy something that her family built all her life, how words can destroy a heart it is so sad.

Sad to hear of the apparently suicide of #HanaKimura. Not sure that the current series of #TerraceHouse should/will carry on. Also casts a light on how much help, if any, the contestants get with the inevitable social media scrutiny (and abuse).

Really sad about #HanaKimura's passing. Online harassment is responsible for it. At times it is even adults who partake in such ridiculous bullying. We see that often enough in the Kurdish community regarding gender topics &amp; politics. That disgusting behavior needs to be stopped.

Didn’t really know #HanaKimura but wish she could have focused on the 80% positive tweets and less on the 20% negative. Can’t believe the minority of negativities drove her to cut herself to death. 😢

Lo de #HanaKimura me hace dudar lo que muchos dicen, "lo mejor que le puede pasar es quedarse en Japón" Estoy seguro que de haber pasado algo así en USA o UK quizá habría una red de apoyo más grande.
@carboncopybear @realsuyung @doranyanpa @kimurarock @RCWSpain Hi Teddy, you're a sweet person. I'm also here for people since I totally understand. It is so overwhelming especially right now to have to deal with all that's happening and being bullied. It's a shame people are so cruel. 💔 RIP #HanaKimura A Beautiful soul.
it saddens me to hear the passing of #HanaKimura. even though i did not know truly who she was, it sickens me that we lost a beautiful soul because of venomous negativity online. she was 22. i am 21 years old, a year younger, that’s not okay. be kind they are real people too!
.In the span of a few days Professional Wrestling has lost #HanaKimura &amp; #ShadGaspard Life is but the blink of an eye. Fragile, Beautiful, Finite. Every person has a life story to tell all you have to do is be willing to listen &amp; when needed #BeTheLight they might need
#HanaKimura Inaceptable la cultura del odio, los comentarios destructivos y maliciosos en contra de una talentosa joven. La indiferencia a la degradación humana debe terminar. https://t.co/lGBSraFy6L

How many people is it going to take before you realize that your words hurt? It doesn’t matter if you know who #HanaKimura was, I didn’t know until just a few minutes ago, the point is that pushing someone that far is horrible.
That Hana Kimura news is so upsetting. The internet is truly is a vile, disgusting place. #HanaKimura RIP
I obviously never met #HanaKimura but I had seen enough of her work to be a fan. She was only 22, man. A kid. Somebody’s little girl. I can’t imagine my daughters being in that much pain. Rest In Peace, Hana.
RIP #HanaKimura 🙏🏻

I'd not heard of #HanaKimura until now. What a beautiful woman. How horrible she's lost to this world so young and because people can be so cruel. I wonder if they feel proud of themselves now. You who bully know you're wrong. Don't follow those who incite. #RIPHanaKimura
I really cannot make much sense of how ugly the world is sometimes. I cannot say anything to do that very talented and decorated young woman any justice, and personally, due to my own history, this feels too heavy, too close. #HanaKimura
I didn't watch #TERRACEHOUSETOKYO but I feel really sorry that one more person passed away. I just wish God receive her with all Love He has #HanaKimura the newest star in the sky 🌟
Cyber bullying needs to stop. Understand that everyone you interact with online is a real person with real feelings. Don’t try to drag people down in an attempt to make yourself feel better. It just makes you the worst type of person. Be better. Love each other. RIP #HanaKimura https://t.co/zkCx5NBEPM

I'll never allow any of you to make me feel so low on myself that I would even consider ending it all. My heart breaks for the friends/family of #HanaKimura. Many of you are downright disgusting and deserve EVERY awful thing that happens to you. I pray you get yours.
I wasn’t cyber bullied but I was def. abused by someone online in a way that made me feel like taking my own life when they treated me like I didn’t exist and they scammed me of money knowing that I had depression and was very alone. Abuse online is not cool #HanaKimura
Mental issues. Let’s talk about it. If SM criticism (or worse) is too much to take, learn from Mauro or @joerogan. Don’t read the comments, get off the platform, or don’t get on to begin with. Simple. Effective. RIP #HanaKimura
She was just 22. Might have had a great career if alive. #CyberBullying #HanaKimura https://t.co/boRws07mKu

I believe @netflix shouldn’t stream what’s left of Terrace House Tokyo 2019 because the exposure is in part what caused #HanaKimura death. I believe the program itself should rethink how they mock the participants behind their backs to the public manipulating the viewers.

Contro il cyberbullismo ci sono 3 soluzioni A) Commentare in modo ancora più infame rispetto a chi fa l'infame B) Fregarsene ed ignorare C) Non avere account social Non so chi sia #HanaKimura ma dispiace sapere che una ragazza di 20 anni si leva la vita per tutto questo

La lutteuse japonaise #HanaKimura que j’ai connue grâce à Terrace House s’est vraisemblablement suicidée suite à du cyber-harcèlement. J’ai plutôt tendance à avoir foi en l’humanité pourtant il faut s’avouer qu’il y a des humains qui ne sont en fait que des bêtes cruelles.

rip #HanaKimura 💙❤️😭 3rd September 1997- 23 May 2020. Bullying is never okay doesnt matter if its an actor or character or a person No one should be bullied to the point. Its sad that things like this must happen before it gets talked about openly when it should be talked about
#HanaKimura , who was a victim of cyber bullying, makes us realize how our just a petty opinion can make somebody else question their existence. In this world so vulnerable we are the only ones who can prevent our species from being wiped out of the face of earth. #RIPHanaKimura

Ho letto della morte di #HanaKimura del cast di @TH6TV su @NetflixIT sembra a causa del cyberbullismo... sono scioccato. La cosa brutta è che i gradassi sono andati di corsa a cancellare le frasi oscene, animali senza dignità, spero @Twitter abbia tutto in cache.
Woke up to the awful news about #HanaKimura. As someone who has been very open about my mental health struggles people don't realize how hard words can hurt. They hit as hard as a fist. Spread love not hate.
At only 22, this is so sad to hear. The wrestling world has lost a rising star. R.I.P. Hana Kimura #RIPHanaKimura #HanaKimura
#HanaKimura era a pessoa mais luz daquele reality. Meus sinceros sentimentos a toda a família e amigos.
Always been a fan of @we_are_stardom and though I never met you I always loved the way you elevated in that ring and your beautiful spirit as well.

The wrestling community isn't alone here - it's both amazing in times of strife or outside (undue) criticism, but also creates so much inward toxicity. It's ok to disagree with wrestlers and fellow fans over lots of things, but how #HanaKimura was treated was fandom at its worst.
Social Media really has become the downfall of society. It's a place where cowardly people talk shit that they wouldn't normally say to someone's face. It's also a place where a lot of irrelevant people think they have a relevant opinion on things. #RIPHanaKimura #HanaKimura

Humiliating &amp; bringing down people for their mistakes won't make them learn. The bullying got into her. We lost a beautiful soul. I feel so sad, so angry. She just went to Terrace House for a new chapter in her life. She didn't deserve this. Rest in peace, Angel. #HanaKimura

Yes cyberbullying is a serious threat, I hope that security regarding bullies cases should be better in the future. Is there a solution for the bullies until people lose their lives. #HanaKimura
This woman gets where I am coming from... That's why I don't follow people (like I used to). Shit like what happened to #HanaKimura Chan occurs.

A highly emotional week for wrestling fans. It starts with Shad drowning, RIP, Owen Hart's Dark Side Of The Ring episode and ends with #HanaKimura's sudden passing on Owen's anniversary! This is a very black week for wrestling. RIP to all.
22 and already a star. R.I.P. #HanaKimura gone much to soon.
I honestly don't know who #HanaKimura was but for someone so young to take their life cause some people have no concept of "if you have nothing nice to say then say nothing" is disgusting. If you didn't like her then keep that shit to yourself. #RIPHanaKimura
Seguo #TERRACEHOUSE da anni e lo adoro, ho seguito tutte le puntate con Hana e ho sempre tifato per lei, ora sono veramente sconvolta e con il cuore spezzato che una giovane ragazza si sia suicidata per colpa della cattiveria delle altre persone. L'umanità fa schifo #HanaKimura

Hey guys. The details on #HanaKimura are deeply triggering, so be careful about what headspace you’re in when you go to news articles about it.
You all think you’re so powerful behind a screen- and you were right. so powerful you ended a life. you have killed a young woman who was in the process of learning and growing just like the rest of us. RIP HanaKimura #HanaKimura https://t.co/NWVFQJ8Jik
I never heard of #HanaKimura before today, but the death of another human being due to suicide always crushes me. Fuck bullies. https://t.co/Ii6NldL5HK
The high death rate amongst professional wrestler's (from a number of causes professional and personal) is not regularly talked about outside of Wrestling circles and fandoms. It is a shame to learn that #HanaKimura died today at age 22. #木村花 https://t.co/zYRwY07e3w

If y’all don’t think cyber bullying is real and that it can’t have a profound impact on the one being bullied, then think again. RIP Hana #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura
I know nothing of #HanaKimura so I looked her up and saw these comments: https://t.co/XOvePiPxYY
Rest in Peace, #HanaKimura . I will really really miss you. I hope that other girls get to see you as the queen that you are. Hardworking. Determined. Fully motivated. Soft. Sweet. Loving. 😭 #RIPHanaKimura
Though it is not clear how and why #HanaKimura died, and whether it was due to cyberbullying by #TERRACEHOUSETOKYO viewers or not, let us take it as a reminder to be kinder to each other. To remember that words have effects on people. And every person's tolerance to hate differ.
I think that was the turning point for everything. The first and only time I saw #HanaKimura actually voicing out her negative feelings for anybody on #TERRACEHOUSETOKYO, and she was bashed for it. Reading the awful comments hurt even my feelings, i can't imagine how she felt.
On #TERRACEHOUSETOKYO I saw #HanaKimura grow in leaps and bounds, navigating her way to interact with boys and also other girls in a domestic environment. She was sweet, but can also be mean when she needs to, as evident when she told Kai off for being inconsiderate of others.
'Heartbroken' would be an understatement. I loved #HanaKimura from the first time I laid eyes on her. Despite her tough exterior, inside she was such a shy, pure and soft person. https://t.co/mMgux6rUTf
This is just devastating news. I had a brother in law, who like Hana, was 22 when he committed suicide. Both were sunny, happy, popular people as far as anyone knew. Please, if you have these thoughts, speak to someone and get help. #HanaKimura https://t.co/mlFyyuqkLe

R.I.P #HanaKimura, @hanadayo0903... you seem like a nice person, it's too bad I never knew you before you were gone... I hope we all learned our lesson, cyberbullying might not be a huge deal on the surface, but it can hurt someone deep inside
Genuinely crying. Need to write more later. There is a REASON I changed from All I Think to Hm Not My Cuppa MUCH LESS making sure someone saw it MUCH LESS when we are all so stressed oh baby girl &lt;/3 #HanaKimura

I hope that, if anything "good" can come of this, it's that the wrestling world - talent, management, and fans alike (myself included) - can look inward and make a concerted effort to be better. For such an enjoyable product, wrestling can sure be an ugly thing. #HanaKimura
I'll admit I'm not as knowledgeable as other @we_are_stardom fans, but I can say I am a big fan of #HanaKimura and will greatly miss seeing her perform R.I.P funky leader of TCS.
Rest In Peace Hana. Cyberbulling is horrendous. So sad. #HanaKimura
After reading the news of #HanaKimura, I feel numb even though I've not watched a single match of hers. She has brought nothing but joy and happiness to everybody by the tweets and vids I've seen from...

The death of #HanaKimura raises serious questions. Sports personalities and celebrities alike come on social media to allow us access to them, their lives, and to interact w/them But really why do people have to bully and be negative? #BeKind My thoughts too all who knew her.
Why does it take a pandemic, a horrific event of losing a father #RIPShadGaspard (who heroically saved his son) &amp; a poor young woman who was so bullied that she couldn't find peace here #HanaKimura RIP .To make us see how we should of been treating each other in the 1st place

My family watched #TERRACEHOUSETOKYO BC it was a distraction. Producers should have taken steps to protect #HanaKimura. They watch SM closely, they must've known she was bullied by xenophobes. @fujitv should have used the show to address this. @netflix https://t.co/qLtq3UfUkd
Understand that there’s a very real person with very real feelings reading the hurtful crap you write. #RIP #HanaKimura
I would hope yesterday’s tragedy with #HanaKimura would be an eye opener for someone like @TheJimCornette with what could happen with the use of bullying language online, but I doubt it.
The tragic news of @hanadayo0903's untimely death is deeply upsetting. We should all strive, especially in times like these, to be better people. The human condition is dangerously fragile, &amp; no one gains strength from exploiting that fact. #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura #EndBullying

@AEWrestling Don't say "just shut it off". What people say to you and about you can stay in your head and heart forever, and when it's cruel it keeps you awake nights. Rather than saying "be tough and take it" we need to say "stop being mean". RIParadise #HanaKimura 🌸

Just read where a 22 year old female wrestler named #HanaKimura committed suicide because she was being bullied on social media..when is enough enough?? Seriously wrestling is NOTHING compared to a human life, all those ppl who bullied her from behind your computer shame on you!!
#cyber #Bullying costs #HanaKimura she is #Japan 🤼‍♀️ wrestler. She lossed her temper with other participants in #TERRACEHOUS ( like #BigBoss in India)which is #Netflix show. Then she became victim of trollers. Think before troll . https://t.co/LWaoZjpIdJ
#HanaKimura je suis mais tellement choqué de la mort d'Hana j'ai énormément regardé des épisodes de TERRACE HOUSE une fille mais vraiment géniale et la je vous le dis mais très sincèrement je suis putain de choqué de sa mort et surtout de la cause de son décès 1/2 https://t.co/303YUyHQTJ
Taken way too young because of some inconsiderate, pathetic excuses of life... bullies! Do not be a bully, stay off the internet and learn to be respectful. Of course never knew her, but she sounds like a wonderful woman. Rest in Peace #HanaKimura The world loves you.
#HanaKimura dead according to @Forbes. https://t.co/ZlP7IVzD7u #Wrestling #CyberBullying #Stardom #RIPHanaKimura
RIP to the talented and beautiful Hana Kimura. :( extremely sad news. Please be kind. Words do more damage than people think. #HanaKimura #BeKind https://t.co/jFQ3oZn2E3
The passing of #HanaKimura is very tragic. A 22 year old prodigy out of Stardom. We not only as an industry but a civilization need to be better. This platform or any like it that allows you to communicate should be used to help not harm. We all deserve kindness.
She really was just as human as the rest of us and was working on bettering herself, it’s so sad that it’s come to this because of ppl being so disgusting :/ Rest peacefully #HanaKimura
#HanaKimura repose en paix... Faut combattre le harcèlement toute l'année pour éviter ce genre de drame 😢

22 is way to young 😢. There are no words. I'm so sorry to hear about this even though I didn't know her. My love goes out to her family and friends and anyone who knew her. Spread love not hate ❤️!!! #RIPHanaKimura #HanaKimura
Just read about #HanaKimura passing. So unbelievably sad, and senseless. 22 years young and she was literally bullied to death. Wake up people, this has to stop. #RIPHanaKimura #StopCyberBullying
Not too familiar with #HanaKimura but no one should be made to feel like she did for her to take her own life. The low lives that caused this need locking up and people need to take care of what they say. Its real life and easier to spread love rather than hate. #RIPHanaKimura

How do people know #HanaKimura was bullied online to the point of suicide? Hopefully those responsible are held accountable. #RIPHanaKimura
I’m so angry now. She was 22 fucking years old. She barely had the chance to live &amp; barely scratched the surface on her talent. How is it okay what they did to her? She deserved more of this earth than the pain these people brought her. Bring them to justice. #HanaKimura
I must admit I hadn't seen #HanaKimura's work in the ring (Really must get around to Stardom), but hers was a name I'd heard several times from people I trust to know how good she was Gone too soon. Its a reminder to reach out to those around you. You never know who's struggling

@FireflyBWG @Prettyangeltoo Yes but wrestling is a business built on fan engagement. Live shows since it's existence it's inherent. Therefore damn near necesary to be on here as a worker. So I can exception to that sentiment. #HanaKimura
Address issues of MENTAL HEALTH in Japan. Be Kind, please share positivity. Social media caused Hana to pass away. Just bcos people aren't face to face with the person. Doesn't mean they do not have feelings. This is disgusting and needs to change #HanaKimura Rest in paradise🙏 https://t.co/53hGTK7Jzo

#HanaKimura gave me nothing but kindness on my journey as an artist. She would compliment my work, and would say it was good (it wasn’t) she pushed my confidence to be where I’m at now. Unfortunately I didn’t know she needed the same.

I'm so sad.. I prayed for you last night, when I learned the news.. but now I see the terrible sadness news. Rest In Peace Hana, we love you.. 💜💜 #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura https://t.co/iKbmRm4SoK
Only recently saw bits of #HanaKimura and how talented she was but regardless of talent and ability in her field...it's tragic to see somebody pushed on Social media to the point that she was last night. People are cruel and at 22 that poor girl couldn't cope.
If you got nothing nice to say, keep it to yourself. Just watched #HanaKimura vs Giulia from Year End Extravaganza ‘19. Kimura was the breakout star of 2019 in all of wrestling. Superstar! Thoughts to the Kimura and @we_are_stardom families 🙏🏻🙏🏻 #RIPHanaKimura https://t.co/5kniurBYPE

How wrong our assumptions are, when we base it on appearance. Rest in Peace #HanaKimura https://t.co/qhfTGTP7TH
#HanaKimura how??? Why???? 💔💔💔 #RIPHanaKimura #STARDOM
The tragic #HanaKimura death has highlighted the ways in which #TERRACEHOUSE has changed in the last year or two. The show was fairly innocent, showing off the subtleties and complexities of Japanese culture whilst making me hugely miss being in Tokyo with family.
Her cause of death has not been revealed. Earlier in the day, Kimura shared self-harm photos of herself and spoke of her severe depression. Rest in Peace, Hana Kimura. #HanaKimura https://t.co/6bxVU8XPJk
#HanaKimura è morta a soli 22 anni, era vittima di cyberbullismo https://t.co/3KTznmuI5d
the internet has driven a really sweet person to suicide because of some shit they saw on a "reality TV" show https://t.co/S1F0pz2jAR #HanaKimura
I had no idea that cyberbullying was so bad in the #TERRACEHOUSE community because I only ever checked the subreddit, never the Japanese comments on IG and whatnot. But it needs to change. You'll be missed #HanaKimura.
Tan solo 22 años, una habilidosa y futura promesa de la lucha libre femenina, este año ya habia roto una gran barrera al ser parte de la primera lucha de mujeres dentro de WrestleKingdom de NJPW evento y compañia que nunca habia permitido luchas femeninas. R.I.P #HanaKimura https://t.co/L4gtZzV6mX
Speechless just Speechless. I just planned to watch the newest Terrace House episode today and then I see this. What a tragedy #HanaKimura
@utami0914 Very saddened by this tragic news. Sending love and support to everyone who knew #HanaKimura R.I.P.
@AEWRetweeting Oh no very sad 😭 #RIP #HanaKimura

The suspected #suicide of #HanaKimura is a reminder of the effects of #cyberbullying which is thought to caused/contributed to her mental health problems &amp; #selfharm . Don't be afraid to speak out, to ask for help... [thread] https://t.co/w8VYVi6nGz
Words are powerful. They make you happy. They also make you nervous, sad, mad and things like that. It's important to choose your words because it may let someone get dead. And those of you going to her Twitter account and left hate comments grow the fuck up. #木村花 #HanaKimura https://t.co/JvpoOvEpM6

I was not aware of #HanaKimura’s work but that doesn’t make it any less upsetting that a 22 year old girl thought her only option was suicide. No mater where you are in the world there are people to help, a simple RT of the site below could help… https://t.co/ZrusRagNAc
Still devastated over the news of #HanaKimura’s passing. I just can’t.....why would you ever wish someone you’ve never met to kill themselves (let alone someone you actually know). Cyber bullying fucking suck. RIP HANA 💔💔. https://t.co/sfZaujQPXm

@davemeltzerWON We also need to address the creepy older male demographic that's uniquely obsessed with women's wrestling, specifically Japanese women. They usually have the loudest opinions and aren't afraid to message or comment a wrestler. It's mostly abusive as well. #HanaKimura
En espérant que son harceleur soit vite retrouvé... 22ans c'est beaucoup trop jeune... horrible nouvelle pour la @we_are_stardom et le monde de lutte mondiale... #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura #WeAreStarDom #StardomWorld #Catch #lequipeCATCH
#HanaKimura was so pretty and talented, the internet can be a terrible place sometimes. #RIP
22 años tenía, yo la "conocí" por #TerraceHouse, una de nuestras favoritas :-( Dicen que ha sido por culpa del cyberbullying. En Japón la cosa es muy bestia. Acosar a la gente así es probablemente una de las cosas más miserables que puedes hacer con tu triste vida. #HanaKimura https://t.co/ZBJkBq9EpY

Je découvre #HanaKimura en TT sans connaître du tout ce milieu... A priori victime de cyberharcèlement, elle a mis fin à ses jours. Pas trouvé de news vraiment officielle pour l'instant mais ça fait tristement écho à l''avant-dernière vidéo de @IciJapon https://t.co/nGbqqkdyQa
Such sad news to hear today. Can’t believe she committed suicide. #HanaKimura
I'm amazing and shocking I can not forgive this fact fucking crazy, #RIP #Hanakimura
#HanaKimura aveva 22 anni e i capelli rosa. Era una #wrestler giapponese del circuito Stardom e guardandola pensavi avesse tutto: bellezza, simpatia, fama. Stanotte si è suicidata, dopo aver ricevuto centinaia di messaggi di cyberbullismo via social, a partire da #Twitter 1/4 https://t.co/NoHKecHNbk
I adored you on Terrace House and rooted for your success in life . Gone to soon 😔💗 #HanaKimura
#HanaKimura will always be in the Joshi Wrestling History Books with Mayu Iwatani, Giulia and Arisa Hoshiki (who retired just a few days ago) as a part of the first-ever STARDOM match at WK in a sold-out Tokyo Dome. Remember her doing what she loved to do: wrestling. https://t.co/G8LqddaYWo
RIP @hanadayo0903 #HanaKimura She deserved better.
@we_are_stardom May she rest in peace. My condolences to her family, friends and true fans of hers. Gone too soon. You deserve better Hana. You did well. We will miss u forever. #hanakimura #WeLoveHanaKimura 😭😭😭

Cyberbulling doesn't make you cool, it doesn't make you in with the crowd. It just makes you look like a pathetic human being in the end. Anyone who bullies online or even offline are complete rejects of society. #RIPHanaKimura #HanaKimura https://t.co/ZZ4VZcfFP9
I sincerely hope whoever the weak, attention seeking, miserable and soulless waste of life meat-suits who bullied #HanaKimura to death do more with their lives than she was going to but I know that probably won't be possible with all their efforts combined. You STOLE a gift.
I just saw the news...and this is heartbreaking 💔😢 This is real sad, no one deserves this. Cyber bully should stop. Please spread love, share kindness rather than being toxic and hurting each other 😔 RIP #HanaKimura https://t.co/jUXWghI3hr
Rest in Peace, #HanaKimura. I'm sorry that you left this world the way you did, and sorry that you hurt so very badly that you felt there was no other way. You will be forever missed. https://t.co/E2FeJnCKVW

To the bastard that’s responsible to cyber bully #HanaKimura! You and your negativity took the life of a sweet human being. That’s unacceptable in this world. You have the nerve to cyber bully her and asking people to send death threats on her? What kind of human garbage are you?

TW: suicide I honestly loved #HanaKimura so much on terrahouse, she was such a breath of fresh air, she was so fun and not ashamed of who she was and what she loved. I can’t believe someone would cyber bully her to this point. I hope they feel terrible for the rest of their lives

I didn't know who #HanaKimura was but to be pushed to commit suicide at 22 when your life has barely begun is so devastating. Online trolls have so much to answer for.
RIP Hana Kimura, people suck, I hope you now can rest with some peace. Far too young, such a senseless waste of life. I hope all her bullies are charged with manslaughter #HanaKimura
Bullying has a power to end one’s life. This is so heartbreaking. 😞💔 #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura

La morte di #HanaKimura è qualcosa di terribile. Vedere una ragazza così giovane fare un gesto del genere perché sommersa da insulti sui social fa male, molto male. Mi spiace veramente tanto. Buon viaggio Hana. Che la terra ti sia lieve #RIPHanaKimura
@AnaMelissa15 Not sure if you’re familiar with #JoshiPuroresu (I’m a huge fan) or @we_are_stardom Stardom 💫 star #HanaKimura committed suicide about several hours ago apparently Hana was suffering from severe depression and was constantly being cyberbullied &amp; slit herself
@Jazzy_Gabert Sad someone could lose their life and Twitter hasn't come out with a statement wanting to investigate this crime. Cause it is a crime punished by imprisonment. #HanaKimura needs justice, those trolls must pay.
We’ve all made mistakes, we’ve all tweeted stuff we wish we hadn’t in hindsight. Let’s all be better and look after each other #HanaKimura
i did not know who Hana Kimura was but wow this story is so sad. SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LADY too ;( . May God forgive you and bless your pretty soul. REST IN PEACE BEAUTIFUL #HanaKimura #RIP
@we_are_stardom #HanaKimura #Heartbroken great wrestler and a great person
If you partook in any of the hate towards Hana Kimura, you have her blood on your hands now! She was literally bullied online to the point where she could take it no more. I'm shocked. This is so sad. Hana had it all. You took it from her. #RIPHanaKimura #HanaKimura
If you can be anything in this world please be kind ❤️ #RIPHana #HanaKimura 💔
@AEWrestling I'm shocked, I saw her often live in the Korakuen hall, saw her smiling and laughing at the merchandise stand. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. It's hard to look forward to #DoubeOrNothing with joy right now :( #hanakimura #aewrestling #thankyouhana #花木村 #STARDOM

I can't even express how sad the death of #HanaKimura makes me. Such a wholesome young Person, by the age of just 22, died to bullying. Seeing her on terrace house was always a joy but it also shows how much is hidden from the viewer... Please everyone, don't give up ❤️ https://t.co/8hCd7cpcdG

If you make jokes or have no empathy for #HanaKimura you are trash. You don't have to know someone to feel sadness, compassion or empathy for them. Mocking the dead or suicide for attention is the lowest form of scum. #RIPHanaKimura I hope you rest in peace and paradise. 🙏
#terracehouse #tokyo is not the same without #HanaKimura. i can’t believe it. rest in peace. 🙏 #RIPHanaKimura

It’s so sad that people feel the only way out of bullying, cyber or in person is to just leave this world. I wish she knew she was worth it and worth living. I hope we can take this as a way to rise above the hatred. Hana, so much love and peace to you. #RiseAboveHate #HanaKimura
Hana Kimura reminds me of when Caroline Flack took her own life - people will preach about being kind and not going online to troll others, but then the next day everything is back to normal and vile cunts continue anonymous cyberbullying. Its a sad world we live in. #HanaKimura
This is really sad. I don't watch a lot of Japanese wrestling as don't access to it. However the fact a young woman living her dream took her own life due to online bullying is one of the things wrong with the world. #HanaKimura #ItsOKtonotbeOK #RIP https://t.co/aHg6ljQPaC

I was not familiar with #HanaKimura or her career until tonight so I am glad that @iDontCare1830 has explained this succinctly. Watching Terrace House now and Hana lights up the screen. Sad story... https://t.co/EMev7n4VQ5
RIP #HanaKimura a true rising star in the business. #TerraceHouse #Wrestling #RestInPeace https://t.co/XKYLDH5vSd
Rest In Peace Hana Kimura... This needs to stop. Please start being kind with one another. #HanaKimura #love https://t.co/FNRm9xSDBV
Never knew who Hana was, hell, I don't even watch Stardom. But it's sad as fuck to see her go like this at such a young age. Cyberbullying is never okay. Never, and this is why. #HanaKimura may your soul rest in power. https://t.co/y0ft2p4acV
#HanaKimura received a day, a few days, or all week and completely destroys it. She was gorgeous and talented no doubt and she didn't deserve this fate. I hope FINALLY this will shed light on bullying but I fucking doubt it, we lost beautiful K Pop idols Jonghyun, Sulli, Goo Hara
So sad to hear such horrible news. No matter what, it hurts because we're all family in this industry, regardless of the distance. #HanaKimura #QEPD #StopTheHate #lovenothate #prowrestling https://t.co/tUefe86ARl

#HanaKimura This one really got to me, as does most suicide stories and I'm thinking she dealt with depression.. I understand what this is, its not something that goes away unless someone helps you take it away..It's like a blackhole that erases all the love and care you may have
Pro Wrestler who was 22 just ended her life because of *drum roll* Ppl being toxic pieces of garbage &amp; bullying her Just this past week I broke down due to ppl doing it to me for 3 yrs Ppl need to stop being pieces of garbage &amp; support one another #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura https://t.co/vCZeqr5NJH
#ShadGaspard and #HanaKimura in the same week? This is so awful. :(

An beautiful young wrestler #HanaKimura Unfortunately passed away today she is suspected of taking her own life as a result of cyberbullying. She was only 22 years old.. This is why we need to #BreakTheStigma because people do care about you even if you feel alone. https://t.co/yljCcV6mIP
your words matter. we should all take time to really reflect on how our actions impact others. it’s really tough to read how negative digital comments are in japan. RIP #HanaKimura https://t.co/rAXvW9NMs5
So a 22-year-old female wrestler (#HanaKimura) just killed herself after being cyberbullied. 22. Younger than me. She wrestled in the Tokyo dome, one of the most prestigious places for wrestlers ever. Then she killed herself. At 22. I can not bear
#HanaKimura ‘s death, much like Caroline Flack’s is another example of how toxic social media can be. How many people need to suffer till we learn? #RIPHanaKimura gone to soon.
The wrestling world, dealing with ANOTHER LOSS. On Friday, May 22nd, 2020 Japanese wrestler #HanaKimura took her own life. She was 22 years old at the time of her passing. PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL AND KIND to EVERYONE you meet and interact with. Words have lasting effects.
Behind a smile you never know the pain someone may be in. Cyber bullying (or bullying of any form) can kill. Be kind to others. If you can’t, don’t engage and practice silence. RIP #HanaKimura https://t.co/20jXGAmnR9
#HanaKimura was very beautiful and Talented, she was a wealth of charisma she brought happiness to a lot of wrestling fans hopefully now she can find some peace. heavenly father in the name of Jesus God bless her sweet soul #RIPHanaKimura 😢😢🙏🙏 #StarDom

I know mostly nothing about Hana, let alone the world of wrestling in general. But what I do know, is that this was SEVERELY uncalled for. People drove her to suicide because of one tiny mistake. That does not warrant ganging up on someone. Why can't we learn to love? #HanaKimura
It's 2020, when will bullying end? Instead of getting better, it's only getting worse 💔 #StopBullying #stopcyberbullying #HanaKimura https://t.co/UbeUwF38hT

I wish the wrestling fan community had a code of conduct that punishes those in the wrestling fan community who abuse and harass others and an industry wide wellness policy for wrestlers who are having mental health issues Hana Kimura's death is not acceptable #HanaKimura
Absolutely heartbroken to wake up to the news this morning that Hana Kimura didn't make it. Despite mine &amp; other fans desperate attempts to reach out to her during her crisis, we sadly lost her to suicide last night. She was dearly loved, tragically gone too soon 🕯 #HanaKimura

“this is a death that can be blamed on the cruelty of social media and it's a subject that really needs addressing” Words coming from the same @davemeltzerWON that was fat shaming @PeytonRoyceWWE #HanaKimura
If we learn anything from #HanaKimura's suicide is that cyber bullying has adverse affects on the victim's psyche. Any so-called #MUFC fans trolling the likes of Jesse Lingard, Andreas Pereira, and Phil Jones need to think long and hard before they tweet abuse again.

As someone who was bullied for years and didnt think I'd make it through, I am thankful every day that it was before cyber bullying was a thing. If it had escalated to online I dont think I would have been strong enough. I'm so sorry people did this to you. RIP #HanaKimura

@TwitterSupport here is an example of someone making threats on your platform. Will a serious incident like #HanaKimura taking her own life because of threats made make you take any action.

Was für eine schreckliche Woche im Wrestling. Jeder Tod ist eine Tragödie, aber es hat nochmal eine andere Qualität, wenn jemand so junges unter so furchtbaren Umständen stirbt. Wer soziale Medien nutzt um Hass zu verbreiten, sollte sich schämen. #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura

As both a wrestling fan and a Terrace House fan, I’m simply speechless over the loss of #HanaKimura. Completely tragic. Cyber bullying is serious and hateful. She was only 22. So devastated! #RIPHanaKimura

Hana Kimura Just a quick doodle. I wanted to do a proper drawing of her (still will), but kept putting it off. She had such cool look and was great in the ring. 22 is too young, life is too short and people can be too cruel. #riphanakimura #hanakimura #stardom https://t.co/CNzCHofrUD
I never knew Hana until her death gave me awareness about her , hearing how much she was adored and respected makes me feel bad that I never watched a match of hers when she was alive , I pray for her family during this hard time #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura

I know nothing about #HanaKimura but that anyone is treated this way is disgusting. My thoughts are with her family and friends. A lot of people need to think about how they treat others.
Mich würde es nicht wundern wenn 2020 Die Welt untergehen würde. Keine Woche ohne schlechte Nachrichten... ich könnte heulen ohne Ende. Rest in Peace #HanaKimura ... what a tragedy. I hope you found peace... Einfach deprimierend dieses Jahr bislang. Bitte bleibt stark und gesund

RIP to #HanaKimura and #ShadGaspard too soon foreal 💔
What I don’t understandis, why was #HanaKimura bullied? Someone fill me in.
How And Why Did #HanaKimura Die? 🧐
So wrong what happened to you, Hana... Damn. I just hope you have found peace. Rest easy now and leave it to us to fight those who bullied you. We need to stay strong, pro-wrestling. Let's fight hate together and make social media a safer place. 🥀💔 #HanaKimura https://t.co/EQCPSLy0m1

i can't even believe this rn. hana kimura, what an iconic female wrestler. this is so heartbreaking. there's a lesson to be learned from this: words do matter and they do have consequences, online and irl. i can't even believe this. wow. #HanaKimura https://t.co/BeQ5TPTFJi
Heartbreaking.. People can be so cruel, it’s a disgrace. #HanaKimura 🙏🏼
RIP #HanaKimura I think it’s shameful that some in the wrestling community who have recently been posting hate filled things about coronavirus and those who have gotten sick or died from that are now trying to “call out” people who bullied this poor girl. You are hipocrites.
Used to watch her when she was on @ringofhonor! Such an amazing talent taken too soon! Been a sad week to top of a sad year.... For those of you cyberbullies out there.... GO FUCK YOURSELVES!!!! #RIPHanaKimura #HanaKimura #BlessHanaKimura https://t.co/xerflZnQQa
what I truly hate is so many of the users in this community that are posting about how sad the #HanaKimura situation is are the same ones that bully other members of the wrestling community constantly. Sometimes in packs.
This saddens me greatly. She has been on the most recent season of Terrace House and has been someone I really, really liked. It was fantastic to see such a kind person in the house really bring it in the wrestling ring. #HanaKimura #RestInPower https://t.co/jqKvj78KYc

Bullying can come from a harmless joke to suicide. Today, we lost an angel at the age of 22. Know the boundaries of bullying cause let’s face it, we’re all bullies at some point, Be it for jokes or plain hatred. Remember that not everyone is unbreakable. #HanaKimura 🌹🌹🌹
#ThankYouHanaKimura #HanaKimura https://t.co/t0QAamygJV
#HanaKimura had the biggest and brightest future. I tried this morning to help. I tried. Rest In Peace. If anyone ever feels that level of pain, reach out to anyone. Reach out to me. Just reach out. All it takes is one moment to breakout.
I’m still having a hard time with this, We miss you so much Hana, you meant the world to us! I can only hope you are at peace now. Rest easy Hana. We will never forget you. #STARDOM #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura https://t.co/kmSDyFGFrT
Hana Kimura, de 22 años, terminó con su vida producto de todo el cyber bullying que recibía a diario... Ahora ¿seguirías pensando que tirar hate es divertido? Sean más consientes, lo que para ti es un comentario tonto para otros es mucho dolor. #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura https://t.co/AhEF8kfWNS

I don't care how much money or fame someone has. I don't care how much adulation they get. I don't care how many followers they have. None of that, and nothing at all gives you the right to bully them or encourage that they harm or kill themselves. NOTHING. #HanaKimura

really sucks to hear about #HanaKimura's passing, my thoughts with her family, friends and STARDOM. if it's true that she was in as bad a mental state as she was down to bullying then people got to look at themselves and think before they go and post their disgusting shit.
I’m putting it out there. After the tragic death of #HanaKimura DM me if you want to talk, you ain’t gotta know me, and I ain’t gonna give you advice or pretend I know what you’re going through. No more suicides. There’s always someone, there’s always something. TALK
Damn. RIP #HanaKimura. Be kind to each other. It’s so easy to do.

#HanaKimura I am lost for words, and yet so very angry to know Hana is gone because of worthless people who just have to be mean. I just can't get over this one. I mean look at her. How can anyone be negative towards this gentle darling. https://t.co/qwh2Q1LPoH
My condolences goes to the #HanaKimura fanbase. I can't imagine how y'all feeling right now. #staystrong ✊
Rest In Paradise #HanaKimura https://t.co/ypQ1XGiKgf
Just...everyone please be nice to one another. Everyone has lost someone or knows someone who has lost someone to suicide. At this point, we know that “sticks and stones” phrase is complete horse shit. RIP #HanaKimura 22 years old is too soon.
This is as heartbreaking as it is stunning. She was 22. #HanaKimura https://t.co/xICzeteR1u
@WWENXTGuy @datila_ @MichaelChauTV @RealMichaelChau @CGirl125 @Simply_c_ok @DameonBerryJr Not sure if you’re familiar with #JoshiPuroresu (I’m a huge fan) or @we_are_stardom But apparently Stardom 💫 star #HanaKimura committed suicide about two hours ago
#FUCK2020 Man, 2020 just sucks. First it was #RIPShadGaspard a wrestler I've grown up watching then to hear #HanaKimura who is gone and is 5 years younger than I am. This has to be one of if not the worst year for wrestling fans across the globe. https://t.co/OKe3yvafiS
If Anyone Is Feeling Down, Sad, Depressed Or Anything I Promise It's Somebody Out There Who Can Help You ❤ #RIP #HanaKimura #RIPHanaKimura #Love #Kind #Nice #Joy #Happy
Oh no. #HanaKimura 😭
We gotta be better to each other. #HanaKimura 🙏🏿
Here’s a idea #WrestlingTwitter how about we stop spreading so much hate, negativity and bullying and start spreading love and positivity. Our words have more power than any weapon ever created. It’s is up too us on how we use it. #PositiveVibesOnly #HanaKimura https://t.co/9BaW44XiU1

#HanaKimura #ShadGaspard
Devastating news about #hanakimura ... What a damn shame... So young and just at the cusp of a great career -- so full of life and energy ... Every one of those "fans" who pushed her to this point has blood on their hands. Every. Single. One.
Fuck y'all bullies!! Hana Kimura didn't deserve that! I didn't know her or watch her in Stardom, but I saw her name online alot as someone to watch! One of the best females wrestlers. So sad! Screw y'all! This is shocking like I knew her. #RipHanaKimura #HanaKimura #STARDOM
@TheTayaValkyrie Social media is a place where people become the worst versions of themselves and thinks it’s fine to say what ever they want with no consequences...people need to understand words matter.....heaven just got a new angel R.I.P #HanaKimura you was loved and will be missed

So unbelievably sad about #HanaKimura . Just an amazing talent. So glad I got to see her perform in NYC last year as 1/6th of the first non-WWE match Madison Square Garden had in 50 years. She just lit up the entire arena as soon as she hit the ring. #RIPHanaKimura
#HanaKimura 🙏
RIP #HanaKimura 🙏💔💖

When will people realise that words cut too deep? 22 is no age to die and it is sad to have such a bright beacon of life gone because of the disgusting behaviour of a minority of people. #HanaKimura #riphanakimura
Saddened to hear of the passing of Hana Kimura 🌹Be kind to each other🌹 @hanadayo0903 #HanaKimura
Absolutely gutted at the sudden and tragic loss of #HanaKimura. This woman was a true star in #Joshi wrestling and a true sweetheart, if Terrace House was any indication. When shit got tough for me during quarantine… https://t.co/pDCTpcrNi9
#HanaKimura Rest in Peace sweet Hana Kimura 😫😭😭
she had such a beautiful pure and bright soul. she didn’t deserve this. May you rest in peace #HanaKimura #thankyouHana https://t.co/sbY2S4mhTr
Also, please REPORT the people who encouraged this, threatened her, harassed her, told her to kill herself, etc. Do not JUST call them out or speak vaguely! These people should be arrested, each and every damn one of them! In every situation like this! #HanaKimura
I cannot begin to understand how can some netizens be so fucking toxic. What were the fucking thinking goddamn! Now #HanaKimura is not around anymore and I cannot understand why.
#HanaKimura was literally bullied and trolled to death over a reality tv show. We are no better as a species for the crisis we’ve endured this year 😢 #WeSupportHanaKimura https://t.co/O30JgLB398
#HanaKimura Be here tomorrow 1-800-273-8255 https://t.co/TIBpDtXZXf
(1 of 2) Just saw the news about #HanaKimura, a 22 yr old Japanese women’s wrestler who essentially commit #suicide on Twitter today because of bullying on #SocialMedia. I unassumingly clicked on her Twitter and saw the gruesome pics before they were deleted.
Jesus, man, why are people so awful? Preying on someone and just tearing them apart until they can't take it anymore? Why bring people down to join you in your misery? Why spend your whole damn day "trolling" and contributing nothing to society? I'm so sorry, Hana.. #HanaKimura
I was fortunate enough to see #HanaKimura perform at Wrestle Kingdom in Tokyo, back in January. 22 is too young for anyone to die. https://t.co/mfJ1C2xAmY
All of those people who pushed her to this point you should be damn ashamed of yourselves! Whether you liked her or you didn’t it you caused this and it didn’t have to happen! I don’t even know where to start, bullying has its consequences people! #STARDOM #HanaKimura
One day we will all wake up from this bad dream. Be kind to others, you never know what they are going through, and it doesn't cost a thing. Rest easy beautiful flower 💔🥀#WeLoveHanaKimura #HanaKimura https://t.co/nn5sPFA8ZZ

Absolutely shocked and upset to hear about #HanaKimura! I’m behind on #TerraceHouse episodes &amp; only saw her in a few so far, but thought she was kind, bright, bubbly, strong, &amp; talented. What a terrible loss! https://t.co/NanZzKcymk
22. She was just getting started with life and had so much potential. Such a beautiful and talented young woman lost. RIP #HanaKimura
What happened to #HanaKimura is absolutely heartbreaking. She was only 22 years old. She deserved absolutely none of that. Rest in peace.
I never saw Hana Kimura wrestle but by the looks of my TL, it seems like she was on the rise to do amazing things in the business. Tough week for pro wrestling. #HanaKimura v

We are heartbroken to hear tonight about #HanaKimura While our shows focus on WWE, it does not make this less relevant. A great person lost for reasons that we may never know fully. In these times especially, we beg anyone who needs to talk, reach out. You are never alone!
💔 #HanaKimura
My heart breaks for Stardom, their fans, and for the family of #HanaKimura . This hasn't been a great week for wrestling as a whole.

Sad to report that #HanaKimura of #Stardom has passed away at only age 22. Recently she had been posting self harm pictures on social media. Unknown as of right now the cause of death. Keep her family and friends in your thoughts. https://t.co/npoEZrZyKo
A reminder to all: if you feel like ending your life, or feel those deep darks, call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline tel:1-800-273-8255. Please. #HanaKimura
Serious question: Can someone explain to me the #HanaKimura drama - in a way a German woman who is not 24/7 on social media can understand? It's the @hanadayo0903 I follow? And now it's said she's dead? Can't find anything official in English... Help anyone? Please?
Fuck Terrace House fans. Full stop. #HanaKimura
🥺 #HanaKimura
RIP #HanaKimura
God damn. Another dark day for wrestling. Hana Kimura got me into watching a little bit of Stardom. People need to be more kind to one another, why is that so hard? #HanaKimura

Just heard about the passing of #HanaKimura. Please check up on all of your friends, you never know what they are going through. Take care of yourself and please seek for help if you are going through something. We all care about you even if you don’t know it
She didn't make it. RIP Hana Kimura #木村花 #HanaKimura #WeSupportHana
@we_are_stardom 2020 is officially the worst year ever May her soul rest in peace! She was one of the brightest stars in womens wrestling so much potential and just getting better and better so much star potential as well such a sad day in the world of wrestling #HanaKimura #STARDOM

Okay, guys. I'm a huge #TerraceHouse fan and all, but shit like what's happening to #HanaKimura isn't why I started watching. Until fans in Japan and abroad can get a grip and until the producers start giving a damn about mental health, I'm done for now. #WeLoveYouHanaKimura
The mental health of #TerraceHouse members really needs to be looked after. Fans also need to remember that these people are human (not characters) and shouldn't be personally attacked over what we see of them on TV. I hope #HanaKimura is okay. We're here for you, Hana-san.
Any updates about #HanaKimura?
#HanaKimura #WeLoveHanaKimura #WeLoveHana We can only stay here to support you girl. No words, just all our love and all the support possible. Don't give up on yourself, you are a precious one.. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I know the world is rightly engrossed in the struggle for racial justice and equality but I also didn't want to forget that a 22 year old died as a result of online bullying less than two weeks ago. Just 22. #HanaKimura #木村花 #FlowersForHana #RIPHanaKimura #cyberbullying https://t.co/PyjimLzRN8

I'm huge fan of #TerraceHouse, but I can't watch anymore of it. I hope that we can all come away from this horrible tragedy with more empathy for our fellow human beings, and I hope those who bullied Hana seriously reflect on their actions. #木村花 https://t.co/vfwwRUb53D

Bottomline, I may, for myself, stop watching reality TV shows from now on. Without us watching, may be there won't be shows like this for much longer. One can hope! I'm just not going to be part of "that" anymore. Will try. Will see. #InMemoriam #TerraceHouse #木村花 #HanaKimura

I liked her, especially her smile. She had a cheerful and very nice personality. And above all, she had a clean heart. She was suffering from defamation on social media for a long time. Saying goodbye in this way is really sad. She died so young. She was only 22... #木村花 https://t.co/7RwWJB9GDX

Hadn’t known of #木村花 till I heard about her passing tho, but looks like there’d been constant online bullying at her by some malicious users... How on earth could there be an incident where a girl at just 22 would find no alternative than to kill herself to end this shit???

Honestly my joshi prowres fandom was brief, but Kimura Hana was one of the core people that attracted me to it. I'm glad I got to see her perform once. Absolutely terrible news. :( RIP. #木村花

Japanese reality TV can be just as toxic as American reality TV. Don't you forget it. #木村花
She was only 22. I was a complete shithead at 22, but I had people around me who helped me forgive myself and grow. Hana needed help. She was owed help. #木村花

My condolences to the family, friends, and fans of Stardom's Hana Kimura. She was a human loved by many around the world. We hoped for the best in the last few hours, but it's sad to learn the tragic end of her life. May her soul rest in peace. #RIPHanaKimura #木村花
I believe Hana was brutally murdered by scums of the earth. Hope she’s enjoying wrestling with her precious ones in heaven. My deepest condolences for her family’s and friends’ loss. #WeLoveHanaKimura #木村花

My heart hurts knowing she felt hopeless and desperate for her pain to end. People have NO IDEA how dangerous bullying can be. Kimura San was so young. Every person that bullied her has blood on their hands. Be kind to people you never know what they are going through 😢 #木村花 https://t.co/tT2Kcdobrv

The heart of #TerraceHouse is supposed to be about uplifting people and helping them overcome their problems. The people who sent death threats to Hana Kimura clearly don't understand that. They aren't true fans. #WeLoveYouKimuraHana #木村花

When Hana logs back into her Twitter and Instagram, she will be surprised by all the messages of love and support from all her fans all around the world #WeLoveHanaKimura #木村花
I had the pleasure of meeting and seeing Hana interact with her fans (@AHROOMEE and I we’re together for this). Hana took her time with each fan, so kind to all...she is so amazing! I hope she knows he fans love her and are there with her through this 💜#WeLoveHanaKimura #木村花 https://t.co/PI2Txu1oiR

To make someone feel alone and push them to the brink... It's despicable. And such actions led to a person in Japan take the extreme step of ending her beautiful life - you all best look up #HanaKimura #KimuraHana and reflect. Report Keem for what he is doing!

#kimurahana “the nail that sticks out gets hammered down!” Says japan when it comes to uniqueness. Fuck that shit. The nail that sticks out is useful. In my old apartment I hung beautiful paintings off that nail. The nail that sticks out is useful. More useful than other nails.

Suzy Lu makes the death of Hana Kimura about herself - pathetic And she wonders why she lost so much so quickly, standing on her grave, the disrespect #kimurahana #CancelCulture #suzylu https://t.co/BzJUlcBfdm
Like most reality shows Terrace House was shallow entertainment at its worst &amp; delightful escapism at its best. Still, it’s so sad to see a young person bear the horrible, dehumanizing side of the internet alone. Thinking of #KimuraHana today.
