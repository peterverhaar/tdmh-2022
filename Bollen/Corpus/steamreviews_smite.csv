"6407,SMITE,2015.0,""Best MOBA on Steam. No question.Over the shoulder camera makes this game not only unique but works very well with this genre.The God Pack DLC gets you everything you NEED in this game, much cheaper compared to something like LoL.Multiple game modes makes this fun even for non competitive gamers.Not overly complicated or off putting like DOTA.My go to MOBA game, give it a try has something for everyone."",1"
6408,SMITE,2017.0,I like this game. its really nice that they got tons of events and characters whats make this game never boring. BEST MOBA I EVER PLAYED (tottaly not the only moba I played or somthing...),1
6409,SMITE,2018.0,look at the amount of time ive put in this game. great concept i had fun. but then i tried playing ranked. let me start with i work in the army as an infantryman. i know what toxic people are like. this game has the most toxic player base i have ever played with. don't know how to function as a pro? you get reported. didn't executed every manuever with the synergy of a fortune 500 company you get reported. its very much a team game and in a world of trolls and dbags you are not rewarded for trying at all. ill save you 200 hrs and tell you you suck stop playing and why are you even trying. avoid this game.,0
"6410,SMITE,2015.0,""I have spent about 1.300 h  on SMITE and all i can say is GET THIS GAME !Besides the fact that it has decent graphics for a MOBA and the general gameplay is awesome and a lot more intense in comparison to other games of its genre, it also has one of the best in game stores when it comes to value for money. The developer updates the game regulary with content patches and it also has a fairly decent E-Sports coverage. The only way this game could be improved if the servers were more stable. This has been an issue for a while now but its nothing that will ruin your interest for this game permanently."",1"
"6411,SMITE,2015.0,""SMITE stands out from other MOBA's for the simple fact that it uses a third person camera wich makes the game more fast passed and puts you more into the game itself.Plus using Gods from various mythologies is somewhat of a unique idea in MOBA's, and it's quite funny to see interactions between the gods.I've played SMITE before it came to Steam and I recommend you check it out, it's worth your time.  "",1"
6412,SMITE,2018.0,Ive spent alot of time in this game between pc and xbox. This game used to be so fun and I had a blast. But Hi Rez and the community have run it straight into the depths of dead games.,0
"6413,SMITE,2016.0,"" FANTASTICWell i myself am a Beta tester and played for 2.5 years now and have to say that the idea of 3rd person MOBA is fantastic!Pros-Really great and greatly evolving by time graphics thanks to unreal engine-Helpful Tutorials to get you started-In game balanced and great variety of maps-Nice abillities that lets you improvise a lot-The efects of the abillities are widescale (ex. At Kukulkan's (Former Ao Kuang that got remade) Ulti there is a F@$($@ celestial dragon coming down from heavens to Smite your sorry !@# and When Poseidon cast his ulti you get to Hear """"Realease the Kraken"""" in a manly voice and then you see a Kraken out of nowhere)-The connection with the servers is pretty solid nowadays in comparison with what was in Beta-God damn hot godesses (Awilix for the money)Cons-The community needs work-The Report/Punisment system too (something like dota i guess)-People should be encouraged to play by making it possible to play more gods (for those who don't want to buy ultimate god pack)-Bring back DX11!9/10 ~Would release the Kraken again."",1"
"6414,SMITE,2016.0,""Matchmaking... ha.. I wish..God knows why i wasted so many hours on this piece ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥Preferred Region: EuropeLow-Rez*processing*: Ahhh I think he means North America.Edit: Mythymoo was the only advertising they could muster and now that he's over Hi-Rez's krap, Their game has gone to sheet, damn mongs these flokken twets is i tells you, fokein konpts."",0"
"6415,SMITE,2015.0,""I've liked MOBAs since the original DoTA, but i didn't play it enough, because it seemed to lack something for me. I liked HoN and played it a bit (purchased an account when it wasn't free), but still something was lacking. I've liked PvP since Ultima Online and even though UO was point and click, I needed something else from MOBAs. Then I got introduced to SMITE in 10/2012 and I never looked back.This game is GREAT - third person makes point & click MOBAs look like console games.I wish there was a system to block players that do not follow the meta-info from matchmaking with you or make them go through some educational videos-tutorials and the playerbase would develop also... I highly recommend this game. Finally on Steam also. Wohoo! (VEW)"",1"
"6416,SMITE,2016.0,""Amazing MOBA, third person camera really makes it original, and it recieves updates very often to help balance the game, servers can be a bit spotty, but besides that it's a great game."",1"
"6417,SMITE,2016.0,""lets start with the basics:okay, so.. the game is similar to the very popular game called League of Legends.. well, but since i dont really like, i mean i hate League of Legends, i didnt really plan to play with this game, either... because i heard that its very similar to that game and you know since i dont like that game, why would i like this one?after i played it, it turned out that its much better, i repeat much BETTER than League of Legends.. because in League of Legends, you get to play as like a strategy game, camera position from above, clicking to move etc. and i dont really like strategy games either, but there are some that i liked a bit, for example Red Alert, but thats different.. also this game is played in third person mode, you can play with a lot of good characters, but here they are called """"gods"""".. because actually some of them (that i know) are really gods that has been confirmed by people in the old ages, who knows when... and so yes, the game is really similar to League of Legends, but as i said, its much betterthe game has got a quite good graphics, it has a good fighting system, it has a fair money system, because here there is no """"pay to win""""! there is only """"pay to skin"""" maybe, that you can get because skins are the things for the gods that you can get by paying for the game or by collecting gems or at some skins favors (that is used for the money itself in the game anyway)or there could be pay to win, if someone pays a lot for the game just to get all the gods, its even possible to do it on low level by paying for the game ^^""""there are different type of classes like in any MMORP games, you know like those common classes like warrior, assassin, mage etc.whatever anyone says, if you get to learn to use a specific class or a character, then you can play well with that, but it depends on you, for example i cant really play with the class mage, but theres a mage character (like as i said a specific character sometimes) that i can use wellso i think if you would like to get to know or to try this game, i really recommend you this one :)anyway, this game is really based on teamwork, so the team has really gotta work together well to succeed, otherwise.. if you solo, if you like go alone and try to do everything on your own, you will failunfortunately, sometimes there are hackers, but you can report themp.s.: you can play with bots as well, theres a tutorial in the game, you can practice etc."",1"
"6418,SMITE,2016.0,""Third person view behind the character with direct controls instead of mouse clicking for movement is a nice change from other MOBA's. The view and Controls are similar to Super Monday Night Combat which I loved.  Has five basic classes with Gardian, Hunter, Assasin, Mage, Warrior. Each has enough variation within to not get bored.Sometimes can be frustrating other times you can feel godlike somewhat depending on your teamates. Thats what makes it fun everygame is different and you keep coming back to catch the games your team is all in sync.I'm more casual and stick to Assault mode, Arena, and the newer clash modes.  Would recommend can easily lose a whole day playing without realizing the time has gone by."",1"
"6419,SMITE,2016.0,""Smite changed every bit of how I feel about MOBAs. I first got this game on xbox after a few of my friends tirelessly convinced me to download it. I hated MOBAs because of LOL and its toxicity in the community. LOL personaly I could not play and feel good after a match and I made the mistake judging all MOBAs off these bad experinces. I got so involved on SMITE I ended up building a PC to join the PC side of SMITE, Xbox took way longer to get updates and I felt I would have a better competive experience on PC. Between both I believe I am sitting at +500 hours.My PROS:- Community is better than any other competive mutiplayer I have seen- Way less clicking than LOL- Perspective (3rd Person)- Lore of Gods- Hi-Rez is good with ways to get free Gems (In game currency that you can also buy)- God Pack to buy all gods and future gods (Saved me alot of grind time)- Hi-Rez is really interactive with the community (Via Twitter)My CONs:- Ranked system still needs some tweaking- Needs a better """"report player"""" system and harsher penaltys for DC/AFK'sThat is just a few I can think off the top of my head.Hi-Rez really has something here and am happy to see it grow."",1"
6420,SMITE,2016.0,im not a big fan of mobas but this game is amazing the graphics arent bad it runs smoothly it has many gods the game is strategic very fun i have been adiccted to this game i can not stop playing it it has various game modes one of my favriotes which were conquest its challenging and overall its the best moba ever one thing i dont like i bought some gems on this game only when it was on sale and if u are getting this game do not buy gems till theyre on sale theyre are way to overpriced,1
6421,SMITE,2016.0,This is my first ever Steam review and It's for one of the best games ever. I've had tried getting into other MOBA games but simply coudn't. I gave Smite a chance because of the unique Gods theme and the playing camera angle and I'm glad I did. The game environment is absolutely chilling and addicting. All those gods and the powers make you wanna play it 24/7. Definately recommeded!,1
"6422,SMITE,2016.0,""I hate MOBAs. I tried LoL, DOTA, and several other lesser known games. I picked this up earlier this month, and immediately became addicted. My friends, who hate MOBAs as much as I do, also became addicted. We now have our own small clan and play this game daily.Not sure what it is about the change of perspective from isometric click-to-move to third person WASD controls that makes such a difference to me, but now I can say I genuinely enjoy a MOBA. The community isn't quite as toxic, either, so that's a plus."",1"
"6423,SMITE,2015.0,""After playing a lot of smite, theres always a time in a MOBA, where you actually feel bad in the game. I played a lot of League Legion before smite. I actually tried it again. And in conclusion i have to admit, that Smite is literally a really really good game. It is really fun. It has a lot of gods in which ALL of them are really fun to play. The community is actually pretty good too, of course there are some people behaving bad, but its the minority and most are actually really nice and behaving. After deinstalling Smite twice, i always come back because it actually is an awesome game. You should really play it. :)"",1"
"6424,SMITE,2016.0,""The 190 hours listed on Steam are since I upgraded from an i5/650TI to an i7/970 and decided to download the game on steam. I actually have over 1000 hours, just look me up on Smiteguru to confirm. It's a 3rd person f2p moba, but for relatively cheap (20? I think? I bought it like 3 years ago) you can get the God pack, which gives you all Gods and all future Gods that ever come out. Forever. I've never heard of another game doing that. The season ticket (bet on tourneys/get points for winning matches that unlock many things throughout the season) is a great deal if you play a lot, and gems (the cash currency) are regularly given away in special events and log-in bonuses. Plus, they just got rid of Golden Bow, so ADCs aren't invincible death machines anymore. (Sorry merc. You're my favorite diamond assassin, but it had to be done).Typical moba community, play with friends and use the mute button liberally."",1"
"6425,SMITE,2016.0,""Made me want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing slit my throat, even at times that i was winning the lane.Honestly, i think you're better off shoving a toothpick under your big toe nail, kicking a flaming wall untill the flesh from your feet disappear.Best game ever"",1"
"6426,SMITE,2017.0,""Note: Most of the hours I've accumulated in the game occured during the latter half of SMITE Season 3.This game is like Monopoly: a game usually played in large groups with friends and family, takes some time to learn the rules, requires a lot of compromise with others, and -- a big point --- is known to destroy the bonds between others. This """"Monopoly"""" has a few different flavors, though Official Rules [Conquest] is the main rule set that you have to go by, since the game's balancing is solely based upon it. This way of playing takes the longest on average: 3 lanes, 5v5, jungle, in typical MOBA fashion. Notoriously has been avoided due to the seriousness/salt associated with the mode, but with the evergrowing playerbase being introduced to the game via ads or the SPL, this game mode follows the """"stomp or be stomped"""" motto.Every other mode is off of the vanilla version, and the best mode of them all, in my opinion, is either Quick Play [Siege, a two-lane, 4v4 mode, with a """"ticket"""" counter which releases a big bad boy after you get 100 tickets... or until the big bad spawns in the center jungle"
"6427,SMITE,2017.0,""now first i wanna say this is probably my favorite multiplayer game of all time, i'm a casual player and this game gets my adrenaline pumping and when i say i ove this game, i mean that i love this game, if it was a woman, well you know, i don't, i don't have woman, also i've been playing since beta, and having 60 hours over the span of 4 years isn't much, but i have seen the evolution of the UI, stage designs, playerbase, ETC.first, yes a new player to this game is going to be absolutely ripped to shreds, there is so much to learn, there are so many gods, so many items, so many tryhards, i can imagine it feeling like a job to learn everything to be somewhat decent, this is a problem, and a lot of new players will just feel like they are being slapped around like a small child by people that played this game a little longer.Gods -There are many of them, and variety is good, a lot of the gods have different abilities and different roles because of that, a lot of tactics are avalible and a lot of gameplay styles. i will say that the gods are kindof expensive, i've played 60 hours and i've only unlocked a little over 1/3 of the roster. being completely free to play and all that.Competetive -With any competetive moba's there are competetive jerkoffs, it's the single reason i back away from this game on many occasions, people telling me what to do and people scolding at me, giving me no constructive criticism, i'm a casual player, i don't care if i win or lose as long as i have a nice intense match of smite, but there are many game modes that are much less competetive, conquest is the most dangerous in my opinionDiffeculty Curve -Wowee, i only bring this up because i was trying to get a friend into this game, and he is a picky bastard but he was totally overwelmed, even with me telling him what he can pick, and telling him he should take his time on what to pick, he still got pretty shafted, learning gods and what they can do is a big thing in any moba, but with so many gods, it gets hard to keep track of, luckely there are a lot of general favorites so you can block out some of these gods from learning since they suck (ratatoskr)Point is, it take a while to get used to, i would recommend it to you should you want to take the time and learn slowely but surely ( i would advise assault arena to learn how to play with and against various gods), but for me, this game is a lot of fun, action packed, tactical, teamwork, funny game. Also recently they added all kinds of random events, one of them being kart racing, and it was almost really really good, so it's worth checking it out for that, this game is beyond just a moba. "",1"
"6428,SMITE,2016.0,""its amazing how every single patch they release, the game just gets more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing broken. not to mention 90% of the playerbase is toxic and dumb. there will never be a time when this game is good, stay the hell away from this trash. oh and did I mention why TF did they give thoth a stun on his """"escape""""?????? an escape that takes you from earth to neptune"",0"
"6429,SMITE,2018.0,""It pains me to write this review after the hundreds of hours of joy this game has brought me but I feel I have to. This game used to be close to perfect. If I was feeling competitive I could hop in a round of joust or conquest. If I wanted to relax after a super draining day of studies, nothing made me happier than hopping in a round of Arena with some friends. Now I can't even enjoy a casual game  of arena with my friends. The servers are garbage"
6430,SMITE,2018.0,u have completely ruined this game u took everything from it that made it good u took attack speed away u took lifesteal away and made it a garbage and useless item why cant u guys make it like it was instead of useless updates ty i dont even wanna play it because u have done nothing to fix what needs to be fixed so ty 30 dollars i spent ruined,0
"6431,SMITE,2016.0,""I've been a player of SMITE since beta, I bought the godpack and everything and recently dove back into this gameThis game is actually fun from other MOBAs, I don't play it as much anymore bc none of my friends like this game but me pretty much so I only play it once in a while, but this is def a good game so check it out."",1"
6432,SMITE,2016.0,smite is a must have for any moba player... free to play on top of it and who doesnt love mythology? they are accurate historically and the graphics i mean come on. obvious choice when looking for a new life suck. i vote 5/5 and 10/10 hell ill even make u a banana split just play the game,1
6433,SMITE,2015.0,I know how many hours I have on steam curently but ignore it because I have been playing scense opne beta and I have quite some experience with this game and I can proudly say that I recomend it (not even joking I allready have about 20 skins just by not paying a cent (beacuse I'm a casual scrub) and it's awesome ),1
"6434,SMITE,2016.0,""Smite has gotta be the most fun 1st person moba I have EVER played. League and Smite have been competitors for my main moba for 2 years now. I have been playing smite longer. Not only that, but they shovel out deals and deals. They even did 30 bucks for every single god that is in game and that is coming. Probably best 30 I've ever spent. I just think that this game is so damn fun. "",1"
"6435,SMITE,2015.0,""Hands down my favorite game in the MOBA genre. I've tried them all extensively (I guess around 200 hours in each is enough to judge ~ Most of the time was in the non-steam version) And Smite is the one that leaves the most awe and a lasting impression. The game takes on one of my favorite themes, Mythology and brings the gods to life in a blood-soaked battlefield. Ever wandered who would win in a fight? Zues vs Hades? Perhaps you like spicing things up with Greeks vs Hindu gods? Chinese vs Mayan? Some Norse as well, all is possible in Smite. The game looks and feels great, the voices are well executed, the ingame prices are very reasonable considering you get free ingame currency simply for logging in or participating in certain events.Highly recommended to all fans of Moba games, even to those unfamiliar with the genre as it takes a different perspective (3rd person and moves with WASD, with attacking and aiming being all skillshot based)"",1"
"6436,SMITE,2016.0,""I love this game.I recently bought the Ultimate God Pack DLC, so I unlock all current & future gods automatically. It makes the game a lot more enjoyable, simply because you don't ever have to worry about unlocking gods again! Each god is worth trying because of all of their unique combat moves/abilities. If you find you like the game I highely recommend getting the ultimate god pack, it's 20 bucks, and you're set for life pretty much. Unless you're a skin â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ like myself.. then you have other issues to worry about. Overall tho, this game is my favorite MOBA hands down. The camera angles are what take this game to the next level. And it's FREE, you don't NEED to spend a dime to have fun with this game, trust me.9.5/10"",1"
"6437,SMITE,2016.0,""THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER,hello i am sander i am gone revieuw this game for you also you can add me on smite my name is dutchlol446 EU ONLY the gameplay is amazing it feels like you are a real got the update the game in a good way not like league of legends that it's only good for compertive no this game is also fun as cusal. i really enjoy this game i buyed the ultimate god pack so i get every old and new god that they are gone make. if you gone play this game buy it you will love it. also the voice packs are amazing what i don't like are the old skins the new skins are a lot better then the old ones some times you play with players that quit league of legends so the flame you if you are bad but the most players are really friendly  pros: many gods to choosemany gamemodes compertive as casul good communtiy the listen to the community god level clansesportscons: no jezus rating 9/10  "",1"
"6438,SMITE,2018.0,""Late Beta was more balanced, I'm not even kidding. I have above 1k hours if you count the time before it was released on Steam, if that means anything.Every new release obsoletes a couple more gods, with a third of gods two tiers above the rest, I think I am done with the game for the time being. There are less and less skillshots, which were the entire reason people play SMITE above other mobas. This is your average MOBA now, half of the skills are unmissable if you have opposable thumbs. Personal outplay potential decreases every season, everything is positioning now. If you aren't playing with premades, don't bother.There are gods that have been competitively unviable since their release, there are gods that stay as top picks for years, get nerfed for two months and get buffed back immediately. It plays quite well and is a lot more polished, but it really isn't the SMITE I used to love when it wasn't even on Steam."",0"
"6439,SMITE,2016.0,""This game was aight when it had Domination.But the game has pieces ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥youtubers like """"Easter Spoiler, DukeSloth, Ozzaworld Punk Duck"""" (many more) It gets worse.So I'll give it a - Broken/YoutubeBtw If you're reading this - Duke, Ozza, Punk, just know I love you â™¥ But â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that Easter Spoiler guy"",1"
"6440,SMITE,2015.0,""I played this game since the beta and there are a lot of gods (champions) to play since then..The community is great,not like in league of legends where when you die people just get mad and they kill the whole fun from the game...The game has diffrent types of gamemodes (Arena,3v3,Conquest and much more.) There is no adventage with in-game purchases so this game is 100% free to play...I recommend this game to everybody :)"",1"
"6441,SMITE,2016.0,""This game has sucked my life away, so many sleepless nights and so many cancerous games, but I can't stop. It pulls you in like a cold mistress and doesn't let you leave its gentle embrace. I've accepted this, but for  the love of god don't fall for the trap, but like, you should still play it cuz it's fun."",1"
"6442,SMITE,2016.0,""SMITE. A different kind of MOBA.So SMITE is a MOBA , just like League of Legends , DOTA 2 and Heroes of the Storm. Yet why do people play it instead of playing the games I metioned above? Well let me explain you. First of all SMITE is a third person game , so it gives the feeling of an adventure game more than a MOBA. That is indeed a nice change of pace in comparasion to other games. Second of all , SMITE doesn't just throw some random characters at you. You play as gods from different cultures which all have a connection and lore of their own. This game can help you learn quite a few things about mythology. Unlike other MOBAS , SMITE has a variety of game modes and maps. The game mode which stood out for me was Arena. In Arena the gods just basically go all out at eachother..in a arena! Seriously now don't be afraid to try SMITE , it's a really good game that can keep you busy from getting laid for a while.  8.0/10 - Good"",1"
6443,SMITE,2018.0,This game yoused to be amazing. But then they decided to put more effort into there skins. Now the servers are garbage and I cant play a game withought laging out or bugging out of a que. And then i get punished? Fix the game and the servers before anything else.,0
"6444,SMITE,2017.0,""A friend of mine emailed them about gods being unbalanced/op. What he got as an answer was a snooty """"delete your account"""". This really made me lose all the interest i ever had in hi-rez games. Seriously, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you Hi-rez."",0"
"6445,SMITE,2017.0,""Well, SMITE is MOBA game that came ou in 2012 and in 2015 got onto Steam. This time it's all about myhtological gods and it positions itself as MOBA that has the third person style gameplay instead of feeling like Warcraft 3 leftover. And yea, they kept updating it. Shame that Nu Wa isn't snake babe anymore though. Nothing that cost money seems to affect gameplay, unless unlocking gods.The game also comes with Easy AntiCheat with set me off at first. After all, it's offered separately on Steam just for Counter-Strike where it often conflicts with Valve VAC and also takes screenshots of your desktop. Apparently, it does it only for CS and everybody else is safe. At least it closes properly when you close SMITE, aha. Antiviruses may not like it when installing and setting up the game though.And well, I thought that's it's just going to be a generic MOBA with a camera slapped behind the characters but nope. While there isn't much of difference when playing melee attack characters, still being able to hit just one single target and all, anything ranged is a different story: you actually have to aim. This alone makes it much better than DOTA alikes as far as I care. There are no Warcraft 3 magically homing projectiles, at least for normal attacks. The abilities also have various hit areas, whether a circle or a line. As example, there is this Neith who has mighty jiggle physics and best ever victory animation. Her first ability is penetrative arrow. First, you have have to aim this line down and use the ability. After that Neith will aim the bow, now allowing you to change the angle anymore. However you are still free to move and thus you are still able to reposition yourself in order to hit the target. Of course enemy players aren't afraid of strafing. You slow down when attacking, so watch out.Plus, a lot of abilities are rather smart. Being something simple yet with multiple usage. Such as ice elemental tankie golem thing being able to create ice wall, having a long range to set it up.Also, the game has jumping but it's just a silly animation for those who feel bothered not being able to jump when controlling the characters directly. Developers don't want it to affect gameplay. Unless exploits or bugs. The terrain is all flat anyway.The game also includes the auto features for both shopping and selecting ability on level up. The latter isn't that much needed. The auto shopping on another hand helps new players to just focus on interacting with others and fighting, when they aren't sure if game is worth of their time spending looking at all the stats and numerical details. Pretty great. Albeit of course it's not as good as manual build.Otherwise of course it still has that MOBA feel. It still has towers and creeps running along lanes. The combat flow is still pretty funny in a silly sense. At one moment players are attempting to poke each other at range and then in another situtaion they all gang up on each other and nuke area with ability spam in 10 seconds.But hey, the game also comes with many various modes. Usual MOBA big map with three lanes, the two lanes one, one lane with small sideways, a simple linear path which has random heroes selectable (about as dumb as deathmatch modes in team games), and a small arena mode. Something for everyone's taste.Otherwise yep. The only MOBA I shall care about so far. Even if it's not pure MOBA so that means that I still sorta don't like MOBAs. But hey, whatcha gonna do?Also, music rocks."",1"
6446,SMITE,2016.0,It's one of the few MOBAs I'm proud of when it comes to being a member of the comunity. Smite brings something new to the table and I simply love it. It's the perfect combo of everything we love about MOBAs and the Third person view like in MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and others. It's awesome.,1
"6447,SMITE,2015.0,""This game deserves more recognition, it is just insanely good and the developers seem to care about it so far (also, the amount of stuff they give away for free is insane..). It's not for everyone, since it is a MOBA and it's hard to learn to play, but if you will get past the initial beatings you will find in this game a very good game."",1"
"6448,SMITE,2015.0,""I started playing this game on the 15th of August 2012, and little did I know that this game actually would be the most important game I've ever played in my life. It has given me so much. But storytime later, this is my review of the game. Every 2 weeks they give out a new patch, which shakens up the meta, balancing and adjusting gods, items and maybe changing some of the ingame elementals on the maps, and I believe every month there is a new god to learn to play and counter. It freshens up the game every time. There's 5 classes. Hunters, Guardians, Mages, Assassins and Warriors. Every class designed for a different role. ADC/Carry, Support, Mid, Jungle or Solo. However, it doesn't lock the classes to their designed roles. Usually you would want hunters for your carry and warriors for solo, but it doesn't say an assassin or guardian doesn't work for solo, or a mage for carry. It's all about your playstyle and how your team could work as a team and make the composition work. Every game is different for sure. There's alot of playmodes aswell. You have conquest, the standard """"Moba"""" map with 3 lanes, a jungle and alot of objectives. This is the most competative playmode, and also the one where professional play is involved with. Smite esport is amazing to look at, especially if you enjoy playing the game and want to see some really good teams playing against each other with different practiced tactics. Then you have the """"casual"""" gamemodes such as Arena, as the name states, you're basically just brawling out in a big circle with 3 different buffs on each side. Teamfights and kills are what this mode is for, but you have to watch the minions.Assault is also here, where everyone get assigned a random god, there's just 1 lane and you can't go back into base and buy items unless you die, which also puts your team in a disadvantage for some seconds until you return stronger to lane. However, being alive for too long puts YOU at a disadvantage. All random, all mid. This is also obviously the most unbalanced gamemode where your team can lose by just the gods you are assigned with. But hey, this is made for casual fun and playing gods you probably normally would, so why would you play assault if you're just going to complain? Then there's Clash. The """"Mix between arena and conquest"""" which is 2 lanes, a huge buff-monster in the middle and some sidejungle with a mana buff. Quite fun, but also just really a cluster of switching between lanes and outplaying the other team. The last """"casual only"""" gamemode is Siege, which also is two lanes, and has a big siege-monster in middle which is assigned to the team that gets the killing blow on it. This has alot of HP and brings down towers quickly. A quite fun gamemode where it's not 5v5 as most other gamemodes, but there's 4v4. There's also MOTD, or Match Of The Day to touch on, where balance is out and there is a new gamemode on rotation with different twists. Then you have the semi-competative gamemodes (with both Casual and Ranked involved) which is Joust and Duel. Duel is a ranked-only 1v1 gamemode where you ban out gods you don't want to play against, and it's only you to outplay the enemy. 1 lane with an objective to turn off the towers, and two buffs, mana and attack buff. It's all about outplaying.Joust is nearly the same, it's on the same map but it's 3v3. So you, alongside two allies plays against 3 others to see who comes out victorious. This game has so much to offer, tons of amazing skins, and a really great community, both on """"famous"""" Smite players on Twitch, Twitter and aswell with Reddit and some groups on Facebook. Honestly, just all around the best MOBA out there to me, atleast, because it is indeed a 3rd person WASD-movement based MOBA. This game has given me friends over the entire world and I even went from Norway to USA to live at some guys house for 2 weeks, all because of Smite. Thanks, Smite, for everything you've given, and this is definitely my all time favorite online PvP game."",1"
"6449,SMITE,2016.0,"" SMITE OverviewThis game is unlike any other MOBA games such as League of Legends and Dota 2. It has Third Person View, instead of the birds eye view you normally get with a typical MOBA game. The third person view is what initially made me want to try this game out.  I have put in over 300+ hours worth of gameplay and is one of  my favorite games i have played on PC so far.My friends believed that the game was just like another typical MOBA game but it is not! after my friends tried SMITE, we couldn't stop playing it.There are many different types of gods you can play as such as Guardian, Assassin, Warrior, Mage and Hunter. SMITE is Not a pay to win game, although you can buy additional in game currency [GEMS]. They are not needed unless you want to buy additional cosmetics that make your gods look better in certain aspects. Some times Hi-Rez releases events that are some times payed for with GEMS and some times which are free. the event enables you to either buy or work your way towards unlocking the specified unlockable, depending on the event.Hi-Rez continuously update SMITE which they bring out all new and exiting stuff such as Gods, Loading Frames, Voice Packs, BUG Fixes and Re-Works on characters. Hi-Rez also have just intoduced Recalling Skins. I haven't come across any exploites so far, hopefully it stays that way.I mainly play two game modes called Conquest and Joust. Conquest is a 5v5 game mode with 3 lanes a solo lane, a mid lane and a long lane and with jungles either sides. Joust is a 3v3 gamemode with one lane and one side of a jungle.There is a Competitive Ranked Play on SMITE but in order to access the ranked play, you must be level 30 and have mastered 18 gods for Conquest and 16 for Joust. the ranked play is much better than casual because its competitive. also you can also gain advantages by banning specified gods, in which you are unable to do so in casual. ProsThe Pros of SMITE are:+ Many gods to play as+ Competitive Play+ Great MOBA game+ Third Person View+ Continuously Updated+ Easy To Run+ Free To Play+ Not Pay To Win+ Many Events+ Cosmetic Items only+ Great Community+ Great Gameplay+ Great Graphics ConsThe Cons of SMITE are:- Sometimes get bad matchups in casual matchmaking- Not Easy To Level Up- Sometimes The Launcher Is A Bit Buggy ConclusionLastly i rate this game 10/10 and i recommend for people to try this game. The game overall is a brilliant game and i hope more people get involved with the game and to see more people enjoy it.  I hope this review helped, and developers keep up the good work."",1"
"6450,SMITE,2017.0,""Amazing game, my favourite actually!Easy to play Fun to play with other people and talk to create tactics :3  Game is good at getting same level players to play with ^.^Recommend highly :3  "",1"

"6452,SMITE,2015.0,""im a pro in this game better than dota and league of legends, but i gota say this game is so fun it should be the number one game on the market and i hope it doesnt get to strict like league of legends cuz like when you abandon games on league of legends they ban you for like 5 games and thats it. But smite doesnt do that. you see Riot games doesnt respect other people saying that meatwadsprite  (aka videogamedunkey) is toxic. Dunkey said something so bad to that player he even got banned on league of legends so he can play again on september 17, 2015. you know what im done playing league of legends. dunkey is done playing league of legends. so lets just all play smite the best moba game in the plublic marketing. league is so shity even nobody is not gona play the game. its so stupid now. I WOULD RECOMEND PLAYING SMITE GUYS!!!!! ITS BETTER THAN DOTA AND LEAGUE OF LEGENDS"",1"
"6453,SMITE,2017.0,""Smite is a really fun game and accessible MOBA even to the less experienced, due to the big playerbase in the casual gamemodes (Arena, Clash, Assault, Joust), but it also offers to the more experienced a great amount of variety with a huge amount of items and gods (the characters in this game). The meta is ever-shifting."",1"
"6454,SMITE,2015.0,""I used to love this game. I've spent like 100 of dollars on skins and played it like 24/7. Over the years, the community has really changed. It's changed to the point where this game isn't enjoyable anymore. There are so many gods and items it's hard to keep track of if you don't play this game all the time. Not worth it."",0"
"6455,SMITE,2016.0,""this game is fun but it sometimes takes a while to join a que. a lot of the gods are very strong there a some weaker gods in there so it makes it a little unbalanced. After all the game is very fun to play and differend from dota or lol, because it is third person. most of the community is good and it the game is easy to play."",1"
"6456,SMITE,2017.0,""I really wanted to like this game. But this game doesn't have a learning curve. It has a learning cliff... ...One hundred stories of jagged broken glass that slams you in the face the moment you install it and enter the first menu. You'll enjoy it from the moment you install and see the pretty graphics until you actually try to play it. At that point it's all downhill until you find the only other enjoyable part, uninstalling it.If you like reading more than playing, getting stomped by heckling high ranking opponents. Being one shotted by characters that mark you from across the map and then one-shot-kill you. Then this game is for you....The good: graphics. It's free. You can unlock all of the in-game content that affects the gameplay for free.The bad: Long wait times to play. No one using voice. No in-game explanation of the vast number character abilities, items, relics, and set up options. Several encyclopedias worth of information to read before you can play any character and actually win.Every character has access to a hundred items, each with multiple stats, passives, and auras. But if you want to know what works for one character and not another you have to sift through pages and pages of guides made by the community.Oh and by the way, there are three or four game modes and no one build works for all so be prepared to do that for every character, class, and game mode you want to play. Five classes. Almost 100 gods. Three primary game modes. A different build for each god in each game mode. You do the math.And to top that off - Plenty of high ranking players that like to build premades and pub stomp. Along with trolls who will drag out a conguest game forever and never actually attempt to finish it."",0"
"6457,SMITE,2018.0,""After a very long time of taking off from this game, I wanted to give it a shot again. The game REFUSES to run. Literally does nothing after playing PLAY in the launcher. I'm just to tired to try to fix it on my own. This game always had faulty client even BEFORE Steam release. I convinced all of my friends to forget about the client issue as each and every single one of them faced a different problem. Diagnosed all of them back then when the support team gave me the automated message. Right now, I feel too old and tired to fix it. I'll delete it before giving it a try. Such a shame."",0"
"6458,SMITE,2016.0,""This game is very fun, much like leauge of legends but in second person perspective, and I feel that it gives you a better control of the character since it isnt a point and click style movement in the same manner that the other game is. I would recommend this over league any day, good job!"",1"
"6459,SMITE,2016.0,""CASUAL GAMERS LISTEN UP! You can come play this, I promiseNow, why do I start that way? Because let's be honest, hardcore competitive gamers are already playing the games they want to play. Anyone NEW coming by this game, chances are, will be a casual gamer. And that's not a BAD thing. You can still be GOOD and have FUN without being super competitive. This community isn't very toxic. Especially compared to other MOBAs. You have 74 unique Gods an Goddesses to choose from. It isn't THAT hard to get into. It's a bit confusing AT FIRST, but you pick up on things quickly. Lots of videos on youtube you can look up and see whatever it is you don't know.I DEFINITELY say try this, even if you have had bad experiences with MOBAs or have never played one"
"6460,SMITE,2015.0,""Having tried a few other MOBA's, namely DOTA2, LoL, and HotS, I could never get into them. HotS I played the most of, probably due to my familiarity with the Blizzard Universe. Perhaps it was the camera view. Probably why I don't play RTS's anymore. SMITE has a 3rd person camera view that helped me a lot. To make another comparison, """"It looks a lot like World of Warcraft."""" So if you're someone who would love to jump into a MOBA, but are really used to a 3rd person camera view like in WoW, or Guild Wars 2, Or many other games, (Hell even God of War or Devil May Cry), then SMITE might be a good one to try. This review isn't meant to rate the game as I'm still considering myself a noob, but more or less an attempt to help someone who might be on the fence about trying it.:)"",1"
"6461,SMITE,2015.0,""This game made me quit DOTA and LoL. Third person view is amazing along with how clear and big the item menu is. And I love how the gods/goddess are from actual pantheons and not some made up concept. I'm taking greek mytholgy in class right now and this game is helping me lmao, reading the lores of gods and seeing how they perform in matches is breath-taking. 10/10 uninstall every moba in your library.."",1"
6462,SMITE,2017.0,Let's put it simple it's like any other moab in terms of what kind of players you'll get even if your really high in ranks.The gods have a wide varity and are still releasing more so you can expect the fun to keep running in this game.Just one thing I'll eat yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥if you main loki.,1
"6463,SMITE,2015.0,""SMITE is way better than LoL. (No offense to LoL community.) I think this game is just a little more fun for me than LoL anyways. If you are new then I would say play Arena or Joust. My favorite game mode is mainly Joust and I love the game so much ever since I found out about it. I Mainly love playing as Anubis (Go figure) and Neith <3 Anubis is pretty broken with how much damage he can dish out and I love it lol. I wanted to write this just to tell people how much fun the game is and how much I recommend this game. I think the main reason why I love it more is because of the third person angle camera it has and that is a deal breaker for me!I mainly play this on XBOX ONE (Please don't hurt me :c ) PC is better yes but I love playing this more on Console, but I think this game is lovable no matter what! It's a great game mainly to play with friends who you know won't let you down and die everytime they run out into the battlefield. Good luck and I hope this review helps anyone who wants to play this game."",1"
"6464,SMITE,2015.0,"" Intro! Hello! Some know me as Hell, some as Claptrap, but most know me through school, but this review is for all of you!I've been playing smite since Cupid release (about 2 and a half years ago). However, and unfortunate event happened and my account was stolen, so I made the account that I play on to this day. The company backing this game at that time refunded me my gems and limited skins, as well as deleting my old account. General Info!    Smite is a MOBA that pits you as one of many gods against other gods in modes with objectives such as (towers, pheonixes, titans, etc.) Also, all of the characters in game, are based on REAL MYTHOLOGY, such as the norse, egyptians, romans, greeks, and mayans. Smite is also third-person, which is what makes MOBA players from all over gather and play this mix of third-person and MOBA. My only tip for you is that this game will make you love it, and it'll also make you want to destroy it. No matter what, even when you tell yourself you're bad, stick with it. This game, unlike most others gets better over time. Recommendations!  GOD PACK <3Its a great deal, although I'd at least wait until you're level 30 and are positive that you'll completely want it. It is a worthy investment at any price. You get all the gods that are out, and those that'll come out, all for 30$ I got it when there were only around 25 gods I think? I've never looked back.I recommend downloading Curse Voice to chat with friends, and to meet new people! I'd also recommmend to start out in arena and learn the basics of each god. Theres also this neat feature inside the game called VGS, its basically call outs that you'd make in chat rooms such as: [VVGH] Hi! [VSAA] I'll attack! and so forth. My personal favorite god is Hel (look at my name), she is the goddess of the underworld! Each character, like other games has jokes, and taunts. One of her """"jokes"""" includes:(light side) """"I know! We should make cookies!""""(dark side) """"COOKIES!? WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH YOU!?Now of course, not every god talks about making cookies and beating the living """"hell"""" out of each other. But please. without further ado, go out, and slam your own cookies in the battleground of the god, we're all waiting for you!If you want to sign up for an account for the game, please use my refferal link below!

"6466,SMITE,2017.0,""After playing Smite for more than 1k hours since Mid season 2, would I recommend the game now? No. HELL NO. This community is toxic just like any other moba. Not only that but It's unbalanced, buggy, and gets boring after a while despite its adventures or updates. DOESN'T MATTER FOR ME. BORING. You know...It felt good clicking that uninstall button today.

"6469,SMITE,2017.0,""Used to love this game a lot but right now it feels like it's in beta again and has so for a while now. Game is money grabbing as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and makes me feel like I've downloaded a trojan. Gameplay lacks in many areas and there are bugs around every corner, so much so that characters are not as good as they should be simply because of bugs for very long times (EG The Morrigan). Would not recommend at the moment, likely in the future if things go the way they have.Disappointed really."",0"
"6470,SMITE,2018.0,""I have played this game long before these 8 hours on my record, way back when it used to be an actual game. Why do I mean by that ? This is not a video-game. It is a well-disguised ad to get you to pay for skins and rolls on chest that contain skins, their drops being based on RNG. It also just happens to have some 3d models and some maps.   First of all, this r e t a r d e d, money-drived software may actually fool you at first. It has a few good moments, when you win a match or two and especially when your team is made-up of the kindest, coolest people online. The emphasis here is on """"few"""". These rare moments are stuffed beneath a pile of dog  s h i t to such an extent that you might actually need a professional to dig it up. So far, nothing has taken-up the role of the said professional, in all my hundreds or maybe thousands of hours of playing. The balancing of the characters has been off for such a long time that I can't remember how a scale looks like. This experience-ruining feature has been the downfall of the game for years now.   Secondly, I'd like to talk a bit about money. Do you like money ? I do, you do, we all do, but what if I were to tell you that the SMITE likes money so much that it's basically asking you for your card details. Open up the game -> boom NEW SKIN, GET THE NEW SKIN ON ODISSEY, ONLY 600 GEMS AND YOU MIGHT ALSO BUY SOME OF OUR DISCOUNT SKINS THAT MIGHT JUST LEAVE YOU WITH ENOUGH MONEY IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT TO BUY A PRETZEL. Now, I'm not saying that it's constantly shoving ads don't your throat. What I AM saying is that the company has clearly lost focus. This isn't about their game, it's about making a lot of money in a short amount of time. They had something great in the beginning, but it has faded away.  In conclusion, I am grateful for the countless hours of fun Smite has borrowed me, but really, it took everything back as it grew older. If you want to hear everything from a youtuber that has been playing Smite since the game's birth, check a video called """"Smite - 4 years later"""" by MythyMoo . Do not install this abomination. Let it die, or learn how to actually be a game. Thank you for your time."",0"
"6471,SMITE,2016.0,""By far, the best Third Person MOBA (in my opinion) I have ever seen and played. I was introduced to this game when I first met my husband. He said that I might not like it because it's a MOBA, but then he mentioned the third person concept of it, and I was pretty much hyped from then on. Now I have over 100 hours, not including the time I have played it outside of steam. So glad that they put it on steam, however I just wish the achievements would work. That's my only problem with it."",1"
"6472,SMITE,2015.0,""What is a MOBA?Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas, or MOBAs for short, originated as a sub-genre of the RTS (Real-Time Strategy) genre. Because of this, in most MOBA games, the player takes control of a single character from the isometric (top-down) view akin to most RTS games. Typically, in MOBA games, a player takes control of a single character on one of two teams. Those players choose characters that all have their own abilities, or â€œkitsâ€. To win, the players must use a combination of abilities, teamwork, and strategy to not only best their opponent, but destroy the opponents main structures. A bonus to the genre is that most MOBAs are free games, which is definitely a contributing factor of the their massive success. The genre has many titles, the largest of which being Defense of the Ancients (DoTA) and DoTA 2, League of Legends (LoL), and most recently SMITE!What is SMITE?SMITE is one of the more recent free MOBA games to enter the fray. In SMITE you donâ€™t just choose a character, you choose a god. Youâ€™ll instantly feel an attachment to characters like Thor and Zeus because even if you donâ€™t know the lore behind them, youâ€™ve at least heard their names before! What makes SMITE so immersive is Hi-Rez Studiosâ€™ inclusion of historical lore into the godsâ€™ abilities, kits, and play styles. Thor and Loki arenâ€™t just characters from Marvel comics and movies. Theyâ€™re also a part of Norse mythology and you can take control of them in SMITE!What makes SMITE different?SMITE takes all of the strategy of the top MOBA games and adds another layer of difficulty by putting you into the action! Unlike most MOBA games, SMITE offers players the chance to experience the MOBA genre they know and love from a third-person perspective. This unique perspective allows for an extremely immersive experience unlike any other game in the genre. While this doesnâ€™t sound like such a big change, once you play it youâ€™ll understand! All of these things added together is what has gaming websites everywhere continually rating SMITE as one of the best MOBA games available!"",1"
"6473,SMITE,2018.0,""I have played a lot trough their actual launcher so disregard the few hours. In reality it would be a few hunderd hours from back when the game was newer and still going strong. I would not reccomend this, for one because they changed their server to cut costs. I'm not quite sure what exactly changed but all I know I have latency issues in this game when I had none before. Which could be explained by issues with my connection except for the fact that nothing changed on my part. I am still dissapointed about this decision by them, especially considering I bought the god pack and have bought various gem packs. To suddenly not being able to play the game properly is dissapointhing to say the least."",0"
"6474,SMITE,2017.0,""For the record, I played this game for at least 600 hours before the Steam Launch. The only reason I started playing was because I happened to get the AlienWare Ra skin right after Beta had ended. I didn't expect much from this game at first, but since it is a MOBA and the only other MOBA I've played was Dead Island Epidemic, I wanted to try it. I don't regret my decision at all. I love this game so much and I will never stop playing it. I usually never put money towards any free game, but this was the first exception, and I definatly got my money's worth. The only cons I see for this game are the same ones that are present in any multiplayer game: Bad/Salty players, and people that complain about the cost of things because Mommy's credit card can't handle it anymore.

"6479,SMITE,2015.0,""I usually play more MMORPGs, FPS or RTS games. That said i personally have better map awareness with map in the top right side VS the bottom of screen like all other MOBAs (ex LoL). The auto ability lvl feature is helpfull but not necessary. When learning a new champ/god it helps to put your abilities levels in order prior to a match & they stay there till you either uncheck the auto ability lvling just b4 a match, change them or get rid of them. Unlike other MOBAs Smite keeps ur pots seperate from your items so you can get that extra item or 2 if you were ever the type to keep them (dont know why but there are ppl like that out there). Also from what I've seen in other MOBAs Smite has more varity in match types (7 types atm). Just like any other MOBA its all about the """"Objectives."""" If your not a team player or care more about your kill count then this is not the game for you. Only negative ive seen in playing this game are the few times when fellow team mates or the other team completely left their more squishy team mates alone an vunerable from the start.Still loving it & still cant beat the community."",1"

The game is easy to get into, and provides video tutorials in the game to anyone who is new to the game and even has a youtube channel that has the tutorial videos there as well if you are looking for further guidance. The game has constant balancing updates and the community is generally good, but can be pretty toxic.

Cant wait to see console players bullied in chat! YESS!!! But in all seriousness this game went from pretty decent to pretty bad. But hey atleast Zhong kui got a skin since season 2!

"6483,SMITE,2016.0,""I probably sound like a hipster but i was first exposed to MOBAs during the time where DOTA was a mod for warcraft. Really had a blast playing those with friends during highschool. However i stopped playing since i was entering college. and that time Hon and LoL were popping out and bringing MOBAs to a whole new level.however what kept me from playing MOBAs again was the community. mostly toxic and it just doesnt seem fun.When a team loses, the blame game happens and alot of frustration. when a team wins there's still blaming (just basing on observation since my younger brother is heavily into LoL)Recently however my special someone convinced me to try out SMITE and check it out. at first i was hesitant but since it was a game we can play together i gave in and played. Best decision ever! the first few times i was mostly messing up. i was expecting abit of flack but to my surprise teamates were very supportive. heck they even said it was alright even though i made a wrong god position pic(that time i only know how to use neith). Win or lose everyone was congratulating each other for a good game. Though occasionally i encounter the bad apples but theyre far off in between and it rarely happens. i guess it boils down to an awesome community making the game fun for everyone. and i always try to pay it forward and make everyones experience fun"",1"
"6484,SMITE,2015.0,""Gotta say. For a MOBA, this game is quite nice. Could never really get into MOBA's until I played this. Don't have much time logged in on this version yet but have put at least 9 days of playtime into the Xbox One version. It's a very addicting game and has well written lore on the different Gods/Characters from the many different Pantheons. Has very simple controls and can be played with various gamepads/controllers that make them even simpler. Also, the in-game tutorials are very detailed and helpful for those who are new to the game. Another thing I like about this game is that, although you can use microtransactions to purchase characters/skins/VP/etc. You can also still earn the two different types of in-game currency simply by playing the game. Allowing you to still purchase most of the forementioned things above. All in all it's a very fun and addictive game to play alone or with friends."",1"
"6485,SMITE,2018.0,""The design team doesn't really understand MOBA balance at all, the community is full of angry little boys who live to make each other and everyone else miserable, and literally every single update breaks large portions of the game and requires at least three more bugfix patches."",0"
"6486,SMITE,2015.0,""It's a Good MOBA sticking out of the rest because of being in 3rd Person, Having their Playable Characters being Gods and actually responding to their Community.The Differences Between the 3 other Big MOBA's are the following:-Does not have Shared Experience with the Team.-Does have Item's and In-Game Gold.-Does not have Destructive Terrain-Does have a Classic Jungle-Does have a growing Competitive Scene.9/10Overall a pretty nice MOBA that moves in the right direction, even though it might not be something for everyone it has a pretty good Community in comparison to other's(looking at you,LoL)."",1"
"6487,SMITE,2018.0,""Smite has deteroriated into a quick cash grab by Hirez and their RNG chests. Thei attempts at keeping their MOBA alive is to release broken gods and uninsipiring game modes. If the game wasn't free (you pretty much have to buy the god pack if u want to play ranked which is a crisp $30 btw), I probably wouldn't play the game. I wouldn't recommend this game to my worst enemy.Edit: Newest Update is a complete disaster with priority que timers and awful rebalancing. Very sad!"",0"
6488,SMITE,2018.0,This game is a hot steaming pile of garbage. I would know. I've put 800 hours into this game. Every time I load up this game every last drop if joy is ripped from the deepest depths of my soul. every second spent in this game is less time you could spend doing anything else. You could spend time with your family. You could go out and make friends. You could find more joy in ripping off your toe nails and putting them in your pb&j than in this game. Every update brings new despair to my life as it spirals into etenal torment that all began when I hit the downlaod button. Don't make the same mistakes I have. Be better than i was. DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!,0
6489,SMITE,2018.0,Custom Games no longer work anymore since last update and the new party system is bugged so can be really difficult playing with friends. Idc if you introduce skins for money just let us be able to play...,0
"6490,SMITE,,""you play this game just casually SMITE is a fun game. A moba that isn't top down. However if you want to play it competitively you'll get frustrated, a lot.  Most of the playerbase don't actually play the 5v5 moba mode but the casual modes such as tdm 5v5 (Arena) and 3v3 (joust). So the matchmaking isn't as good as it can be because SMITE has like 15 gamemodes (exaggerating here but you get the point) and no one actually plays SMITE for the 5v5 moba mode (conquest). You either get the same players every game or some players in a game they shouldn't belong in (multiple times a bronze has been in a diamond/masters game, this happens regularly). Hi-Rez, the company behind SMITE, knows that the playerbase is a majority of casual players so they also try to balance the game around that. Making gods easier to play or nerfing/buffing according to winrates in casual modes. Hence they dumb down the gameplay PS: I've got like 1.5k to 2k hours in this game. Just recently downloaded the game through Steam. Have played it before on the SMITE client."",0"
6491,SMITE,,is going downhill with much of the broken features and bugs getting worse and worse as well as worse design decisions such as the new UI. Once was a good game but likely not worth investing into anymore.,0
"6492,SMITE,2018.0,""Okay, as the player who has 1500+hrs with all accounts and non steam i can say that right now the game looks ugly. When i came to the game after two months break i expected cool features etc. But you made an update for UI which looks ugly af. Smite was an original game in my opinion and now it looks like paladins or smth.Put the old UI back or i quit this game forever lol. "",0"
"6493,SMITE,2017.0,""Played since beta and am diamond 5 to diamond 2 in ranked conquest since season 2.  Therefor this review is biased from a ranked players perspective.HIGH SKILL CAPIf you're looking to dedicate alot of time and crush other players then this game has that to offer.  Skilled players are rewarded and it feels good outplaying the opposing team.  Mechanically gifted players will definately thrive here.  The macro game is important, but ultimately when both teams are tied, the team with the best mechanical skill will usually come out on top.COMMUNITYIt's a moba.  You know what to expect from other players.  Other than the usual f*ckboys and trolls that litter all mobas. the community is pretty great.  Smite playerbase is small compared to in competitors so you'll occasionally queue into the same people if you play enough.  HiRez is also very strict with behavior in games, you will be banned if you consistenly get reported, afk, harass, or just overall f*ckboyness.GODS (heroes)There are currently around 80+ gods available for purchase right now.

"6494,SMITE,2016.0,""What could've possibly been the greatest online game of the decade is being actively ruined by a company that both has no idea what they're doing, and doesn't give aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥anymore.I want to recommend this game to you. It's one of my all-time favorites, I've met countless friends and competing in SMITE has genuinely made me develop as a person and shaped me into who I am today.

"6495,SMITE,2016.0,""After playing League of Legends for more than 2000 hours,i can say that this relatively new MOBA(i've played SMITE in Open Beta too) is the best out there so far.The combination between Third Person Shooter and MOBA is delicious,the large variety of gamemodes is unique(there is one new gamemode daily) and the devs are serious,responsive and good event makers.Download this game right now and start playing because you won't regret it! :D"",1"
"6496,SMITE,2018.0,""Ever since the new home screen changes, and the layout, I would not recommend this game to a friend.  HiRez Studios has really ruined this game over the last 6 months of 2018 with radical changes to the appearance of the game.  Xmas Gem sales used to be 50% off, now its only 35% off at a time the game is at its least popular.  Something has changed in the management of this game, and it's dramatically affected the game quality."",0"
"6497,SMITE,2018.0,""I wish I could give this game the praise it deserves. I really do. Comparitively to other MOBA's, the playstyle is different, third person rather than top down. This in my opinion is what made this great for me in the beginning. The camera angle istelf proves to hold a much faster game and encourages a much more aggressive playstyle. This is what made this game different from the rest and in my opinion better. But the other problems with the game much overshadow the potential it could have in the right hands. Developers of the game have been pushing for monetary decisions rather than gameplay decisions, leading to less effort put into the game overall. Matchmaking is horrid, Servers are terrible, Balancing is too much or too little. The game is dead and dying. I wish I could recommend this to anyone and everyone, but alas, I can't. Even through the time I have played this game, and I've played quite a bit, there have been very few instances where I felt that this game was better than any another."",0"
"6498,SMITE,,""for a while.Since closed beta, actually. Clocked roughly 1000 hours before playing on steam. And The first few hundred hours were really fun. However the game in its current state isn't very comparable to what it was back then.At its core, it's a fun game. Great mechanics, perfect idea for characters,.. Sadly, it's in the wrong hands. Hi-Rez went heavy on the cosmetics element. After 6+ years of development they are still unable to release even a single patch that isn't in need of some serious hotfixing afterwards. When bugs do get reported, it can take another year before they get fixed (saw one take nearly a year and a half to get fixed). If you intend to collect skins and whatnot and don't care about past content, so you just want to collect everything new from the point you start playing... Then be prepared to spend $175 a year, 'cause that's the price you'll pay nowadays just to make sure you've got all the limited items released in that year.So yeah, if somehow you absolutely don't care about any of that, or matchmaking, or a rude playerbase,... Then sure, I could recommend it. Around 100 mythological beings to have fun with. But if you're concerned about any of the previously mentioned issues, or you're only getting in hoping it'll get better... Give it a pass, and a hard one at that. It's getting worse as the years progress."",0"
"6499,SMITE,2015.0,""This review is for those who are already familiar with MOBAs and have played Dota 2 or League of Legends. I will point out what makes Smite unique compared to those games.- Third person camera perspective. Unlike the classics, Smite does not feature a strategic top down perspective and puts you right in the action behind your character. This allows for much more precise movements and sneaking up to somebody doesn't necessarily require a cloaking ability. - (almost) Every ability in the game has to be aimed, including melee and ranged basic attacks! That's right, if you want to play the Ad Carry in Smite, prepare yourself to be completely useless if you can't land your basic attacks. Same goes for everything else: If you can't hit your abilities reliably, you will not succeed, there are precious few abilities in the game that do not need to be aimed. From the other perspective, this mechanic allows you to minimize your damage intake by being a slippery snake and wiggle your way out of tight situations. Many times I was one hit away from death, but moving in circles and triangles and wavy lines and other sorts of unpredictable movements, I survived. - Playable Characters (Heroes, Champions) in Smite are real Gods from pantheons that were once (and some still are) worshipped. Norse, Roman, Mayan, Hindu, Chinese, Greek. Play as Zeus, Thor, Odin, Loki and many other gods and mythical creatures. HiRez Studios does a (mostly) great job at interpretating these well known deities into detailed playable Characters. And for those Deities you don't know, there is always a lore section for every god, so you even learn something about different cultures while you play. Yay, Knowledge!- 5 different game modes + one that changes every day. Unlike its competitors, Smite features many different game modes aside from the classical 5vs5 (Here called Conquest). Arena (5vs5, no lanes, Team Deathmatch), Siege (4vs4, Two lanes, small jungle), Joust (3vs3, 1 lane, small jungle), Assault (5vs5, All Random All Mid, 1 lane). The Mode of the Day changes every day and features fun setups (like 5vs5 on the Assault map and everyone get's the same god).All of these game modes have their own, detailed and well crafted Map. In Conquest Mount Olympus opposes a vulcano, in Arena you fight in a grand Colloseum, in Assault you defend the Halls of Asgard from the forces of Chaos, in Siege you fight for supremecy in the lush Mayan rainforests and in Joust you're a knight for some reason (It will be changed to a Chinese themed map soon). In addition to that, Smite features one of the best deals in a Free to Play game: The God Pack. The God Pack costs 30$ and contains every god currently in the game. Owners of the God Pack also receive the newest God as soon as they're released. FOREVER. That means, the more Gods join the battle of Smite, the more value you get for your 30$. You do the math. Why should you play Smite over League or Dota? If you love mythology and you like the concept of MOBAs, but never liked the top down perspective and ferocious clicking of the traditional ones, Smite will be the game for you. It's highly skill-based with a very high skill ceiling and many new challenges and skills to master that traditional MOBAs do not have. I played League of Legends for 4 years, but after I got Athritis (This is a joke) from playing ADC and kiting for too long, I gave up. For me, Smite is so much more comfortable to play and the fact that I can escape my death and make great plays simply by evading and aiming my abilities carefully really drives me forward in a way traditional MOBAs never did. I will not end this review without pointing out things that bug me about Smite, I am not delusional:Many Skins in Smite are locked behind Chests, which you have to buy with real money currency and by opening them, you only have a certain chance to get the skin you want. It can be infuriating when a cool new Skin for your favourite God is announced, only to later find out it's in a Chest with 56 other items. HiRez abuses this a bit too much. Though we have the God Pack, so that balances it out.EU Servers can be very unreliable. Quality Control at HiRez is either non-existent or very bad. Some new Gods release in a pitiful state, either balance or design-wise. They have horrid animations, amateur-like voice acting and are either drastically underpowered or overpowered. Some God Designs are also very questionable. Sometimes they have ability kits that have nothing to do with their Lore, or in general are designed in such a way that they make no sense. Did you know the Spartans put the statues of Ares, the God of War, in chains to restrain him? Yeah, that's cool, but only a small footnote in his lore. Well, what HiRez did was base his whole ingame design on that little fact. He shoots chains and fire and runs around in plate armor with broadsword and shield. The shield has a demonic visage on it, where the fire comes out. Does that sound like the Greek God of War to you? Not to me. But these things are minor and ultimately do not take away much from my experience. I've been playing this game for more than a year, and only looking forward. It's free in the end, so why not try it out and look for yourself? "",1"
"6500,SMITE,2015.0,""Let's start by saying that I have way more then 22 hours of this game played. its more like just shy of 700 hours and, that I ABSOLUTLY HATE traditional MOBA's such as League of Legends, and  Dota. But smite is not traditional. Smite offers a unique 3rd-person view with easy movment controls of the WASD rather then the tedious spam clicking. The perspective of the game allows many people to sit down and feel much more confortable and allows for a quicker grasp of the game, and also puts more on timing and skill into the game.The only complaint that I have on the game is that no matter what mode I play, I always get put on a team of monkeys who would be better teammates if they where smashing their faces into the keyboard. Just saying!"",1"
"6501,SMITE,2018.0,""SMITE is a game with some nice character design and a unique perspective for a MOBA, and literally no other redeeming qualities. Everything bad will be bad forever. Their sense of balance is a trainwreck centered around Conquest (the basic MOBA mode, equivalent to Summoner's Rift in League of Legends) with zero regard for the two concievably-fun modes, or any others, though plenty of characters are unabashedly overpowered or horrible on Conquest, as well. Again, this will never change, unless it's for the worse.There is a continuous attempt to convince players to spend money on the game, with many of the cosmetics vanishing forever, often the ones requiring a massive toll of both time and money. Many more skins can only be obtained through chests, rather than bought directly, to extort more money from gambling addicts.HiRez should definitely hire an actual programmer at some point. Every single patch is a storm of broken UI functionality, disconnects from the server, and outright crashing.HiRez hates fun. They firmly segregate character classes, with magical and physical being the main division, and barring the one passive item, no one of these types is allowed to deal the other type. They also acknowledge, if anything at all from the community, the absolute worst suggestions made by the worst people, which brings me to my next point.The community is despicable. You haven't known hatred until you've experienced a Nox main on Arena. It may seem childish to wish someone actual real-life harm over a video game, but if any force on Earth can cause that to happen, it's SMITE. And Arena is an actually fun mode, despite having minions be too valuable. Conquest players hate you for not playing exactly how they want, and also hate you because they are terrible about the game they are yelling at you over. They only know one thing, and that is that they hate you, personally, and wish you the worst life has to offer, including being trapped in a game with them. Surrender is theoretically possible at 10 minutes (not early enough, but better than League's 20), but almost never passes.The matchmaking is analogous to a war crime. It appears to take the average ELOs of two handfuls of people, which means that, despite the asymmetrical reasoning this creates, you, specifically, get a team of people far below your skill level and must defeat a team only slightly below your skill level, which means you 1v5 against fed players.Of course, the company may have committed actual crimes, because employee reviews have painted its CEO to be a despicable, arrogant, 1% representative manchild who insists that balance is whatever he does well with.Play SMITE if you want to poison your soul so deeply that you feel contempt and betrayal even looking at a MOBA or a book on religion. Otherwise, try literally any other game, but still not League as it may actually be worse. "",0"

When i first got the game i was matched with other players that had put 1000 hours into the game. But on the bright side, the game is truly free to play. They're no pay to win aspects at all. You only have to pay for cosmetics like skins and ward skins. There is a diverse selection of gods to pick from so its garunteed to have a god that suits your play style.

"6511,SMITE,2016.0,""probably greatest online multiplayer arena ever. The setting (playing as a deity, god) may be questionable, acquired taste or a weakness for the antics, but honestly that really doesn't matter much.what does: No grinding, no leveling needed. Jump in and go. 15..60min for a single match depending on game mode and teams. Levels are used for matchmaking purposes only (or a status symbol). Skills still matter a lot - knowledge of your own """"god"""" and opponents, field control, team work, etc.  Matchmaking is working fine. As a lone beginner you won't be thrown in arena against a pack of teamed up old wolves. Amount of active players is huge. Each battle is started at """"zero"""". All equal - same money, same items to earn in a fair fight every single time. You can't take anything over to the next fight - except fighting spirit, your experience and a great team if any. Item choices are large enough. You may specialize in speed, critical chance, damage, health, defense, regeneration, mana... you name it. Thats on top of your basic skills and character preset. I would recommend starting with something that supports your own personal playing style. Two players may play the same god (opponent team) but most likely will do that more or less differently. Find your own style. Items are meant for action but probably even more - reaction (to the choices of opponents). It does work. Team work. At some point you will notice what a great difference it does. You stun, your mate does area damage and someone finishes the runners, or all ultimate attacks at once on a whole enemy team, or... there are a lot of choices to be made and profit in a team. Rude teammates are more like an exclusion. At the start there will be too few to worry about in a random match. At higher levels/competitiveness they will be your own regular teammates more often than not. No paid freemium bonuses - you may buy all gods or additional skins anytime, but you can also quite easily earn any of that for free within just a few hours or just by daily login. To earn all would take quite some time of course but all gods are also on a weekly rotation for a free play and I doubt you will play or even like all of them. I have started Smite 3 years ago in open beta, paid some 20 EUR because I loved the concept and the work done by this team and still get all the new gods for free.whats not to like? Probably some gods or skins won't be your favorite ones but with the 75 gods (different playable characters) out there at the moment I doubt you gonna miss some of them due to your own preferences.enjoy fair gaming."",1"
"6512,SMITE,2016.0,""It is fun at the start but once you get to a high lvl then the game dumps crap on you, so it gets annoying at times but still can be fun at other times.Bad teams are like the most annoying thing then you get the little nugget who says that they are better at the game then you even if they did so much worse then you."",1"
"6513,SMITE,2015.0,""I know my steam play time is low but I've been playing this game for a solid amount of time before this released here and I love it so much. This is from someone who hated MOBAs and everything about them but I was a bit curious and thought that Smite seemed like a good entry point and since then this has been the only game I consistently play. The gods are all so cool and the mythology adds a fun layer with the characters plus actually seeing the skins you have on your god is pretty great. The motd is a fun addition because it spices things up a little if you don't want to play a traditional game mode, which Smite has a solid amount of. The daily log in bonus is great because I haven't spent a penny on this game and I have a bunch of gods and skins and ward skins and icons. If you're someone who doesn't like MOBAs I would suggest you give this one a try because it might just click for you. That all being said, it seems the steam version might be a bit iffy right now so you may want to wait and download it from Hi Rez, either way, I hope you play this game."",1"
"6514,SMITE,2015.0,""I've tried LoL, DOTA and a few other MOBA's, but I just couldn't get into the isometric click-fest. After having played the beta I gave SMITE another shot when it launched 1,5 years ago and I never looked back. More than a 1000 hrs later I'm still playing every single day.It will take you some time and practice to get used to it all, but It's more accessible compared to other MOBA's due to it having less items and being able to turn on auto-buy/level. Positioning is a big part of being successful as well as aiming, timing, communication and synergy making it hard to master.  The game is based on mythology from 7 different pantheons and the 69 gods (at the time of writing) all have lore related directed taunts, which adds a lot of humour to the mix. 5 different classes, 8 game-modes on 5 different maps offer something to enjoy for everyone.Regular updates and patches keep the game fresh. With plenty of """"free gems"""" events and sales you won't need to spend tonnes of cash on cosmetics if you don't want to. (I have accumulated 1000s of gems and free stuff in my playtime) Being the 3rd Biggest MOBA with 2nd largest tournament prizepools in e-sports history I think I can safely say Hi-Rez finally hit the right spot with this game. The only negative things I can think of are that on a rare occasion the servers lag and sometimes matchmaking can be a bit wonky, which isn't too big of a deal if you don't play ranked leagues. As with any online game you get a few toxic players every now and then, but they can easily be muted or ignored and more often than not you will find nice and reasonable folk in your matches. Furthermore I can reccommend playing/queueing with friends. Once you get used to the 3rd person and aiming, turn off auto-buy/level and use sites like Tiermonster.com for item builds. The bots in co-op game-modes are horribly bad, get into PvP as soon as possible. Read some guides and watch streams to improve your game. If you enjoy the game get """"the ultimate god pack"""" (unlocks all gods+future gods) it's the best deal in moba games. [VVGL] Good Luck[VVGF] Have fun!9/10 would kappa again."",1"

I've even watched a lot of videos about LoL and still think those are annoying, slowish, boring games.Smite is not only a change of perspective, it's rather a new take to it. More action, faster, funny humour and interesting, real mythology-lore. What's funnier than this?Gameplay-wise, Smite feels really cool. Different characters bring on a new gameplay, and they're working a lot on providing a bit of variety in the builds.The first matches you'll get into will almost surely be a nightmare: no coordination, people continously d/cing, trolls, dramas... but as you go up and play, it will get better. COmmunity isn't THE TOP, and there toxic players and all that shiZZ, but still you'll find a lot of funny people.Pretty balanced overall, and a cash system that I really like: skins are cool and you WANT to have them, and they give you a lot of ways to get them, even with some patience. I do recommend the God Pack although, 'cause you can find YOUR god easier, and have more fun that way.All in all, I'm playing this since... a lot. Really a lot, even while in open beta, and I'm still returning to it, started god-guides on my channel and I'm enjoying it, with friends for the most. Still, if you're up to it, you can enjoy it also alone, but just one thing:in Assault you make a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing jump-fest before starting the battle.

"6520,SMITE,2016.0,""Ignore playtime, I have played much more outside Steam version.Brings MOBA Games to third person. This makes the game much more enjoyable to me, as I really don't fancy playing from the sky.Smite also uses WASD (Or equivalent) to control your character, so I feel like I actually control the character, unlike in LoL or DotA where I feel like just commanding the character.  Abilities are located in numbers, so it feels pretty natural to use them.Smite also offers different gamemodes than the 3 lane pushing. It has few more casual modes, such as Arena, which are fun to play and to test characters, as the games are faster, and shorter. Game also has few other gamemodes, but I won't go into them anymore.Overall, Smite is MOBA, Easier to start due to controls, I think.It offers good deal for unlocking all characters( Future updates too) for 23,99â‚¬ which is really good price if you don't want to grind to unlock. Game also has skins, some can be bough with in-game credits, some need real money, which is pretty usual in today's MOBA games. "",1"

"6527,SMITE,2017.0,""Smite is really a mixed bag for me.I stopped playing League a couple of years ago for a lot of the same reasons that other people did. The fun in the game had long been sucked dry by people who throw hissy fits if they don't get the most kills or if they're paired with people who are still trying to learn the game. I was never that great at the game, and found that I really wasn't able to improve when no one wanted to play with a noob. And with that, I left. When I heard about Smite in early 2015 from Jontron, I was eager to give mobas a second chance. I loved playing the game and found myself a welcome member of the community. As much as I loved the game, I stopped playing for awhile, only picking up the game back up on Steam in the summer of 2017.After getting used to the game again, I started playing PvP again. Holyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ how things had changed. It really felt like I was playing League again with all of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing. At least once a day out of all the games I play, I'll see newer players bullied out of games. In my opinion, it's a community's responsibility to encourage its members to improve, instead of just calling them noobs and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all over them. Smite is an amazing game. But I think anyone who isn't contributing to the toxicity can agree that the community has isolated itself from new players, and finding the enjoyment that the game once offered is becoming increasingly difficultAlso, holy â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, someone fix Susano, please."",0"

"6532,SMITE,2017.0,""http://smite.guru/profile/pc/SugoiSenpaiWolfSmite account up there, with my actual hours played, have only recently moved to Steam's Smite.At currently 1050 hours in this game, and still counting, I can say this is a very fun game, it has lots of characters, game mode variety and what differentiates it from other mobas, a third-person perspective.So it's a good game, right? Well.. It really is, in my opinion the best moba I've played.. As long as you're not trying to go into the deep, dark corners of what this game has to offer, in which case I won't recommend playing Smite.The game itself is very good, offering a wide variety of forms of entertainment for the player.One could argue locking certain skills behind a paywall is not a good thing to do, but let's remember skins are not what's crucial in a moba. What is crucial in a moba is a decent community, which since Smite's release on Steam, the game is lacking.Not counting the joke of an attempt to balance characters and items, Smite's toxic community is its great downfall.Steam's player base, flooding Smite since it's release on this platform is, in my opinion the factor that genuinely  ruined the game.You'll be forever stuck playing with either bad-mouthing or poorly performing teammates, this meaning that you'll have to use the most over powered character if you'd want the slighest chance to win a game, which is not a fun experience for neither you or the players you'll be fighting againstSmite's Ranked Games are unplayable unless you team up with people you know are performing well and/or respecting others as individuals, not feeling the  urge to use bad manners.Smite was fun.

"6537,SMITE,2018.0,""Oh boy, here we goI started playing SMITE during the Pre-Season, but the majority of my gameplay runs from Season 1, slowing down around Season 3. If I recall correctly, SMITE came to steam around Season 3, so my hours don't exactly show how much time I put into this game, but I digress. I used to really like SMITE, I don't want to turn this whole review into a nostalgia trip, but I do want to talk about some reasons why I thought this game was great, and what changed, making the game what it is now.When I started playing, so many things were different than today, and that's a good thing. Games should change, but I think Hi-Rez took this game in one direction, where the things I enjoyed were left behind on the other path. The Joust map changes really hurt. I played mostly Joust because I played with two friends, rarely four other people were around at the same time to play Conquest. When they changed the Joust map, we all kind of stopped playing. It's sad to say that release Bellona or release Ah Puch didn't bother me as much as the direction that the developers took their game in, releasing things like K-Pop Bastet, and that disgusting Skadi skin later on that thankfully I wasn't there to look at. The game lost it's charm, not mechanically, but communally. They decided to go down not just a path of cringey asthetic design, but also a path of boring game design. Removing Golden Bow ruined the fun of Mercury, building all crit and being able to clear a wave with your 1 was fun. Removing the original acorns ruined the fun of Ratatoskr, giving him  4  2 cool paths to take the character each game, making each game feel less one dimensional. I don't want to write a giant review and cry like a child the entire time, I'm sure the game is fun for some people now, but I feel that Hi-Rez pushed a game design choice that to me feels like a flaw. Also why hasn't Zhong Kui gotten a skin since Summer 2015?If I could turn back time to play through Seasons 1 and 2 again, I would. I'm sure that my opinion has changed just due to aging and the development of a taste, that SMITE is no longer a part of, but I wouldn't play the game in the state today. There were too many strange choices made by the team working on this game that left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Maybe new players will have fun with the game because they didn't get to experience any of the old, but Version 3.11 will always be the final nail in the coffin of SMITE for me. It's sad, because I see new patch notes, and I think about what the game would be if some changes were avoided. I guess only Gods know what could have been."",0"
"6538,SMITE,2017.0,""One of the most toxic player bases in the MOBA genre and that's with games like LoL and Dota with people telling others to kill themselves every game. However those games have the advantage of being good. Kudos to smite for having varied game modes. and the third person perspective really changes up the formular. The game is serviceable - if you're willing to ignore the games glairing fault. Its community. Today for example I played 7 games throughout the day.2 of which I was told to kill myself.1 had someone allude to my sexuality being less than favourableand 2 other games devolved into petty name calling and sh*tposting rather than playing the game. The vast majority of players will throw games if you dont let them win their way.In a world where other, better, studios are taking big steps to fix their community. Hi Rez seem far more occupied with making questionably infringent copies of other games whilst not taking the time to help the community grow healthly. Before you ask. Yes these people were reported. No nothing happened. Good times were had with this game. But playing this with other people makes me concerned for my own sanity. Thus making it impossible to recommend this game to anyone. I had to warn a friend who was starting to be careful of people probably telling her to kill herself if she didn't play 'the right way'. She stopped playing soon after when I was proven right within mere moments of the warning.Gameplay - 6/10Game itself -2/10"",0"
"6539,SMITE,2018.0,""Since this is one of those reviews that show the complaints of a player who has spent infinite hours on said game reviewed, I must justify my intentions.The reason I criticize SMITE its because of its company, Hi-Rez, which I think has peaked its maximum level of disrespect for the community and greediness in their marketing. What hereby I'm going to give, is a definitive sentence on every game made by Hi-Rez, a silent agreement by many people on Reddit, Hi-Rez forums and critics alike: that the marketing has ruined what had once potential for being a solid game.Why now? Cause we confirmed suspicions about Hi-Rez thrice: with the bandwagoning of hot trends through the creation of Paladins Battlegrounds, Realm Royale and, of course, Medusa's (Smite's) Deathmatch.Smite, like every game of Hi-Rez, has always been a cheap (theoretically speaking) alternative to far more successful MOBAs, like League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm and Dota 2, even taking some of its designs with clever changes like Chernabog off Varus and Artemis off Windrunner.But the fact Hi-Rez has been inspired by its rivals is not the real problem. The problem is how Smite feels when played.Which translates to pureâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥I will list the problems in the format of problem/reaction to highlight the attitude Hi-Rez has shown to its fanbaseProblem: Smite has always been plagued with too many bugs by a MOBA standard, more to the likes of a closed beta despite supposedly being a full game, with crashes, packet losses, FPS drops, client crashes, RAM overheatings and every variety of visual bug, especially on featured gamemodes, often followed by afk penalties despite being innocent.Reaction: Everything has been shrugged off, silently blamed it to the ones suffering and the problem persists since releaseProblem: The toxicity of the community, and you have my word, I play both LoL and DOTA 2 a lot, overwhelms the one of the two colossi put together, with afk at the fountain, intentional feeding, voice command spam, chilling toxicity with death threats and heavy insults. This is amplified to ridiculous levels when playing Conquest, apparently the Vietnam War due to the treatment to newcomers, which causes a vicious cycle of people not learning due to toxics and toxics insulting """"noobs"""" because of people not being allowed to learn. Not to mention the hilarious (being sarcastic here) matchmaking that has yet to find a fix on any rank. Bronzes with Masters is a common antic by Hi-Rez.Reaction: Hi-Rez ignored these claims, never updated their report system, which is useless, unclear and non-functioning and many members in the forum have shown no empathy in the various forums. As such you can be as toxic as you want because you will never be retaliated against. This is a thing that is also abused through voice chats, which, should you be this stupid to play this game, I suggest to deactivate it in the option forever.Aside from those two problems, there are also intricate ones, like balance and marketing system.There is not an agreement about what criteria Smite uses to balance their game"

"6542,SMITE,2015.0,""Smite is a 3rd person MOBA drawing gods from various mythologies as playable characters. If you saw the word """"MOBA"""" and immediately rolled your eyes, you probably shouldn't have, as this game is essentially the best MOBA for people who don't usually like MOBA's. The third person perspective makes the game feel more at home to people who play action games, and also make the game far more skill based as there are very few abilities in the game that aim themselves for you. In fact if you don't like the MOBA stuff at all you can easily play arena and be more or less rid of the typical MOBA gameplay, instead playing a sort of fast paced RPG Team Deathmatch. The third person perspective actually changes the gameplay cataclysmically, and if you've played DOTA or League of Legends before and you didn't like it, this one is definitely worth a shot. Characters are based on real gods or other various figures from Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Norse, Chinese, Mayan and Hindu pantheons, from universally known gods like Zeus to Ah Muzen Cab, the bee guy nobody cares about. The game's premium currency system is extremely fair, with all gods being bought by in-game currency with the option to use premium currency to unlock them immediately, as well as the option to use the premium currency on purely aesthetic skins, voice packs, ward skins, and icons. The game is updated very frequently, averaging out to around one brand new god added every month along with balance changes, new skins, etc. Overall amazing game, I've played hundreds of hours outside of steam and I'm looking forward to a thousand more on the steam version."",1"
"6543,SMITE,2018.0,""This game is continuesly compared to League of Legends and Dota 2, and for good reason.

"6547,SMITE,2018.0,""ive been playing this game since the end of season one. got enough time in to have uninstalled 30 plus times to the amount of anger and bs this game causes. i had once loved this game so much i spent my last two years of highschool coming home and playing it till i went to bed. years gone by and what had been a fun game before became the most toxic moba ive ever played. this game used to have a fun and nice fanbase but everybody got so hellbent on talking tash and playing the broken team comp and act like didnt have to try against you and insult you. secondly, balance in this game is out the window. so out of balance they took the god of balance, nerfed her and made her terrible compared to her counterparts. then they take the most op type of class and buffed their items and thought that was ok. then they went ahead and nerfed all the items for the tanks and said they were too tanky when they actually needed better tank items. now if you are playing a tank and you see a hunter you might as well quit the game because they are just gonna focus you and you cant do anything about it besides watch your healthbar go from full to nothing in one hit.lastly, hunters apparently are the high egoed in this game they think you can just crown them the moment you load in the match. these guys are supposed to be the heart of the match but instead troll and basically waste youre time.

"6548,SMITE,2018.0,""Smite felt like a really great game for a long time, (700+ hours played outside of steam btw) but it feels like it fell short somewhere along the way. Smite has always felt like the easier MOBA to play if you were bad at something like LoL, I used to hate MOBAs with a passion but Smite helped me get into the genre so I'm thankful. I guess the best way to explain it would be, if you hate MOBAs but really want to give them a chance, Smite is probably a good place to start. Personally, I'm done with this game, it feels like they're trying to hard to please their audience with cringey anime themes, and that's coming from a weeb. Not only this, but several balancing issues and no real focus on those issues, just more skins."",0"
"6549,SMITE,2018.0,""One of the worst communities in the world. There's nothing wrong with the game itself, but it is a multiplayer game and it's a failed experiment.

"6553,SMITE,2017.0,""For those looking for a MOBA experience and aren't familiar with the concept, Smite offers a great introduction! It offers the standard MOBA style gamemodes, classes, playstyle, and feel while introducing more conventional game mechanics such as a 3rd person POV, chat system, and familiar controls. It's also a great game especially for being free! The buisness models revolves around skins and unlocking gods faster which doesn't really make the experience a pay 2 win game. They give you enough favor to pick any god you want after the tutorial phase so you'll have at least one god that you want t0 play as. There's rotations to try out many and they sell the package for $30 which unlocks all 91 gods.I feel like this game offers a great experience for those new to MOBAs, or veterens looking for a new playstyle."",1"
"6554,SMITE,2018.0,""This game has its pros and its cons. Having 1000+ hours invested in this game, I can make a little analysis.Most of this analysis will be based on the game mode conquest because that is the ompetitive, premier game mode. First of all, no you cannot transition from League of Legends to this game.       The two games have separate metas to each game. while it is also a moba, it is not a game that you can pick up. that being said, this is not an easy game. You will have to have a grasp of over 90 gods and their kits, and learn there pros and cons and matchups against other characters. Secondly, it will take a while to face people that know what they're doing.         Before they introduced the new leveling system, the maximum level was level 30. If you were not level 30, people would call out things like it was league of legends instead of understanding the choices in lanes were relative and you must pick solo lane or duo lane instead of left or right. People will blame you for not being there for them when they were too aggressive and you wanted to cut the losses and steal something from them. People just don't fully grasp the game and what they're doing wrong. It will be frustrating for a little while due to the leveling issues.Then you hit a certain level where the entire game changes.         it used to be about 20 games into level 30, but now it's different.But once you hit a certain level, the game will choose to test your skills against higher skilled people. People will gank you and be aggressive. They will be smart and group up to steal objectives and gank you. At that point, you will have to commumicate will your teammates and defend what is yours or counter steal another objective or tower. And, for the most part, no matter behind you are in levels and gold, you are never completely out of the fight. As the game goes on respawn timers get longer and you are able to catch up by taking objectives and towers that cold completely turn the game around, and all it takes is a misplay. The long games are some of the most rewarding experiences or biggest heartbreaks in almost any game i've played.The conquest game mode has been up and down since the middle of season 3 and through season 4. I personally barely played season 4, just played enough ranked to get into diamond again. With how the map has been revamped, it feels the most engaging and exciting season I've played.The neat thing about this game is that you can get all the gods and future gods for 30$, and sometimes 15-20$ on sales. The game is very accessible taht way. However, they get there money from loot chests that you have to spend on gems, which you either get from logging on every day, getting up to 50 per week or buying them. All of the good skins are in a pool ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tier trash to pretty cool skins. The chests have a set limit on what is in them, ususally ranging at 20 - 50 skins or boosters and misc. They claim that the skins are all randomized and not in a set order, but all the good skins end up to come up when youre at the very end of the list. I encourage people to get coolâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥skins because they do put a lot of effort into them and that's where their creativity comes out. but just keep that in mind when you are planning to buy a chest to get skins."",1"
6555,SMITE,2015.0,An explosion went off in my house halfway through a game of Conquest with me playing Ah Puch (someone who blows stuff up). Still finished the game.Turns out it was a coconut that exploded in half. My mind is blown.10/10 dedication fun game,1
"6556,SMITE,2018.0,""Third Person MOBA with over 80+ Gods to choose from, lots of modes and tonnes of customisation this game is highly recommended.SMITE is a Free To Play (F2P) Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game and has probably the largest number of playable characters in any game F2P or not. There are over 80+ Gods to choose from, each has a different look, different abilities, they all have their strengths and their weaknesses and of course they all have a whole host of customisation skins, emotes and taunts available for them. The developers are continuously updating the game with even more Gods, customisation options, game modes and seasonal events which just keeps this game alive and interesting. Almost everything in the game is customisable as this is F2P but almost everything is earnable for free, meaning you do not need to spend any money in the game. There is of course two currencies, the in game Favor earned by playing games and completing quests or challenges, and the currency bought with real money, Gems. As mentioned, almost everything can be bought with in game currency over time. Some of the things you customise in the game or buy with free in game currency are Gods, God Skins, loading screen backgrounds, loading screen character frames, God selection pedastals, in-game announcers, music, emotes and so on.There are also many game modes to choose from, one of the more popular being Conquest, a 5vs5 typical MOBA type map where each side must defend against minons and enemy players while also defending their towers. If a tower is destroyed then the minions can generally push further towards the players base and victory is easier. There is also a game mode called Clash which is the same as Conquest but on a smaller scale with only two lanes and Joust which is on an even smaller scale with only 3vs3 players and a single lane. There is an Arena type mode which is again 5vs5 players in an open Arena with no towers to destroy you must instead just kill enough enemy players and minions to reduce the number of enemy tickets to 0 from usually a total of 500.If PvP (Player vs Player) is not your cup of tea as described in the above modes then do not worry, there is also a PvE mode (Player vs Environment), this is a mode that either unfortunately or fortunately is constantly changing in SMITE. This is the mode that is only available for usually around a month or so then disappears for a little bit and reappears as a whole different experience. The first time I played this mode it was very similar to Nintendo's Mario Kart, you were able to choose a God and drive around a track in a little vehicle which was different depending on the God you chose and the goal was to reach top 3 out of around 10 players total. There were pick ups that you could drive through to gain a speed boost or to shoot one of the other players and slow them down. Another time the PvE mode was more of a dungeon crawler which allowed you to collect gear to become stronger the more you ran through the dungeon. It is a forever changing mode and usually quite alot of fun, especially if you have a couple of friends to join you on whatever journey it may be.All in all SMITE is a fantastic example of what a F2P game should be, it does everything well, it is constantly updating and there is a huge amount of free customisation options with no need to spend real money. It is a free game in which you could easily spend hundreds of hours playing and never get bored.Follow my curator page if this review was helpful and you want to see more reviews like this one.

"6565,SMITE,2015.0,""I started playing Smite about a year ago, and I was hooked instantly. The concept of MOBAs had always intrigued me, but I struggled to enjoy the ones I tried because of the mouse movement controls and isometric viewpoint, among other reasons. When I heard Smite was a 3rd-person, WASD-controlled MOBA with an emphasis on skillshots, I had to try it, and I'm glad I did. The game is a fantastic team-oriented experience with a great depth of stragegy/gameplay/skill. The character design and implementation is amazing, the lore of mythological gods battling is a blast, and the variety of abilities, skills, gamemodes, events, etc. has kept me coming back for more ever since I started. Try it - you won't be disappointed!"",1"
"6566,SMITE,2015.0,""As a player of Smite since early beta, I can definitely recommend this MOBA. I find it is the best of its the best of its genre, and have had hours and hours of fun with this game and with friends. As the devs release new gods, it takes a while before they balance them, but eventually all the gods in the game get balanced, and ever single OP god can get countered in some way, whether its team composition, playstyle, or your character build. This is hands down the most fun I have had with teamwork based games. The community is good, but with this now on Steam I'm not sure how thats going to change. Its only every so often you get trolls on your team, but if you are a more advanced player, an easy fix is to play ranked matches for the most competative experience. Most Liked Feature: Gameplay/game style. The maps are beautiful and the mechanics of movement and ability use are what make the game so distinct and fun.Most Disliked Feature: Loki isâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥OP You never see someone playing bakasura unless its random pick and they get him. This also goes for a few other underrated godsOverall, I find this game to be one of the best games for playability, integrity, and mutltiplayer. If you are a scrub with no friends, the game can still be enjoyed. 1/10 -IGN"",1"
"6567,SMITE,2016.0,""If League or Dota are too slow paced for you, and you don't like the top down perspective, then SMITE is the game for you.      With a character roster that's more interesting, gameplay that's faster and requires more skill, and a company that has shown time and time again that they care about their playerbase, it's the best MOBA on the market."",1"
"6568,SMITE,2017.0,""This game makes me happy.Smite is very fun.sometimes...it makes me not happy.VERY not happy. but it's not the game that does that, it's the people.Great coomunity, horrible lower class. Would recommend Smite apartheid."",1"
6569,SMITE,2017.0,I'd say it's a great game. Just to touch on people complaining about matchmaking what I've noticed is that the people I played when I started in February this year compared to the people I play now at 30. What I have seen is people who are experienced at the game make new accounts with friends to steamroll new players. This happens quite frequently. The game as a whole is a ton of fun and very possible to learn even if you're new but like any new pvp experience expect to get your butt handed to you a lot. Though it will make you better.,1
"6570,SMITE,2016.0,""So, after 100 hours+ of the game ive decided to short write a review on this game.Pros1-A great theme, I love the background to a lot of the heros.2-The game has a solid hero selection and the god pack makes the cost of playing the game very reasonable.3-The 3rd person view works great and immerses you more heavily into the game than other mobas.4-The game has a different number of game modes.5-Events seem a common occurance and the community seems 'okay'.Cons1-The match making is as bad as any other moba and will frequently (50%+ of games) put of a group of 2-5 against a team of solo players.2-As in all mobas you get a fair amount of smurf accounts and that means as a newbie you will have to play against long time players who want to restart but look like a newbie to the match making system.3-There arent many maps.4-I would say that at least 66%+ of games are uneven slaughters, makes that really fun/tense game a rarity. 5-The servers are down a lot and frequently have problems.Overall, if you enjoy mobas and will either get your friends to play or join a clan you will most likely like this game. This is because you can and will often get placed against solo players so you can combo and high five each other to your hearts content. If you are more often that not solo queuing I would recommend that you skip this game and play something else. Its a shame as the game has a great theme but is let down by its match making and unreliable servers."",0"
"6571,SMITE,2016.0,""The game itself is pretty interesting for a MOBA, but inevitably poor matchmaking makes me unable to recommend it if you care about having a good competitive experience.  One regularly encounters long streaks (5+ games) of non-competitive rounds where your team is simply overmatched as a group and doesn't even sniff destroying an objective or two as the opposing team just rolls over you, which after awhile is pretty uninspiring.  Inversely it's also much more common in my experience to blow out the other team than have a tight, back-and-forth round where your actions really do matter.  I'd say optimistically that maybe 10% or so of my matches were actually close with well-matched teams.  When the matchmaking does work it is pretty good fun, but sadly it's a much rarer of an occurence than I am willing to put up with."",0"
"6572,SMITE,2017.0,""S3 was a joke, with random bs. Current season, S4, an even bigger joke. Their designers clearly only care about a game that is fun to watch on the esports, they don't care if it end up being really stressful to actually play the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing thing. And now pushing EAC when ther eis absolutely no need for it in this game (and several better in house approaches that has none of the down sides). â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ HR, they have no respect for you, and the game isnt even as fun as it used to be. Burry this."",0"
"6573,SMITE,2015.0,""I have never really written a review for any game on steam, but this game breaks that mold, in fact it breaks lots of molds in the MOBA genre in all. Its a MOBA game that uses a third person camera at all times, while this may seem like a quirky gimmic that makes the game uninteresting in a few moments of gameplay it does not. It always keeps my attention and I waste hours playing this game without even realising it and thats the thing. Whenever I try to play any other MOBA game (Dota 2/League of Legends) I get bored quickly because I feel like the action just isnt there. This game on the contrary is always filled with excitment and im always on my toes when I play this game. All of the Basic attacks are whats called """"skill shots"""" meaning you have to aim in order to kill anyone in this game. Unlike other MOBA games you do not click on the ground to move, instead you move with the WASD keys and you have to option to re bind them to something else. Currently the game has about 69 Gods to play as from different pantheons. Gods are essentially your character that you can choose to play as or a """"Champion"""" if you will and they all look and sound Great! Hell the entire game looks amazing even when everything was turned down on low! The game modes vary from conquest (5V5) to Joust (3V3) and if that isnt enough you have a MOTD or a """"mode of the day"""" which should add a little something to your life if you ever get bored of Classic 5V5. A MOTD is a random mode with the rules changed whether it be Extra money or all one character or a mode where everyone is already to the max level. In the end I could keep going about how amazing this game is ( I have played this for like a gazillion hours before it even came to steam) Or I could just end on saying, if you want to try a MOBA game thats a little diffrent but still fun Smite is your game!"",1"
"6574,SMITE,2017.0,""Now I know why everyone is writing reviews... Well, don't play this game if you don't have any friend who plays it as well. The community is REALLY toxic. They will insult you for every tiny mistake you make, or won't help you at all (besides they will be like """"Am I the only one alive???"""", WELL, IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO HELP THEN YES) BUT the game itself is pretty awesome and the characters are cool af! Again, play it with friends. You will encounter some nice people every now and then, but it's not that common.

"6580,SMITE,2018.0,""One of the worst mobas I have ever played (and I've played pretty much all of them).  THIS GAME IS NOT NEW PLAYER FRIENDLY, IF YOU ARE NEW TO MOBAS, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.The idea is solid, and the gameplay has the potential to be fun, but...1.  Matchmaking is bad, and I mean BAD.  If you are a solo player, don't bother.  You will get matched against premades and pros, one after another until you rage quit.  You will also get the pleasure of being flamed by your team (because the community is mostly salty vets at this point), until you rage quit a second time.  if you are still playing for some reason...2.  Loot boxes have taken over the store.  There was a time when you could just buy skins, not anymore... any worth having are locked behind rng.  3.  The game has a wierd system of forcing a 50/50 win rate even if it means matching you vs players so much better it gaurantees you lose (thus adjusting you back to 50%).  This is a super messed up system, how did it get through development?4.  The graphics and movement are janky by todays standards, not much effort put into overhauling that over the years.  In summary..I REALLY wanted to love this game, but it sees new (and experienced players returning) as foder for the small and pretty savage community to chew up and spit out.   "",0"
"6581,SMITE,2018.0,""This game has gone so dramatically downhill in the last several years. Hi-Rez is a company that takes one step forward and three steps back every single time.

Everything, from inappropriate buffs to inappropriate nerfs to failure to promote correctly... I stopped playing 3 months through season 4. The only thing keeping this game alive is the casual console fanbase. I've attended Launch Tournament, and the first two World Championships. I've competed in Challenger's Cup. As someone who has invested thousands of dollars and hours into this, let me say that this is a game that exists in a shadow of it's former self.

"6584,SMITE,2015.0,""   I    HATE   MOBAAnd  yet, this  Game, is probably, the Most epic GODLY  Crossover between Several Religions,  believes, cultures-  basically,  Many  Gods (And Godesses,  hey there, Babes!)  from different Mythologies   I played  Dota  2 for The whole  37 minutes  in my life  (for which  I still can not Forgive myself)- And YET, This game breaks  all   the  stereotypes  about MOBAs.  See  ya,  dota/  lol / the infinite Crysis,  wait there,  Marvel -DC crossover,  we Got something Big here!"",1"
"6585,SMITE,2015.0,""Reasons to play Smite:-You're getting tired of the old MOBA formula and you want a new twist-You like third-person action games-You like competitive team-based games that require strategy and teamwork-You want something fun to play with your friends for free- You have no better way to spend your time since you have no life responsibilities NOTE: I have many more hours than what is displayed, as I have played this game before it was released on Steam. Since the day it came out of beta in fact."",1"
"6586,SMITE,2018.0,""Honestly, this game is so bad, yet its one of the most addictive things ive ever experienced. To quote a friend """"this game is a lot like heroin""""-Ryfy 2k18If you wanna get addicted like me, its a great game, if you like actual quality content, avoid like the plague."",1"
"6587,SMITE,2015.0,""- Fast paced MOBA in the third person perspective. Very unique and much fun at once. Such action.- The characters are Gods from 7 different Pantheons and all are almost unique compared to others individually.- A very good F2P price model. A pack offers you all currently released and future gods for a set price and you can spend your ingame money on other stuff. Mostly cosmetics. No pay to win in this game.- Hi-Rez (Devs behind the game) are very kind and generous to it's players. Lots of free rewards and stuff.- Constantly beeing patch with new content. No end in sight just yet.- Meta is constantly changing, a meta never last really long. - eSport scene is thriving and watching pro players playing the game on high ranked play is a joy.There's not much complain about, other than:- Community can be toxic sometimes. Mute and ignore if you can. This problem exist in every MOBA however.- Game has tad bit of optimization problems with AMD cards from what I can tell. Still, runs really well on older rigs.Love this game. I've been playing since Beta, took a break however (was playing League of Legends competetive at the time) and came 4 months ago back to it. I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys MOBA's with a very unique aspect. 9/10"",1"

"6589,SMITE,2017.0,""Does Smite need any more word-of-mouth than it already has? Probably not. But I'll throw in my two cents into the well anyway.Before I even mention anything about the game itself I want to talk about the community that plays this game...http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1116439958The word here is toxic. Absolutely vitriol and toxic. So much anger and hatred is oozing from the vast majority of the player base polluting what could be an otherwise enjoyable experience. 9 out of 10 matches will devolve into a shouting match like the screenshot above. And this isn't even a Smite problem to be honest, it's mainly a moba problem and the type of games that just attract this sort of crowd. Be prepared to be yelled at, A LOT. Oh and yelling isn't even the worst of it. Also be prepared to get reported. There's nothing more sore losers love than to press that """"report player"""" button after almost every match. This game is not friendly to newcomers.With that out of the way I guess I should touch up on the game itself. It plays like any other moba out there"

"6591,SMITE,2017.0,""In a world where every MOBA-styled game is getting more and more toxic, Smite is one of the last of it's kind that I can enjoy. Don't get me wrong, you'll still run into the occasional game with someone who just has to ruin your day, but overall I've found the community here to be much more welcoming and helpful. The game modes are diverse and the massive character roster (91 ATM I think?) keeps you from getting too bored. I feel I should note that the God Pack for this game is 100% worth it, as you'll get every character released as they come out, which is a huge value. At the very least, give the game a try!"",1"
"6592,SMITE,2018.0,""Im torn with this game. In concept the game is incredibly fun. However it houses one of the most toxic playerbase I've ever been forced to play with. I used to play this game religiously, infact for the longest time it was the only game I played. However my computer died and went unreplaced for over a year. Now that I'm back I cant play a single match without being lambasted despite explaining my departure. The game suffers from what most dotas will suffer from.

(They deserve their own servers, would take out a lot of grief.)Overall i'm pretty done with this game, a really nice (and sometimes even fun) game to play, but like all of these games they need to earn money, and if you want the nicer stuff you need to start forking out cash and quick, because some skins are exclusive content that can never be unlocked again after it's gone?!So nice game Hi-Rez too bad it's nothing that i will be investing in.

"6599,SMITE,2016.0,""I have spent a Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ of time playing this game and all I have to say is I have never been so horribly disappointed by any game i have ever played in my entire Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ing life. Like most MOBA's. It started out great! The game was fun and fairly well balanced and the community was actually significantly better than the notoriously toxic community's of other MOBA's such as League of Legends. But just like every other game of it's type, it went to absolute Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ing horsecockery. First and foremost, the company isÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ They don't listen to the community. They get countless complaints all over about different things that are not working as intended or not working at all, severely overpowered gods, and game breaking bugs, but instead of fixing or even acknowledging those problems, they tweak a few minor details once every thousand years that make little to no difference, and are typically things that no one wants or gives aÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥about. The gods are so horribly unbalanced, and the less skill it takes to play your character the higher your chances of winning. (This if Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ing fact. Loki, Poseidon and Odin are prime examples) Out of the vast supply of existing gods currently in the game i'd say there are maybe 20 that people actually play. There are far too many instances of gods that are just plain better than others. And I don't mean counters. I mean that there are about 5 mages that are 4000x stronger than all of the other mages. And this goes for every single class. Not to mention every time they release a god they overpower the livingÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥out of it in hopes to get more people to spend money on them. I really did love this game when i first started playing it and would easily say that at it's peak, it was the best MOBA i ever played. But just like other MOBA's i have watched it slowly decay into the bubblingÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥volcano that stands before me today. I could spend so much longer talking about everything that myself and many others find wrong with this game at this point in time but I realized that i've already wasted too much. So if you wanna know more reasons why you shouldn't download this taco-bell-shotgun-diahhrea game, feel free to contact me and I can give you more reasons than you could ever possibly need. If I had to thoroughly sum this game up in a sentence, i would call it nothing but a gargantuan Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ing time vampire.0/100000000 would not reccomend to the dark lord himself"",0"

"6605,SMITE,2017.0,""After trying LoL and Dota 2... I can say without a doubt that Smite is one of the best MOBA's out there.The community is actually healthier than LoL's by a huge margin, but at the end, this is the lesser issue with these types of games, and it will greatly depend on luck and your own personality.The Devs are always worried about balance between the Gods that are old or new, the items that are used in the builds and even little details in the map designs or events. So if you worry about a broken game that barely gets attention on these issues, worry not, they take care of it with constant patches that are always mixed with new events, offers, cosmetics and so on.Despite certain small issues with old computers (Some perform poorly in specific game modes) This game is pure gold. I really recommend it, specially if you have people to party with you during the events that are often and are great. Also, if you are the kind of guy or gal that wants to spend a little bit of your hard earned (IRL) money they always have good offers and discounts during the year.This might sound weird. But the only thing that Smite is missing is the ability to trade Skins, Emotes, or other cosmetic elements of the game between players.I truly hope you enjoy the game as much as i have, i also hope you can refer your friends so you can enjoy even more with them.Word of advice: If you have the chance, get the God Pack when its in discount. Totally worth it. Unless you are the kind of person that likes to earn everything thru hard work :) "",1"

"6614,SMITE,2016.0,""I have never played a game as much as I play Smite. Since mid to late season 2, I have had the wonderful oppurtunity to play Smite as my first MOBA ever. All the iteams, abilities, and skilled players were very intimidating at first, But the growth through the game was truly an amazing feeling. Many people hate that Smite has changed so much but personally I am thrilled with every change they make because the beauty of this game is how power of items and gods are always shifting and changing allowing new play styles and ways of stratgey. This game has truly shaped me on a realistic level as me and my friends have bonded over it. If you are thinking of trying this game... you must. I, personally believe there is a bit of a learning curve but once you find your perfect character, and get your first victory, then positive KD, then penta, and all the way to placing in ranked you will hopefully find as much enjoyment as I have.

"6617,SMITE,2017.0,""There is no such thing as a simple review for a game which is so vast in its complexities.  But in short, the game is amazing.  The playerbase ranges from super friendly to little mortons salt girls and the three trolls under the bridge and everything in between.  Some players understand too much of the game and get bent if you don't select the character they want you to select and or buy the items they want you to select, and others just give great tips and don't mind carrying you a few games to show you the ropes.  I definitely recommend watching some videos on how to play before you just jump in though as I mentioned the game is pretty complex.  If you show up to a team game and you obviously didn't listen to the tutorials people will get frustrated.  The problem is that unlike other pvp games you dying repeatedly because you attack like leeroy jenkins during a raid makes your enemies stronger which causes your team to die also... Pay attention to the tutorials and ask a friend about what to buy for your chosen god... you really want to set it up BEFORE you go in to multiplayer matchmaking.  Those valuable seconds you spend searching during multiplayer will get your team killed.  I definitely recommend this game, but don't waste all your money buying skins... if you are able to resist!"",1"
"6618,SMITE,2015.0,""I have played 3 moba games so far and I wasn't really into trying another one but recently I wanted to give it a shot since I heard about it a lot and got released on steam. I now play mainly hots and I love it but I will play Smite as an off-moba sometimes cause it has some features that don't require me to invest time to learn from the beggining a new moba and set it part a bit from the classic """"strategy"""" focused lol and dota. So if you too are heavily invested in a main moba, here are the reasons why you should play Smite to blow off some steam every now and then. 1) It has 2 game modes that require no jungling or warding and it is just mindless massacre: arena and assault, mainly arena is the pure massacre with no real towers, just plainly kill each other. 2)It has the option to auto lvl up and auto purchase items, so if you can't bother like me to learn about new items and skills or whatever this contributes tremendously in just going in and kill gods, eventually though you will start wanting to purchase your own items since you will play enough to have the urge to change your build a bit. 3) It gives away for free some starting gods that are relatively easy and fun to play so no need to farm asap for your first god. Generally it is a unique gameplay wise moba and the action based camera and combat have an amusing feeling. At first it will be hard to get used to the gameplay specially if you come from another moba game but eventually you get used to it and it is quite fun. If you are a starter on moba genre, I wouldn't suggest Smite as your first moba as it is not a pure representative of genre nor as easy as the other isometric camera view moba games. It retains the """"fed"""" concept from lol and dota but not in a terrible scale but the 50% of your hp-one ability concept exists. Also the concept of fighting gods is really great and if you love mythology you grow a special feeling when you play your favorite mythological god no matter what his/her abilities are. Smite's referal program is quite rewarding and by simply logging in every day in 4 weeks you get a free skin with the amount of gems they give. In-game currency progression is faster than lol's and hots's but not by far and the graphics are quite decent although they could use some improvement in some models, the environments are pretty great though. Final verdict: try it if you have played another moba, come back if you are rookie after you have played another moba."",1"
"6619,SMITE,2018.0,""Pros: - Best 3rd person MOBA out there (there aren't many).- Many gods in an ever expanding rooster.- Skins and voice packs are good enough to WASTE your money.- Truly free to play, but you can purchase all gods that exist and will exist for around 30 bucks.Cons: - Toxic community (you might end up muting your TEAM in a teambased game).- Outdated game physics and graphics.- A tendency to release new overpowered gods, then once people who do not own the gods pack have purchased the new god, a patch that nerfs the said god is released.(You can purchase all gods with the in game currency if you have the time to farm it)Overall: If you can, play with friends, and buy the gods pack, otherwise prepare to be insulted by 12 year old who can't play the game, about how badly you play the game, in the form of spammable voice messages that go like this: Littleturd2005: YOU ROCK, YOU ROCK, YOU ROCK, GOOD JOB, CANCEL THAT!Littleturd2005: kys and uninstall plz!Me: I will do that in that exact order thanks.SOURCE: over 1000 hours wasted on this game since I started during the closed beta before it was on steam."",1"

"6622,SMITE,2018.0,""If youre into MOBA's, this is definitely for you.Why?-Wide Variety of Playable CharactersThe playable gods vary from different pantheons, so you could play as the Greek god of death Hades, or take a twist and go for the Egyptian god of the sun Ra. There will be at least one god that suits your playstyle, and the journey to finding that god is amazing.-Wide Variety of GamemodesThe Gamemodes are just quite simply good.Nothing More to say about this to be honest, its just solid.-New Content Every 2 WeeksHi-Rez Studios work hard on the balance (although the balance aint the best yet!), Playable Gods, Items etcSeeing a Brand new skin for your Main god is satisfying as heck!~The Community....Well.....This is the only part i would say, not recommended, because HOLY **** THE COMMUNITY IN THIS GAME CAN SUCK!'...'CAN' suck, because if you dont get a team full of whiny lill kids, this game is close to perfect.

"6624,SMITE,2017.0,""over the shoulder style moba. i really enjoy the fast pace and decision making involved in this game. out playing people is always fun. i highly recommend you try this one esp if you dont care for top down style mobas but are still interested in the concept. there are several different game types so as long as you like the mechanics you can probably find a game mode you prefer most. a lot of the cosmetics are unlockable just by playing the game to. theoretically, if you dont miss any log in bonuses you can even get the paid only cosmetics."",1"
6625,SMITE,2018.0,Ever since I started university I've had severl instances of depression because of school work/grades/co-op. Smite helped me get rid of that depression. Smite was able to rid me of my depression largely due to its greate balancing team and the community as a whole.Smite turned my regular drepression into crippling depression. Now I don't have just regular depression anymore :)10/10 would play again.,1
6626,SMITE,2018.0,smite is an amazing game but hi-res is the worst they make too many stun mechanics some gods are broken AF and just annoying to play against. i also always get new players as a team and more experienced players as enemies which can be very annoying when you want the quest/daily reward. please fix :(,1
"6627,SMITE,2016.0,""I have been playing this game for a little over 2 years now and just watching it progress is amazing. This game is very fun and interactive especially when you use curse with the game, it creates that much more of an experience."",1"
"6628,SMITE,2016.0,""smite is a 3rd person moba with interesting characters, few maps (but are very good), a ton of  game modes and very few bugs. the game is realy grindy and can take 1 to 2 weeks to earn one character. the game is fun and is one of the better free to play games and one of the best mobas."",1"
"6629,SMITE,2018.0,""This game really surprised me. Oh, the splendor.I was an avid Dota and Heroes of Newerth player for many years. This game has blown me away.It is very well made. In fact, everything about this game is well constructed: it has thorough tutorials and tutorial videos in-game... AND you can even play against Bots/AI with friends co-op online and earn points to unlock characters etc. while you're learning to play the game. (It is genuinely FREE to play if that's the route you want to take. There are no unbalanced in-game features for paying money, unlike games such as League of Legends)Once you play a MOBA with a 3rd Person view-point, you wonder why this isn't the gaming standard for the genre right now. That being said Smite is still madly popular, and for a reason. The people who dislike this type of game are generally people who jump right into public play without practicing against AI first, or without learning the classes/roles that synergize together. The Smite community is also WAY less toxic than other MOBAs that i've played and that, is a plus!If you're into the idea of playing as mythical gods from cultures around the world, and you are looking for a revolutionary MOBA experience in 3rd Person ... the game will not disappoint! It's ****ing good. Try it out.(The only thing I will recommend is that you practice a bunch against AI on Medium and learn about the different player roles before jumping into public Conquest matches. Like most MOBAs this game has a definite learning curve... but that's what makes these games great in the first place.)Highly recommended."",1"
6630,SMITE,2018.0,Don't want to play hardcore MOBAs like LoL or Dota? Well i highly recommend you this game just for the arena gamemode.An arena match is just about skill and how you play.Both teams' levels have almost the same level(not more than 2 levels  higher).Besides this fun gamemode the game controls are pretty good.The single gamemode that i played besides arena was joust.3v3 match with 1 lane and a jungle.,1
6631,SMITE,2017.0,Does Hi-Rez have a balancing team for SMITE or is it just a bunch of monkey slapping buttons? Stop releasing meme skins and start to balance the characters that can simply one-shot you with no effort involved.,0
"6632,SMITE,2017.0,""what amazing free to play game.Smite is moba,but it feels more like 3d team based action game: with many gods to choose from and different maps and game modes.I absolutely recomend Smite to anyone and evryone."",1"
"6633,SMITE,2017.0,""It is the same as League of Legends, but it has some more mechanics, more interesting plays and requires more skill than league. It also has more action and I believe this is what makes it one of the best MOBAs out there right now, the skins and extras are way easier to get than in league which makes it less of a pay 2 win game than LoL ."",1"
"6634,SMITE,2016.0,""Good MOBA game... the tactic and battle is so great , good system , and mode... and all the gods have their own unique style... but the game is lack of balancing when matchmaking... :D but overall its a good game"",1"

You can give it a go with Bots, but PvP system is terrible."",0"
"6636,SMITE,2018.0,""SMITE is your counterpart to LOL - A Moba, behaves very similarly, has casual and competitive gamemodes, and your only difference is third-person perspective versus an angle-locked overhead scroller. Either of these games are easy to pick up from a fresh start, but when trying to play one after getting comfy with the other, it's only gonna feel horrible. I managed to step into SMITE a bit before League, and I took this game over the other as a comfort pick. Since this game is alike League, expect it to have a lot of the same elements as LOL - A high mechanical and game-knowledge learning curve, skill ceilings and required knowledge of all characters (considering Smite double+ of League's), item understanding and grasp of the changing meta, the list goes on. I would say from my perspective, Smite came off as a lot less intimidating witht the amount of knowledge required over League, but I'm sure that can be argued either way,SMITE's a good game, and it can be good fun. Always the kind of game to be more fun with friends, and third person makes things a lot more demanding for mechanical control, rather than """"where can you click a million times with your mouse and hope the game/client responds in time and accurately."""" It has a strong casual scene, and a competitive scene, with some very likeable figures to represent the game (no, I'm not talking about DMBrandon).However, I have more than a few complaints, after nearly 2k hours on PC and around 700 on console:- Just because it's a smaller community, doesn't mean that toxic people don't necessarily exist. They do, in less quantity, but man, Smite players can be ridiculous. It only gets worse the higher up on the Ranked ladder you climb.- The tutorial for SMITE does a poor job at teaching you practical knowledge and buying. Yes, it's trying to cram a lot in within about five tutorial games, but it does a very ineffective job at that. You're taught to strictly focus towers or dive head-on into fights, buy Meditation (as one of the worst actives available), and the tutorial only initiates other horrible habits for new players. Be open to learn from YouTubers and other players as you explore.- The game is typically broken in some way, all the time. For an example, to compliment Ullr's highly anticipated and very rare Tier 5 skin, they buffed him """"subtly"""" into an absolute assinine state, where he received a 100% ban rate at Worlds. Relics are typically either functional, or bugged to where they often won't go off in time. Relics not working is more of a niche complaint being that I play competitively, but having a game that is very often imbalanced, alike League, can be stressful.- Ranked matchmaking is misery. I don't know much for League's ranking system, but I do know that the way Smite's ranked matchmaking operates is punishing. It is intended to be a logical system, to where if you are performing very well in lower MM, it will raise your matchmaking Rank/ELO to try and pair you with more skillful players. It's a good system, in a sense, but retrospectively is brutal if it isn't accurate. For me to have the capability to place in Platinum in a past split is nice, and even then I was being restrained by solo-queuing. A brand new season started recently, and I ran my placement games. To be consistently matched WITH Bronze V players, or players who were new to ranked, yet be matched against Platinum and Diamond players (like I should be), is ridiculous. To have a placement in the middle of Silver, yet I can go and compete at a Diamond level, beating people who have previously placed Masters in a great game, is VERY ridiculous. Ranked is an optional experience for competitive players, and if you do decide to take this opportunity on, do not expect it to be forgiving to you in the slightest. Most of the complaints are ones that League players can say the same for, as expected. But, if you can look over said issues, and grab a few friends, SMITE as a casual game is expansive and enjoyable."",1"
"6637,SMITE,2016.0,""Smite is one of the best MOBA'S i have played besides Dota 2, the majority of the community is very friendly and helpful.i would recommended smite to anyone that is new to MOBA'S it isn't easy to get the hang of but after about 100 hrs you should have a good understanding of the game."",1"
"6638,SMITE,2018.0,""Don't let Steam hours fool you, I've been playing this since Beta on the normal client. I literally downloaded this on Steam just to throw my two cents in: I'll just say this: If you enjoy other MOBAs, you'll most likely enjoy Smite. That being said, the game is undergoing a major shift, and the developers are jumping ship. They're going from Hi-Rez-EXAMPLE EMPLOYEE NAME to Titan-EXAMPLE EMPLOYEE NAME. This is being used to distinguish between the two groups of HiRez. One is project Titan, and the other is simply HiRez. You can expect the eventual dropping of the original Devs, to the new ones. Half of the problems that the game is currently facing, is due to inconsistency. I'll explain: Most players, whether they're new or old, can tell you that the game is incredibly inconsistent. This being that you can queue for a match, and if you're lucky enough to get in, and not """"You are unable to be matched, and are now the highest queue) which literally resets your queue for another 10-15 minutes. If you're lucky to get in, you'll see one of two things"
"6639,SMITE,2016.0,""A Paladinâ€™s Review: SMITE: Battleground of the Gods. An Epic Firestorm of an Experience.Genre: 3rd Person Multiplayer Online Battle Arena With Multiple Casual and Ranked Modes and Multiple Characters to Choose From.Developed & Published by: Hi-Rez StudiosPlatform: Windows, Mac, Xbox One and PS4.DRM: Free Hi-Rez Player Account Required. Steam is optional.Business Model: Free to Play. Premium currency used only for cosmetic items.Paid quite a bit of money on premium currency and some gifted by friends. Iâ€™ve played over 1,300+ hours combined in both the Steam and Non-Steam client. As this review will not fit on Steam, please read the full edition on A Paladin Without A Crusade.[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsSMITE is a 3rd person multiplayer online battle arena where teams of up to five players fight each other on a large map. They must work together to contest objectives, obtain buffs and killing minions to defeat the end goal, the enemy teamâ€™s Titan. It's a combination of PVE farming and PVP fighting that reward good teamplay, positioning, timing/reflexes and usage of skill shot abilities. There are seven unique modes, as of this review, that change how the game is played from the usual MOBA format. Add on over 80 gods to choose from, each containing their own unique playstyles, a wealth of items that allow players to counter build or change how they play along with seven unique modes and SMITE allows for a lot of different ways to play.In SMITE, the player controls a God or Goddess over the shoulder. Giving them a plentiful view to cast their spells up close. These characters are based on the beliefs of ancient or current religions including the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Norse, Mayans, Hindus, Chinese and Japanese Pantheons. These myths and beliefs form the basis of the lore, look, capabilities and personality quirks of every character. Allowing for a big range of personalities and ideas. The lore reason for why these gods are fighting is that essentially gods are fighting over the last remnants of human worship and the power that worship gives them. While many gods fight for whether humanity should be free or controlled, other gods join the fight for their own personal goals. As such, it's creating a conflict that threatens to destroy everything that the gods and goddesses hold dear. Game Balance and FairnessAs far as how the balance is in general, thatâ€™s a tricky thing to answer. I think in the long haul, Hi-Rez has always done a good job of keeping the game balanced and enjoyable. They make sure to get community feedback on a regular basis. Iâ€™d like to say that Hi-Rez is unafraid to tweak the balance of gods and the game in general but it does feel like sometimes Hi-Rez has become more skittish of balancing some of the more problematic characters as time goes on. I don't know, I'm really conflicted on this point because on the one hand they'll have gods like Ratatoskr, an Assassin, go from pretty much worthless to overpowered. On the other hand, they'll have a god like Bakasura or Artemis only receive minor buffs over a very long period of time. It can lead to a lot of frustration with the balance. Granted we are talking about 70+ gods and I can only really think of about five to ten at any one time time that were problematic. That all said, every single season has seen sweeping changes that have shaken up the META and brought some of SMITEâ€™s most problematic balance problems to heel. The biggest problem with SMITE's balance in general right now is that all gods and items are balanced entirely around Conquest. Which is great for Conquest but not so much for other modes where a god's weaknesses may not be as crippling. Joust and Assault show this weakness off quite distinctly, with some like Ah Puch being incredibly difficult to deal with. To the point that gods like him were creating quite a bit of irritation in the group of friends I play with. Even I can't deny that I get tired of it too and I wish SMITE could figure out a better balance point for all of its gods. But at the same point, I'm not sure what they can do about it right now. Ultimately, Smite is a team-based game. Even if you have the â€œbestâ€ gods possible, it won't matter if one or more of your teammates aren't pulling his weight and the other team is on point. This is where you can run into the biggest frustration with SMITE. There will be matches where there is nothing you can do to win. Where the matchmaking will put you with a team that is clearly way below your skill level up against a team much better than you. Or even vice versa. Then there's the other problems including you not playing well to someone disconnected from the match. Iâ€™m not going to lie, there will be plenty of those matches in SMITE and it will be frustrating. It can also make game balance very difficult to figure out when you've got all of these various elements in play. Even if you're the best player in Smite, if you're stuck with some of the worst players you're going to lose. Something I want to expand upon in the next section. But for now, you'll have to accept that there are some people that just suck. In-game, you're fortunate in that there's a mute button and report feature to deal with the toxic individuals. (The report system does now let you know if a report has been acted on). Even so, those sucky people are far outweighed by good people. SMITE's community is rich with creators and good people to discuss the game with and watch play. A community with a plethora of YouTubers and Twitch streamers, artists and parody people. But it's also a big community which means you get a vocal minority of asshats that can be annoying to deal with. Running with your own friends is probably the best way to go or assembling a bunch of people throughout playing it because running on your own will get tiresome in the long run. Final ThoughtsAfter 3 years of playing SMITE, itâ€™s daunting to come to your final thoughts. Especially when this game will change in the coming years as Hi-Rez continues to add and change its content. This is what I can say about SMITE. I got sucked into it and played it for over 1,300 hours. There is a real sense of accomplishment when games are won and frustration when games are lost. The emotional rollercoaster SMITE has taken me on has had its ups and downs. But I have no regrets. For new players, the learning curve may be daunting despite an improved tutorial system with the various gods to learn about and complex, if hidden, mechanics therein. There's plenty of casual modes for someone to play and enjoy. As far as League is concerned, I don't think its worth playing due to a general lack of reward or need to work together. After all, why bother when you can simply grind your way to Platinum ranks. The business model is still free to play and everything you can pay for are cosmetic items that don't affect gameplay. Though I don't like the exclusive skin chests that Hi-Rez has been running for a while. While I am taking a break for an undetermined amount of time, I can't deny that I've had a lot of fun with SMITE. Is it perfect? No, but Hi-Rez keeps on trying. Even if the current state of balance is probably the most contentious it has ever been. Is it worth getting into? Well, yes, I do think it's worth getting into.

"6640,SMITE,2018.0,""potentially a good game but worst comunity! lamest bunch of whiners and snitches, they report you for anything and then you get baned for a week because some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ blame your selection of shoes for their failure to get what the game is about. unless you have a bunch of friends to make a good premade with you will be surounded by people so stupid you ask yourself how its even possible, 8 out of 10 times. 1 out of ten times its a balanced game and another 1 out of 10 when you somehow get a luckystrike and end up in the team thats not made up of 40 year old stoners or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ children, and you beat them so easy its not even fun."",0"
6641,SMITE,2018.0,Man on the xbox and the pc I have over 1000 hours on this game but hirez is killing it.Every god relesed is so op at launch that it makes the game not fun to play whether you are using the god or not. they also do not fix their gods making the game an unballanced mess and hirez does nothing to resolve the problems only just keep adding more gods and keep adding usless skins.But the worst thing about this game is the community behind it.they are either really terrible at the game and blame you for their own mistakes and bad judgment or they scream at you for each little mistake you do.But you cant blame the community for being bad when the developers that run the game alo treat it like crap. In my opinion this game was worth playing two years ago when hirez actually cared for their game and wanted to make it better not just try to get as much money as they can before the game dies,0
"6642,SMITE,2018.0,""It is fun and truly FREE to play. You cannot buy an advantage, you can only buy appearance. Buying new playable characters is not necessary, you can simply get them by playing the game and earning in game currency."",1"
"6643,SMITE,2017.0,""Probably my favorite game of all time, especially since I am on a budget. Its addictingly fun if MOBAs are your thing with enough differnce from generic LoL like MOBAs. Also you play as gods."",1"
"6644,SMITE,2017.0,""I have a love hate relationship with this game.  After 500 hours, I'm not better than I was at 20, or at least thats how I feel.  I guess the matchmaking is balanced enough to feel like you have a challenge everytime you play (for the most part).  I play mainly assault, so I understand a lot of edge is up to RNJesus.  Overall, I would say that it is a good game.  I will continue to play it until they stop supporting it or shut down the servers.  Yeah, there are balancing probles, yes microtransactions are way too much, and yes the community can be toxic, but the developers actually seem like they care. Please stop nerfing Khepri.  8/10"",1"
"6645,SMITE,2017.0,""now, this is a great game and I would've given it 10/10 if it wasn't for the toxic community and the lack of balance in the game. It's not normal to give a god an abillity that makes him CC and damage immune for 1 second with cooldown of 15 seconds, a healing abillity that heals every ally near you for half their hp and an abillity with 3s cooldown that can kill you on 3 shots. I don't even wanna talk about the ult. Anyways, if Hi-rez knew how to balance the game, it wouldve been perfect, but they don't and they keep releasing more and more broken gods that sometimes even receive BUFFS, instead of nerfs. Still, it's a really fun game if you want to learn how to play a god that actually needs skill. 7,5/10"",1"
"6646,SMITE,2016.0,""SMITE is a strange beast. I find myself liking it in spite of my general distaste for MOBAs, but it occupies this strange zone between that and a third-person hack-and-slash game, and I find its arena mode and diverse character roster entertaining. I am somewhat biased in the latter regard, as a friend purchased the god pack for me some time ago- part of why I keep playing it now and again, to try new gods. I have mostly played bot matches, but have found some degree of success in live versus- much more so then in League of Legends."",1"
"6647,SMITE,2016.0,""This is a one of the better MOBAs.  The Ultimate God Pack gives all current and future gods for about $30 US (depending on whether it is on sale).  I enjoy the simple Arena Mode.  It's not a perfect game, but it's worth a try because it is Free to Start."",1"
"6648,SMITE,2016.0,""Easy to begin to play, fun and satisfying gameplay. I also like the fact that the God Pack gives you all the gods (77 at time of review) and also all future gods.Mix of different gametypes to help ease into the different aspects of MOBA strategy.Really enjoying it so far."",1"
"6649,SMITE,2018.0,""Could be better if it didn't crash or freeze every time I try to play.Guess I'll just farm daily login rewards til I get every God in the game or something?Also, not as of a toxic garbage dump community as LoL or DOTA2 but it got it's foul and vile moments,that makes me wish I didn't bother with a MOBA ever again.  "",0"
"6650,SMITE,2018.0,""Download 5GB, organize HiRezUtility from somewhere within the Internet, download 18GB through HiRez Launcher, close Launcher and Steam starts at the original 5GB download again ... Don't get it through Steam."",1"
"6651,SMITE,2018.0,""I have played this game for around 5 years now, and I just wanted to write an honest review. I love this game, I always have. The idea of a MOBA in almost an FPS style is really cool, and almost seems more action orriented than other games like LOL or DOTA 2. Granted, it is harder if you can't aim or makes it EXTREMELY difficult if you are lagging, more so than other MOBAs. SMITE's god selection is really nice, with tons of creative design interpretations. However, being as they come out with new gods quicker than other games, sometimes the kits can become quite repetitive. Many gods don't have clear combos, while others do. Some I feel are just to """"get a god out"""" type of thing, but this is not always the case. A lot of gods are very creative and their kits have a lot to do with the lore behind them, which is really nice to see that the developers care enough to research those things.Skins are always a money point in these free to play games, and it isn't much different in SMITE. The one thing I find about this game which is better than other MOBAs, is that they give daily log in rewards. If you log in every day, by the end of the week you will have been rewarded 50 gems. This is nice, because even if you don't have time to play a full game, you can hop on and get the reward before  going to school, work, etc. Most skins are 250 - 600 gems, so it may take a while to get a skin using only the free method, but it is worth it. SMITE is also always giving out free stuff, with quests, events, and more. Other companies don't allow you to get the paid currency with their rewards, and it's nice to see that change. Obviously Hi-Rez has to make money, but it almost seems that they care about their completely free players a little more than most companies.My favorite aspect (although quite simple) is the joust game mode. It allows me to play at least once per day, with a shorter average game than conquest. The games are usually around 20 minutes, and are just as much fun... as long as your team isn't being toxic like they can be in other MOBAs.Overall, I really enjoy this game, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for something new to try."",1"
"6652,SMITE,2018.0,""I've put some time into this game, and I enjoyed it a lot as a casual player, however I've recently been running into a bug issue that has caused my game to freeze and crash, and I've tried everything to try and fix this, lowered my graphics settings, verified folder integrity, uninstalled and re installed, contaced Hi-rez,  which has the saddest support team, they contacted me back in a about a day, said my case would be transfered to the proper department...and nothing, I even responded to the email, to check in.. which is said to do.. and still nothing, It's a shame really, the money and time I've put into this game and they can't help me with a issue I'm having. I keep getting negetive hits, and got a """"You will be banned"""" warning due to the fact that the game keeps crashing constantly. Too afraid to even try and play a match due to the fact I might get banned, but even if I don't it still sucks because it's like I'm banned anyways because I  can't play. It's prettyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I can't recommend a game that has such horrible support for it's players."",0"
6653,SMITE,2016.0,Never played MOBA. This game I like a lot. It's very fun and quite addicting once you find yourself doing very well. Recommend to try this game if it's your first time playing a MOBA.,1
"6654,SMITE,2015.0,""After playing this game for over 200 hours off steam, ive come to the conclusion that this is the MOST Enjoyable MOBA ive ever played. There is LITERALLY no P2W anywhere in this game. It all depends on your skill, it may take time, you may get frustrated, but you will be a master of the gods."",1"
"6655,SMITE,2017.0,""Alright, to start off let me just say that this game was actually the first MOBA I played in my entire life, I never really played any at all previously but this one caught my eye due to the mythology. It's an easy game once you get used to it, a little more appealing than some of the other games out there like Dota or League of Legends, no matter how much they tell you otherwise. This game takes a little concentration but after a while you'll get used to it and no doubt enjoy it. Pros:- Wide variety of Mythological characters to fit your playstyle.- Gamemodes are easy and fun to play.- Addicting.- Always adding more and more items and gods into the game.- No need to pay anything in the game, everything is free unless you want to boost yourself and buy some gems to help out not only you, but HiRez.Cons- Teamwork is NEEDED but you don't always get it in public matches.- Some gods need obvious nerfs. - Some gods need obvious buffs.- Occasional server lag/issues.- The amount of badmouthing from other players is immense. Overall I'd play this game with a few friends, going into public matches tend to lead to bad teammates constantly badmouthing and being a general annoyance, but the gameplay and variety makes up for it in the long-haul. I definately recommend this game to anyone interested in a good and well-paced MOBA."",1"
"6656,SMITE,2016.0,""Well, I am just gonna say - that's my beloved MOBA.The concept of using GODS as champions is really interesting.I am playing since early beta, I am surprised that game is """"growing up"""" so quickly. I just do recommend that game! I met a lot of people I really like, and I am friends with them.Community may seem broken sometimes tho, but well, every MOBA has kinda broken community."",1"
"6657,SMITE,2016.0,""Hello there! Now, i've only played this game a little.... I promise. There are a few things that Hi-Rez could work on and i've emptied my wallet a few times... All have been worth it! its a great game with a great concept! With them currently enchancing old skins and even remodeling people i'm fairly confident this games easily one of my favourites"",1"
"6658,SMITE,2015.0,""This game is pay to win.How? You ask? Well, let me just say this...I was playing my first """"Casual Joust"""" match when I noticed a character was flying above me, he then landed on me and killed me with some Finger Pistols, or someâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.. Apparently  it was the god """"Apollo"""" I thought, huh, that kinda seems unfair... There's a god that can just fly above you in this game and become completely untargetable?? That's so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t!! But i let it slide... (mind you Apollo is not even a default god, and you need a currency called 'Gems' to buy gods in this game) (There is no god pack and gems are an in game currency which cost real money...) So, after my horrific encounter with apollo I queued again and I faced off against the gods """"Ao Kuang"""" """"Thanatos"""" And guess who get again? Yep, you guessed it. Apollo. I suddenly noticed that these gods can ALL take to the sky and not only that, but to top it off Ao Kuang and Thanatos ultimates just instantly kill you and there's no way to escape it, you just instantly die... And it heals Ao Kuang and then he can fly away and do even MORE damage, so after my teammate got eaten by an Ao Kuang, which then landed on me killing me? I just uninstalled. (((NONE OF THESE GODS ARE DEFAULT GODS AND ALL COST REAL MONEY) Oh yeah, and before I even started playing, there's some gods they released that they didn't even finish, causing massive balance issues. Such as Hel, Artio, and Ullr, they released them without any Ultimate Abilities which puts them at an extreme disadvantage compared to the other gods in this game. If Hi-Rez fixes these things, I will make my review positive, but as if now I can not reccomend this game.TL"
"6659,SMITE,2018.0,""This is my fourth year of playing Smite and I have loved it up until probably around the last year or so. This was my easy go to game for fun on my own or with my friends. Tonight is what finally ended it for me: there have been problems for the last few months of Hi Rez releasing overpowered gods, but the recent patch were Freya was changed finally came to create its downfall for me. I didn't feel that the most recent god, Pele, was unbalanced, and I thought that Smite might be recovering from the unfortunate recent history of making certain gods overpowerered and nerfing the heck out of gods who used to be fun to play. However, when one god (in this case Freya) can hit you for 2x your maximum health (granted I was playing a hunter), it becomes no longer fun to play the game. You try to play a god because you enjoy them, but there are broken gods still in the game that prevent you from being able to play a normal, balanced god. Your only option is to play another broken god, and the game loses its excitemnent that was arond since it first was released as a beta. I'm sorry to all of the new smite players who were hoping to join the community. It just isn't the same game it was a couple of years ago. I truely enjoyed this game once, but my time with it has come to an end."",0"
"6660,SMITE,2016.0,""In my opinion the best MOBA there is.League is changing to fast for me right now, and I could never really get the hang on DOTA while HotS, which I still play most of those three, is not competitive enough right now imo.The third person view is something that makes this game feel far more closer to everything and far less forseeable. Overall the community isn't that much different then in other games, but since you can mostly communicate via makros the flames are largely reduced.For the time being Smite will be my MOBA of choice."",1"
"6661,SMITE,2017.0,""I've been playing this for nearly a year now. Before I start, the Steam download of SMITE is buggy, so go download it from the official site. It's not as bad but still crashes and disconnects frequently. I love this game so lemme list all the cons first - yes, the game has possibly the worst hardware I've ever seen. Players get disconnected every 2 or 3 matches on average, and every patch released completely trashes the game launcher, forcing you to manually delete all game files and install the game again. And don't count on official support either, Hi-Rez clearly takes customer service lessons from EA.The community is toxic and hostile, like any other MOBAs or competitive games. Just as Russian players famously """"ruined DOTA 2 for everybody"""", Spanish and Latin American players suffer from the same notoriety in SMITE (most of the time for good reason but I won't go into the details). The EUW server is basically to be avoided at this point for people whose first (or only) language is English. I would highly recommend Hi-Rez make language-based servers just like in Star Wars The Old Republic, to help reduce cultural clashes and miscommunication - Britain is no longer part of the EU anyway so there's that.The game itself is awesome, IF you manage to get it running by some miracle of the gods - speaking of gods...oh man where do I begin. As a mythology nerd, I can say without a doubt the gods in the game are presented in respectful and lore-friendly ways 95% of the time, and SMITE  easily has the best skins in any MOBA ever. However, balancing is apparently not the primary concern of the developers, and even diehard fans of the game will admit this. I have PTSD from Loki's sound effects and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Guardians deal way too much damage, and matchmaking is so broken even famous SMITE youtubers make fun of it (see Mythymoo).Despite all its flaws, SMITE is good, immersive fun. The 3rd person mode combat makes everything feel more alive and engaging, and that's probably the best thing about SMITE. The sound design department deserves a raise as well. I wish there was lore explaining why the gods are all fighting each other, but that's not central to the game. You won't care why because the sheer notion of gods fighting each other is awesome enough on its own. My favourite gods are Chinese, and I highly recommend Ao Kuang, the Dragon King of the Eastern Seas - he's very hard to master but you can literally eat other gods with his ult. Nuff said. And then there's everybody's favourite monkey, Sun Wukong. Dynasty Warrior fans will also be pleased to know Guan Yu is in the game as well, and his beard and Green Dragon Crescent blade are awesome as always. 7/10 - not a perfect game, but best MOBA out there right now."",1"
"6662,SMITE,2018.0,""Though steam only shows that I have 750+ hours you can look up my smite guru account that will show that I have 2500+ hours of in match time in this game. It is hands down the game I have played the most in the last 7 years. It has all the addictive draw of a game like league of legends, champion/god lore. Loot boxes. Pvp. Many uniquie heros/abilites, with almost no long term thought, or short term fixes. This game will hook you, if you are someone like myself. There is a certain level of surface polish, but nothing past that. They add in addition after addition, and never back up any of their promises. They added in clan rewards over 2 years ago, that could be completed in 2 months, then haven't touched on them in years. Many of the games, gods voice packs are still incomplete after an update 3-4 years ago. Higher lvl, none exclusive skins cost around 15 dollar a pop. And exclusive-limited skins are either stuck in gambling chest or behind other limiters that can range for 45 dollars to 100+.You can, of course play without skins, so that isn't a massive drawback. But gods, relivancey is tied to their skin releases in some cases. Some gods recieve an uncalled for buff, and next week, a new skin comes out. Thinking that players will now buy it because said god is now in the meta. The game is rampant with bugs/crashes but they choose to focus on skins, jump stamps, and other flavor things instead of the things that will illeviate some of the rage that this game induces. I would happily pay money for this game to not release a new god, or skin for 6 months. If they solely focused of issues causing errors, reconnection issues, bugs, UI, balance, optimization etc.From someone who has a very love hate relationship with this game. The players can be """"toxic"""" as in much other mobas, but there is no love in care here from delevopers. Watch one of their cringe inducing patch note shows, there is a thin veiled facade, they are trying to sell you skins and gods. And that this where their focus lies. I understand, it's a bussiness. But I would be happy supporting a bussiness that is focus 1st on a good player experience and second on selling me skins.  As apposed to the other way around. HiRez is a small company is comparison to most, and due to their choices ( and miniscule lack of marketing [rivialing most stupid mobile phone games with facebook banner ads]) they will stay this way, and SMITE like all other of their properties will die out within the next 5 years. TLDR: If you are looking for a 3D moba play it. Don't invest your money in skins, cause the game won't be long lasting. If you are fine dropping money on the god back, that is fine. You'll have fun. But grow frustrated with this companies focus if you pay attention to where they spend their resorces."",0"
"6663,SMITE,2016.0,""The most toxic player base outside of rocket league, no ban system in place, money grabbing developers, the nail in the coffin was the """"damage increase"""" which turns the game away from tactical moba combat and just aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥fest."",0"
"6664,SMITE,2018.0,""Good game bad community. Honestly any other MOBA is more worth your time I got trapped because unfortunately this is the MOBA that I learned and got good at and it just so happens to be the one with the worst playerbase and a dying E-Sports scene. I'd reccomend that you learn any other MOBA for instance: League of Legends or Dota or consider avoiding the genre entirely, don't waste your time. After nearly 900 hours I'm freeing myself goodbye."",0"
"6665,SMITE,2018.0,""Here is my honest review. At this point, I can't recommend this game to anyone. The community is terrible, as well as the updates that the soyboys at HiRez HQ are releasing. Take the time out of your day to find a different game to play because this one isn't changing anytime soon, and it's actually getting increasingly worse because they're trying to squeeze more and more money out of their dying community. I would avoid downloading smite."",0"
"6666,SMITE,2018.0,""From my prespective, smite is only good for a few things. The items, such as skins and frames etc which just make you look coolerThe reason(s) I don't like this gameThe towers do no damage to enemie gods which allow them to just a tank a tower and kill you if you're low which makes absoultely no sense, as a TOWER should be a source of protectionAlso The matchmaking system for casual is absolutely GARBAGE as you get put up against these unfair teams when you try to play as a squad with friends. for e.g. if you went off smite for a few weeks, you'll come back to being against rank 40+ which is just utterly bsThis game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awful Their are so many broken â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing gods It's unbelievable and you would think Hi-rez would fix it in patches. But they dont They just bring our more and more gods. This game is so unbalanced its unbelievable. So dont get this game unless you want to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kill yourself or you're depressedNote: This game is losing players due to these â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing new gods so the player count will drop more and more over the next few months so play it while your depressed."",0"
"6667,SMITE,2017.0,""What a heart-wrenching review that I feel the necessity to write. My Steam hours are but a mere fraction of the actual amount of time I've invested into this game. I played long before Smite's steam client debut (and what an intial disaster that was).Over the course of time, I've played this game less, and less. I started playing around the time of Xbalanque release, I played on Pandorum eSports in Season 2 and then subsituted for AFK Gaming's Challenger Cup Team in Season 3. In short, I no longer have fun or enjoy this game. I have never been as frustrated or angry at a game as I ever have been with Smite. Hi-Rez has a very infamous streak of making amazing games, there isn't a shred of doubt in my mind that the games they make have nothing short of amazing potential. The fault lies when they stop listening to their fan base. Hi-Rez employees for the most part are overwhelmingly unprofessional, disrespectful, and have no moral compass when regarding their players, or their paying customers. Whilst I feel that the argument of """"I'm a paying customer, therefore I am always right and deserve respect"""" is completely illogical, there comes a point where you are at least respectful enough to hear the complaints, constructive criticism, and voices of your fanbase. What's worse, is they don't listen to their professional players either. The players who have hundreds of hours if not thousands just simply theory crafting, crunching numbers, and taking their position very seriously, are completely disregarded in regards to balance. Their focus has been more streamlined in the direction of skins, adventure events, and things of the like, rather than balancing their game, and listening to no one but themselves. Matchmaking is nothing short of atrocious. You would imagine that a player with an upwards of 3,000 hours, would be matched against players of their same skill platform, instead, I am often paired with players with sub 1,000 hours, to even fresh accounts. My elo is in the top 5% of all players, and not only do I get paired with new players, but I get paired with toxic players who are self-proclaimed good players with less than a 50% win ratio. Now all of that aside, let's turn a blind eye to the disrespectful attitude of Hi-Rez employees, and the terrible matchmaking followed by a focus on aesthetic, useless content that holds no substance beyond distinguishing yourself with a unique skin. The bugs. The amount of bugs in this game are absolutely absurd. Fix one, create two more. This phrase can apply to nearly every patch to be released to date.The entire consensus of what I'm trying to say is, if you're considering playing this game, stay away. It is a horrible example of what a game should look like in terms of it's business structure and how it's handled. If you don't believe me, try it for yourself, and give it a week or so, and you'll see what I mean."",0"
6668,SMITE,2017.0,Great game with amazing replayability. Been playing for years and they still consistently release new content. I play every day and all the different combat situations never get boring. Great overall game!,1
"6669,SMITE,2018.0,""compared to dota and lol this game's abilities are boring as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and every time i see a new god release i hope they have interesting abilities but its always the same old  """"deal damage in a aoe"""" or """"hit the enemy with a certain part of the ability for more damage or cc"""" except for a few needless to say dont play thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥if you dont want boring ability design"",0"
"6670,SMITE,2017.0,""Free to play, without constantly being bugged with microtransactions. Overall it is a solid game, and with the number of gods it takes quite a bit of time to really learn how their abilities can work together. I would consider this game relatively easy to pick up and play but it will take you some time to really master the finer details. Give it a shot, its free and if you happen to hate it you can just delete it."",1"
6671,SMITE,2017.0,Smite. The Third Person MOBA. Legit the only reason that my friends had got me to download the game was the third person aspect. I'm not interested in the MOBA genre of games but the fact that this is third person makes it that much better and a whole lot more entertaining. What is LoL or DOTA? MEGALUL,1
"6672,SMITE,2017.0,""Matchmaking is not  that  bad, but there is room for some improvments specially in ranked duel.also this is not p2w by any means, sure there are some paid events here and there but they don't affect gameplay at alland the community is not toxic compared to other games like cs:go.if you end up playing this game  please please please  don't instalock  I admit i used to do it alot one last thing : LOKI = CANCER just don't pick him, OK?"",1"
"6673,SMITE,2015.0,""I can't recommened this game in its current state...Nobody in casual matches has a proper grasp on how to play, and almost everyone is plain toxic.Furthermore, Matching-making is a nightmare. The Dev team recently added """"prestige levels"""" for players to level up passed the previous level 30 cap, but I just use it to see who I'm being put up against in a match. Myself, a level 127 player, has constantly been placed against people below level 100, and it gets a little bit frustrating.Smite's main gamemode, Conquest, is the least played gamemode because of it's drastic and impossible learning curve. Only players who have been playing since day one, and have been evolving with it can properly play. Conquest in it current state is much too """"snow-bally"""" to be an enjoyable experience, and the worst thing is. Most of the people on the deisgn and balance team don't even play Ranked! It's absurd! Not to mention too much time and effort goes into skins...Also, every other God release isâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥poor. A lot of them end up being eye-candy Godesses, to pander to the new, younger men playing the game. And their ability kits suffer because of it, with little to no synergy in them at all. It's just heartbreaking that it's gotten this bad, compared to the old design team's releases.Lastly, Osiris hasn't been nerfed yet. A character that has been overpeforming at the mid and highest level of play, hasn't been nerfed yet because of his underperformance in casual matches.So, yeah... Maybe wait until it gets a new Lead Designer, or until Season 5. It's supposed to be great! But I'm not getting my hopes up."",0"
"6674,SMITE,2018.0,""Fun stuff. Easy to control and utilize abilities, all gods are unique. This leads to some interesting combinations. Better than league. A lot of gods to choose from and lots of unique game modes as well. Smite fills the gap where LoL lacks IMHO."",1"
"6675,SMITE,2016.0,""As a huge lover of Mythology, I can honestly say that SMITE has stayed true to the various beliefs and cultures it derives its playable gods from. I can highly recommend this game, as the community are extremely forgiving and generally not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s (looking at you, LOL and DOTA).

Don't get into it. SMITEs prime time is over. And alot of my money aswell. If I only knew how it would change...I would not have wasted that much time on it.

"6685,SMITE,2018.0,""They cannot balance this game correctly to save their lives, crazy unbalance across gods, items being buffed and nerfed every patch but never even balanced, therefore not only changing the meta every two weeks and forcing people to constantly have to learnâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥that will only be changed the following two weeks but also just not allowing any chance for routine or just enough time for a proper meta to be established. As a whole the annoying things are poor mechanics. I just completed a game where I was playing Arachne and I had used my ultimate. Whilst in this ability I am supposed to be immune to all damage, mind you this was mid way through the ability, not in the charge up. During this so called immune ultimate, I was killed by another Arachne, therefore cancelling the whole principle of my ultimate ability. One of the few multiple occasions where this game has just not worked well. Look, it is a great game and I have spent a large majority of time on it, something always makes me come back, but for players like me, being around in the community for such a long time (since beta on other accounts), it frustrates me how little I get in returrn for my playing hours, there is no way that I, as a long time player, get rewarded for my loyalty. I still get terrible matchmaking, an abundance of bugs and just a series of unfun games where I'm stuck in a rut, not getting matched with people even close to my level. I literally get matched with first time conquest players when I have 1000+ games under my belt. This is not me gloating, this is just five seasons of built up overall distaste of a lack of passion by the creators. It doesn't help that every new player thinks they are god's gift and doesn't listen to or even accept someone trying to help them learn the game. It's an absolute shambles but I've never complained before and I feel as a dedicated member in the community I should have my fair say. Also OCE has no ranked scene. Peace."",1"
"6686,SMITE,2018.0,""I have played this game for 4 years. I have 1600 hrs of GAME TIME and I installed this game off steam about 2 years after playing it. Smite has had its ups and downs and though people might think the developers are terrible, they are so interactive with the community and are improving more and more. Since season 5 had come out, this game's playerbase has sky-rocketed and the match making is 10x better with ranked queues popping much more offen. In seasons 3 and 4 from someone who plays on oceanic servers (i'm from australia) this game felt pretty much dead by the end of season 4. We had high hopes for season by with the game having a massive update/make-over. As of right now, i would highly recomend this game. It is not pay to win, the first 15 or so gods you are able to play with will be enough for you just getting into this game. 10 of thouse gods rotate over month so you will be able to try all gods in games. You can also try any gods you want in jungle practice, or just by the god pack which gives you all the gods and every god released each month after. All in all, you should start getting into this game now, what is there to lose. You will probably get hoocked like i did.REMEMBER, your first experiences on this game are decided upon what you chose to do and play. Dont make your first 10 agmes be conquest. It is a hard, and punishing gamemode to start with. It gets fun when you have good knowlage about the game and its mechanics. Play other gamemodes first like arena. You learn everything you need to know about the gods, items and abilities of the games and you will discover what you like about that class of gods. When you do decide to play conquest, keep in mind this game is like any other moba, YOU NEED TO CALL A ROLE. if you don't know much about conquest there are plenty of ways to learn, like on youtube. I recomend looking up smite conquest tutorials for new players. A youtuber like DukeSloth makes great videos like thoughs.Have fun palying this amazing game. Don't rage quit after one game. With many people looking to pick this game up in season 5, there will be plenty of other new people with you. Keep persisting and try new things. Also if you are starting your first conquest games, let other players know that you are new. They will understand and will gladly help you.Go on, give this game a try."",1"
"6687,SMITE,2018.0,""When they fix the servers and minor bugs, this game is gonna be great. Be ready to have a constant 120 ping when playing this game in its current state. The meta is whack but you can eaisly adapt to it. Its a solid 4/10 right now, but when Hi-Rez gets they'reâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥together, it can be a 8-10/10."",1"
"6688,SMITE,2017.0,""I am primarily a LoL player, but lately I have been interested in other mobas. I took a look at Dota 2 and Smite, and Smite is a very interesting game.     Right away you notice a huge difference between it and other mobas, being the over the shoulder perspective. I love this, because it allows people to sneak up on enemies for ganks. The game is easy to run, like other mobas, so that isn't a concern. I'm not a big fan of the oversexualization in this game, but it's tolerable. I very much recommend this game to casual and more competetive gamers, just because of how easy to run and deep it is. If you like classic mobas, but aren't the biggest fan of the bird's eye view, this is perfect for you.     I think you should try it out if you aren't sure. It's free, so you have nothing to lose.EDIT: Reading other reviews, ignore the people complaining about the community. If you want to play an online game, they all haveâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥communities. If you really can't stand the community, play with your friends. Do normal games and add the decent people to play with them again."",1"

I have the luck of having such friend, one of them, who got hooked with this game along with me. Sadly for Steam statistics we play on PS4, and don't really know if that account can be used for playing here as well.I don't have to tell you which type of game Smite is, what I can tell you though is that Smite gives me great instafun, me been a busy family guy turns that aspect of the game a massively good feature.Progression is deep enough to keep interest alive, and playing on my PS4, along with my pal makes for great laughter and good times.A must for social players."",1"
6692,SMITE,2018.0,Ive been playing smite for a long time and it is unplayable now the game is slowly dying they say that matchmaking is going to get better but they seem to be making it worse then it already is hi rez has already accepted that the game is going to die in the next year and they are trying to milk what little cash it has now its a shame because the game has so much potential but with hi rez it cant be brought to its full potential,0
"6693,SMITE,2018.0,""One of the worst example of poor developing and illiterate, smurf community in a game out there.- Matchmaking can't be fixed for 2 seasons now- Repeatedly reports do nothing to people who continue to harass and leave.- No hardware optimization- Every season the whole game's mechanics change leading to a downfall- Ranked climbing resets after each split leaving no mood and actual effort for rank up"",0"
"6694,SMITE,2018.0,""If you're not into smite already, there is nothing for you here. The game has been on a steady downward slope for sometime now and it doesn't seem to be chaging direction. I have spent so much time on this game, and at the end of I feel like I've wasted all that time and money. There was a time where I really enjoyed logging on and playing all the different gods that there are to chose. With over 90 gods, non of them look in anyway interesting, I never know what I want to play and I don't even enjoy any match whether I'm winning or losing. It's not even fun to talk trash to other people anymore, so whats the point. The company doesn't really care about the game, their using it as a stepping stone for their future projects, so theres no real reason to take the time to be even half decent at the game. I started out playing in season 3 with a bunch of friend that have been playing since the Beta days, and by the time I understood the basic mechanics of the game they dropped smite, and now I see why. The game isn't fun, no one is having fun, all people do are get angry and whine to eachother."",0"
6695,SMITE,2016.0,This game was one of my first Moba games I've ever played... the first being LOL(League of Legnds) and I highly recommend this on over any others. The game itself is pretty well balnced and makes you feel like you are a god.. dont get me wrong though there are a few gods that still need to be balanced but the enjoyment I have playing this game is secon to none. The best skins ever are in this game and they are fairly priced in my opinion. Overall this game is great and its free so download it already and become the god you were meant to be!,1
"6696,SMITE,2017.0,""recommend this game :D very happy to make this choice for this game .. after 301 hours of this game i was sattisfied so i bought the ultimate god pack so worth it,, and the best it all the in game favor i used to buy gods... i auctually got all of it back very glad on this ... this is totally worth it :D"",1"
"6697,SMITE,2018.0,""this game is complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ rofl its impossible to get into the game as a new player because for the most part you get matched against egotistical acne â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who live to smurf on a dead game because its the only thing they have ever been decent at. havent played in months and i decide to play just to realize that i have to wait in a q just to wait again for another q just to play CASUALS. then when i finally get into the game, the players on my team are new and the opposite team is filled with experienced players that are completely merciless and treat it like its easy bots, using their best ranked characters with stupid high stats (against lv 8's btw). the community is also cancer and i would even go as far as comparing it to osrs."",0"
6698,SMITE,2017.0,definately the best moba ever made. it feels much more fast pace when you're in 3rd person mode instead of the top down look most mobas have. artstyle of the game is also very well executed. would highly recommend it to everyone even people who dont like mobas because i did not like any mobas untill i played SMITE.,1
"6699,SMITE,2018.0,""I never thought I could spend so many time in a game. I'm not a multiplayer gamer nor a competitor. However, when you finally pick a god that fits your style of combat, you want to become better and better. You polish your skills and see the results. At this point, you become aware of the capabilities and limits of your god. You see when he can be very dangerous or very weak. But you have to experiment this against all the gods and adapt your tactics. As an Arena Mode player in assassin style, I always hit and run, keeping myself mobile, checking my distance with the opponent and strike where he doesn't wait me. I support the main assault with flanking manoeuvers, divide the opposite team to spread them out. But you have to synchronise yourself with your team to maximise the results. Don't stay alone, it's a TEAM based game. And that's why you should have a friend or more to play with to become more effective.  Smite offers many gods to play with. But to handle only one of them it takes time. Despite of lack of balance between them for some ones, the real strenght of a god depends on how you use it. Also, don't be afraid to try the various game modes which require different strategy each time.It's not a pay to win here. Everything can be done in game and if you want to spend money, it's for cosmetics. That's a good point when you know many companys like to play with our wallet today. Sadly, I must say that the game became more and more unstable recently. Now I always play 1/3 match with someone quitting the game for whatever reason. If not in my team, it's the opposite. That kills the fun."",1"
"6700,SMITE,2018.0,""Everything posted below is completely based on my own personal opinion and experience when playing the game.Positive:- Unique view on the different gods (the style and voice packs)- Voice packs- 3rd person MOBA- Not a baaad community...not great either- pretty good graphics- Not bad music- interesting chat system using voice guided chat (Example: just type """"without hitting enter to chat) VVGG to say Good Game)- Ra's laugh (to laugh do above but press VEL)Negative:- bad matchmaking system, a level 1 just starting out gets put against lvl 30s (and if u are in a party, prepare to always go against stupidly high lvls and high mmr players)- consistant launcher problems, whether through their site, or through steam and no realy """"fix"""" for any of them.- Smite Tech people seem clueless when trying to help with any technical problems and the community usually helps then the techs just copy and paste- Community can be a tad salty and toxic """"telling them to gear down seems to help some""""- HiRez seems to not really care about their community (personal opinion)I know it says i only have 10 hours on this game, but i have played it since open beta, over all however I think you should get this game, just dont try to go in and be serious about it because you will have a very stressful day....assuming I can ever get the game to work again I tend to play it again.

"6701,SMITE,2017.0,""I have more than 2k hours of playing this game now with a high elo in some gamemodes like arena and assault. And how do I get rewarded for those achievements? I get paired with people who don't even have 50 hours of gameplay against a team of balanced players. You see, because I have a high elo, Hirez's algorithm thinks that if I get paired with people with low elo, my elo will balance it out to a regular match. So I go positive or almost in all my games, almost always top dmg, and still can't win because I get at LEAST a lvl 20 feeder every match... The worst part is that when you try to give tips to those people on how to get better, they get really defensive and toxic... This really, really ruined the game to the point that it's completely unplayable for me. It's been a problem for years, but recently, it's been the worst it's ever been for me"",0"
6702,SMITE,2017.0,Very good game and an alternative to League of Legends. The one downside is that if you play on a different console your profile and everything you have earned will not sync. I have many hours logged onto the PS4 but my achievements and unlocks did not sync with my online HiRez account despite having them linked. Still recommend to play this incredibly fun and addictive game.,1
"6703,SMITE,2017.0,""Although the community can be quite toxic and there are a few balance issues, I recommened this if you have friends to play with. Getting into a voice chat and playing with a good friend is the most fun I've had this summer."",1"

"6707,SMITE,2016.0,""Pros:It's a MOBA, but it gives you an over-the-shoulder view with WASD movements rather than mouse-based movements.Unlike other MOBAs, basic attacks require aiming.Interesting playable characters based on gods, goddesses, and monsters from mythology.Cons:Although balance has improved in my opinion (So long golden bow! I still don't miss you in the slightest!) it will still require a lot of work to make sure the game is as balanced as it should be."",1"

6709,SMITE,2015.0,This is a MOBA and a very unique one that is more skiled based then traditional MOBA's it adds action with 3rd person view for a truly unique experience.

"6714,SMITE,2017.0,""Personal Experience: This game is amazingly fun and addictive. I love the differnt modes, and how the creators constantly update and upgrade the game. Gamplay: Smite is a third person lane stratagy game. For new players you start with the five basic gods one for each class, plus an additonal random five gods that cycle weekly allowing you to test every charchter eventually.-Ymir- -Neith--Ra--Thor--Guan Yu-The five classes areGuardian: A tank based class that is normally used as a bullet sponge and to protect the sqhishy members of your team.Hunter: A DPS (Damage per second) based class that most of the time used attack speed and criticals to finish enemies.Mage: Either Damage dealers/Support classes. Mages can deal outragous damage or buff your team to victory.Assassins: I don't need to explain this class their a both hated and loved class lol.Warriors: A blend of offensive and defensive abilties warriors can bring the pain and tank when needed.There are around 75 gods to choose from and unlock.

"6721,SMITE,2018.0,""Played this game for awhile and decide to make a review.    The game was really well when i first played and has slowly been ruined by the addition of constant new broken gods, which after complaints from the community get a nerf that has nothing realating to the actual problem, the fact there hasn't been a skin you can directly buy other than chests and constant adventures/bundles for months, and the general toxicity of most players.    I'll continue to play but i highly recommend new players avoid this game until positive change comes about."",0"
"6722,SMITE,2017.0,""Please note, my hours played are highly unnaccurate. I've clocked roughly 300+ hours, prior to having a Steam account.As someone whose first MOBA was League of Legends, Smite was really a breath of fresh air for me. The grapics are simply amazing, and it feels like a large step up for a MOBA game compared to others out there. The one thing that blew me away is just how many events and how many skins you can buy with Favor, the currency you get just from playing games. Skins bought with Favor are basically just recolors, but it's still more than most free to play games would give you.Smite brings the action right into your face, as you play from an over-the-shoulder camera angle"
"6723,SMITE,2017.0,""A good MOBA experience with interesting a various characters. More stable balancing than other Hirez games.

6725,SMITE,2017.0,a complete free to play moba. Seriously I have not bought any hero/god in this game for real money. I only bought gems for real money to supprot this awesome game. give it a try if you if you are familiar with getting flamed by some casual player.PS: the 3rd person view brings more action into the game.

6727,SMITE,2017.0,played in 2014 and 2017 Very fun game althoughn i swear hades was a guardian anyway.Community is pretty trash btu you do come across some really friendly peopleAll the characters are unique and tehy're also gods which is interestinggraphics lookm very goodThe game modes really switch up the gameplay and are very fun,1
"6728,SMITE,2017.0,""A great alternative to other MOBAs if you're looking for something that changes the formula enough to spice it up, while still staying true to its roots. There are plently of interesting characters to choose from, which are all based on mythological gods/figures (which can be pretty interesting in its own right, seeing the team's interpretation of said figures), and I feel Hi-Rez has done a great job of keeping each of the gods feeling quite unique so that you never really feel like any are too similar to other gods (something League has been guilty of recently, though it's still my favorite MOBA for other reasons). The main place it gets points of League, though, is in the variety of game modes available. There's the traditional 5v5, there's a 3v3, a 5v5 with 2 lanes that leads to a more chaotic game with less jungle focus, a 4v4 siege mode, a 5v5 arena mode that can be fun if you don't have much time, an ARAM mode, and a final limited game mode that change out daily. Additionally, the Ultimate God Pack is a great â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing deal to anyone planning on spending any real amount of time playing. For $30, you get every god currently available and every god that will ever be released. Not a bad deal at all, and it allows you to use the in-game currency you acquire for other things, like skins.My only real complaint with the game is that most of my friends from League refuse to pick up Smite, so I'm mostly left queuing with randos. Which does limit the fun of a team-based game a bit. I've seen a lot of complaints about the toxicity of the community, but it doens't seem any worse than other MOBA's communities in my experience. It could be that I don't play ranked much, and also tend to avoid the generic/classic 5v5 mode because it's not as fun to me. I feel like people are more relaxed on other game modes too. I went on for way longer than I meant to. It's a good game. Try it, it's free."",1"
6729,SMITE,2016.0,I have been playing this game for over 2 years now and it is possibly one of my favorite games. Hirez community is amazing and the only issue is the god balancing is askew sometimes.,1
"6730,SMITE,2018.0,""This game is really fun to play with friends. I am not a fan of some of the female designs in it, but with most the skins later fix the issues. They make it easy to earn gems and honor to get new heroes and the class and playstyle are expansive. I used to play league- and this game seems to lack a lot of the toxicity thus far in players. I have yet to run across the chat spamming you see in OW and League."",1"
"6731,SMITE,2016.0,""I have played this gem of a game a total of 287 hours before it was available on Steam and I could start playing it on my Steam account.I started playing SMITE in open beta. I even had a closed beta key, but stupid me didn't start playing SMITE back then because the premise of a MOBA sounded boring. I had no idea. Well, SMITE could be called the non-boring MOBA.This is a full action game you play in 3rd person, so you can enjoy the beautiful levels and the even more beautiful ability effects from a decent angle of view. Even better is you can enjoy the look of the gods and their many awesome skins from up close.The gameplay doesn't lack either. Once you know how to upgrade abilities and when to purchase which item, casual play (which I prefer, but SMITE has a huge competitive scene with leagues etc if you prefer that) is a lot of fun and will entertain you for many hours, especially because you can choose from many different gods to play, as well as a good selection of different game modes.Gods? Yes, you play gods. This game doesn't feature unknown fantasy characters with a lame backstory, instead you play one of currently (January 2016) 73 gods (and some mythical demons and monsters), like Thor, Freya, Athena, Ares, Isis, Osiris, Hercules, Mercury, Kali, Rama, Kukulkan, Chaac, Sun Wukong, Chang'e and, recently (January 2016) introduced, Amaterasu as first goddess of the Japanese Pantheon.It is likely that more pantheons will be added in the future.The fact that you are an actual god in a battle for the heavens makes this game feel more epic than other MOBAs, which is supported by the scenery, items and music in the game.This is a free to play game which has an acceptable in-game economy. There is no pay to win at all in this game, everything you buy for real money is cosmetic, from avatars, skins, voice packs to music or announcer packs. All gods can be unlocked by playing other gods (you get a selection of gods for free when starting the game), and many skins and other items can be unlocked by playing as well.The only thing you could say against SMITE is that a game can swing to one side a little too quickly. However, even in the SMITE world championship we have seen interesting turns in a game, so the imbalance is perfectly acceptable.I can recommend this game even to people who think MOBAs are boring. You will probably be disabused of this notion like me."",1"
"6732,SMITE,2018.0,""I personally have a love/hate/heroin relationship with this game, I love the gods, and the maps, I hate the toxic and rambo type of players on this game, and as for the heroin part I cant get enough of the MOTD's some of them are epic and you just wanna keep playing them. I have also uninstalled this game 1 time due to the constant trolls and or """"An ally has left the game"""" I can't remember...."",1"
6733,SMITE,2016.0,Played over 1300 hours of this game on the normal version of it I love this game and the only thing I dislike about this game. Is the developers. Low-Rez are some of the worst developers I have ever seen for any game. They push out new games and always follow trends. They never create original ideas. And have no clue how to balance the game.,1
"6734,SMITE,2017.0,""So apparently when the community says, """"we want shorter queue times"""" I guess what Hi-Rez thinks they meant is lets make super long queue times for the majority of the day and only a couple hours with short queue times. Before the split patch I was getting sub minute queues with an occacional queue that was over a minute. Now we get locked queue times that are way longer than if I just queued normally before this patch.1/10 "",0"
"6735,SMITE,2018.0,""The game itself would be fine if it was run by a company that actually tested their game.They ignore the PTS, they ignore bugs that have been happening for years. They ignore blatant cheating in their games.You'd honestly be better off playing any other MOBA for a more enjoyable experience. Even HoTS has a more active playerbase."",0"
"6736,SMITE,2018.0,""Smite is probably the best MOBA out there. Whilst LoL and DOTA focus on a birds-eye perspective, Smite gets right into the action in third person, skill shot based gameplay. Using mythical deities from global pantheons such as the ancient Greeks, the ravenous Mayans or even the newest pantheons being Voodoo, Slavic and Polynesian, there is a character that represents apart of almost every single corner in the world. With almost 100 mostly different characters to choose from, there is something for everyone. Whilst, not every release can be as unique as Ganesha or The Morrigan (especially with the latest Chernebog being unpopular in the community) the game has endless combinations of team comps and thus provides a lot of fun. Especially with a two-week update rotation, there is constantly something being added, whether a new god or game mode or much needed balance. Balance is not the best in smite, its arguably one of its weak points. The meta is constantly changing and for new players, it may be difficult to get into the competetive scene. Yet with constant updates, this isn't always a problem. Monetization is strictly cosmetics. Loot boxes are a thing, however, the recent and fairly priced daily bundles, give you random exclusive skins for around $10. You can also earn premium currency in game for logging in daily or gem storm events. One issue, however, is there are constantly events back to back, giving no rest to a collector. Limited skins pop up left and right and it does get tiring seeing your favorite character get a new limited skin but not being able to purchase it due to spending your money on the last limited skin a week ago. There is a lot of free items given out however, you can get free items for winning games and leveling up will earn you previously exclusive items.The esports side is professionally handled and enjoyable to watch. With all its faults, Smite is a really good MOBA that I'd suggest everyone try. While it can be frustrating at times, Hi-Rez usually always comes through and responds to its community. Toxicity is a problem in any game and smite is no different, but ignoring negative players through the mute button is as easy as a click, and the newly added commendation system encourages positivity. Overall, smite is enjoyable and provides something for everyone. Despite its few issues in balancing and player toxicity, pass that is a game worthwhile."",1"

"6739,SMITE,2017.0,""Fun to play for a while, really enjoyed it. Played a lot of AI to practice and played mostly arena. There are certainly issues with the game, for instance how long it takes to unlock the gods without buying the $30 god pack. But the one really terrible aspect was the matchmaking. I had very few close matches. And if I won a match, the next time I played, no one seemed to have a clue. It was as if the game saw you win a couple and stacked a team against you to make you lose. It got to the point where I really have trouble wanting to log in to a match. It was very similar to Paladins. Too many one sided matches. Too many times the teams should have been mixed up. You can tell when one team has borders, High fantasy points, higher god levels against a team full of level 1 gods with the basic default everything. Feels pointless and demoralizing. Maybe Hi Rez doesn't care about anything but E-Sports, or they don't know how to match people of similar skill. Don't know but I stopped playing Paladins because of it and I am most likely going to stop playing Smite. There are better games that have developement teams dedicated to gameplay rather than just E-Sports and Cash Shops. (Dont mind the cash shops and the cool skins, but when you play 6 matches in a day and get stomped each time, you can't get enough points to get the cool stuff.) Most losses came from playing with people who had no clue how the game worked, didnt buy items, ran in and died everytime, or could not follow up anything. Soooo, I would recommend trying the game out, but don't spend any money unless its a game you really really feel your gonna be dedicated even when matchmaking sucks the soul out of you. As for me, I've had much more frequent fun, close games with Overwatch, Dota2 and LoL."",1"
"6740,SMITE,2018.0,""Decent MOBA to play, especially with friends. Huge playable god pool, and all of them feel unique to the game. Several different game modes that are all enjoyable. Ranked play for those competitive folks out there. God balance seems decent"
"6741,SMITE,2017.0,""A different level of MOBA where you have to skillshot your normal attacks and most abillities, a different point of view where you can't see Loki sneaking behind you, and different maps/game mode. Also, Kappa xD"",1"
"6742,SMITE,2018.0,""I have 2,107 hours on this game, it's a fun game. I recommend it unless you get mad and salty quick then don't play it. I like how the developers update the game every week with new content. Overall this game is a must."",1"
"6743,SMITE,2015.0,""I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!! Its quite difficult but that makes it BETTER.There are a few kinks but thats to be expected! Everything seems quite balanced the only issue i have specifically with this game is that some of the items and main ideas that are introduced and essential to a moba are rather obscure. But thats just cuz im a noob to mobas everything seems really well thought out and i LOVE the idea of using gods instead of random people that the devolopers will spend maybe 10 minutes on thinking of. I feel that with the right community reception this game will dethrone league of legends and dota 2 especially since its a little easier to understand. As a complete scrub when it comes to MOBAS this game is definitely more attractive to me than the others simply because i mainly play FPS and this is 3rd person so it still has an """"in the battlefield"""" kind of play. plus as a moba its just superior to most fps games because it requires you to ACTUALLY PLAY THE OBJECTIVE. Im just scared of how the community will go, if this games community ends up like counterstrike im gonna cry because counterstrikes community is so toxic i need a gas mask JUST TO PLAY CASUAL OR DEATHMATCH. I think this games going to do well tho it really just comes down to the devs the games off the floor and in the air people are playing time to make them stay. anyway i give this game a 10/10 simply because the only things i have against it are the cries of a scrub and im sure after a few hours of messing around ill get the hang of it PLAY THIS GAME ITS HARD BUT ITS FUN AND WORTH IT."",1"
6744,SMITE,2017.0,Worlds okayest MOBA.EDIT: I quit the game and uninstalled. BEWARE: The community is cancer. Worse. Most of the time you'll be fighting your teammates in the chat rather than enemy gods on the field. Mute everyone and you'll be fine.,1
"6745,SMITE,2016.0,""This game, this game. Is honestly...Awesome- I loved mostly every second that went into playing this game. It's fun, it's challenging, team work is pretty meh but when you come across a good team every now and then that actually wants to cooperate with you- It's golden. This game isn't perfect, it has it's issues such as some balancing and a few bugs that happen, some crashing. I've had to re-install this game numerous times just to get it to work again. I love this game so much. Yet at the same time this game has given me head ache's plenty of times as well.If your looking for a fun cooperative MOBA that's a step different than League or Dota 2 then this is a fun, somewhat relaxing change from the norm. It's got a somewhat strange learning curve with some gods while other's litteraly all you have to do is spam the 3 2 1 on your keyboard and watch as the quadra kill's rise. Now the difficult question is- why am I giving this a bad review exactly? That's a question I asked myself when I wrote this. As wonderfully fun this game is, it has what seems to me. A pretty awful problem. That's the match making. Now am screaming that the kids on the other side are better than me as I autistically slam my fists on the keyboard. No, it's not that at all. It's the latency issues this game seems to have cursed me with. I'll sometimes have perfect 60 ping games in which I'm at my best, and then the next game I'll be thrown into 160-200+ ping servers in which I'm litteraly as useless as a moldyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Do I have bad interenet, no. Though I never have these ping issues in any other of my games. Just painfully to say, this one. Sadly I'm not the only person to have this issue happen to, some of my friends encountered the same as well as some others sprawled across forums in confusion. Though no one seems to have a good answer besides saying it's just matchmaking with a simple shrug.As much as I want to give this game a better review and put many more details as to why and yada yada. Sadly this is the worst issue I've come across. Should you not play the game at all? Course not- Play the game to hell if you like it, or just want to try it. And hopefully you won't have the numberous issues, bugs and worst of all the latency hell that I seem to crawl through. And just simply enjoy the game.TL"
"6746,SMITE,2018.0,""After achieving 1000 hours in this game, I can say that this game is fun as hell. Pros-High ReplayabilityEvery game feels different and refreshing. No game can feel the same.-Aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ton of godsA god to fit pretty much every type of playstyle possible.Cons-Horrible matchmakingIt works. Thats it. Id be matched with noobs on my team and people all my skill level on the enemy team. No this isnt a luck thing. Many other people have the same issue. They said they are working on it but that was a season ago. If you want decent matchmaking be on around 11-7. After that, queues are long (3 mins+) and the people are either god tier or complete noobs.-Toxic communityThe community is toxic. Nothing else. If youa re having a bad day, they dont care. You will get bmed up theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥until you cant walk. Just dont the 11 year old wanna-bes get in your way of playing the game and having fun.-Skins are overpricedThats it. Makes complete sense though as the game is free to play with no hinderence or boosts to gameplay with real money. -Horrible learning curve for new playersThe learning curve as it shouold be. Its a MOBA. The mindset of a COD player and a Smite player should be completely different. This game was extremely hard to get into and still is. But after becoming decent at the game, it instantly becomes addicting. -ConclusionThis game is a great game. Great gameplay and a Moba that is fast paced. This game is completely reliant on skill which is great since it is F2P. The only thing you have to pay for is gems and the god pack. Which are both completely optional. The pros defenitely outweight the cons. Just have fun with the game. Its what its meant for."",1"
6747,SMITE,2018.0,Very good game a big learing curve but after you get the basics down it is so much fun.You also have the option to play so many diffrent gods so the game allways fells new to me even though i have 108 hours.The last part is the toxic pepole who play this game you run into them every like 4-5 games but you can just mute them.,1
"6748,SMITE,2016.0,""You should never write angry reviews but here goes"
"6749,SMITE,2015.0,""I've been playing Smite on and off for a while now, I'm not in to MOBAs at all but Smite feels like something else. It's another one of those """"easy to learn, hard to master"""" games. As mentioned by a lot of other people the camera angle is great and all the maps are fantastic.Extremely fun game and a very balanced free to play, the extra Â£20 on the gods collection is fantastic value and a great way to give back to a great dev team."",1"
"6750,SMITE,2017.0,""The game that became way more better with time. The game which took thousands of hours of play time long before appearing in Steam. The game which took lots of money and efforts, brought both stress and joy. If you like MOBA and action TPS, you'll like this game."",1"
6751,SMITE,2017.0,Smites characters is actual religous gods.You play these religous gods.You can learn their lore.You finally figure out how to pronounce their names.You see how baddass/Sexy gods are..This game is totally on the top 3 mobas.And it has a lowkey eduactional value aswell.10/10  ,1
"6752,SMITE,2018.0,""With the state of the game at the moment? No. Definitely not. A few years back when I first picked up SMITE in the Beta tests, it was great! I loved playing with the game as it evolved: The seasons ticked on and - whilst there were many hiccups along the way - I was pleased with the progress. Season 4 the point where I stopped playing. Season 5 got me back in! But...well, the truth is that the Developers are more interested in Cosmetics and Gem sales than game balance. Just...no. Sorry SMITE. Start listening to your player base and treat them with respect.HOPEFULLY the day will come when I can change this review to positive. I'll follow the progress of the game still. I'm doubtful, but hopeful."",0"
"6753,SMITE,2018.0,""Possible for it to be fun, but it's extremely glitchy, the people who make this game don't know how to make a videogame. But they do know how to make in game purchases super overpriced"",0"
6754,SMITE,2017.0,Interesting take on the moba genre pioneering the third person gameplay within its genre.Fun hero designs and game modes even if you're not into the typical MOBA formula.There should be a game type in there for everyone.Free to play model is not very agressive either.Pick up and enjoy.,1
"6755,SMITE,2016.0,""This was once one of, if not, my favorite games. The base concept of the game is amazing. It is honestly great fun once you understand it, and it is really simple to get into compared to other mobas. The problem lies within the developer, HiRez (or TitanForge whatever they are called now).If I had to give this game a rating on JUST THE BASE GAME AND HOW FUN IT IS, I'd give it a 8.5/10Yes, I still play very frequently. But it's only ever with my friends and never alone. I have been playing more ranked and the change of pace has been kinda nice, but I don't know how much longer it will appeal to me. I've invested too much time into this game to stop playing forever. I've simply learned too many things and played so much that I would say that I am an above average player, but the game just seems to match me up with players that are signifcantly worse than that of my enemy.The matchmaking is just a joke. Honestly. I don't need to say more than that. Matches are almost never balanced when it comes to casual gamemodes. Either you stomp one way or you run into a comp where they all picked a stupid comp and get yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥pushed in.There are very frequent patches, one or two a month. A new god is also released everyone 1.5-2ish months depending on how much time they actually spend on the god. The problem is that the patches have slowly become more and more centered around presently new skins to play dress up with your god and less about actually balancing characters that have been incredibly powerful for several patches or bugs that have been present for LITEARLLY YEARS. Yes, bugs like the victory or defeat screen bugging out and staying on your screen until you relog have been in the game since 2014 and was fixed only recently. 4 YEARS! And even then it's still not fixed, but rather they have something that just autotimes you out if the screen doesn't go away in 30 seconds or something like that.The skins in this game are amazing to be fair. They look great and are normally paired with great voice packs and effects that are quite nice. There's a problem however that they keep giving the same pool of gods multiple skins throughout the year while certain gods get 1 or sometimes not even a single skin in an entire YEAR.Again, this game is bugged in multiple areas that do nothing but make you feel like you're playing an unfinished product that is constantly stuffing skins and chests down your throat in order to make as much money as possible. Certain gamemodes like Siege don't even show you all the players that are in the current match and has been doing that for well over half a year now as of writing this review. The game recently has been kinda declining/stagnating, and it makes sense. Patches are used to advertise costumes for your characters instead of fixing the game.It's also frustrating that this year HiRez decided to dedicate all of it's pro matches on Mixer instead of Twitch. This is when I realized truly how money hungry they are and how little they care for this game. Viewing numbers are down and there are far less people watching on Mixer than there would be on Twitch. Not to mention that the Smite World Championship helps bring loads of viewers and players to Smite through Twitch, but this year it's been abandoned.I think I have put more time into this game than any other game I have ever played. I love this game, but I CANNOT stress how terrible it feels to play it. I enjoy it far less and sometimes I'm just miserable and play it only because a large amount of my friends play it. I feel like the cries of players who actually love the game are ignored. Some gamemodes are just horrific to play, and that brings me on to another issue, the playerbase.Yeah, it's toxic just like any other moba, but the real problem is how split it is. I have for the most part played more casual focused gamemodes rather than the main gamemode, conquest. The problem is that I am in the majority.Overall, I just couldn't reccommend this game to anyone in the current state that it is in. I have 2k+ hours on steam alone but I played before it was even on steam. I love this game so much, but HiRez is not a good company for Smite. They don't know what they are doing.Thanks for reading my rant lmao"",0"
"6756,SMITE,2016.0,""it's one of the greatest mobas of our generation.. this is the best anyone could ever build.. this is the ultimate creation of humankind..!nope..Haha.. this is my first review, so had to make it sound epic. The game is good enough.. and yeah this is my kind of moba (3rd person, multiplayer, mythological char.s and no guns.. unless you pick apollo).. will be playing this after reviewing it too.. so, 8/10 for what it was going for..

"6757,SMITE,2016.0,""Even though it says how many hours I have played in Steam... I have played a countless many more when it was not a steam game.  Smite is a very addicting and rewarding experience.  Yes, it can be very frustrating at times due to how the community can be, but that is with any competetive game.  Even though it is a bit dated now, the graphics still are great in my opinion and the game can run on pretty much any basic game machine.  Learning the different gods truly can be a craft and that alone is an addiction in itself.  I highly recommend Smite compared to the other MOBA's simply because of the 3rd person view.  You really take control of your toon much more so than any other MOBA."",1"
6758,SMITE,2017.0,Game has its pro's and cons.For me its good.I play it with friends mostly.Really addicting.The only MOBA which made me to stay and play it.Recommendation to everyone who want to play.,1
"6759,SMITE,2018.0,""Not very beginner friendly. Ive spent 270+ dollars on this free to play game. Half of the money was spent on chests and most of the things I got from chests were avatars and voice packs. Extremely fun to play with friends. Great free game. I've enjoyed almost every second of it. Parts I do not like about the game: Queue time is sometimes pretty crazy for some gamemodes, Loki is a fair and balenced piece of fairness that should go and stomp on legos"
"6760,SMITE,2018.0,""Very unique game with High Quality of texture. If you a fan of Dota (Dota 2) or Leauge Of Legend and third person shooting games, I recommend this to be in your libary. This is not the best game but also not the bad game, this game is a ton of fun with lot of god with special unique ability. And IT FREE :)))))"",1"
"6761,SMITE,2016.0,""This was recommended to me by someone who is addicted to this. For me the general rule for all MOBA titles is that I hate them with a burning passion, but this one was alright, I'm not a fan but I can see why its so popular.

"6764,SMITE,2018.0,""Hi-Rez Studios is one of the worst companies that I have ever seen try to balance a MOBA because they don't even try to. They purposefully release new gods in a broken state to """"reward"""" those who bought the gods access pass or those who saved to buy the new god. The company is all about a huge cash grab releasing skins in updates to try and distract from the fact that they ignore their community and refuse to balance anything. The game is really only fun if you pickup one of the generic, broken gods that can be played rather than any of the ones with a unique and fun kit because unique and fun just doesn't cut it here, you have to be generic and broken to win. Will never be able to recommend the game until they manage to fix the state it is in."",0"

"6766,SMITE,2018.0,""Oh Smite. First off, I do have a few hundred unlogged hours from when Smite wasn't on Steam.Smite holds a very special place in my heart, it is one of, if not my favourite multiplayer game of all time. Played since Beta, and I've had REALLY long breaks from it from time to time, months long. But I seem to always come back. To me, it's easily better than League and Dota, just because of the easier learning curve, and potential for much faster paced games. I've always hated the entire early game of League, as it is pretty much just clicking minions for 10 minutes or so. I'm also not a fan of clicking to move.This is where Smite came in. It's primary premise was to be a third-person MOBA. And my god did they nail it. The abilities, action and synergy between gods is great, among other key gameplay aspects. Ask anybody, and they will say that it's glory days are over. And while that may be true, Smite is still the same core experience, with a more complete roster of more diverse gods. The reasons why it's glory days are over?1) Community has indeed, gone toâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Early on, the community was one of the best, although I think that's true of most Beta games/new games.2) A couple of key people working on the design team of HiRez left to work on other games and projects within HiRez. Basically, instead of returning an investment to improve and prolong Smite, HiRez thought it would be a good idea to do a handful of smaller projects. Really only Paladins was successful, but this still draws resources and manpower away from Smite, as HiRez is still a pretty small dev company. They tried a bunch of card games and mobile games, and really just wasted time and money. I'd personally reckon Smite suffered for this.  Now, the design team don't really know how to play the game at a high enough level to test balance properly, which REALLY makes balancing a huge issue at times for them. Even with all these issues, balance may not be very good, but it's definitely NOT as bad as some people make it out to be. And it sure is more balanced than a bunch of MP games out there.3) Matchmaking. I really never will understand at all how a matchmaking system can ever possibly think that a couple of silver level players get matched with Diamond & Platinum and even Grandmaster ranks. It's easily the worst thing about Smite. It's not even like there's not enough people queuing, there's still a modest-sized playerbase for ranked. The PERFECT example of howâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥matchmaking is, is this story of how me and my friend got into a game with not just a pro player, but probably a top 3 midlaner in the world: It was a couple years ago, me and my friend just qualified for the new split, and got something like Gold IV. Now, gold is pretty bad, you definitely are NOT good at the game if you can't get out of gold. Yet somehow, someway, me and my friend got paired with a Silver, a Diamond player and this top 3 midlane pro in ranked. It's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing mind-boggling.(Conclusion)I still love playing Smite, and it is still my favourite MP game, I just don't know if it's worth a new player trying to learn the game up to the point of playing ranked extensively, because of those three problems. If you want a casual, fun time learning the game with friends, this game is fantastic. I have tons of memories of that with my friends in the past, it was a blast. But if you have intentions to truly learn the game and get better with ranked, I can't recommend this game to you."",0"
6767,SMITE,2018.0,This game is great one of the best MOBA's handdown I would play if you like mythology and MOBA's never thought the two could be connected until I found smite as a fouth grader 4 years ago.,1
6768,SMITE,2016.0,For me SMITE is a history of Hate and Love.It's the best and the worst.I do LOVE EVERYTHING about it aside from server stability and poor skill players mixed in matchmaking with veterans.All in all I do recommend SMITE as a pick even for non-moba players.PS: just keep in mind to stay cool.,1
"6769,SMITE,2016.0,""I've played this game since before beta ended, i'm pretty addicted.pros.-the first MOBA with the camera behind your character, allowing for some pretty cool ganking strats.-*pretty* balanced roster of characters, the new ones are a little OP-you get to play as gods from various mythologies, such as Thor and Anubis-not pay-to-win, all chars are unlockable via """"favor"""", a currency gained through playing the game,-usually a good community, there are the occasional few idiots who base their self esteem off of their w/l, and care too much-I haven't encountered any hackerscons.-hard to get into, since the lower matchmaking is FULL of smurfs-new characters cost double the favor of current ones-item building is a bit complicatedtl"
"6770,SMITE,2016.0,""Look, to be honest, I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing love this game. My playtime hours should tell you enough. Smite is by far the best MOBA game around. I can say, as I've played lol and dota2. The community is far better than other MOBA's and it's not pay2win. The only thing you can buy are either gods (which you can actually buy with ingame earned favour) or some sweet goodlooking skins. If don't know what a MOBA is and you would like to start playing, go ahead and start downloading. If you enjoy the game, 'd suggest you get the Ultimate God Pack, as it unlocks every God and future Gods in the game and refunds all favour you spend on Gods (best deal in your life especially if it's on sale)Pro's- Almost everything, for real (skns are cool, updates every 2 weeks, gem events, ...)- I can play this on my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing, outdated laptop from the year 2007, which is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing awesome- FREE + every week you can get 50 gems(with daily logins)- Balance isn't a real problem, every god can be good/OP if played right. Nothing is OP, people just rather complain about balance than trying to counterbuild the god that isâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥them.Con's For newer players:- Smurfs and toxic scumbags appear from time to time in matches- You're gonna getâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥by smurfs(people who made a new account because they reached lvl 30 and they can't compete with other level 30s)- Players who complain about kd, but it should be kda + player damage- Matchmaking early(sub 30s) is kind of random, but once you reach level 30, iit gets generally better.If you are new to the game, try to fght bots on medium difficulty first, as people appear to be toxic af if you don't know what you are doing. Look up some builds or guides if you like, they mght help you. Finally if you are level 30 and have played over 500 assulat matches feel free to add me, as this is my main game mode.IGN FusionflameboltIf you need a refferer pm me on steam or post on my profile, I 'd be happy to play those 10 hours with you.And remember to have fun, as that is what gaming is all about.Final verdict: Best game ever, potato pc friendly, Support this awesome game.I love you SMITE :)"",1"

There are some problems, such as server lag every now and then, and a tempermental third party anticheat system that hates me (FIX IT HIREZ), but other than that I would reccomend it to anyone to try personally."",1"

The meta is whack but you can eaisly adapt to it. Its a solid 4/10 right now, but when Hi-Rez gets they'reÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥together, it can be a 8-10/10."",1"
"6774,SMITE,2018.0,""Just going to start with saying that this is my personal opinion and my experiences with the game. Other's will have different experiences and opinions of their own.I played this game quite a lot when it first came out years ago before steam. I bought the god bundle because I liked being able to play all the different mythological figure. I enjoyed different take on a moba style game and loved the mythology angle of it. Unfortunately, the longer the game is out the less fun it became. It reached esports level and people started dumping their lives into the game. I play MOBAs very casually and don't take them very seriously. At this point, the game is almost unplayable in a casual way. Bot matches are a terrible waste of time unless you just want to try out a new god you've never played before. The bots are so bad at the game that it doesn't even give you a good feel of how the god actually plays though. Outside of bot matches, the majority of the games I join, I end up against a clan that clearly plays the game a lot while I end up on a team of randoms with no coordination what so ever. The other team will just steam roll through yours and not even be taking the game seriously. It's not really an enjoybale game when 5 minutes into the game your team has 1-2 kills while they are in the double digits, they destroyed half your towers, and are now just farming kills for fun. You can't surrender until 10 minutes and they are fully aware of that. Once in a very rare while, you'll get into a normal game without any clans and it can be pretty enjoyable but those matches are far and few between. The only way to really enjoy the game is to play it seriously and focus on it as your go to game. You pretty much have to find a group of people to play the game with and really only play it with them. Of course there are going to be players that are good enough to carry a team but for most games, it's going to be a matter of the group coordination, planning, and communication like any MOBA.The real issue I have with the game is that casual play doesn't exist because their either isn't a skill based matchmaking system or it's just a really horrible one. I'll maybe play this game once a month to try out new god released or try out a new event but it gets worse every time I come back. I don't know why they think it makes sense to put clans up against completely random groups in their non-ranked play. There are plenty of clans in queue, why can't they get matched together and random groups can get matched with random groups? And of course like most MOBAs, the community is pretty toxic. You can expect to be insulted and trash talked by the clan that just wiped the floor with your team at the end of the match because it was too ez for them. I can jump back into HOTS or LoL, queue up and typically get into a game with people of similar skill and at least have a chance at winning most games. I don't have time to focus all my attention of this game and following the meta to have the perfect build with the right team to run the perfect play against another team on a regular basis. If there was a way to conitently queue up and not end up against an organized clan, I would probably play this game more and actually be able to enjoy it again.TL:DR Don't bother with this game unless you like incredibly stupid bot matches or getting steamrolled by clans in unranked casual queue. If you love MOBAs and you have an organized well communicated group to go into battle with you, then my review doesn't really apply and you should give it a try. If you are looking to play it casually, then you really should pass on the game."",0"
"6775,SMITE,2015.0,""Basically this game is the game League of Legos and Dota 2 wants to grow up to be. If I wanted a point and click game, I'd play Clicker Heroes. I HATE MOBA'S with all my passion, I can't stand the stuff, but this doesn't feel like a MOBA, it feels like a normal 3rd person PvP game(with epic underboob, yeah Nu Wa I'm talking to you!). This game is free-to-play done right. Microtransactions doesn't give you any advantage, it only buys skins and voice packs. The best thing about this game is the humor. 11/10 would RALLY HEEEEERRRREEEE again! "",1"
6776,SMITE,2016.0,Hi-Rez Studios is becoming one of my favourite developers of the modern era Like paaladins and jetpack fighters Smite really upholds the reputation other games have given to the devs :D,1
"6777,SMITE,2016.0,""from my hours on just the steam version you can tell that i have played this game a great deal, I have been playing this game since the beta a few years ago and I have loved playing this game ever since then and seeing all the gods or changes that they add to the game to make it more fun. I play this game every day and when ever im bored its my go to game to play. I would 100% reccomend this to someone its even free so you may aswell try it for a few games and see if you like it the only thing you can spend money on is cosmetic skins for the game no pay to win factor to it."",1"
"6778,SMITE,2017.0,""Free to play game and not pay to win! I grinded to unlock all gods without spending money. If you want to test out a god's abilities, you can try any god in jungle practice. You can normally play any god you want even as a new player through renting with favor, a currency earned simply by playing the game. You can rent a god for 24 hours with 300 favor, which really is not much. The only thing you can really pay for other than gods is cosmetics. I find the game very enjoyable most of the time, but there are several issues with it.Matchmaking is bad. The ranked divisions are Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster. I am a Grandmaster 1v1 player (top 25) and it is not uncommon to face players in the Platinum division, which is 3 divisions below me. On top of this, for some reason the game will reward me more Tribute Points (earning TP increases your rank) for beating lower ranked players than higher ranked players. I also lose less TP for losing to lower ranked players, and more for losing to higher ranked players. This is the opposite of what it is supposed to happen.Playerbase seems very toxic. Every 1v1 match I play, I enter Do Not Disturb and mute my opponent so they cannot interact with me in any way. The amount of toxic people playing the game is hard to believe and kind of upsetting. It does not matter if you are playing the lowest level or the highest level. Even most streamers BM their teammates. In casual matches it is not uncommon for me to mute 2-3 teammates, while I almost always have to mute at least 1. Chances are if someone is not BMing, they aren't saying much of anything or you are winning and they are not dying. Just remember there is a mute button, and if you find someone that seems cool, try to add them and play with them. If they turn out to be toxic, don't feel like you can't delete them.Balance is okayish. Gods are often overpowered on release or, with Ullr recently, buffed far too much when they have a big expensive skin coming out. I think the balance team often makes questionable decisions but nothing that makes the game unplayable to me.These are the main issues I can think of with the game, but it is not nearly enough to stop me from playing it. I've met some great people playing Smite, including my SO, The gameplay is very enjoyable, especially some of the challenges I face in 1v1s. I don't think bugs are as big of an issue or as common as some people may make them out to be. Give it a try! We need more players. Just remember the mute button and don't get discouraged if bad MM puts you against someone with 1000+ hours lol."",1"
"6779,SMITE,2018.0,""Fantastic Game, 9.5/10If you like League or DOTA, but thought there wasn't enough action and chaos then SMITE is your game. The third person perspective is a staple of the game, and defines it from the rest in the genre. The game feels clean and the third person perspective puts you strait in the action. Tons of fun!"",1"
"6780,SMITE,2016.0,""Pros:1) - An interesting and varied world of heroes"
"6781,SMITE,2015.0,""I have been playing Smite since it launched back in beta a few years ago and before it launched on Steam. I still love it and in fact I play it more than DOTA 2, League of Legends, and Heroes of the Storm.  I just love the aspect and controls of this game more I love the idea of playing gods and how some of their kits are imagines and worked into the game.  No complaining about auto pathing here as you are in control of your character at all time unless your under some hard crowd control effects like: Being in the moth of Fenrir, Being Slapped by Poseidon's Kraken, or Being stunned by Artemis' Boar the list goes on.  I just really enjoy the game and what it's become itâ€™s the most Action based moba I can think of without a top down camera. There is also Awesomenauts but thatâ€™s like a moba/ 2d platformer which is neat in its own right.If other Moba's have not piqued your interest with their top down perspective and possible micro managing. Smite throws all that out the window for a fast paced and third person perspective!Do I recommend SMITE? Yes. Just the fact you can earn premium cash (gems) in events and for logging in daily says a lot most games that are free to play don't let you earn the premium cash. Paladins does as well with daily log-ins but they are both Hi-Rez games.Give it a shot! Play gods most of which You probably never heard of Like the Mayan Pantheon. I never knew about a Chaac or a Xbalanque guy!? But more of what I like is how they made these gods their own unique characters! Seriously just try it it's free."",1"
"6782,SMITE,2015.0,""Used to be a fun game with friendly community. Now all you get are :1. Getting paired up with AFKs on almost 5-6 games straight.2.

6783,SMITE,2017.0,is an amazing game which i have been playing for a long time... i can put thumbs up.

Hope they repair it on the next patch,1
6784,SMITE,2016.0,best mmo game ive played weather you got 30mins or 5 hours it will keep you busy the entire time while having a blast if thats not enough for you than play it for the SEXY SHARK below><^>,1
"6785,SMITE,2017.0,""At this point in time i have 799 hours logged. I'm gonna do a short and sweet review of the game and try and list a few things that are diffrent than other MOBA'S and hopefully give you guys some insight for people looking to get into the game. Smite is a 3rd person MOBA unlike most MOBA's, which are usually top down, now with that being said makes the game imo a whole diffrent type of MOBA and the way i prefer to play a MOBA.I've only played around 3 matches of LoL, and as ive said before i prefer the 3rd person aspect, top down games just arent my style, so i cant really compare this to other MOBA'sNow. to get to the basics, you have your Guardians,Mages,Warriors,Hunters and Assassins, All of which are all fun to play my preffered class would usually be a guardian or mage seeing that not many people choose to play guardians and that hunters are far to generic.Hunters- Hunters are your standard point and hold left click for the most part they are effective early game but most useful in late game scenarios to shut down the lower health gods easily and also beat down your enamy Tank.Mages- All around good class used to shut down most all god types most having a very diffrent kit and reasonably diffrent from each other enough to realize you're playing another god and not a re-skin of another.Guardians- Guardians are your preferred tank class although warriors can also be very tanky most guardians are fun in their own way and all have a play in the game but less than the other classes imo unless the right hands are behind them.Warriors- Warriors are very fun to play alot of them have good kits and some of them being very overpowered in the right hands and some being huge game changers for your 5v5 fights in late game joust.Assassins- Assassins are very crucial to your Conquest matches (5v5) and quite a few of them are left untouched during seasons due to a few being Overpowered, They're used for your jungling and to gank lane as most moba's.Now that thats over with i'd like to touch base on a few of the things i like and dont like about smite.Pro's- Visually the game looks great every one of the gods are very detailed, maps look great and the spells and abilities really bring all of it to life during matches.3rd person aspect- as ive said before i dont enjoy top down games and if you do thats fine you may still like smite regardless, Top down just isnt my cup of tea.Community- All in all the community is great in a whole if you join in solo for the most part if there are people playing solo as well they are usually nice, although you can have teams of clan people who are toxic just as there would be toxic people in other Moba's but smite seems to have less toxicity than other Moba's too me.Updates-Smite is regularly updated with new content Very Often, in the last year It's seen around 11 new gods meaning we see new gods almost every month, Gods usually stay relatively balanced with your select few that are more overpowered than others, but High-Rez stays on top of it.Gods-All of the gods feel diffrent to me very few of them have simialar skills and for the most part all of the gods in the game are fun and ANY of them can be good if they are in the right hands.Cons-Unfortunately there are some bad things about smite and i will tell you what my biggest problems with the game are.Hunters- Hunters are fun to play and i wont lie i love to play Neith,Ah Muzen Cab, Xblanque and many others, BUT they need to be nerfed unlike League (going by word of mouth) Yes, their abilities help them in fights tremendously but some if not all of them by end game only have to hold down left click to kill anybody, doesnt matter what their opponent is even guardians get melted with full physical protection, I'd suggest removing penetration items from the game, They make being a guardian not fun.Guardians- There are alot of fun guardians in the game BUT, as ive said in the previous statement Hunters can melt them, just as any other class can in the right hands, they just dont feel tanky enough most of the time no matter how much armor you build, and even at this point you can build for damage so you do no damage and die regardless due to the lack of damage resistance from said armor. Although there are many guardians that do alot of damage and are seemingly tankier than others leaving the other guardians hanging out to dry.Now that ive gotten my two biggest gripes over classes out of the way ill list a few diffrent other urks i have with the game.I've previously stated that there isnt alot of toxicity in the game but, I like to play assault alot and i've done this before just in case someone reading this recognizes my name, Being toxic or talking crap in this game-mode makes you look like a huge dbag, You're not playing Ranked-Conquest. Stop acting like it, Thats my only problem with the community is that i can understand when someone is purposely throwing the match/feeding but, if you watch and see that they're actually trying, give them a chance if you lose at the end of the match say gg, nice try they may be new and your actions could be the reason that they stop playing the game, meaning we're losing people from an amazing game that already has a much smaller player base than the likes of Dota 2, or LoL.Last thing is the server downtime, I want this game to grow, and i want the playerbase to grow also, But, it seems like and moreso here recently that the servers have been down quite a bit. in The last month there was upwards of a week (altogether) that i couldnt play because of server downtime. I've read many articles stating that it's Because of DDOS from other developers, I would hope that another company wouldnt stoop that low. My problem with all of this is not that im missing out on playing but afraid that at some point people will get tired of it and go to something else, and im sure im not the only person that feels this way. So High-Rez you've made one of my favorite games of all time, Please, try and fix this problem.Thats the end of all of my pro's/con's and gripes of the game Hopefully this will help you to decide to play or not to play and it answered some questions for you.I'll update my review if anything else sticks out to me. Favorite Gods-Vulcan,Agni,Neith,Khepri,Poseidon."",1"
"6786,SMITE,2016.0,""Supernovas happen because of when a sun is formed. it has a lot of gravity. This gravity pulls the matter(Mostly hydrogen) into the core of the sun where it undergoes extreme amounts of pressure and causes the Hydrogen to fuse. When the hydrogen fuses it turns into Helium and this fusion gives of a small amount of energy, but remember, there are billions of these fusions happening simultaneously, so that energy adds up real quick. When it releases energy, the particles have the energy to fight the intense gravity (which is why stars grow/don't immediately collapse). Now Helium is denser than Hydrogen, so it goes down father into the core and gets fused as well. The helium is fused into Oxygen and Carbon and emits even more energy for the matter to fight gravity and expand. but then there's a problem. when Carbon and Oxygen fuse into Iron, no energy is given off. This means that the star will started having an Iron core, but no problem because you still have some Hydrogen and Helium and stuff. But eventually all the Hydrogen will run out, leaving the denser Helium, Oxygen and Carbon to fight the intense Gravity. Then the helium goes and then Gravity starts to take its toll. The Star begins to shrink because the fusion of Oxygen and Carbon doesn't produce enough energy to fight gravity until eventually gravity packs the Oxygen, Carbon, and Iron closer and closer, without enough energy to fuse or fight back. Then the Gravity becomes way too much for the matter and the star implodes, ripping apart some of the Iron and Carbon and Oxygen back into their original Heliums and Hydrogens and creating a massive cloud of irradiated dust, ready to start the process all over again. And if the star is big enough(AKA has enough mass like a Blue Giant star) all the heavy elements in it keep of compressing pass the supernova point and becomes a singularity (some of the stuff does go supernova but most of it goes into the singularity)"",1"
"6787,SMITE,2017.0,""The community has become like any other MOBA, a group of people where at least 50% is toxic.Balancing issues everywhere.Glitches everywhere.Depression everywhere.Beside all of the negative things, I still enjoy playin' the game. So....I will recommend it. I guess"",1"

"6796,SMITE,2017.0,""So, About smite. Gotta say, played it on beta and it actually improved a lot !Things beta had :- Limited Cancodemon Skin + icon and beta tester icon.- Dominion game that actually i loved alot to play.- 1 server for all regions, you could actually play with people over the world without change anything.- Good optimation for the year it was made.Things new Smite has:- Its been more and more a game related to league of legends, you just pay to skins and you can get them much easier but i think the 7D chests rotation should be smaller.- You cannot gift friends, That sucks :c- You CANNOT, literally, say a bad word that if you get 1 game reported you're banned.- You have even better graphics and a better optimation.- Inovated skins but gods seem alot like league champs.- weekly Updates (sometimes there are alot of updates over the week)So, i recommend this game. It will seem weird at start but its good, play it for 10 hours and you'll start enjoying it. Beying a noob its always the easiest excuse to stop playing, but have you ever tryied to stop be one of the worse? What are you waiting? Join us on this game and let's find the Pro Player in yourself !"",1"
"6797,SMITE,2016.0,""SMITE  is quite unque 3rd person moba where you play as a god from ancient religions(greek,roman,egyptian and norse)So if you ever wonderd if Zeus is better than Thor now you can know(just dont feed that kid, he is broken)"",1"
"6798,SMITE,2017.0,""I could play as Amaterasu from the Get-go. My Inner Weeb is satisfied.Somehow has a better community than Latin Dota 2. Still won't abandon it, despite me being stuck with latinos 9/10 of my games. "",1"
"6799,SMITE,2016.0,""My first experience with a MOBA, and I don't think I'll be switching to LoL or DOTA anytime soon.You know how you get """"that game"""" that you end up playing no matter what? This is that game. Fallout 4 is out? This is free, and I need to scratch my itch. Smite is a very well balanced 3rd person take on a MOBA that can attract anyone from a hardcore LoL player to a gamer whose never stepped foot in the genre (aka myself). Besides the current hours I have, another 500 can be added from Xbox playtime. The game is very easy to get into as a casual, but also very fun for people who love to customize builds and find what numbers need to be allocated where to be the most effective (power, attack speed, protections, etc.).Smite is constantly updated, with small patches every few weeks. Also, a new god is added every month or two, allowing the player to always have someone new to try. When you first start out, you are given a few free gods (some are top tier, think of stock guns in TF2) and a few gods are free every week for you to test drive. I would highly recommend the God Pack for anyone who thinks they will sink a decent amount of time into the game. It makes you much more flexible as a player, gives variety to the game, and lets you try what seems to be an endless amount of playstyles that you may have not be able to experience prior. Gems, Smite's premium currency, is given in small doeses every week from logging in, can be bought, and is often given for free from weekend events. Also, skins/voice packs are often on sale. Devs are in constant contact on r/Smite and Twitter, making it extremely easy to contact them for any concerns, and easy for them to see community ideas. They are also some pretty fun guys that are always fun to see on stream or during events.The game's free, give it a try and see how you like it. Make sure to look up builds/guides online to make sure you get the most out of the game. Have fun!"",1"
"6800,SMITE,2017.0,""I love Smite. It will forever to me, be the most fun MOBA on the market. Game has a few small problems that CAN be fixed but will they? Hard to tell. HiRez needs to develop a way for people to understand how to play the game. As a Master Conquest player this Season peaking at 50th in the world ranking, I understand this game more than anyone can hope to understand a game.  Even in the highest level of games players still don't udnerstand fully what to do. They need to pay people like me or other well known players to create videos teaching players how to actually play Smite. Game has a great casual side. Matchmaking can be very poor at times because of lack of players at times. HiRez genuinely seems to be a good company other than minor slip ups. Stop promoting Paladins and your card game. Those games are jokes and a waste of time and money. Smite is a gem and could become the next big thing. Will it though? I see a bright future for Smite, but until this game is HiRez's only focus, time will be of the essance until this game dies out or is taken over by another """"action MOBA"""". After having atleast 2000 hours on this game (Non steam hours are a thing) this game will ALWAYS have a place in my heart. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to try out the MOBA genre."",1"
"6801,SMITE,2017.0,""Great game with many heroes to pick from and fight against, its definitly worth your time but do remember that Hi-Rez Studios (The developers and publishers) are absalout cancer and most of their games are bad, SMITE however is the exception and is good fun with friends or alone"",1"
"6802,SMITE,2017.0,""I absolutely hate this game I have wasted almost my entire life playing it and I have gained nothing, this game has torn my family apart because I've put over 15000 dollars into skins, and I am on the brink of killing myself."",1"

Smite has many different gods to choose from and supports many play styles. Smite does need to learn how to balance new gods before the release, But its still fun. I would recommend the God Pack Smite offers if you are going to play for a while. Smite is a game that is still growing and I hope to see it become a bigger success. - Hope to see you all on the battlefield! -"",1"
"6805,SMITE,2018.0,""Smite is an extremely fun game like League of Legends or Dota 2. I personally like it better than both of those games for a few reasons. First off, the graphics are much, much better. Second, it is easier to pick up and go than LoL or Dota 2 with its easy controls. High Rez Studios has made a pretty good game known as Paladins, so I gave this a shot just because I disliked LoL and Dota 2. I actually enjoyed the game and didn't want to stop. I highly suggest you guys try this game out."",1"
"6806,SMITE,2015.0,""SMITE is a 3rd person MOBA, its very fast pace and has skill shots. I been playing it off and on for more then a year now. If your looking for a casual game with lots of action and skill this is the game for you."",1"
"6807,SMITE,2015.0,""If you take Dota and combine it with World of Warcraft. That's what it feels when playing Arena in SMITE, atleast for me. Arena is 5v5 game mode and it's what you would expect from """"arena"""" map. Pure, fast paced action.Honestly, i don't really play other game mods, except events. If i want to play classic long game, i can play Dota. When you played so much of other moba games, you most likely look for something different. But there are also many people who play classic map (and it's really well done imo). To each their own, important is possibility of choice.Of course there are other game mods, here is the list: - Classic (3 lanes, 5v5, doto style)- Joust (1 lane, 3v3, smaller doto)- Assault (1 lane, 5v5, ARAM)- Siege (4v4, 2 lanes, siege towers)- Arena (5v5, try not to die, kill everyone, have more tickets in the end)- MotD (different each day, some crazy stuff here)Each mod is 100% playable, no imbalanced sh.t going on (except MotD) and people play them all.You can buy these items:- gods (heroes)- god skins- voice packs- portraits, ward skins, border frames, announcers, pedestals... (all of these are the least important imo, save your Gems for skins and voice packs)There are two ingame currencies: Favor and Gems. Favor is used to buy new gods and some skins. You earn Favor by playing games and loging daily.Gems are premium currency. You can buy them via real money, or you can get them for free during various events and also by loging daily. With Gems you can buy everything, naturally you should buy the things you can't buy with Favor.Game itself is absolutely NO PAY TO WIN. Real money can get you only cosmetic items.I can't but recommend this game. It's really great. Try it, you might like it. And remember to take the daily bonuses!VVGG"",1"
"6808,SMITE,2015.0,""Short review:  Smite is a good MOBA for anyone who wants to try one and for experienced players alike.Long review:  Smite is a MOBA that is somewhat different from others.  It has a third person perspective that I personally like.  There are a wide range of characters to choose from, 70 at the time of this review.  Along with the wide range of characters is 6 different game modes.There are 5 different character types to choose.  Assassians, which stick and move, securing a kill.  Warrior, who are constantly in the fight.  Hunters, long range specialists for ranged attack.  Mages, who deal a variety of magical attacks.  And lastly there are guardians, who play support but can also deal a lot of damage.The 6 different game modes differ quite a bit.  -There is arena, which is just a 5v5 deathmatch where your team tries to kill the other and escort minions into the enemies portal.  Reducing the enemies score to 0 wins this game.-Joust is a 3 on 3 mode that uses teamwork to advance to your enemies titan to destroy it to win.  Of course you must get through the enemy teams tower and phoenix.  This is a one lane mode with buffs for each team to pick up on either side,-Assault is 5v5 one lane fighting where you are randomly given a god and you and your team work your way to the enemies titan to destroy it.  Similar to joust, but you cannot go back and buy equipment or items until you are dead.-Seige is a 4v4 2 lane fight to destroy the opposing enemy titan.  This is more strategic than the other modes.  Teamwork is almost always nescessary here.-Conquest is the main game mode of Smite.  It is a 5v5 3 lane strategy game.  The goal is to destroy the enemy teams titan once again.  But teamwork and playing your role are a nescessity in this mode.  Conquest relies heavily on strategy.Overall Smite is a fun game for me, and I personally don't play many MOBAs.  There are a few minor issues I have.  Some gods play too similar.  The community can be toxic at times, and the servers can get overloaded at times as well.  But those are my biggest gripes.  I do recommend this game to anyone wanting to try a MOBA."",1"
"6809,SMITE,2015.0,""Took me away from CSGO And any aspect of my social life. Lost water cause couldn't pay bill. Lost kids cause couldn't feed them. I spent all my money on gems, and no longer have a house. Im playing at the library. 10/10 Would lose family again."",1"
"6810,SMITE,2015.0,""I â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing love this MOBA, this is the only MOBA that I can get into. I feel as if it takes a bit more skill than most of the others which are basically a button mashing fest. Sure they're pros and cons to every game developed, but out of all the MOBA's or even out of the nearly 150 games I have I pick this one the majority of the time to play. I only wish the achievements and hours transferred over from the original client launcher instead of me having to get them all again for Steam, that's my only CON so far. Because I have damn near all of them in game and roughly 200+ hours put into this game and the only MOBA I like paying for skins. They put some DAMN GOOD detail into the skins as well as the voice packs to go with those skins. Also if you get hooked on the game get the ultimate god pack, if it's still out, it's TOTALLY worth it. All of my hamer friends I tell about this game and I've gotten several hooked on Smite. I love it and so do they. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone. It's fun queing up solo or a group."",1"
"6811,SMITE,2015.0,""Nice and fun game, personally I hate MOBAs, but made an exception for this one, it is fun to play and addictive, also 3rd person view, something I really liked, compared to imo theÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥viewangle from common mobas."",1"
"6812,SMITE,2018.0,""After playing this game over the course of 3 seasons on the smite launcher and steam version, my feelings for this moba are extremely mixed.

"6813,SMITE,2018.0,""This game has been a wild ride over the years, and I'm thankful to have been around so long, even through all the pain and memes that have risen this season, I hope the best for Season 5. :D"",1"

"6817,SMITE,2016.0,""This is a very good change of gameplay compared to League which going back to that game feels too easy and rather dull in gameplay compared to the dynamic actions in Smite.Here are beginner gods you should try that i find too easy to use.ADC: Cupid, Apollo, Neith, Artemis.Mid: Posidon, Kukulkan, Anubis, Scylla, VulcanJungle: Fenrir, Loki (great for split pushing), Thor, Mercury (basicly the hecarim of Smite),Support: Athena, Sobek, Ymir, Chang'e, Ares (if enemy buys purification beads buy cooldown reduction tanky items)Solo: Pretty much any god can solo easily in smite even supports like Sobek, Ares, Yimir, even the ADCs can go solo lane since most of them are equiped with mobility or with good crowd control attacks.Smite is a Third Person MOBA with the same objectives as DOTA and LOL, 3 Lanes, 2 jungles, 2 Jungle bosses, Towers, Inhibitors (Pheonix), Titans/Nexus.I've been playing this for over a year now and personally I find the gameplay, controls to be alot more fun and it has its own unique stragety to it.For example your map radar only shows near sight of enemy/objects but only you can see whats directly in front of you, You can see enemies in the distance but your allies cannot so you need to describe the enemy situation by voice commands build into the game or if your fast type in like """"Kukulkan has low mana"""" or """"Anubis stun down"""" along with voice commands that say """"Ultimate down"""".For my experience the community has been pretty sweet up till 2016 where i started seeing more trolls and ragers than ever.You will expect some poor scrublord to rage theirâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥at you in any multiplayer game but they don't even know how good you can be in late game team fights which sadly low elo and just incompetent players do not understand. "",1"
"6818,SMITE,2016.0,""It's been over four years since I have stumbled onto this masterpiece of a MOBA. My review alone wouldn't do this game justice. The passion I have for the company Hi-Rez, the community, and the pro league is near and dear to my heart. The amount time I have sunk into this game is something I really don't want to know. From 3rd person action view and the 7 different gamemodes like conquest, arena, and MOTD (Match of the Day), to the 70+ playable gods that are still growing in numbers to this day and are all available under the god pack for $30 (best deal EVER). The game is updated every two weeks with incoming balance changes, new gods/goddesses, skins, and a lot more. From the variety of things like youtube, twitch, reddit, and gurus out there, the amount of content associated with this game is enormous. I highly recommend people who are intrested or are on the fence about the game to watch the new  Smite cinematic trailer  or  god reveal  for Amaterasu before jumping into a game of explosive enjoyment.I hope this helped some people out on making a decision and happy smiting!"",1"
"6819,SMITE,2017.0,""Hmm... HMMM... HMMMMMMM! Well just look at my time played. Ok so I recommend this game as an entry level MOBA, as it takes WASD controls and a third person view from the back of your character wich translated well from other games, namely the FPS genre. To be fair I have played this game for way too much time especially before getting it on steam. Finally the GREATEST TIP for HAVING FUN IN THIS GAME IS: grab a friend... or two... or ALL OF THEM! >-<"",1"
"6820,SMITE,2018.0,""Used to like the game, still play it a lot but only cause i dedicated a lot of money. Do not recommend anymore, play something else. HiRez has become more money hungry then dedicated at making sure the game is playable. Most likely new players will get stomped by max leveled masters players so good luck."",0"
"6821,SMITE,2017.0,""The only reasons i dont recommend SMITE is that it has become very unbalanced over the years and very few good players (if any players at all) play the game. Matchmaking takes 5+ minutes to find a game, as I had to wait a full half hour to get a conquest match. As for the game being unbalanced, a handfull of gods that have been falsely declaired weak or lacking recieve unneeded buffs. Some gods who recieve no changes already are too strong and can last in a 1v5 fight and most likely win. One example being Baskura that can use his ult to nuke an entire team with little or no chance of the enemy winning. Another is the Morigan. As a squishies wort nightmare, this mage will sneak up on you without any warning or sight from a ward and kill you instantly. And who dosn't love CHALK...Chalk?..Chak, WHATEVER!!! this one will tower dive you, kill you and a teammate, leave, heal up to full with his rain, and do it all over again no problem. And thats my rant."",0"
"6822,SMITE,2016.0,""*Summary on bottom*-THE GOOD:Smite overall is a very fun game and pretty balanced. It offers great teamwork mechanics along with solid gameplay features that just overall really make the game experience great. If you are someone that likes to be the hero and try to solo everything, this game probably won't be for you and can honestly go from casual to toxic real quick (emphasis on being a team player here). The item build system is simple and straight forward. So long as a good team build is there, and players know the item equip system a win is always possible.-THE BAD:Sometimes characters can play outside their intended class (see damage Cabrakan here as a gold example). Rebalancing to the gods that need the rebalancing typically don't really get acknowledged. When you have assassins that can't do damage because they have to run a nearly max defense build, you lose team damage output real quick putting you at a disadvantage. Again to reiterate a win is always possible despite this so it isn't necessarily game breaking per say, it's just more annoying that you have a tank meant to receive damage, 2 shotting all mages and assassins, then 3-4 shotting warriors.-THE UGLY:*If you are from console like me* - I moved from console to PC with this game. You cannot tansfer your account over. So all my no lifed diamond god skins, all my time played on console is rendered pretty useless which is really unfortunate because I don't think many people would be willing to regrind again (hence why I have so few hours on here). Despite that, I can still happily recommend this game to new players or to those moving from console, that are comfortable with going through the grind again.**Summary: Good game, great game, yuge game. I know it, you know it, everybody knows it.**"",1"
"6823,SMITE,2018.0,""I have Honestly been playing and having fun on smite for many years now but recently it has become a pain to get on because you get one of three things that will happen and if your not lvl 30 atleast your guarenteed to deal with it.First you deal with toxic plaers who just ruin the experience by screwing the match in multiple ways, Second you have people who will just up and leave if they die more than once which screws the match for you most of the time and really starts putting you off of it and third and finally, there are some seriously bad game breaking bugs that make it hard to even want to play it and this is coming from a beta player. Now if you can get a team to play with every match it takes out most of the problems but everyone is not always available which makes the likelyhood of having to deal with these issues more and more.THis is my personl opinion after playing this game on PC, and Xbox."",0"
"6824,SMITE,2017.0,""This game use to be my go to game. It had so much potential. A community of devs that actually listened to their fan base, great game play, competitive nature, everything you would want. It put a different spin on the MOBA genre. However, this has fallen flat and I wish it didn't. I stopped playing SMITE and I never  thought I would. They update often but how much can they do? It seems like every update they break something else in the game. They won't fix important issues, or just choose to ignore them. I love this game and it is my favorite MOBA to this date. I wish I could see SMITE getting bigger and better but I don't know."",1"
6825,SMITE,2017.0,I've played this game alot and i still can't recomend it even though it has been fun I loved all the gods and i loved the shop system but not it seems like the gods to play without getting yelled at by your team are very low but If you want a free game to play and want to play with friends and you like mobas then this is a game to play.,0
"6826,SMITE,2018.0,""Quite a fun experiance, way more fun with friends in my opinion for the communication. One thing though is some players can be extremely toxic, and instead of coaching or giving tips to new players, they proceed to insult you.HOWEVER i did come across a couple players who were willing to group up with me and teach me the game, as there is only so much you can learn vs bots!"",1"
"6827,SMITE,2017.0,""I've spent over 200 hours on PC and probably about another 300+ hours on Xbox. So with that being said, I figured it was time for a review. So heres my pros and cons review for Smite for you guys. Pros - 1. Free to play2. Several game modes3. Monthly updates to add new gods 4. Frequent updates to fix/improve the game and bugs5. Fast Progression6. Third person makes it unique to other MOBAs7. In game store only has cosmetics (NOT P2W)8. Good community9. Fast paced (Quick games depending on the game mode)10. 90 different gods to play as11. Periodic sales and good deals in the storeCons -1. Unbalanced gods2. Matchmaking (Noobs every game)3. Store isn't reasonably priced (Expensive)4. Devs updates don't change the correct things (god balancing, item balancing, or game mode changes)Now, of course these are MY opinions for pros and cons. If anyone would like to let me know their opinion or let me know if I'm missing something please comment. Also if you need anything dumbed down, ask. :) I hope you guys enjoy the game as much as I do. If not more. See ya out there! My username is DrowningInFlames"",1"
"6828,SMITE,2018.0,""Pretty good game. It's free. I think the only thing thats worth putting money on is the ultimate god pack because it gives you every single character for free.  makes the game more interesting and less grindy. Typical moba except its more emphasis on the skill base. Balanced better than other mobas imo and is pretty fun. Don't be a toxic player, learn from your mistakes and you're bound to have a good time! The devs are meme lords and push skins in chests that can be obtained through money, which is kind of dumb in my opinion, but if you really care about the game its your money. I haven't encountered any horrible game breaking bugs but I do know that the devs are constantly pushing new content out which is nice in comparison to other games that take forever to release new characters or content. The game does take quite a bit of time to play, however, unless you're beating some cheeks and the enemy team surrenders.  so be ready to spend hours playing 2-4 matches."",1"
"6829,SMITE,2018.0,""One of my favourite games to play. Outstanding design and mechanically great, the only problem I have is the Australian community is very small (like 90 percent of online games that are not CoD or Battlefield)"",1"
6830,SMITE,2017.0,The greatest free to play game on the market. You can pay money in return you get skins when you buy gems because skins and chest are how hirez makes there money. If you buy the God pack you get all the gods and new gods for free which they have been bring new gods into smite almost every month to every other month. Skins are nearly every month especially when they do updates which are every month. If you don't own this game download it but have friends download it along with you because just like every online game there are trolls and anal noobs who blame everyone for everything when they are losing. So just learn the game explain in game you are new and people will help explain what your role is and do this before locking in your God Do not auto lock or you will not have a fun team.,1
"6831,SMITE,2018.0,""I have over 1,500 hours in smite. http://smite.guru/profile/pc/venousmeerkat I have played from beta through season 4 and every new season Hi-rez shot themselves in the foot. With the latest season they shot themselvees in the chest, Hi rez needs to not """"fix"""" things that arent broken. Every new season they felt the need to change things when nothing needed to be changed, and thus â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing things up. Balancing gods to hi-rez means overly buffing or nerfing 3 months too late."",1"
"6832,SMITE,2018.0,""Smite acts like a virus: shuts down skype on start-up, takes ages to load, crashed sometimes at random moments,... . But all in all, it's a fun game. I'd recommend playing it at least once."",1"
"6833,SMITE,2016.0,""GOD THIS GAME IS AWFUL!What even is there to like about this game?- The community is awful- Only 12 year olds- Everyone is salty af- No matter what you do, its not good enough- Its litterally a Skin simulatorwait... wrong game...

"6835,SMITE,2017.0,""I don't like this game, but it's mostly for personal reasons.I just had a match with incredibly toxic players, and got falsely reported several times, so I'm uninstalling. The MOBA itself is different, sure, but the matchamking seems rather unfair. Perhaps not as bad as Dota 2, but still rather unenjoyable. Give the game a try, but... tread carefully."",0"
"6836,SMITE,2016.0,""I honestly like this game a lot especially when I play with friends but it has become so unbalanced recently I just cannot stand it half the time. They keep buffing items that certain gods will almost always get unless you're building wrong or making some new joke build but don't nerf the gods themselves because """"we don't want them to rely on 1 item too much"""" even though 90% of the time you're gonna build it anyway whether you """"rely"""" on it or not. And some gods just feel terrible to go against because they have some stupid gimmick to them or 1 dumb ability that takes absolutely zero effort but gives a huge reward when you use it because why not. Also they keep ruining dog skins with terrible voices."",0"
"6837,SMITE,2017.0,""I want to start out by saying that this game isn't my cup of tea. If you are looking for a MOBA where you can be more agressive, go play Awesomenauts. That being said, it's a very good game with great graphics and a good psudo lore surrounding it. It's decent for actual gameplay, could be better if it tried to do it's own thing instead of trying to be DOTA2."",1"
"6838,SMITE,2016.0,""Been playing SMITE for a loooong time. Over 1.5k hours now.Got to say, its my favourite MOBA. The matchmaking needs a lot of work, always gets you teamed up with low level players or people that think they are good, but are crap and blame everyone else for losing. My block list has over 200 people on it and it keeps growing, cant avoid the kid trolls unfortunately.Other than the troll players its a great game and I continue to find myself going back to it over and over again.People complain about the performance and servers, I always have 60fps Solid and a ping of no more than 70. I never get disconnected, I play on EU servers and they are always stable for me."",1"
"6839,SMITE,2017.0,""Easy Anti Cheat, an invasive and useless anti-cheating measure, is being implemented in the next patch. This does nothing to fix the only (rare) form of cheating in the game, speedhacking, and will only hurt legitimite players."",0"

"6841,SMITE,2015.0,""I've played over 1,500 hours of SMITE before the steam release and I could play 1,500 more.  This game in a short summary is the most skilled MOBA you will ever play, nothing is an auto lock ability and auto attacks even take skill to hit.Pros and Cons:Pros:  -Multiple gamemodes for different types of players (you don't ever have to play the classic 3 lane map if you don't want).-All gods are usable, meaning that no ones is complete garbage and you will be shunned or hated on for using him.-The META is constantly changing, always keeping laning and jungling fresh.-Every god can be used in every lane if you are good enough, and no one will be mad if you do use a Tank in mid lane.-The store currency to buy skins can be obtained through special events and through weekly awards, meaning if you are patient enough, you can get a skin you want.-Game is completely free to play, you will never have to spend money on it if you don't want to.________________________________________________________________________________Cons:  -All new gods on release are either: 1. completely broken and will infinently destroy you, or 2. super garbage and need a buff immediatly.-Some gods are better than others, such as Bellona, Au Puch and Khepri, and Hi-Rez won't balance them.-Servers are constantly kicking you out of games and going offline randomly.-Community is very toxic, luckily you can mute people though.-If someone does something wrong, Jungle always gets blamed, so you better be damn good at Jungle unless you want to get roasted hard core.-Game does not have an in-game voice chat, you have to download an external client called """"Curse"""" to talk to people in League matches.-Favor (the in-game currency to buy gods) is extremely hard to obtain, making you want to buy the godpack more and more so you don't have to deal with trying to get it.________________________________________________________________________________Overall, this is my most played and favorite game of all time, and I most likely will never stop playing it, no matter how unbalanced Bellona is.OVERALL RATING FOR SMITE: 9.25/10"",1"
"6842,SMITE,2018.0,""Very fun game, the 3rd person makes it an innovater in the moba genre and makes it more fun then playing a top down click to move game.

Alot of different gamemodes to keep you busy and to keep things fresh.Tons of skins for your gods to suit your personality and make your god look like a badass.Completely free to play, can unlock any god you wish to play with in game currency they you get from playing matches.Active developers to help balance the game that listen to the players.

"6843,SMITE,2016.0,""S'aight,  The devs are kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but every game they make is a fairly good, even if they tend to ruin games in the long term.  Very good FTP model, not P2W at all, and unlike other mobas you pay once and you get all the caracters now and forever.  The community is... honestly not that bad, but then again i dont think league of legends is that toxic, so maybe dont take my advice on that.  ive sunk much more than 860 hours off steam, and can say its one of my favorite games.  just dont do what i did and burn yourself out, i regret it so much now that i wont play it anymore."",1"

"6845,SMITE,2018.0,""i have almost 1000 hours in this game and I am addicted to it yes but I am still playing in hopes that Hi-rez can seriously get itsâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥together. New gods are ALWAYS over powered even after being on the public test servers and some old gods still need to be worked on and are over powered. Everything is now about gems which you have to pay real money for and this game is getting GREEDY AS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥! With issues of longer que times, gods being under or overpowered, and a decent bit of toxic players I wouldnt recommend this game unless you buy nothing and play the free rotation gods unless Hi-rez does some serious fixes to their game and not try and produce a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing battle royal spin off. OH and i almost forgot their servers are having some malfunctions where people dc from games at the start and have to reconnect which takes a couple minutes which in a moba the first couple minutes of a game is huge and then if people finish a game sometimes you get stuck on an endless victory or defeat screen that you have to restart the game to fix and then on your friends list if you and your friend get out of seperate games at the same time you cant invite them because it says they are still in game so that means that one of you has to restart the game in order to fix this issue. that's my 2 cents, peace."",0"
"6846,SMITE,2015.0,""Pretty neat game. It's pretty well known so another review isn't really going to matter.

"6847,SMITE,2016.0,""One of the most free-to-play MOBAs you'll find. Unlike other MOBAs, in this one you can unlock skins and earn """"premium currency"""" (also known as """"Gems"""") simply by playing the game. It's wonderfully addictive. If you're new or considering to play the game, you can earn extra rewards by referring somebody! If you're struggling to refer somebody you can always refer """"Buddhano"""" :)"",1"
"6848,SMITE,2017.0,""You really need to prepare yourself to play this game, you need to be ready for people to belittle you for making small mistakes and expect everyone to have little/no regard for a good team composition. Expect everyone else to actively seek to assist the enemy team in any way possible. That way when you encounter decent people you are pleasantly surprised. People get tilted super fast and it can be terrible when idiots come in packs, now that it is summer break it is going to be harder to play and stay positive with the younger crowd having the witch-hunt mob mentality, with reporting people. So if you want to enjoy your time playing pay little attention to chat unless someone is actually attempting to offer constructive criticism, don't take it personally when people talk trash unless its constructive. Please remember, if you aren't part of the solution to toxicity, then you are part of the problem."",1"

The most exicting thing for all these years I play till now is that you look forward so much everytime when there is update, because the game has a lot to offer you, not like other games where updates are almost the same like the previous ones.

They are continously updating it with new events, almost one after another recently and none of it is pay to win, you can pay for skins but gods stay the same and you have a huge choice of them.At the end of the day, the free game is limited, give it a try, don't like it then leave it, 3rd person style moba isn't for everyone.My only complaint is that some of the skins  are cringinly outdated e.g. Doge skin, figgit spinner recall skin..."",1"
"6853,SMITE,2018.0,""This MOBA is game for those people who dont like MOBA like me, i never played other MOBA cuz its boring for me but this game. I cant stop playing.Support- Hi-Rez is very nice to you.Game is good with pretty nice graphic and controls."",1"
"6854,SMITE,2017.0,""Overall, a good game I'd recommend to anyone looking for anyone who'd like a little more action in their MOBA.As compared to Dota 2 and LoL, Smite's camera and ability style allows it to put players more in the action and therefore has faster paced gameplay while not compromising the strategy and depth of items in a character's builds. Pros:- Excellent character selection"
6855,SMITE,2016.0,They copypasted console UI to PC-client. It looks horrible and literally ruined the game.There was another option to prevent this game dying than cross platform....Smite will be dead within 2 years.,0
"6856,SMITE,2018.0,""I have many more hours on this game on other platforms, but this will be a review of the PC version of this game. Summary: this game is fun, but is so terribly un-optomized, un-balanced, and just a flat out broken i wouldn't recommend getting into it. Go play LoL or just any other MOBA. Truth be told this game is very fun and action packed. Unlike LoL where it just feels like 90% of the game is grinding to fight, smite action is contiunus and even if you are 30 kills down you can still come back and win the game. There are so many great thing about this game but the company ruins it. They do not listen to their commuinity, they do not fix any bugs, they do not balance characters, but hey, once every 5 months they will push out a new â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, un-orginal gods. Also if you like wasting money on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cosmetics this is a good game. They constantly push out skins instead of fixing their uncountable bugs. Another thing they have been doing is relasing reallyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥bounus games inside of smite that are honestly pretty trash for the most part and unlessz you have a season pass, its impossible to progress in. They honestly remind me of a small child with ADD trying to make a project. But anyway, im going to still play it so........"",0"
"6857,SMITE,2018.0,""Great game ruined by the worst developers i have ever seen.Hirez have a great game  idea, the 3rd person moba is great but Lowrez keep putting out updates that no one wants. the new UI is the latest dumb idea, they basicaly copy and pasted the console UI and stuck it on pc with zero optimisation. It is ugly and confusing to use, it also has much less features then the original UI which everyone liked. Their skin releases r just stingy, almost all their skins r only unlockable from chests with  1 in 50 chanceof getting what u want. Hirez dont listen to their player base at all, if they did this could be an amazing game as the gameplay and mechanics r all there. This game is like vomit that tastes nice, looksâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥and is unappetising but is good if u can overlook the many flaws."",0"
"6858,SMITE,2016.0,""Okay, so let's talk about SMITE for a minute. MOBA's in general tend to be high skill games, and SMITE certainly isn't an exception. Most others are based on original stories and characters and tend to be top down view. This, on the other hand, is based on mythology, and is third person. These are great in many ways. If, say, you want to learn about each character (god) you aren't limited to the game, its website and wiki, but many other sources, you can even take a mythology class and most likely learn about the most well known of each of the gods. The Third person view makes you connect with the game much more. I've played league and DOTA before, and felt a certain disconnect to the games. With Smite, you stand behind your character and have much more control over what you can do, which is a great addition. Though, as with other MOBA's, the game gets repetitive. I'm not the kind of person to stick to only one god, and never play any other god in the game, assault is great for this, because it forces you to play gods you're not used to, but again, the map and play style usually stays the same. For that reason, and that reason only, I have stopped playing the game. My favorite god was Anubis, but I found him boring after getting him to diamond. I do have over 1000 hours into the game, I played maybe 3x as much off of steam, so take my word for it, this game gets old. The addition of other gods is great, but I can't say it brings the excitement back for me. Plus, joust, my favorite map, was changed completely a couple months ago, and at that point I stopped playing it.6/10Fun game, though it gets old"",1"
"6859,SMITE,2018.0,""As if Hirez cares about reviews and what people want.... but let me give you a piece of my mind anyway. Smite, a game that is still dying year after year no matter what their """"smart developpers"""" do. I'll be as brief as possible: Learn how to make a good ranked system that doesn't let bronze people get carried to diamond. Learn to create ranked matches for parties beacause people are sick and tired of playing with reetard randoms that have no clue how conquest is supposed to work. Learn how to make a better matchmaking system. Learn to listen and plz reply coz i want to see ur process of thinking about all these problems that actually killed ur game"",0"
"6860,SMITE,2017.0,""Heavily unfair, some gods are just so powerful that the game is just unplayable sometimes. More exclusive/lmited skins then there is actual skins you can buy. The people who play this game are so toxic you will use the chat to argue with people who think they are the absoluteâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Bugs and glitches from 3 years ago are still here. Assualt is the only balanced game mode because people can't just spam pick overpowered gods since you get them chosen for you randomly."",0"
