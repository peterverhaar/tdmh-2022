"8536,Heroes & Generals,,""its current state this is an absolute joke of a game,  the tank / armour bias is game breaking.This ,with the everyone has a scope makes for some very  short and one sided battles.I really can't see this game making it to 2020. "",0"

"8538,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Matchmaking isâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Veterans VS noobs.Very pay to win. New players cannot compete with vets.Respawn timer gets longer as more deaths, so losing team is punnished.Placed into squads in battle, can't leave them till it ends and cannot play with another charactor if on is in battle already, so no leaving a battle that is being spawn camped.Paratroopers will spawn camp you, they are endgame lvls.Tanks mostly are useless cause every soldier can solo kill you with AT grenades. Most tanks don't have coaxial for killing infantry.As a tanker, within a min an enemy will drive behind you with a AT rocket and kill u.I keep coming back to this every 6 months, these probs have never been addessed."",0"
"8539,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Ok guys.This used to be a game which couldn't be played by new players because there was no balance.They have fixed it with the new update.Staged battle is fun, War is fun.Edit: Game is fun, new players get a Game mode for themselves, but classes prices have gone up so there's a lot of grinding but when you get good you don't see it as grinding you see it as fun, and even better with friends. It has micro transactions but as I said above you """"grind"""" for money and then it's ezHighly recommend, very fun and free"",1"
"8540,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat looking game with great ideas,but some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ devs who like censorship and telling their fanbase to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off (Other reviews go into detail about this).Its also very very pay to win - being able to spend money on getting a sniper rifle, then more money on ribbons to unlock upgrades to make it insta-kill is super annoying.Semi-same for a machine gun (MG42 - SGT44 in particular )Imo they should just make all guns 1-shot besides MGs, pistols and SMGs,remove health bars on tanks and vehicles and replace them with damage models or section by section health (Ammoracks, turrets, hull, tracks, engine all with their own HP) just seems better for the play style.Spawn killing is a problem in this game since I last played (mid-ish 2017), one map in particular where you spawn in as a tanker and within the amount of time it takes for your guy to turn on the in-game engine the enemy tank behind you can kill you stands out in my memory.Just over-all the goods don't out-weigh the bads and the devs don't exactly help the """"goods"""" in any way.   But hey, it's free, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it. Go ahead and try it."",0"
"8541,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat idea, but current game updates have ruined the game for newcomers and casual gamers. Heroes and Generals is a true """"freemium"""" game. RTS side seems like a good idea but it just gets worse and worse. If you want to continue the rts side gold (real money) is a must. Dont bother giving them money like I did, you will regret it!"",0"
"8542,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""This game has some real good potential, the concept is good since most of WW2 games cost money.

"8543,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access Reviewok my previous review was a bit to long.i am new to this game but here it is... was having fun shooting others around the same level as me. then when i hit level three was put in a game with people many many levels higher using tanks and better weapons.i went from a kill death ratio of 1 death and 5 kills to 8 deaths and 2 kills.uhh balance thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥already...this game is a pay to win period. its fubar'd beyond belief.you can say its in beta but its been in beta for three years.face it the company doesnt give a crap about quality only your money.there are many issues read the following reviews.it really isnt worth playing at this point to me. i am nothing but connon fodder for those thats paid for everything.there ya have it , its a piece of junk."",0"
"8544,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewEver since I started playing this game I noticed that it was just a money grab for the devs. They label it as """"BETA"""" and have publicly stated that they have no intention of releasing a full game any time soon. It's been in a """"BETA"""" stage for almost 2 full years and the reasoning behind this is because they can hide their flaws behind that tag.They continue to push new content that further breaks the balance of the game instead of fixing the issues they already have at hand but hey it's """"BETA"""" so we have to deal with it. The way I see it, as soon as you add any source of micro-transactions the game is already fully released, you can't consider it an """"BETA"""" game anymore. Mostly because games that are in an Alpha stage tend to get wiped after that stage. So once you've added micro-transactions, unless you plan on reimbursing your paying players than it's just utterly wrong.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless you enjoy being frustrated everytime you play. Great concept just poor management from the developers."",0"
"8545,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Too much grind, I like grind, but really, TOO MUCH GRIND. If you want to be a  sniper either you play for a year straight, without spending coins (which is impossible due to repairs) to unlock the class, the ribbons to get the weapon, and when you finally have the weapon and you think you're ready to go you still need the scope, which costs 2x more than the weapons and you'll need to grind hours straight with it, you'll need about 1,000kills.............. Or you pay 30$, problem solved. So, you'd like to be a medic? Perfect!That will be 3$,Oh, you can't afford it? Well, you can't be a medic then. Wanna have a good tank? Well 30$, or either farm for about 8 months, I'm not even kidding, all the hours I have were playing my tank crewman, I achieved rank tier 2, can't even afford the next tank.I could go on and on about every other classes or weapons, but you get the picture. **Not really a pay2win but really a pay4fun.**Wan't a war simulator? Put the hours you're gonna waste in this game into a real job a get Squad, Battlefield, anything. Just don't lose time with this like I did."",0"
"8546,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWell the short version is you used to be able to get all theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥you wanted just by doing some light grinding nothing to bad, you could still enjoy the game, but now the developers have bent over their fan base and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed them. Now you can't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing progress at all without paying a bunch of money for weapons of the veteran bonus â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. They took one of my favorite free to plays while I was on a payday binge (thanks for ruining that overkill) and turned it into a giant vat of soupy dogâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥Reto-Moto do you have any lipstick because I WANT TO LOOK PRETTY WHEN YOU â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ME"",0"
"8547,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI can't understand how anyone, who does not want to use extensive amount of money to buy weapons and equipment, can stand to play this game. You have to grind for ages to get levels and ribbons in order to being able to buy anything. Even after being able to unlock something, the ingame money costs are abyssmal. Unless you like to grind (with meh equipent at the beginning of the game) be prepared to use your wallet to achieve anything. I want to like this game, I really do, but all these obstacles designed to frustrate you into using real money take all the enjoyement away."",0"
"8548,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""This game has an unforgiving matchmaking system: after you play with newbies like yourself for 10 hours roughly, it will matchmake you with players with all kinds of high-level weapons and tanks and god knows what else. You'll have to grind hundreds of hours(literally!) or pay real money if you want not to just be a frag on a tiny bicicleta."",0"
"8549,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewSo I downloaded this game to test it out, but it just popped up code 35 and when I looked up what code 35 was turns out it is a ban for cheaters EVEN THOUGH I NEVER PLAYED THE GAME"",0"
"8550,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewFun game, but in my opinion, only up until rank 3...Before rank three, it puts you into games of 'skirmish' maps, perfect for 10 v 10. Then it FORCES you into maps with people that have more skill, better weapons, etc.  Not only does it do that, but the maps it forces you into only has a limit of 20 players playing at once, which is still 10 v 10...on maps that are big enough for hundreds...HUNDREDS of players. Don't let the term 'MMOFPS' fool you...it's match based. This makes 'battle lines' almost non existant due to lack of troops. Seriously, 80 percent of the time I was killed, it was from behind during those maps, because it is SO easy to just walk around the objectives, and due to the size and amount of various types of foliage and terain in the way, no one would ever see you. Ever. Which makes snipers practically dominate...Oh, another thing...the bullet drop and speed of this game is...it's...it's just dumb. Not even 100 yards out and it just drops so hard, or the target moved out of the way because you know...apparently, you are playing with nerf darts in this game, that's how slow bullets travel.Another thing is...If you are rank three and don't want to pay them money...you're going to get murdered by tanks and planes...a lot...because all you have is a rifle...which does nothing to them. So you have to grind out match after match of either losing, or getting destroyed and barely winning. So yeah, if you play it, have fun from ranks 1-3 against evenly matched teams on maps that support 20 people and have 20 people."",0"

"8552,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewSo, I've been playing a bit more, recently. And it has gotten better since I had last played about 6 months ago. But only marginally. This had made me want to change my negative review to positive - that's how good it had gotten. I had just unlocked the Sherman (Worst thing about it - HE and APCR [APCR is a NECESSITY. You can not play tanks without it.] took a while to unlock) and was having a bit of fun with it. As I was writing a positive review, I decided I should see how it is with a new character. So I decided to pull a raw recruit for Germany, and I'll say how fun THAT was...So I started off doing the tutorial for the quick level and First Blood badge (As I had done when I was actually first starting off). I then hopped into a match and it was decent. Nothing amazing. The next match wasn't so good. The third match was abhorrent. I came up against PPShs, PPSs, and PPDs with nothing more than a stock Gewher 43. I was mowed down in seconds flat in close range, and in medium or long range I couldn't hit anything (Mostly due to not having the ability to hold my breath). I had just gotten grenades, so that was alright, but my Gewher could do nothing to combat the automatic SMGs, Rifles, and Machine Guns that almost every enemy had. And thus, I decided to change my review to negative.So here are some pros and cons:Pros:- Looks decent, not amazing, but decent- Very active player baseCons:- Everything is expensive- You don't make much money, next to nothing when starting off- Garbage starting gear -> Can't compete with anyone else- Long grind between level to level- Spawn camping is still a thing, despite devs trying to get rid of it- Spawn protection exploits- Airplanes can damage tanks with AP MGs, strafe with HE MGs, and wreck everything with bombs. All on the same plane.- Infantry have a meriad of ways to destroy tanks- Back cappers areâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥br>- Para- Excessive pandering towards long-time veteran players who basically already have everything- Grind is essentially the pay wall. Pay up now, or face the grind!Yes, I mostly pull tanks."",0"
8553,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,Early Access Reviewthe gameplay is strange with the same caliber bullet in a different gun does 1000 times less damageand it also is so slow that you almost have to buy ingame currency,0
"8554,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe infantry gameplay is fun, but it gets grindy and repeditive REALLY FAST. This game has been in beta forever and will probably be another 5 years or so before its done baised on how slow the davs do things.... Im afriad to say we live in an age where """"early access"""" can be used as a way to earn money from a game isnt done and never will be, with the special abuility to dismiss all complaints becasue its """"just in beta""""  THE GAMES BEEN in beta for over 2 fricken years! I left this game before it was on steam and came back a year later when i saw it was on steam. NOTHING CHANGED! NOTHINGLitterally the only things they added was Russa (wich only russian players wanted) and ONE new map that just used recycled assets from other maps (witch im ok with by the way, why cant they make hundreds of maps with recycled assets? its easy in other games to do that)I dont recommend this game becasue like all """"free to play"""" games it quickly becomes a """"Free to Grind"""" game.Forgive myâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥spelling, steam has no spell check."",0"
"8555,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is most likely the worst game I have ever played in my life. For the first few hours this game is awesome, you drive around in cars, you fight against people your level with guns your level, and its an amazing game.      Then comes level 3. After level 3 the matchmaking turns to complete crap, matching you against either p2w f***, or just people who have played longer. If you're still using the default gun you will constantly be getting killed. Your gun takes 2-3 hits to kill an enemy while most guns either one shot or kill you so fast you think its a one shot, then you get sent back to spawn, spend 10-30 seconds deploying, drive/walk back, get one shotted, repeat. Doesn't that sound like fun!!!??? And if you're not getting killed by better players, you're matched up against tanks, which are 10 times worse. They camp across the map, and shoot shells that hit your general vicinity to kill you. If you're in a jeep or convoy car, all of you will instantly be killed. The player in the tank is invincible to bullets, and the only way to kill them is with anti-tank weapons, which are expensive and are also hard to get. But, the game has to have tanks. You cant have a WWII war game without tanks, the problem is that you only need to be level 3 to be a tank driver, meaning that every game will have up to 10 tanks camping across the map destroying any infantry. In assault its a little better becuase there are planes that counter them, but what the game should really do is remove tanks from skirmish modes, where they are safe from their #1 enemy (fighter pilots cant play skirmish)       Let's move on to the economy. Every time you use a grenade in the battle you have to pay for it. You also have to pay for your gun ammo, vehicle repair costs, and gun maintenance. Now, usually its not very much, but once you try to upgrade your weapons you start gaining very little credits per game. Any half decent gun costs $50,000+ credits, meaning that you have to play constantly to get these weapons. The game probably gets better once you get the better weapons, but I have 65 hours into the game and still have trash weapons. I'm not putting myself through the torture of playing more so I can get better weapons. [EDIT 1]: Oops! Silly me, I forgot about one of the most important things! You might be thinking """"Okay, this game is in Beta, it still has potential, right?"""" Well, this latest update made me think wrong. The Soviet Union was added as a faction (team) to the game. Now, first of all, for the majority of the war the U.S. and the Soviet Union were allies, although tensions were still high, but they wouldn't attack each other, but who cares about that. I dont. What I do care about is the fact that they made the Soviet Union a frickin' powerhouse, their infantry weapons are far superior"
"8556,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewA lot of people have a lot of criticisms of this game. But my biggest issue is the learning curve is too big. New players are paired up with experienced monsters and there is no simple way for new people to learn the game against other people who learn. Yes there sort of is a system, but it is not enough and not long enough. Needs serious work."",0"

8558,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,Dont buy it! The Devs are ignoring the community and trying to squeeze every dollar thats left in the game out of it. And btw the screenshots are totally faked. The game looks totally different (Gameplay and Graphics)To make that clear: I was a closed Beta tester and originally loved the idea. Sadly the game was ruined.,0
"8559,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game has a lot of great potential and could be extremely fun to play and enjoyable and I love the concept. However, this game has SO MUCH LAG that it is literally impossible to enjoy. The few battles I've played without lag were pretty fun, but the servers for this game absolutely suck. Not only that, but it also has very unrealistic damage which makes it really hard to kill since the game isnt all too smooth. It takes at LEAST 3 shots with the gewehr (starting german rifle) to kill someone, and over 8 shots with the first unlockable submachine gun. If the developers enhanced their servers, changed the damage to be more realistic, and made the aiming more smooth, then I'd certainly recommend this game for anyone, but right now theres unfortunately a lot of unfulfilled potential."",0"
"8560,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""This game is terribly addictive - but its also incredibly frustrating to start off in - as many of the reviews say - you get thrown into matches with tanks and airplanes with nothing but a basic rifle, and get constantly one-shoted by campers with high-tier gear.... with those on your team who could potentially clear these campers off doing exactly the same to the low-tier people on the other team.If not for the totally unbalanced matchmaking, I would give this game a thumbs up, this way its a big no-no."",0"
"8561,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Heroes and Generals is a game with a lot of potential. The gameplay is fun, no weapon is overpowered outside of their intended engagement distance. With this in mind, stay away from the airfield maps unless you like getting sniped every time you poke your head out. What kills this game and makes me dislike it is how pay to win it is. I have played a lot of this game and the only weapons I own in it, except for the defaults, are the M3 Grease Gun and the MP34, while I am going up against people with STGs and MG42s, and it feels very unbalanced. What I would like is if Reto would take this the way of the ghost in the shell game, with some weapons you can unlock with an appropriate amount of gameplay and then buy for a very small amount of in game currency. They could make these weapons things like the first SMG and the bolt action, but the mods you have to earn yourself. I have used the M1 Garand extensively and have only very recently reached M1 Garand specialist 11th grade, which, were it a sniper, would allow me to get a scope, and while I have the M1911 and M1903 unlocked, I am nowhere near being able to buy either. Please, Reto, cut down on the pay to win. I know you have to make money, but please, don't make it next to impossible to earn anything past the first SMG"",0"
"8562,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewPlaying this game after 50 hours is hell. Imagine BF4 but downgraded by 1000000000000000. Yea this game is free but I'd rather pay the 20 bucks the game is worth than playing this game. The progression is super slow, so it's going to take a while to get guns and better vehicles. The only way to get around it is by paying for Gold, which is payed with real money. One of the best weapons in the game is more than 10 bucks... what? Yep more than 10 bucks for one gun, again sorry for comparing, but if you pay another 10 bucks you'll get BF4 which has no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t Gold system and the progression is much faster.Another thing about this game is the balance (btw balance is not even a thing in this game). The gun fights are fairly balanced however but the vehicles... just no... Tanks and planes are way to OP in this game since many people do not carry anti-armor weapons. This is because no one starts with anti-armor weapons regarding your class and the rocket launchers are SUPER expensive. There are some AA guns on the maps to take down the planes but it seems as if no one is using them... Side note: The American standard grenades are SUPER OP as well...Another thing that factors into the poorly balanced game are the generals. Basically anyone who spits out money can be a freakin general. The role of these generals are to provide you with specific squads in each battle. Each squad has its own purpose and you can only spawn certain vehicles in each squad. Which leads to very unbalanced combat. I've had games where my team has had 6 tanks spawned in and the other team only had less than 3. Vice-Versa, I've  been on teams where we've have no squads to spawn in vehicles leading us to get pooped on (I kinda felt like the other team just finished eating bad truck food and they pooped out the spawn of Satin and made our team eat it).Um yea................................................................ #bikeSQUADShoutout to my boi Noah and Neil for being the the bikesquad.

"8567,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""this game is a thing, but the balance is horrible and anti- german bias is blatantly evident by the devs. why is the M2 carbine even in the game since it was so rediculously uncommon during ww2? why do all the american carbines use 30 rd mags instead of the infinitely more common 15? why doesnt the german AA gun do more damage? the thing is a 20mm for christ sake. why do the johnson automatic rifles exist in this game? less than 10,000 were built and all they add is ANOTHER M16 FOR THE AMERICANS. the johnson took the BULL**** that americans did with the 1918 and boosted the stats. (where they took a heavy hitting slow firing gun and cranked the fire rate up to 11) why doesnt germany have an automatic rifle? the MG-30 exists. the panzershreck stops being useful after 150M. the bazooka on the other hand has near infinite practical effectivness if you look at their respective charts. why WOULD the bazooka be more effective than a panzershreck? the PZS had a larger round. why do the russians start off with a 70 round smg? WHY DOES GERMANY START OFF WITH A 20 RD SMG? 32 rd mags were made available for the mp34 during ww2, but i guess that kind of upgrade only counts if you are american. the AVS-36 only had 34,500 (MAX) rifles produced, why is it in the game? why does russia need another automatic gun when they have SMGs that hold 70 rds? why does a DP-27 not puncture armor, but when you put it in a T38 light tank it melts through armor like a .50cal? its a .30 cal round and its not EVEN 30-06. why are all of the planes in this game flying tanks? the firepower that most planes in this game are able to take should rip straight through them like a laser through paper mache.AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, CAN WE GET ANTI AIR GUNS THAT COUNTER PLANES?! THAT THING THAT THEY WERE DESIGNED TO DO?!?!all of this doesnt even mention the bugs this game has, like how barbed wire can juggle you so you cant move, how your parachute wont open for no reason, para planes randomly crashing into the ground. the bodies that randomly fall out of the sky. 2 ton cars flipping upside down from going over train tracks slowly. at this point having sunk several hundred hours into this game, i know it as """"the bad game"""" and for some reason keep playing only to make more money and buy more stuff. that part is fun, PLAYING for the most part, is NOT and the game will give you more money to ride a bike in a field, than to play because of upkeep. dont buy gold, the devs dont deserve the money until they fix their mess."",0"
"8568,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""This game has degenerated into a lagfest. LAG LAG AND LAG. Rubberbanding and misfiring of guns is constant when you are assigned your server location. Often times its a distant server and the lag gets so bad that the game is unplayable. Now they have it so if you quit the game, you are locked out of being able to play any other map until the game you were in is over... good luck if you happen to have a sorry server connection on a three way battle. Your are unable to play for more than 30 minutes  and then there is a really good chance that you will get stuck on the same sorry server you tried to leave if you try to play again. They want you to buy a membership but the ratio of good server connections to bad server connections makes this a money losing proposition for you but not to the developers.

Since all that time, I lost the count of years that passed. The game remained in nearly the same stage it used to be. Graphics are as bad as they were, and so are the sounds, and the rest as well. Free players can play, but will encounter so many obstacles, they are most likely to bounce off of them, and stop playing. Everything is so expensive, it takes ages to grind for, unless you pay with real cash. If you pay, you can have everything straight away + extra slot for weapon, and extra slot for a bage, otherwise... Want a weapon? No problem, grind till death. Want to upgrade your weapon? No problem, grind till death.  Want new character, or more slots for them? No problem, grind till death. Want a vehicle, or more slots for them? No problem, grind till death. One of the features in this game is possibility to have assault team, but you will rather die of the old age, than ever have one. As long as everyone remembers, Americans were always OP with the M1 Garands, now Germans have Gewehrs 43 to counter them, but still M1 Garand owns. Previously it was M1 Garand against Kar98k. Spawnâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥is present, just as it was before. Take a tank and park it in front of the enemy base. 10/0, 20/0, 30/0, 40/0 etc., such stats of the tank crew are not rare to see. The team with the tank wins the game in 99.99%./Edit.Recent update introduced new nation, Russia. I cant tell anything about their tanks, but surely their aiplanes are the best at the moment with two bombs, beside the infantry having the best gun which is PPSz. Russians also have the best all rounded gun in the game, which is PTRD. It kills infantry with one shot, it destroyes light vehicles with one shot, and is capable of destroying pretty much all of the low tier armored vehicles in couple shots. It is also possible to shot down aircrafts with it. At the end, I need to add, that the Russian infantry have the best default camouflage, which makes them hard to see, everywhere./Edit. Heroes & Generals is run by communists. They spread propaganda, lies, delete posts, topics, ban people that have different opinion. They glorify the Communists, and Sickle with Hammer.From the forum topic.""""The Hammer and Sickle is there to stay, where as we won't implement Axis symbols such as the swastika in the game.There are tons of countries and organizations all over the world that sadly committed atrocious crimes against humanity. The Axis's have a very large negative reputation in this aspect, represented by their flag, a 'face' and their concentration camps. In this game, the German faction is the Wehrmacht and not f.e. the SS.The hammer and sickle also represents some of the above mentioned, but the symbolic value is way less concise and known. It goes beyond war crimes and is more arbitrary.The topic will remain locked, as this is just an open flame war.~Circinus""""I do not recommend."",0"
"8570,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI have been playing a lot of this game for over six months now. I used to find this game very enjoyable and even got some of my friends to try it out. Old patches seemed to move the game forward by removing some bugs. Now  the Timoskenko update is out and has tons of issues. From balance to poor optimization of the general game. Poor servers with a ton of down time in the past two weeks. I dont consider this game pay to win but it would seem the developers dont care much about making general improvments. They would rather make """"more"""" content to get more money from the people who actually buy stuff with money. I really hope they get there act together because this used to be a fun game. Honestly they really should be focused on making a enjoyable experience for the player then creating buggy and unbalanced mess of a patch that is Timoskenko."",0"

"8574,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWASTED POTENTIAL.  That is the basic summary of this game.  It's not early access.  It's been around since 2011/2012.  This game will never leave beta, as the devs don't want to lose that excuse.This game is great until about 100 hours in, then you start to see all the flaws.  Things like a horrible match-maker (being put into games that are 30 seconds away from ending), garbage physics (a tank can flip if it hits a bicycle), bugs that are never addressed (spawn your tank upside down anyone?) and inept devs that rarely communicate with the user base and clearly only care about profit (raise in price for vet membership at same time you greatly nerf XP gains, then more recently nerf ribbon XP gain by a (user base) reported 75%?).  It's clear what these devs value.  Then there are the issues with the RTS side.It's a real shame because the game concept isn't bad.  It can be quite fun, if your teammates aren't complete idiots that spend the whole round trying to snipe, using non sniper rifles (not just non-scoped rifles, but fools using SMG's and LMG's like they're snipers) or completely ignoring the objectives in the game.*edit*The devs scaled back the ribbon xp nerf after the tears and gnashing of teeth by the playerbase, myself included.  A definite +1 for the devs.  Wish I could say that more often.  I still think wasted potential is the best description for the game, but it's in a fairly playable/reasonable state right now.  Good enough for a free game.  Too bad I can't give this game a neutral rating."",0"
"8575,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Part I: TanksIf I was asked to put it in one word, I'd say: Frustrating.Second word would be: Dissapointing.Third: Hopeless.Frustrating because there are so many flaws, broken mechanics, plain stupid game design decisions that you will get tons of negative emotions out of this """"game"""". Lets name a few (not evey by all means, there are too many): 1. Physics. They are bearable, but primitive leaving you with an impression of a very cheap or old game. Tank wont pass through wire or can be stopped with a car parked on his path. We are talking about a moving tank btw.2. Balance. There is none. 2 to 4 tiers of tanks in each category: lights, mediums, heavies and TDs. Balancer does not take tiers into account meaning you will fight T-70 in your Pz Ia (you can't pen their armor) or Chaffies in your T-38 (they will kill you in 3 seconds. Not a pleasant experience, And it will take you few months to grind to Panther or T34-85. And keep in mind that intermediate tiers are not worth buying, so if you are a fan of grinding and suffering this game is for you and that review is not.3. Stupid game design decisions. Reto managed to create a situation where tanks are both frustrating to play for and against. As an infantry its not fun to be killed over and over again by HEs with 20 m splash from another half of the map. Mind that tanks have like 3 sec reload (some) so these splashes will hit often. On the other hand it takes just 2 magnetic grenades to kill a tank and there is no way to see them coming as tanks have limited vision. So you have to rely on your teammates. Random teammates. Good luck with that. Or you can bring friend who will waist his time guarding your tank. You know what will be a reaction of a Kings Tiger driver when he hears an infantry whistle somewhere near? RUN, RUN for your life! Like a terrified dear through the woods. Yeah! Thats what these so called developers (a community laughing stock) managed to create.Dissapointing as the concept is good. But devs are not. They are lazy, greedy and unproffesional. So, a wasted opportunity. Hopeless for the same reasons."",0"
"8576,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewDont waste your time and money on thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥joke of a  game. I played it for around 27 hours this week, and that is time im never getting back. Unless you like playing for hours on end without unlocking anything, only being able to buy the starter garbage weapons and jeeps, and like being spawn camped by tanks and snipers all day. The devs of this game is trying so hard to force you to buy your way to power instead of actually playing the game. 0/10 untill the devs start making a real game.Decided to give the game another go to see if it got better. Spoilers, it didnt. This game gets worse every damn time you play it. the game is full of bugs such a bolt action rifles looking like the they shoot twice so the shot you intended to hit some goes into the next postal code. complete broken spawn system, its also super easy for one person in a heavy tank to spawn camp your entire team. Most battles end in either total stalemates or a massive blitz that smashes one team. At this point it seems like the only thing that actually works in this game is the insanely overpriced store where you can buy yourself all the power in the world (only if you are dumb enough to even give these devs a penny for this joke of a game). I have a really hard time understanding why anyone would ever support the devs or this game what so ever when all they care about it taking your money and clearly not using it to improve the game at all. 4 years of being in """"beta"""" should give you a pretty good idea of how little the devs care about their playerbase.

"8577,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""This Game was a funny and good game.I Played this game approximately 800 hours!But now I have stopped playing this game because of the following reasons:- Infantry is hunting tanks- Many People are running around and dont care about the game mode(people go tank hunting or make things where they can earn credits)- Maps are incredible unbalanced (defense is winning again and again)- Maps are not good for strategy playing. There are no places where you can Hide an APC. And everybody has Panzerfaust or stuff like that to destroy APCs instant.- Weapons are incredible unbalanced.It always takes such a long time (month or years) to convince the DEVs to nerve stuff.- This game is OVERENGINEEREDToo much troll Stuff for Troll Players (PTRD, swimming vehicles and whatever)- Snipers and Campers EVERYWHEREeverybody wants to be a sniper now and is hiding behind those plants.In earlier versions there where not so many plants. So snipers where not so OP.--> And again nobody cares about Game Mode and capture zones.- PERFORMANCE People have 30 FPS or less- Spawn Zones are pointless placed in the maps where it dont make sense.- The general/strategy part of the game make NO SENSE.in earlier versions it made sense but now in every city there are 3000 infanftry or other stuff.- Russia is winning wars because of auto resolve and nobody cares about it.It makes the strategy part pointless and will take several years until the DEVs will understand this."",0"
"8578,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis review got edited!The game is not a new player friendly at all. My initial review was full of rage.This is a very strange game. Not your typical shooter, hard, but once you get into it - over 100 hours - you will do just fine.Read guides, watch youtube videos and you still will not know a lot about the game.Experience. This is what you need. You need to learn the maps, you need to understand that this is a strategy game first, then a shooter. You need to learn where to be at what moment, after that you will enjoy it.Few advices to new players:1. Purchase weapons only after a good research. I have wasted tons of credits to go trough different routes and weapons.2. Learn the maps and experience the game.3. You need at least 1 hero to level 10 and one to 5-9 to say you know something. Before that it may be frustrating."",1"

I suppose for the ardent supporters, if they find something redeemable here, they might enjoy it.  I instead was greeted by cheesy mechanics rewarding one hit kills with bolt actions, ineffectual rifles, and an overall feeling of futility as I tried to do anything except die.  If you want to waste your bandwidth and try, by all means I welcome you to it.  This however, isn't a game I would recommend to friends.  The sheer progression for weapons is one of the absolute worst I have seen in a Free2Play game.  I have seen the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t Warframe pulls, and this pulls far far ahead.

"8580,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""What can I say... the game has a lot going on for it, it's a nice shooter game that has it's issues. But what's most annoying me is the money system. For example, my last game I played, I was equiped with thompson and bazooka. We fought well but in the end we got bested. I was top of our team list, multiple frags etc. I got 11k+ credits for the fight, my ammorefill cost was 13k... so basically I lost 2k playing. WTF? And dont get me started about the veteran crap, the bonuses you gain (not just money gain, but in-game edge)This game is so p2w!

"8582,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIm sick of developers â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the bed. There are so many concepts which are perfectly painted and so damn simple, but turn out to be buggy, unpolished, pay2win, and a complete grind. This game fills a few of those categories. The painful thing about H&G is that it easily could be great. When alone, the mechanics of this game, including both weapory and gamemodes, are great. Balancing nonwithstanding, if you are a player committed to overcoming the grind and leveling up, you would enjoy this game. But once there are tanks to be fought, unbalanced slugfests of armor running your character over and over again, while you have no acess to anything to remotely damage a single tank, you will lose satisfaction. and at this point in the game's development, it seems like that isnt going to change. It makes me sad, almost angry at modern game companies that grab for cash like this. Again and again, titles such as War of the Roses, War of the Vikings, Rome 2 Total War, Planetside 2, and Heroes (Horrendous) and Generals (Grindfest) show mechanical potential, but disappoint the vocal majority of their players. So I implore you"
"8583,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewDon't even think about playing this game.. Its are crappy game and the only thing the devs want is money.. Why is that you ask? Well try playing it and getting to rank 6, after that good luck because you need to grind for atleast 100+ hours to get something good, plus the devs don't care about the players, they are hiding behind a mask and it might look like they do but they don't.Another BIG issue is the balancing and it is terrible, your team might not have tanks and the enemy team has tanks, the same for planes and everything else.Also this is a pay to win game, Why? Well because the money you are earning is not near enough to buy anything, you get like 3k per game and the basic meele weapon is 15k, not to mention the sniper rifle which is about 250k so you will have to but gold with real money and spend it, if it was only for the looks it was ok but it isn't, you pay for guns, rifle, lmg and basicly... everything, the only thing that you don't have to pay for is the civilian car and bike that spawn near points, you even have to pay for repairing your weapon and buy ammo. Plus you have 3 factions and the items that you buy doesn't share between the factions... and if you look at the reviews and the rating you'll see that its probably droping because people are starting to realize that this is a pay to win game with a lot of bugs and doesn't worth your time and your money."",0"
"8584,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""I played this game when it was relativly new and it showed so much promise. And it still does.As someone who remembers the early days of waiting 10 minutes to get into matches, it pains me to see the game in its current state. But the devs just don't understand how game balance works and that's this game's biggest flaw is that if you don't play the OP weapons then you get slaughtered.For instance.Tanks should have much more weight in a fight than they do. A light tank is essentially a truck with a gun. The ease that you can kill even the tier 3 tanks is laughable. An easy fix would be to adopt a weapon limit to each team. Or the fact than every and I mean EVERY SINGLE SOLDIER can have access to a scoped sniper rifle. Not only that, but properly modified every soldier can have access to a SINGLE BODY SHOT RIFLE.Not to mention the grinding. My God the gridning in this game has gotten terrible. The economy of this game is horrendous. You barely break even on an account with premium time"

Because it's a free game after all (do not agree it is Pay to win, but the GRIND have become really annoying over the time), it's WW2 shooter that reminded me of good old Battlefield 1942. I think i gave enough time the Developers to show me they are trying to improve the game... but most of patches did nothing more then adding fancy, but useless, stuff. Ingame maps are big, but people cant find each other and there is no intense action, but camping with snipers in bushes and tanks pixelshooting you from other corner of the map. Paradrops and jeep raids are best way of taking flags like in arcade style.But one more thing about the GRIND. I played with like 300 hours with main footmen and till now i've reached only level 15 (out of 22)... Just imagined i have to play till i retire from work to reach cap and instantly got frustrated.

Even other games such as world of Tanks or War Thunder could let you get it right off the bat. This game surely needs a reboot because this game anit going far, its only makes other WWII games much better than this, sure it dose have good maps and nice graphics but it dosent cover the rage and pain to deal throught a game. My word for it never get it untill theirs 3 good reviews in a row on it.      And if not just dont get it will save your lifetime. And for the people who have this game heres a note. Never give a single penny to this game it wont do you much now. And also if you do play it go for German its the only team that can win with its rediculos unbalnce team. (Updated) To add this on since its been a while I will admit this, they got the idea and the feel of what's it's like in the war, the guns and weapons are well detailed and the hard work of the people who did this much on the visual of the game is great. But since I haven't played it in a while my bets it's not much changed maybe half grind but the balance of the game is still a mystery. Overall give it a shot at least if you want but don't give a penny to them, because if we stop giving them the cash maybe they will finally fix some of the major problems in this game. But anywho take care you guys and fight on in the war! (updated 11/11/16) Since its veterans day i thought playing this game would do it, but it really didnt. For whats new going on about this just gettign worse and this whole game might abandon ship.       They got ride of bikes and the old trucks from the spawn point witch really is sad because thats the simple way to go to one place or another and not have to be forced to buy a truck. repairs in this game is just more sad because paying that much your lossing about 21,000 coins in that game for just that one weapon. still no since of balence of guns or ranks, grind is still not great, and the game balence of when their 3 enemy planes and your team has none. Idk who did there reserch but surely they didnt had much logic of having something little balence in the game. Buying gold is just pathic, just have it at simple numbers like 4.99 or 9.99 its that easy.      Maybe they need to get a buck more to survie but surely this game is still have no single thing of redemtion in it. For just something simple, have the game or balence of ranks, teams and guns, dont charged alot of paying or repairing weapons, and at least have some respect of whats the purpose of the game. This game has places where battle  acutally happen, and all over 70million lives lost in the war total, weaither its axis, allies or even citizens you really need to know whats it just like being in their shoes. So this game works but still not even, if you want to try it go ahead, but dont donate to them, if there going to screw you over in the future. A suggestion of another game would be Post Scriptum as it has no pay to win, alot more balanced, and a bit more content in my opinion, as its still early game but its more playable than H&G."",0"

"8595,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewLets do some grind math real quick, average mission time 53 minutes, average payout per mission 4800 credits, cost of a new weapon 92280 credits. That translates to about 17 hours of in match game time for that new weapon assuming you and your team perform above par and you win every single one of your matches. Not only that but all the parts and ammo you can buy to make your gun perform differently are going to need constant credit infusions to keep working. Don't leave now theres more! All that grind is just for your primary weapon, so you burn maybe 35 - 40 hours to get that gun and all her mods. by then you have already unlocked access to the straight up better version of said gun WHICH IS EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE.Now that im done talking about my third job, lets talk about how the game runs.  Graphics got lost in 2005, net code is back there with it as well. The menu, squad, and friends system don't just need work, you flip a coin at launch to see if they even do work. Anyone out there have vision problems? Expect white text over white backgrounds and poor advanced graphics options.

"8597,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game started off great but as it gets patched more and more the hit detection gets worse.  The latest major patch, Rommel, broke it entirely.  There are numerous threads about it and the devs response has been to blame it on the player base, stating it's clientside lag.  It is not, watch some of the videos.  It is a free game, but after a round or two, the frustration of the broken mechanics kicks in and will have you looking for a new shooter."",0"

"8602,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""After a strong year with several updates that improved the game considerably, the developers have decided to worsen the already rough grind by substantially increasing the credit cost for new soldiers. Why they think this is a positive change for anyone I have no idea. In the end it's a great game ruined by its user-hostile monetization model and this is why I cannot recommend it anymore. Your money or time is better spent elsewhere."",0"
"8603,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game confuses me. Because it isn't badly done.It's a f2p game, but it's mostly pay2avoidgrind. There are some p2w elements to it, but I've not noticed them have any significant impact on the game. You gain the free currency fast and unlock the gear quickly. I was in a tank with a big gun on it by my second night of playing. The interesting part is that the starter tank with a machine gun isn't actually bad. Infact, it's pretty good. You're essentially a metal box of anti-infantry that can park in any barn you want. It works well and you don't feel crapped on from above just because you're not shelling out money on unlocking upgrades quicker with real cash.The weapons are heavily customisable and they actually make a difference. I have an SMG that fires so fast that at least one person has accused me of hacking because of it. Wonderful thing since i'm such a crap shot.You can also steal bicycles and give people backies. Which is clearly a major selling point.The game itself is very basic, there's not much to it. It's a WW2 shooter which feels to me like Day of Defeat on Battlefield sized maps. But it's nothing special, just a shooter.But it has me hooked, I've no idea why. The game is average but the fact that it's a f2p game that doesn't feel like i'm forced to pay up to keep up has me smirking as i sit in my little tank gunning down anyone that comes near the cap point. I could use a bigger tank, sure. You gain currency just as quickly as you gain unlocks. But I don't want to, because everything in this game, from basic gear to bigger gear has it's place.I'm still confused as to exactly what it is about this game I like. Maybe it's just simply because it's hitting all the right notes for a f2p game that wants to include a p2w element but doesn't feel like a monster grind or keeping me down because of it. Maybe it's because the game is barebones but feels like it has a lot of content to it and will only have more on the way?Or maybe it's just because I can steal some American's bicycle for the glorious Fatherland."",1"
8604,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game was good at one point back when you could faction lock and were stuck with that side for a whole war but ever sense then this game has gone to completeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥its a grind sim and you will play tank missions where you will do amazing and not lose a tank but it will cost you more to replace your ammo in your tank costing more then you make a game so no this game i have lost all love for they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed it up.,0
8605,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,in my opinion heroes & generals could be a great game but now it is more likely pay to win.if you want to purchase something it will take ages unless you buy it with real money which still sucks because it is so unfair.the only way to enjoy this game is to play and never reach rank 5 as a soldier.playing as a starte may sound boring but thats only when i enjoyed this game,0
8606,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,Dont waste your time and money. The game is a complete grind fest even if you spend money for veteran status its a blatent pay to win cash grab riddled with bugs. The developers dont care about making the game less so in fact whenever they patch the game it seems to take more steps back than forward. The developers make poor design descisions all the time they cant figure out if they want realism or arcade action and choose the worst of both. Prepare to get shot many times by guys running around firing anti tank rifle from the hip i know ive done it so many times myself but hey they want it arcady. Ohh wait if i aim my gun an inch from the side of an object my gun will not be shootable because it was too close the game decided that position was unacceptable. Devs decided we wont have a lean but we will make prone extremely annoying to use apparently a soldier has trouble moving on the ground with any efficiancy. There are a myriad of annoying bugs which have been in the game since I played it years ago reto moto do not care about fixing the game they make it worse and hold thier hand out for your cash. this game will cost you more than most and keep you shilling out for it with little effort from the devs to fix basic gameplay.

Unfortune but the game is fixable, but its been in beta for 6+ years lmao, came into """"full release"""" some time ago and its pretty much still a beta, only went into """"full release"""" for a little celebration because the way this game is going, the community sure does need one. I mean it still has 8 whole maps for you to grind thousands of matches on.Take it from someone who played from 2015, Played it so you don't have to. They banned my friend TWICE for """"hacking"""" even though he never did. Whoever moderates this is way to damn trigger happy on banning and is watching like a cop watches black dudes driving on a highway. Oh well though right? go make a new account and spend some gold comrad xd Wrapping it up though it was a pretty good game, and if this was mid 2015 - early 2016 I would probably recommend this but I really cant. but for the GOOD part of this game I do have to say It IS fun, if you want to play it you should give it a try because its fun for the first few hours, and it is a good unique experience, gunplay is something very new to other FPS' which is good. but the repetitive nature and lackluster amount of maps makes the game really boring so I really cant recommend this."",0"

8611,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game when i first started playing it was awsome but after this update and how i have been hearing people are getting treated like crap by the devs and some of these people getting perm banned for no reason and it sucks cause it was a good game but its glitchy as hell the mechanics are pretty much a gaint mess and the sqaud system is horrid right now and you cant change class at ALL after choosing at the beginning unlike before when you could change at anytime which i think gave it a HUGE plus but now you can only choose one class and the sqaud system pretty can give new players roles as leader instead of a experianced player and they can kick you for not doing stuff but when you a pilot and they force you to cap a point when you dont exactly are armed for it what do you do? Not only that but its VERY pay to win as you have to grind over and over again but the thing is its based on how long you play in a match and not have good you did so you could be high in the leader boreds but get barly and coin but then you have to maintain EVERYTHING your gear the upgrads your vechiles your upgrades for those but its so costly you end up with barely any coin left for weapons and the factions ARE WAY OUT BALANCED the poor rusains are so weak compared to the germans and americans.sadly all i can hope for is a miracle cause this game needs it bad!!!!from a angry and disapointed gamer,0

"8614,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Been playing this game a number of years so I speak with experience of yesterday and today. Prior to this review I checked the number of positive reviews (just over 50K) and the number of negative (just over 39K), I find myself in the middle but for the purpose of Steam I have ticked no. First of all please ignore the images on show, I don't think any player gets graphics like that, I have a pretty top rig with decent FPS and graphics on high and its nothing like the images above. Clearly they have had the Kim Kardashian effect of having been glossed.The only good thing about this game is that its a game that still has a lot of potential, yet the potential is never really realised. The Devs make far to many judgement errors when developing this game and I will list a number of them below.As a free game I do appreciate that development must be slow due to revenue streams being tight, but still I expect a certain bare minimal to let that stand, but now things are really sloppy.1: Give the people/community what they wantDid you know that LMGs didn't have bipods? Yep that right, all those movies and documentaries you have seen were the Germans mount MGs on the ground, or on concrete/sandbag bunkers were all fake. Well according to H&Gs there are. Even though they are drawn on the weapon you can't use them. Virtually every WW2 game I have ever played apart from the very early Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games from the early 2000s had deployable bipods. I think Day of Defeat may have been the first and that was a mod for the original Half life which gives you some idea of how long they have been used. On forums all I see is give me bipods, give me certain planes, and yet the devs say, not currently planned. When CoD WW2 came out all MGs were mountable, so how come the Devs of CoD included it even though MGs don't really play a huge part, were as MGs in H&Gs do? Makes no sense and especially hafter 3-4 years of asking too.2: Devs don't know their history sometimes.There is a wide variety of weapons and vehicles in this game and for the most part they actually do look great. But one of the most laughable things is when they introduced planes that never even featured in WW2. On the Generals map, you can attack Switzerland. Hang on were they not nutural in WW2? Russia can attack USA and vice versa, could have sworn they were allies.3: A cheater/hackers paradiseI never quite understand the need to hack, cheat, use macros etc in MMOs because ultimately it can kill of the the genuine player base. In spite of the devs best efforts this game is a hack fest, and it has become quiet the joke especially when you see some of the videos on YouTube. Recently I got headshot sniped by a pistol, the other player was on the other side of the map. This after the introduction of a major update which included new anti hack software. But like anything, go for the lowest bidder and you will get what you have paid for.4: Very angry player baseCompared to a few years ago, abuse has become aweful and this has nothing to do with bad players (although it is the individual player committing the abuse) its the way the devs have allowed players to play.There is really no way to learn this game any more except the hard way compared to years ago when there was a basic training map and a basic skirmish map. Now any player of any rank and experience can play any map and in a lot cases thats not fair for the new player and also not fair for the experienced player. In the basic maps that are supposed to be designed for novice players, its far too common now to come across players with high end gear. Flip the coin and you have similar issued playing a General/war game and find yourself under the command of a player who is lvl 4 and your lvl 15, it simply makes no sense. With this in mind you see a lot of abuse in game due to players with a lack of experience not playing as a team. A simple solution would be to add restrictions to the game play options.I still have hope for this game, and always like to return every now and then to see where the game is, but its painful sometimes to see its current state."",0"
"8615,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewIt was a very fun game to play with friends,yet very frustrating because it requires loads of grinding to get the weapon you want, which isn't really my style of gameplay, but overall I liked it the short time I played it"",1"
"8616,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat integration of RTS elements with a FPS action. Both """"Heroes"""" and """"Generals"""" parts of the game affect each other, making you valuable whichever one you choose to focus on.Even though that creates uneven odds sometimes, so players should be prepared to face higher threats, but if you and your team are competent, you always stand a chance.The combat is mainly about positioning, situational awareness and stealth, though aiming should be not disregarded at all.The RTS part is quite simple and success depends on soldiers, but the point of commander is to make sure that his faction's troops have a fair or even a bit advantageous situation to guarantee victory in battle."",1"
"8617,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Grinding? Yes. Getting sniped from across the map? Yes.Still fun? Yes. Would recommend to anyone interested in large scale WWII shooters, but not to people who get angry easily. Matchmaking is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, takes forever, but when you finally do get that match, it's a 50/50 shot to getting arserammed by german tanks or 500 new holes from a Russian PPSH.

"8619,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""PHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW I have waited a long time to write this review.  Heroes and Generals is the best made game I have ever played, but... the most poorley made game I have ever played.  You start up the game, pick a faction: Russia     (The one everybody loves), Germany, (The one everybody hates), and the Allies (The other one). When you first start playing, it starts you off against players like you that have no idea what they are doing, and you generally have a good time.  Then they move you to the next tier where you get a good feel for what the game will be like, with smgs, semi auto rifles, bolt action rifles and good stuff like that.  Also, you die super fast, and don't expect to have health regen.  If you get hurt, the game will not help you out, so you need to look for med crates placed conveniently (or inconveniently) around the map.  Same thing goes with looking for an ammo cache or anti-tank weapons.  But you will die (Trust me, you will) and you will spawn back in... AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP HAHAHAHAHA!  Yes, you need to walk all the way back to everywere once you die.  I suggest that you invest in your faction's truck early on.  Speaking of vehicles, the gameplay with them is crazy, fun and filled with tons of explosions and lots of messed up physics.  But they have one other type of vehicle... Tanks.  Oh dear lord TANKS!  Where do I even begin... Okay.  I can do this.  You will have PTSD after playing for the first time with tanks.  They are OP as balls and make you die and respawn, but we already covered that.  If you don't take the game seriousley, as I often just mess around, they can add some fun to the game, but you will never meet somebody that just played a match with tanks and said that they liked it.  Oh, and planes are the same thing, except you can't destroy them NEARLEY as easily as you can with tanks.  Then I bought a tanker and pretty much beat the game.Now, I will tank I mean TALK about the largest issue with the game.  The Grind.  After the first set of vehicles and weapons, tier II weapons all cost way too much.  You can't make the money that you need because of another system I will talk about later.  Because of the low amount of maps to play on, there is almost nothing else to do accept grinding for xp and weapons.  You can't even immediatley get the weapon that you want because you don't have the xp in a certain ribbon to buy it.  I will give you an example.  Say I am playing as the Allies.  I want the Thompson SMG, a Ka Bar knife and some stick grenades.  I have the M1 Garand, and I level up my infantry assault ribon to level 4 to get the Grease Gun SMG and some Pinaple Grenades.  Now I buy a shovel, because I need to get to level 5 in close combat to unlock the knife.  I use the SMG, but then i'm not using the grenades, so I can't level up in explosives.  I switch to grenades, but then i'm not using my shovel so i'm not leveling up close combat.  I use my shovel, but then i'm not using my SMG.  I pick up the smg that the enemy I just killed dropped and use that.  But then i'm not getting xp in my Grease Gun so i can upgrade it.  So it goes in a terrible circle.I do like one system in the game, beleive it or not: The weapon upgrade system.  If you use a weapon of your faction a lot, you will be given the oppertunity to buy upgrades for it, like springs, sights, barrels and some cosmetic things like skins.  I like this system because the game rewards you for using the weapons that you enjoy most.  For instance, I like the M1 Garand.  A lot.  I first used it as a sniper weapon, changing the ammo, getting better gas sealing and even a scope.  But then I changed it to a close-quarters weapon, taking off the scope, lowering the percision and damage while cranking up the rate of fire.  There is a downside to this system, however.The game's repair system, Ho MAMA.  Every bullet you fire, every vehicle you spawn, every grenade you throw and every tank shell that you shoot has a price tag.  It costs money, lots of it.  I kind of like the system, as it makes you ration your resourses and only fire when nessecary, but other times you actually lose money between games for no fault of your own.  Also, you guessed it- upgrades cost money between matches, so the game also punishes you for using them, which is a little strange.Here are my suggestions to make this game better.1. Add more weapons, so skill trees don't only unlock you one or two weapons2. Lower the prices on everything, the game grinds on for way to long3. Add more maps, the only thing that keeps you going is unlocking new weapons and tools, playing on the same maps over and over again gets tiresome very fast.4.Balance your damn tanks5.Place spawn points much closer to the action.Okay... My opinion of this game... I like this game and want it to be good, but it is constantley held back from all these problems.  And I know fanboys of this game will eagerley tell me that they are working on adding more weapons and maps and all that good stuff, but that is NO excuse for what we have NOW.  They should have waited much longer on releasing this game, as I am being shot through walls and spawncamped by dreadful tanks.  But one redeeming feature is that it is completley free to play, as of now.  My final rating for Heroes and Generals is a 7/10.I will continue to update this review as the game progresses.  That will be added to the bottem of the review"",1"

"8621,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Originally, I would have written a positive review about this game. I enjoyed playing this game with friends, and in groups. But after a while, this game just gets extremely repetetive and boring, and if you don't pay, you'll have to sit hours and hours XP farming, just to progress in rank.The microtransactions have ridiculously high prices aswell, and the developers are extremely greedy. This is one of the worst pay-to-win games I have ever played, and I'd advise you to stay far away from this game.You should rather give Verdun or Red Orchestra a try. They may not be """"as good"""" as in tankmen, airplanes, paratroopers etc, but atleast they're not pay-to-win. It was a huge mistake for me to return to pay to win games.Never again.1/10  - Terrible Game"",0"
"8622,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is great fun when you get past the beginning levels, to a certain extent. At first, it is a very unique and exiciting shooter, having everyone roll out into an objective with a jeep, is pretty cool. After a couple of games, this starts to become repetitive and a bit tedious. The charge across road, hide in forest, capture objective, is a fairly solid idea however it quickly bores, in my opinion. Even when this is fun, which is 50% of the time, when you have an epic firefight across the forests and storm objectives, it does feel a bit tedious at times, you die drive another jeep in die, again and again and again. Despite this, it is great fun when everything in the game comes together, the tank crews rolling in, parachuters dropping down and airplanes bombing you this way and that. When all of these things occur at the same time it is great, and this happens quite often. However, there are a variety of factors that drag this down, not just because of game mechanics, but perhaps also because of the community and players. It gets annoying when you charge into an objective, get sniped, do it again, get sniped, do it again, get sniped and so on. Plenty of people are going to say, """"That's your own fault for being stupid HERDURR,"""" the problem is,  there's not much else I can do as an infantry man. I can sit back and try and snipe people? But this isn't really a factor in this game. There's not much you can do but charge, machine gun and die, the marksman factor of this game exsists but it's not very effective, and there's no other gameplay mechanics that change this. An example I can use is Planetside 2 or Arma, where it is a perfectly reasonable option to just surround the objective and starve out your enemies, something that doesn't happen in this game. That might just be the way I feel about this game, but it is my review. Finally, in my big rant, there are times when I just want to smash my pc to pieces. There is nothing more annoying than a tank destroyer creeping around into the rear and blowing up every tank that spawns because the turrets are too slow to turn, and no one can blow up the enemy tank because anti tank items are too 'pay to win' and most people don't seem to even know about them.The game has got a very large and annoying pay to win system, don't get me wrong it's a great game, graphics are great, gameplay is great, but pay to win and annoying tactics and repetition lets this game down, so overall I'd give it a 7.5/10. This is just what I've seen from the game, people may disagree but that's what I think."",1"
"8623,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewAfter playing several rounds I am less then impressed.

If you want any info on why the devs are completely awful, I reckon you can just read another review that is negative, and see what i mean. But the reason this game was ruined for me personally, was the insane grind that comes with the game. This game is NOT Free2Play, it's Pay2Win, and that's a shame, because the core concept of the game is good. It's a shame that the developers and completely unable to do anything good to the game.Thanks for reading."",0"

"8631,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWhen this game first came out I had high hopes for it. Over the years of playing it, the game has devolved. I have played the German side from the beginning. Reto, the game devs, have made the game very unbalanced. German weaponry has gradually gotten worse and worse. To the point that the revolutionary weapon known as the Sturmgewehr (STG 44) is nothing more than an anti aircraft gun after firing 3 bullets or more. It has more kickback than a BAR. The smoke that comes out of it is immediately blinding as if the Germans only used black gunpowder. It's like throwing a smoke grenade, within 3 bullets you can't see anything. It doesn't matter because the gun is pointing at the sky after the first 3 rounds anyway. Meanwhile all allied weaponry is extremely easy to use, have very little smoke and very little kickback no matter what gun you use. One of the most ridiculous things about the game is that the allies run around with panzerfausts as if they manufactured them. The Russians have the PTRD and it will one shot any infantry, does NOT need to be fired from the prone position and will rip to shreds any and all light tanks. One of the """"features"""" of this game is that you can name your guns. One of the most over powered guns of the alllies is the M1/M2. Rate of fire, ease of use, accuracy, little smoke, you name it, it has it. Common names that people I've seen with this gun are """"yes, I know it's OP"""" and """"don't you wish your stg44 could be like this"""" Sick of the game after many years of play. Recommend it to no one unless you like being on the unbalanced allied side and enjoy and unfair advantage."",0"

Hop on a bike ring its bell as you ride into battle or hop in a farm truck and drive it into the enemys base and strike fear into their hearts blazing on the horn as an enemy drives by in his farm truck and challenges you to a horn honking good time. I sure hope there is more in this game but I don't know because I can't stand the viciously slow and I mean very slow level up and the only way to get anything fun is to you guessed it level up way up that is.

"8639,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""This game might look pretty, but don't let that fool you. This game was """"released"""" in 2016 but had been in Beta since around 2013-14. Even back then it was an abysmal pile of sh*t. Not only was it EPITOME of """"Pay-to-Win"""" (still is, but even worse), it also had atrocious sound (still does), hilariously crappy physics (still does), laughably awful gunplay (still just as bad, firing a 45. SMG shouldn't give me the impression of firing a f*cking airsoft gun in terms of sound and projectile trajectory). Remember how I said it's basically the definition of Pay-to-Win? Well, it is, but it's prices are also hysterically overpriced, and have been since BETA.. They already had Pay-to-Win as early as the f*cking Beta, more than 3 GOD DAMNED years ago they were ripping idiots off, and still are. You can download it for free, sure, but be prepared to pay for your Guns, Ammunition, Repair costs for weapons, Repair costs for vehicles, Vehicles, Binoculars, Repair tools, Explosives, you name it (ironically they also charge you if you want to name your gun), they'll charge it. Yeah, you read that right, you have to PAY TO REPAIR.. YOUR F*CKING GUN. This isn't an MMO, I SHOULDN'T have to pay to repair my stupid friggin' gun if I DON'T have to pay to repair the gaping bulletholes in my uniform and dryclean the bloodstains left from being spawnkilled via a Plane and Tank b u k k a k e (Steam censors that word, go figure) of self-loathing and money ill-spent by someone too sh*t to succeed at War Thunder.You might argue that """"Oh, but you can earn the silver token thingies (earned currency in-game are these little silver tokens, bought currency is gold), well you earn those things at a snail's pace, so have fun grinding  for 2 or 3 days straight to earn those silver tokens to buy a crappy gun you wish you'd never spent money on because there's no way to test weapons before purchasing, you'll be lucky if you even make it that far because 50% of all those tokens you'll earn will be spent in the meantime on repairs and resupplies. Another thing, if you ARE stupid enough, OR rich enough (you're one or the other, or both), to download this piece of crap regardless of my and many other's warnings.. Do yourself a favor and join the Germans, their entire playerbase consists of wallet warrior knobheads, so you'll be in fantastic company as you abuse Planes and Tanks to decimate helpless ground troopers in their own spawn."",0"
"8640,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""I like the game. I like to play as an infantry soldier. The Infantry battles are awesome to a point. Tanks absolutely ruin this game. Spend most of my time dying to a tank camping across the map. And I feel this is every battle as of late. Tanks, tanks, tanks and more tanks. Its horrible. I feel that H&G has become a reskin of """"World of Tanks"""". After playing for a bit I do not recommend this game to others as I feel the game Is pretty much made to please the part of the community that pays to play and the regular players opinions are ignored.

"8642,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI played this game a LOT when it first came out and I loved it, I loved being a commander sending in troops to help with the war, I loved sniping, flanking, finding different routes to the objective and adjusting my guns through the money gained each match.2 years on I went back to the game.... I wish I hadn't. The commander mode i enjoyed was now gated under high ranks I would never achieve (i liked to log in play an hour or two as commander and then go do something else) so now I won't be able to help in the war effort by sending troops in. The progression has been slowed right down to where you NEED the premium (which you pay for) to get anywhere and even then it's still slow going.The game itself seems to have gone backwards in gameplay and the menu system is... awful. good luck finding anything quickly if your new or coming back to the game after a long period away. Limited squads means you can only team with 2 other friends, a very bigâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥if you're wanting to play with 3 or more friends because guess what.... you cant! Unless you rank up A LOT to (we think) increase the number of people in the squad. Bad, bad system.Personally having gone back a year, maybe two later I won't be playing this game again. It's sad, because i used to love this game but from what i've read and heard the devs dont seem to give aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥about what their consumers say/want which is never a good thing really. Current rating of this game: 4/10(There is SOME fun to be had in this game still, but like most of the upgrades it's gated behind hours and hours of frustration. In my view, not worth it.)"",0"

"8644,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI'm playing with some friends. It's... an okay game I guess. Mostly fun.Spend a few hours saving up in game currency in order to buy the rocket launcher so we can go and hunt vehicles. It works alright for a bit. I run out of ammo, and need to spend more in game currency. Alright, I can see that being a thing...Reloading costs as much as buying it new.And we all quit out of disgust. It's tricky knowing how to monetize your game. These developers seem to have taken a cynical approach that feels like it would fit right in with mobile games. Assume hardly anyone is actually going to pay for the thing and that a couple people are going to dump hundreds or even thousands in. And this is reflected in the game design.It's been awhile since I've played, so it might have improved since then. You'll have to forgive me if I remain skeptical."",0"

"8646,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""EDIT - 16/07/17Once we put in enough time we were able to set up a squad where most of us could play together again. It was purely trial and error that got us there and isnt explained in any detail we could find in the game.If playing solo, the game is still exceptional, in a pair its even better.Trying to play with 3 or more people together gets very tricky though as you need to spend squad points on either making your squad larger (a bigger group of friends) or to add 'auxillery slots' which are the slots that give you the option to change from an infantryman to a sniper or tanker etc etc mid battle. Its a case of either make your squad big enough to have all of your friends together but have no aux seats (no variety) OR keep the aux seats (ability to change roles ingame) but not be able to create a group big enough for all of your friends.The old system was better imo... if you had a sniper and the battle has sniper resources, you could just switch to it, then to pilot, then tanker, whatever the map had you could spawn as provided you 'owned' the type you wanted to switch to.Currently you need to setup your options BEFORE the battle starts, which locks you and your squadmates to just those soldier types.As a consequence I barely ever us my pilot or para now as i dont like to give up my sniper/tanker/infantry slots.__ ORIGINAL REVIEW__ (smell the update rage!! lol)Loved the game right up to the latest 'Squad' update """"Devyatayev""""Have 566.9 hours on record and I loved it... right up until they broke it with too many big changes, too suddenly with little explaination on how they worked, exactly what they had changed and what they were trying to encourage us to do, with those changes.Feels similar to how i felt going from Windows 7 to Windows 8... if you know what i mean?Would love to roll back to the previous version where the game made sense, doesnt force you to play only one role in a given battle and doesnt insist you take orders from the random squad leader the game just paired you with.Previously you could begin as a Paratrooper and drop in on a base for a cheeky capture, switch to a pilot to protect the para plane and bomb the tanks, change to sniper to pick off some baddies then over to tanker to hold the bridge etc all in one match... now you cant do any of that until you level up new badges by following 'squad orders' given to you by someone you dont know and very frequently doesnt have a clue which orders to give... and even once you have the badges you can maybe attach a single infantryman to your tank squad... but if playing with friends only one of you can switch to infantry at a time... it just removed all the versitility from the game and as I have at least one of each unit type, I kinda enjoyed being able to change to what was needed at any given moment as it made me feel like i could affect the outcome of the battle rather than being stuck as a whatever i turned up as.Would be a 5 star review 2 weeks ago... now its a big fat 1... and thats being pretty generous.Just to give a bit of background, there are 5 of us (irl friends) who all play together and since the update its not been possible for us all to play together in the same battle because of the new squad limitations... its just broken...

"8653,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Edit: wil update this review soon when I feel like spending some time on it since I've gotten back into the game recently and some stuff has changed.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I have also played on browser version, so my total playing time is ways more than just my steam hours.I started playing after the timoshenko update hit and I absolutely loved it. Great gameplay, lots of laughs, premium players have no advantages (except leveling/money bonusses and weapon skins) and the way it worked was good. Reto did a lot to improve the game, they added new guns, nerfed and buffed stuff to make it more fair. The thing i loved about this game was the different weapons for each faction, all with their own characteristics. The grinding part of the game is kinda bad, but when you have grinded long enough you can upgrade your gun. That is also something i loved about this game, since you can mod your guns the way you like them. A big disadvantage about the grinding and modding thing is that people you'll fight against as a beginning player will have better guns, but that is not that bad since its lots of fun to play. It was huge fun to participate in a battle with tanks, planes, and lots of lil' infantry jimmy's. There was still a lot of work to do, since hits werent always counted and character movement was quite poor. Reto improved that and added lots of stuff to the game in the updates. A little bit to much probably. We have loads of camo to choose from now but we only have a few maps to fight in. They keep adding camo and and unnecessary stuff (like the third german pistol), but it seems like they dont care about adding new maps. In one of the last updates they added more vegetation, but all they did was copy paste the same bush all over the place. After 5 years of early access developing, the graphical part of the game is still very bad.Something else i dont like about the game is the toxic community who wants reto to nerf everything they get killed with. Thats also because of the different types of players (e.g. tankers want to nerf anti tank stuff, infantry wants to nerf tanks). I used to play all classes and i think it is pretty balanced. Reto did a good job on balancing, allthough the russians are a little bit underpowered and germans a bit overpowered (e.g. MG42(1200 max rpm) and the heavily armored tanks).Till this """"Devyatayev"""" squad update hit i absolutely loved it. Sometimes the battles where a little unbalanced, e.g. when the enemys had lots of tanks and your team had none, but if u had a tanker u could easily switch and kick someâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ This is diffirent right now. You have to grind your squad ribbon to be able to switch to diffirent classes. I have quit a lot of characters, I need to grind em all up to be able to play normally again. Another thing about this squad system is that you can never play alone, you will always be in a squad with some random guys who are f*cking around.They have done such a thing with the ribbon system in an earlier update, when they went through the ribbon system, but it wasnt that bad, since u could still use all of your characters. At that time, there were not that much experienced players with lots of characters, so it didnt matter that much. Right now, there are lots of player who have grinded their way up and have lots of characters. They will all have to grind that ribbon on their characters to be able to play normally again. With this being said, i dont recommend this game to new players, since it is still in early acces and things like this will probably happen some more in the future. It will also take a long time before it can be released, because there is still a lot of work to do, especially the amount of maps(maps are all same scenery) and graphical part of the game is very poor. For someone who just starts, this new squad (ribbon) system wont be the problem, you'll just level ur squad ribbon up through playing while ur grinding for better equipment. But still, something like this might happen again in the future, so you'll be just as mad on reto as a big part of the community right now.If Reto dont chance this squad system and refuse to add new maps and if they dont improve the graphical part of the game im gonna leave and play some battalion 1944 or Red orchestra, or even WW1 (Verdun, Battlefield 1) instead. I always liked Heroes and generals more than other ww2 games like battalion and red orchestra just because of the tank, plane and infantry gameplay all together and of course because of the generals part of the game. If not this is after Warthunder the second Free2play WW2 game im gonna quit because the developers are f*cking it up."",0"

8655,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is possibly one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. There are so many things that are wrong with this game. Weapons like the Springfield rifle that kill instantly but the starter guns take a whole clip to kill. As far as progression for guns and ranks goes you won't get very far until your hand over a considerable amount of cash. Most of the guns and vehicles are intentionally made expensive so you have to buy them with actual cash. There are a lot of players who complain and whine whenever they lose a game. They even have the nerve to verbally assault their teammates as if it is their team's fault that the fool keeps running into the same sniper or machine gunner that killed him the past 30 times. America might as well not have any tanks because they are all worthless. The Panther apparently does as much damage as a tank destroyer. Oh and don't forget about all of those anti-tank terrorists who ride up on motorcycles and blow themselves up on your tank. Be prepared for ultimate spawn camp grinding and good luck even getting out of your spawn. Grenades can apparently blow people into outer space. HE tank shells are an absolute waste of your time and money as they really don't do much you are better off just using your machine gun. And how about the Jeeps and motorcycles? They handle like they are on a Slip 'N Slide. All of the locations you fight in are basically the same maps with the slightest of variations in the objectives. You will no doubt find yourself bored to tears after you played the same map of the same town 5 consecutive times. The matchmaking takes an eternity to find a match to put you in even though there are available matches. If the enemy is short a player be prepared to deal with the totally spectacular team respawn queue because we all just love waiting. If you think the queue is bad try waiting to respawn after you accidentally crashed into a tree and blew up because of the horrible vehicle handling. On the generals side of everything the assault teams cost a lot of warfunds. Not only are they expensive but they also have to go through a queue which again we all just love waiting. However if you're lucky and you troops actually make it through the queue which is controlled by other players then you have to select a city to deploy them at. Once they are deployed you have to send them to a battle or initiate one yourself. Sounds amazing right? Except your armies are slower than a slug. But most of the time if you are a new general your squads will almost never see the light of day. I hope there are some major changes regarding these issues but until that day comes we are stuck with what could have had potential to be a great game.,0
"8656,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewSorry for my english, I'm french.I don't recommend this game for many reasons:Firstly, this game is a pay to win. In fact, if you want to play with all weapons, it's not possible without a lot of hours of grinding.Secondly, if you buy a new weapon and use it, you need to repair this weapon. In fact, there is a durability system about rifles and grenades (and probably it's the same for the other stuff). So, you have to spend a lot of in-game money.Thirdly, all items, even premium can buy with in-game money. But, it's very very expensive. It's a grinding game.Fourthly and lastly, in game, you have medals (every medals have differents effects, for example: accuracy bonus, agility, endurance etc.). Without premium you can equip one medal. If you are premium you can equip two medals, it's a big bonus. This game is optimized, it's funny game but the economic model is repulsive."",0"

"8659,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewSuper fun game, unlike other most recent released FPS games, this takes us back to an older time in the War, a more classic war experience. However, despite the brilliant idea, the fact that you have to spent RL money to purchase many upgrades and character boost, makes it unenjoyable. This should have a flat out price tag and allow everyone to enjoy ingame item upgrades with the ingame currancy, instead of RL money."",0"
"8660,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""There are almost no restrictions on how far the enemy can go to your spawn and then they can camp your spawn and you cant do anything to win the game, and they make new people fight pros. Before the games was so good and very adictive and it was easy to grind for money and xp but now its almost impossible to get new weapons and new careers. The devs realy need to listen to the people to make the game a lot more fun for the people and not to make it so unfair and they should stop banning people who have bought stuff for hacking/cheating just so the peson gets a new acount and buys more stuff but me my self have not experienced this but there are very many people saying that it has happend to them and i have only have been ginding for the money and the xp. Another thing is that people can camp the trucks for people who spawn and the devs are not doing sh!t about it and its to unfair for people. Ive already said this but they realy need to make it so that new people are up against other new people or atlest a little more experience in the game but not all of them because then the enemy will have automatic guns and your team all have starter guns.

"8662,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewIf your tired of playing call of duty or battlefield and wanna get that old battlefield 1943 feel, well this is it. This game is a wonderfull ww2 game that will not stop developing. Well of course till every major faction is added. But this game focuses on everyone cooperating into finishing the job of capturing territory, including different roles in order to support one another. Also there will be times when you are pretty much out gunned like this for example: Germans-- have air support+tigers+inf, while allies would have-- inf+light tanks+recon. But that makes the game challenging and forces you to storm on a plan and work together with people as a team."",1"
8663,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThink of it like this - Germans = Advanced WarfareUSA = A couple of kids having a birthday party at a paintball arenaUneven teams.

"8665,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""I have played this game since early BETA. Several years, I took a 6 month break and came back to check out the new map changes.After three days I deleted the game. The community has become toxic. I could not take the endlessâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥talk, racism and misogynist comments from our own team. Harrassment of new players was outrageous.It used to be every few battles there was one or two. You could ignore them or reasonable players would coach them.

"8666,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you are looking for a free to play world war 2 game this not for you. It is no where near a free to play game especially for new players. I am an ironsight player from other WW2 games all the way up to modern FPS games and the sights for this game are just horrendous. Map layout- The layout for each map are excruciatingly uneven especially with spawn points being steps away from a capture point. Spawn camping is a common occurence with high ranking players going behind the spawn and shooting those who have just spawned. Many maps are so uneven that if you get the good spawn that no matter how bad your team is you will still win.Weapons- Starter weapons are starters they aren't the best but they should still be able to do damage, they kinda don't. Yeah they hit but they don't deal nearly any damage. If you want a new gun even a low tier new gun be ready to empty what little credits you get to get that gun and hope its good(whitch it isn't). If you use a gun or GRENADE too much you have to repair it. Yes you have to repair a GRENADE!!!!!! The expense of repairing a weapon  or GRENADE is about the same price as a new gun. So if you can't afford a new gun, you may not be able to even play the game. Free to Play- Yes you can download it and play a few games for free. But if you run outta credits early on you may have to wait to even play. Or you can shell out money to play. I have played world of tanks, War thunder, and other WW2 FtP games and have never been bombarded so much to buy gold to even get farther into a game. This is no where near a free to play game. Yes this is a beta so maybe it will change but right now it is very much a free but you have to pay to continue farther game."",0"

"8668,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWith over 1000 hours in game I feel it's time for me to leave a review.This game is fun and frustrating all rolled into one. When I first started playing HnG I was proud if I even got 1 kill, it takes time if you are not a seasoned fps to get use to.This is not a game where you join and have all the perks and upgrades at your disposal, you have to earn them and to some seems way too much of a chore to do, so be patient and give it time or you will find yourself rage quitting (I'm sure most of the negative reviews are based on the grind). The Devs in my opinion are doing an amzing job with updates and keeping the game fun for people who enjoy a challenge and don't want everything handed to them.Pros.Good selection of guns, weapon mods, vehicles, professions, funny moments, nice graphics, frequent updates, it's free to play, lots of maps.Cons.The damn fog lol...For us snipers it makes it tough "

Its deep and relistic (from my point of view) I've wanted it for a long time but i was a bit annoyed at the preformance of the game its very laggy for its requirements. BUT I like to judge games on it gameplay rather than it tech issues so this is a thumbs up, it is an awesome simulation of world war two and I like it a lot, but be aware that you need a decent bit of computer horsepower to run it really well, i hope the devs make it easier to run though if you asked me for a improvement"",1"

8673,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,The game is amazing considering all the crap you pay $60 for nowadays. For a FPS WWII game its pretty well balanced with many different options and paths.

RTS/FPS Casual/Hardcore or Realistic?No cap on special classes. In a match of 18 players you may have 2 infantry 4 recons(Snipers) 8 tankers and 6 pilots and 2 paratroopers vs 18 infantry that makes the game unplayable and unbalanced(Spawncamped)New maps every 1/2 years. The game has 8 maps currently with slight changes to them instead of adding more maps a year.Barely any updates/fixes on the RTS. The RTS is what makes this game unique being able to combine a battlefield environment with a RTS map of europe making every battle you play matter for the war.Badly optimized ingame sounds(Sounds clipping and you won't hear footsteps behind you etc)Terrible squad implementation(Where it forces you play you to play in a way that doesn't make sense)Getting put on a line without tanks and equipment instead of defending the necessary line for victory.I wouldn't recommend investing time into this game. Since the only thing that kept me playing for longer than i should is the same reason why people played WoW for such a long time. Friends you met ingame and nothing else.In-depth explanationThis game has been in development for over 5 years. And it still has bugs that existed from the start.Crashing/Loss of currency/Lag/Objects that gives low FPS. Is just a few of the problems that has always existed.The only reason this game is still not in beta is because the terms of service of steam prevented them (You are only allowed to have a game that is under BETA on steam for X amount of years or your game will get kicked out of the platform)""""NEGATIVES""""The main issue for me is how they ignore fixing broken stuff and balance between factions. Instead they can add new effects that no one requested(Casings going out of your gun/ Weapon has uncontrollable sway and coded inaccuracy meaning that bullets can go left or right of the target instead of CSGO where the first bullet always goes in the middle of the crosshair)They dont use a PTR system so when they make a new item (Tank/Weapon/Game mechanic) they just outwards release it breaking the current meta. Instead of removing it and fixing it they will keep it and fix it in a later build(Big builds take 3-6 months to release)Example is when they released a new faction(Soviets) with out adding a reduction to grind/free migration or any other form of buff to the new faction. Which led to the game being broken for over a year before the faction grew enough to survive. It's still broken as of today since the new faction only has 1/4 of the players of the other factions. They also have a habit on breaking the game, then going on vacation leaving it broken for months.Reto.moto has become very Anti-NA, their servers react very poorly to NA players and the NA servers they use are terrible, cheap and often lag. I would recommend anyone who lives in NA or South America or Brazil to never play this game, not worth the time."",0"

8685,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,Early Access ReviewGreat game with a good veteran player community that wants to help new players learn the game. While the game has some issues it is still under development and the devs are pretty good at fixing major issues.

ORyou buy it with goldthis sums up he entire game getting killed and grinding for stuff at first it's fun but the more you play the more you get annoyed. the grinding gets very repetative and annoying. The devs may have fixed some stuff but that made it worse-> the rifle update gave infantry scoped one shotted rifles it â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed us all and now everybody is camping sniping and not being infantry.

8690,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,Early Access ReviewIf your looking for a first person realistic ww2 action game then look somewhere else. The game feels like a big #### fest which is great if you like dieing every 3 seconds. Not only do you die when you spawn it takes like 10 secounds to respawn.   First of all the game runs like horse ####. I can understand that it does not have much money to work with but at least make the game try and make it run at forty frames per second but I can't get past 33 frames. I recently got a pretty good graphics card that can run all my other games at about 300 FPS with the settings on high but not this game. If I wanted to play a game that i couldn't run then i would just plat AC Unity.Another major problem with the game is the fact that it is not historically acurate. For exaple the United States and the U.S.S.R where not enemys when i started to play it I thought it would be cool to be have of countrys involvecd but nope they ruined that to. My friends and I where really happy about them adding Russia because we could fight the germans with the US butthat didn't happen. The first game I get in to in the new update with Russia I am fighting them because I normally play as and American and i relized why am I fighting the Russians. Also if they want to add another fraction then   fix the current issues like the frame rate. Last the game just feels boring not like Civ v or Far Cry 3 where it is just after this I will get off.The game dosn't feel balenced for example the german guns are far superry or to the US weapons for example the US SMG has a 1 or 2 secound delay as were the Germany smgdoes not.Another bad thing about the game is the servers suck because every time i want to get in to a game it is always at 100 or 200 ping but for other games the most i get is 70.There are a few good things we more like one the the game is Free to Play so if you didn't like it then you didn't waste any thing but your time.I feel that the game could be better and i love to play ww2 games and the reason I am doing this is because I want to see the game do well so my final review for the game is 5/10 because it is still in Early Access but this game will need some work before it is done.,0
"8691,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""This new update 1.12: deploy, drive, wait for a respawn has unfortunately made this game suck for everyone. The new damage update makes every vehicle a god at absorbing bullets and shells(even when destroying as many components as possible). Spawncamping is being encouraged now due to the maintenance timer... (only viable thing to do is run starter weapons if you get spawncamped). The new driving physics makes cars go 20 km/h offroad while getting catapulted to 100km/h on roads, you never want to touch your brake button as that activates some sort of airplane level brakes that kill all your speed in a second. Cornering is impossible due to you powersliding round a corner when holding the gas, you just not making the turn when just steering or doing a grandma where you drive round the corner with no speed at all. The sound is broken now aswell to the point where i can't pinpoint sounds anymore where before i could.And oh the tank physics, good luck getting up hills/mountains.I've been actively playing the game for 2 years now and i really enjoyed it before this update, too bad they had to release this update in this form. It has great potential but in its current state it is unplayeable. I don't recommend playing this game right now."",0"
"8692,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""This game is nothing but missed potential. Nothing but a grind-fest. In all my time played i still can't even use the most basic bolt action rifle of the german army.

"8694,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""  Dear developers and reto motol, after playing this game for a long period of time I have come to the conclusion that after the recent updates the game became too unbalanced. The Russian weapons and the American ones outclass the German arsenal by far and for the german players it is increasingly harder to get new  weapons or ribbons. For example a few years ago germany used to win some wars but now with the nerf of the german faction they lose prettey much every war. I appreciate very much the improvements that the devs made to this game but I want to draw attention to this issue. I hope that you won't spoil this wonderful game and would see that it is now too unbalanced. For me, it's too unbalanced and all the german army talks about it. Right now, I can't recomand this game."",0"
"8695,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""I used to love this game on my old account I had atleast 2000 hours of gametime.I picked it up again basically as a time waster because they have made it A.

"8696,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Conceptually: Amazing war simulator with a fairly good strategy element to it as well as a decent focus on team play to take objectives. Classes of soilder are pretty awesome and fairly well balanced when everything comes together properly, couple snipers, some tankers, plenty of infantry, a few paratroopers, and a general heading the team. The period accurate weapons function exactly how you'd hope, innaccuarcy and all which can add to the feel of the game. The potentional for full war campaigns between the different nations present offers limitless battle possibilties.Reality: Teams generally end up unbalanced with your tanker being level one and having a crappy tank that gets one shot by the enemies max rank god tier vehicle which can also make things worse when just starting out in any class other than infantry. You end up just constantly losing over and over again to people who you really have no chance of beating no matter how good you are and then you level up at a snails pace but even after you get there you'll never earn enough credits to actually buy the stuff you need (credit costs for anything are insane and then they even threw in repairs). Yes your vehicles should be stronger the higher up you go, no you shouldn't be matching veterans with basically brand new players, especially when your equipment actually makes a noticable difference in your ability to play and when the servers are so unbelievably overloaded that there are 4k man queue times just to log in this kind of tier mixing shouldn't be happening.While I'm talking about the servers being overloaded, I should also mention they're complete crap...sometimes. As in every match you get into its a complete roll of the dice as to if your 5 ping actually means anything. With a constant 120 fps and an average of 10 ping I can barely move half the time because I'm getting ruberbanned left and right and even if I play sniper and just crouch down somewhere my targets are just warping everywhere so I still can't do anything. There have been multiple requests by the playerbase to prevent matching us into games where this is going to happen which would also level out the teams and possibly boost the community and overall player experience but these pleas seem to fall entirely on deaf ears.Overall: No, I can't recommend it because I simply can't see anyone really enjoying this game with its numerous problems. I know you see the good reviews scattered around but those people are, quite honestly, just lucky. They don't get placed in the games where suddenly nothing you do matters and everything is just going to warp around regardless of your connection. They don't get the games where your entire team is gimped with starter level players against a team of seasoned veterans. For most of us, at least half the time, we get into a horrible game with no chance of winning and barely an ability to move around just to try and at least enjoy our loss."",0"
8697,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,I wouldn't recommed this game to anyone. Grinded for a day and a half for the xp and money to be able to buy the recon class and sniper scope to be told that I can not play with a friend who hasn't got the recon class or any other class apart from the infantry soldier. The fact that the game is still grainy while playing in 1080p with maxed settings without bloom effects and because of that unable too see a guy who is 50m away from me moving in a bush is completely stupid.

"8701,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Never really write reviews but geez, this one feels well waranted.  The queues are 5-10 minutes long.  I can't get a good connection to any servers to save my life.  My internet is just fine, works great on every other game.  I'm in the US so I guess all the servers are in EU, so no NA Servers.  I didn't realise how far this game has fallen.  The remaining players in the community are very toxic and elitest.  Didn't want to believe all the negative reviews on this game because I remember it being very good back in 2014 when I last played.  I do like the overhauled flight controls and new planes, but it doesn't mean anything if half my team is lagging.  Not to mention the air spawns are awful.  Enemy planes can spawn right behind you.  Still no way to enable a toggle for aiming down sight.  You have to hold down right click while you shoot wih left click.  Never had any game do that before, it feels so awkward shooting like this.Overall check the game out if you have nothing else to play and want a few hours of entertainment for free.  But don't expect an amazing WW2 Game.  This is a poor man's battlefield unfortunately.  This game could have been great but it's going further and further down hill.  Pretty soon there wont be much of a player base left and it will take half an hour to get into games.The more proof I see about how the Staff treats People on their forums is disgusting me.  They don't acknowledge trolling and don't take any action based on the feedback they get.  Completely in shock at what I'm seeing."",0"
"8702,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game, has potential. This can be a fun game. And I HOPE, that this game is fun when it is finished. But, the beta lacks balance. In the game, you will start as a regular soldier with a basic semi-automatic rifle. That is fine in all, except when you are in any mid-range or closer fighting. Anyone with a smg, sub-machine gun, will easliy murder you, inless you get a headshot, which is very unlikely. Some may say,""""Oh, why don't you use grenades or a melee weapon."""" I would respond with, you don't start with either of those weapons. The first two german grenades don't do good damage unless the explosion is close. To hit someone with a melee weapon basically requires you to be so close that it is only effective from behind. Besides, if they have a machine gun, you will be dead long before then.      I haven't mentioned sniping yet and that is because there is no incentive. Most of the maps, I've seen, aren't suited very well for sniping. Killing doesn't give you that much xp, experience. Only five to be exact. However, you can get over a hundred points for capturing an objective.     The lack of progress is irratating. Because at first you don't realize that smgs are important, you will spend all your money upgrading your rifle, assuming that it will help. After about six hours of gameplay, you spend all of your starting money on buying the first grenades, melee weapon, and upgrades. You then realize that you should've saved it for the overpowered smgs. Plus, the first American smg is significantly better than the German counterpart because of its lack of recoil.     After almost twelve hours pf gameplay, I still can't afford the smg, I'm reduced to endlessly grinding for money, and I'm frankly at wits end. I will say that at first it was fun, but now I find myself getting annoyed. I am only rank four, out of twenty two and feel like I haven't made any progress. I think that this game could be fun, but there is some massive issues with balance. If you are really into fps, than you could have fun with knowledge going in. But their is a massive amount of grinding needed to actually get anywhere in the game."",0"

"8710,Heroes & Generals,,""so where do I begin, I played this game wayyy back before this game was even """"released"""" onto steam. When I played, it still had a Beta tag at the top right corner. Ahh the memories, anyone remember that? The Beta tag I mean? Reason why I bring this up is because, the game was actually GOOD when it was still in beta. Gave the game some sort of a excuse for slight mistakes. But now that it has been released, that excuse doesn't work anymore. The game was a lot more fun and simple before Squad 2.0 and everything after that. I quit the game maybe a year after the release of Squad 2.0 because of the lack of new content. Because of how long I have played the game, I felt the urge to come back to see if any thing had been added or changed. To my surprise...................... very little changed. Tanks are now much harder to kill, which I have conflicting feelings about cause I loved playing my tanker. And 1 map was added. ONE........ COME ON RETO!!!! I played a few matches on that new map (in regular MM, too lazy to even play War anymore), ended up carrying the team as per usual and then I once again, unistall. A few weeks later, the new update comes out and turns out, another new map was added! Cool! I check to see what it is, and turns out, it is one of the ones they leaked a former HnG streamer that I watch 2 years ago. WOW, I have no words anymore for this game. RETO, if you want to bring back former players and veterans while at the same time hooking in new players, PLEASE!

I only wish I could get the time and all the money I put in back.

"8712,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access Review     According to the Devs, they """"wish to create a healthy, solid and well-balanced game."""" I have one thing to say to that. Bullsh*t, If they wished to create a well-balanced game, they would of made everything equal, but I geuss thats not what makes a game well-balanced.     First off, the tanks. Russian tanks take 3 hits from a Panzerfaust 60, While U.S. tanks take 2 hits. But hey, Well-balanced game right?     Lets talk about the pistols. The C96 pistol has a supposed 32 damage, Last time I checked, 32 damage was not able to murder someone with 1 shot. Where as the US revolver, the M1917, does a supposed 39 damage, But hey, apparently it can't one shot. And the soviet Nagant M1895 is also a 1 shot.      Lets look at the assault rifles. The U.S. weapons and the German weapons are balanced other that the MP40, which apparently has more damage then the U.S. M1A1 Thompson. You can barely compare the two of them. When they are both """"Highest Level"""" SMGs. Then again, Here comes the russian sub machine guns which completely sh*t on the other two factions' SMGs. The Soviets SMGs are the only SMGs that have more than 32 bullets, But they shoved the amount of bullets down the other two factions throats with an impressive 71 bullets in 1 mag. With barely a damage penalty.      Now to the Assault Rifles. You can not play as an American without knowing the two most feared Assault rifles. The Sturmgewehr 44, and the AVS-36. You can not cap a single point against the Germans without someone coming in with a Sturmgewehr and one hitting every person in the room with a torso shot. The russian AVS is the same way.      Now, onto the Rifles. M1G with a 30-06 cartridge 4 hits someone. Where as the Soviet SVT-40 with a 7.62 cartridge 2 hits people. Lets go onto the bolt actions. The American Springfield M1903A1 is a supposed two hit with 5 bullets in a mag, but the chance of it actually being a two hit is low. Where as the Soviet Mosin-Nagant M91/30 has the same amount of bullets in a mag, but it is almost a guaranteed one hit. The Germans' Kar 98 K is just as powerful as the Mosin-Nagant.     Im not even going to start with the grenades, and the LMG's are weak AF. Im also not mentioning the other things in the game(Planes,Tanks,ETC.)     Im suprised that the Devs from Reto-Moto even call this game Well-Balanced. Cause the Soviets are overpowered as f*ck, The Germans are about normal for a Early-Access Game, and the U.S. are surviving by pure luck with all of their underpowered weapons. Plus, their are tons of cheaters in this game.          Although this bring me to another topic, Does Reto-Moto even care about the games they release. Because all of the games they put out are sh*t, Correct me if im wrong. But Reto-Moto is wasting their time by not even paying attention to how people react about things in their games. "",0"

"8723,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is pretty much a money/time sink for you to get to Single Shot Bolt Guns, Automatic Weapons, or tanks/vehiclesThe Infantry game is pretty lackluster and based heavily on if you have an Automatic or not. Single shot snipers are the alternative. The gunplay is clunky asâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ compared to say Red Orchestra 2 which handles weapon Oscillation, breathing, and whatnot better. The movement in H&G is clunky, and they just now got around to fixing some issues since day 1. Spawn camping is prevalent. if the enemy has better gear you're probably going to lose. If the enemy has a single tank, and you don't you will lose. Once you get tanks, everyone and their mother suddenly has AT.This game pretty much relies on you sinking about 100+ frustrating hours into grinding just to get the levels/money to get the weapons. Which you then have to pay for through """"upkeep"""" costs which can pretty much Zero out your profits in a match.A few of my friends and I gave this game multiple tried, over the course of a year or two.

"8731,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewNazis riding bikes, 10/10 Best wargame of the year.On a serious note itâ€™s a decent game.only problem is the matchmaking.2/10 of the games i played where so unbalanced.. most of the time there were us, riding on bikes, vs the other team, with epic tank destroyers, weâ€™d get our asses handed to us.But remember that this is intentional. From the very beginning developers wanted H&G to be more like a real war. This game is not about fair battles, mirrored teams and kill to death ratio. Itâ€™s about taking what you get and using it to the best of your abilities. And if you want to influence battles even more you can become a general.More often than not the game is unfair but it can be fun in itâ€™s own way. Itâ€™s most certainly not for everyone though. The way they made it is a far cry from how wars are fought you donâ€™t give your soldiers inadequate gear and weapons then send them off to the slaughter and expect them to win you give them equipment that is better suited for the situation and is capable of standing some sort of a stance.â€œSir the enemy has a squad of tanks what should we do?â€â€œWell we have a ton a bikesâ€¦ use those.â€â€œB-but sir!â€â€œDid I stutter? saddle up and peddle on out there son!â€ The tanks vs bikes battles come to be because of the differences in sources that each faction has. From my understanding, the unbalance is partially caused by the people playing on the Axis side have had way more warfunds to buy resources with than the people in the Allied side. This causes the unbalance in battles and the one-sided wars that have occurred for some time now. Additionally, since the Axis side ends up wining more often, players switch factions and thus more players end up joining the Axis which doesnâ€™t help much with the balance.If you are on the Allied side, the above reason is the likely cause of the bikes vs tanks battles. Additionally, if you want to avoid these sort of battles when playing on either faction, when you click on â€œenter combatâ€, select â€œfind missionâ€ and when you click on a battle, you can view the resources available at that time. Choosing â€œrandom missionâ€ matches you in a battle without taking resources into account."",1"

With this latest update, they reset all ribbon progress - that means all the hours put into this game were completely wasted. Uninstalling this game as we speak. After all the posts on their forums, they have clearly stated they don't care and are happy to see players leave. I'm done here. As much as it pains me to say this, don't bother with this game. It was fun back in the day, but the developers will clearly do anything they can to make you send them actual money.Again, go play another game if you value your time, as the developers clearly do not."",0"

Of course, German weapon can be strong in the end. GERMAN PLAYERS MUST BE PATIENT. Until your trooper trained enough, you will be killed so many times even if you are experienced in First-person shooter. Don't worry about the """"Kill-Death Ratio"""".

The damage and recoil of G43 rifle(German beginning rifle) are inferior than M1 Garand(American). If you want to keep using this rifle for long time, you should improve these status by installing weapon mods. After that, this rifle will be able to defeat Uncle Sam with only twice body-hits in close to middle range. MP34 Submachine gun has only 20 rounds while M3 Greese gun has 30 rounds. This gap suffer German players. Of course, you can purchase MP40 Submachine gun when you earn enough EXPs of SMG ribbon.However, its Fire Power and Rate of Fire is still worse than M1 Thompson.

Excepting Russian, most people may believe """"German tanks are best in WW 2 !!"""". Although it might be true, in this game, German tank soldiers must walk thorny path. Pz.I light tank(German beginning tank) is the worst tank, and it will be just a coffin in Tank battle.This tank bring only a pair of 7.92mm machine gun while American M2A2 LT has 12.7mm machine gun. For example, however when you shoot APCR(better penetration and more expensive ammo) against the back armor of M5 Stuart or M24 chaffee, it can NEVER penetrate(shoot out) their armor, even THEY ARE LIGHT TANKS!! In case, against M4 sherman or M26 persing? Needless to answer...... So, if you want to train German tanker, I recommand you to avoid tank battle with Pz.I. Attack only enemy infantry and non-armored vehicles, and gain EXPs of Light tank ribbon to buy 38t tank. It is the best light tank in German, and it can kill American light tank from its front. German Heavy tanks are actually good, but there are only a few opportunity to cast them in standard battle.ã¨ã¾ã‚ã€ã“ã‚“ãªæ„Ÿã˜ã«ãƒ‰ã‚¤ãƒ„å´ã¯ã‹ãªã‚Šãƒžã‚¾ã„æˆ¦ã„ã‚’å¼·ã„ã‚‰ã‚Œã¾ã™ãŒã€å…µå£«ãŒè‚²ã£ã¦æ­¦å™¨ã‚„è»Šä¸¡ãŒæƒã£ã¦ãã‚Œã°ã€æ®µã€…ã¨æ¥½ã—ããªã£ã¦ãã¾ã™ã€‚æœ€åˆã®ã†ã¡ã¯ã€1ã‚²ãƒ¼ãƒ ãŒã™ãçµ‚ã‚ã‚‹Skirmishãƒ«ãƒ¼ãƒ«ã®æˆ¦å ´ã§ã‚¯ãƒ¬ã‚¸ãƒƒãƒˆã‚’ç¨¼ãã®ãŒè‰¯ã„ã§ã—ã‚‡ã†ã€‚Like this, german player will fight under disadvantages.

The fresh soldier has no Anti-tank weapons, and they cannot buy them yet. Your Anti-human grenades cause quite NO damage against armor targets. It means, you can easily be slaughtered by even Pz.I light tank!! And, compared with """"Red Orchestra"""" series, the damage of Anti-tank weapons is weaker and weaker. For exapmle. you will need 3 direct hit of Panzerfaust to kill M18 hellcat(even this tank-destroyer has only 13~25mm of armor). If you use Anti-tank grenade(this is so risky), it also needs twice or more. Using Panzerschreck or M1A1 Bazooka is more damage than Panzeraust, and much safer than Anti-tank grenade. But their prices are so expensive. After consuming all 50 rounds, you need to supply them at the same prices of buying new ones. As the result, when you get suffered by enemy tanks and you want to eliminate them, you should cast a tank, like enemy does."",1"
"8737,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewA ww2 fps game that in MY opinion looks like a game that was inspired by ww2battleground europe but instead of an actual """"Battlefield across Europe"""" you get matches like battlefield 4 (snipers and tanks everywhere).The game is ok - not great.Why? Because the devs seem to be adding more """"stuff"""" then actually fixing things like random crashings, ui not working right (freezing when leaving squads) and the game engine feels like meh.  Also....FOG! no...not tog....FOG !A meme comes to mind, Fog....Fog everywhere....The only time I've seen anything that remotely resembles this kind of """"Foggy battlegrounds"""" would have to be from Scary movie 1, Shorty's car.

"8739,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewDid you enjoy CoD 2 and Battlefield 2? Good becouse you just found mixture of those two with graphic update.Gameplay is slower than in most of todays FPS shooters, there is no run and die if you play properly.You strategize and advance to destroy enemy, even one soldier can change outcome in big battle if given opportunity.Pros You choose your playstyle- rush, hidden, conqueror, recon,you customize your soldiers,great feel of battle, there is always way to counter your opponent no 3 snipers blocking any movementlot of choices overall,Great maps, cycles of day and diferent objectives on same map so you will play same map 3 times in a row without even noticing it.ConsIf you are not enjoying it you will quit becouse you see the grind ahead of you,Nothing tells you that you should save those reward money at start to buy something you really want to have fun later and make more money,Squads, squads are great until you find out you cant pair with different class until you reach certain level where you can personalize your squad too.Overall good game, with few tweaks it will be awesome "",1"

"8741,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""For New playersIf You are looking to get into this game you need to be aware of few things1 yes, it have pay to get stuff real life money shop, but you can get all of it with in-game money. Yeah, it will take time and so on, but after you get what u want it feels great, as well better stuff won't make you play better(i bought scope with gold and found out that i suck with it, while with iron sight i'm pretty good.) so only thing what recomend is veteran, it will give you some exp boost(it is if you like game)2 You will die a lot, at least in begining, till you learn how to play, well i still die a lot, but i make some enemy players die a lot too :D what i meant is, head shoots, grenades, road kill - in time it may feel unfair, but you will learn how to stay alive long enough to take out 2 enemy tanks with panzer-snacker, kill rogue sniper and steal their stuff :D3 i have heard that game have cheaters and ect. But as far i can tell, it have some skilled players too, and by investing time in it, not cash you can be one of them :)4 grind, yeah, you can say it's grind fest, but which mmo isn't? And i will put it simple, if you like game, that grind won't matter for you, cose as you play you unlock stuff and as like i said, better stuff won't make you better(i'm rank 5 infantry, loving my starter G43, taking out higher rank players with their â€˜â€™uberâ€™â€™ guns, just need to play smart)5 HaG, is not your standard FPS, you run straight to enemy- you die, you try to be next â€˜â€™remboâ€™â€™ - you die, try to take out tank with standard grenades - die, so what you do is flank, take cover, prone, run in z style, use mother earth as your ally, report snipers to your team-mates, play as team, use suppres fire, smoke them out with grenades etc6 you start out with 1 loadout, after a while you can customise to your playstyle, found what works for you7 game isn't for all, especially not for 10-14 years old cry babies or short temper ppl and impatient persons. You need to take time with this one, take it slowly, set your goals and work hard to get them. My first impression.When i picked it up i didn't like it, i meant i died instantly in all possible ways, headshot, legshot, torso shot, roadkill, grenadesâ€¦. And that money shop.. I with my friend was like, it's p2w, you can't doâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥without paying rlm, enemy is op (playing as german and german only), and so on. But as we played we wanted to see how THE big war looks and we aimed to get on rank 5 and on the way till rank 5 some changes happen, not to game, to our playstyle â€¦ i stopped to run straight on enemy positions, stopped to stand up or still in 2v1 fights, stopped to aim for most kills, instead i start helping team in big picture. Capture objective points, kill rogue snipers, defend our points and so onâ€¦ and the more i kept playing the more i enjoyed game, like now if i can get 1 good match out of 5 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ones it's worth it and the atmosphere of game are perfect, airplanes roaming sky, tanks rolling over land and me as infantry in middle of it all :)+  one can customise his character to his play style (be brave, be sneaky, be tanker, be pilot and so on)+ rewarding unlock system what responds to your playstyle+ great game to play with your friends (make a squad and you can team crush your opponent) + think your enemy have better guns? Kill him and pick it up to see for yourself+ game strongly rewards team play and tends to punish rambo wannabeâ€™s + nicely done progression system which will make you busy+ good use of repair system which won't allow to spam op equipment( could be more balanced though) + for f2p game are well balanced, u can get all what you need with ingame money, what leads to point where your opponent can't have something what You can't have (well it will take time, but then again more you play this game, more better you will become)-  vet. Bonus is overpriced, i need to spend 15Â£ to get it, so yeah, devs should make it down on 5Â£, cose i personally don't like to use gold, it's make me feel cheap - only 2 tier system, so after you get rank 5 game kicks you out in big pot with high skilled players what makes it feel unfair sometimes, they could add tier 3 and and let tier 2 be mid ground for lvl 5-6 or 5-7 players to get around of things or something like that..- game isn't friendly for new players, i mean if they don't get how to play it in first 10h they will leave it cause if you try to play it as regular shooter you will lick bottom foreverâ€¦- no training grounds for tankers, pilots and ect â€¦ i mean, i would love to see what is what before i spend shitloud of my hard earned in game cash to switch my infantrymen on different branches, so that should be fixed..- upper point and some other design choices tend to lightly hint on more cash in, then delivering most to players enjoyment and it's sad.For dev â€¦.I got it, that one needs earn money to keep supporting game and making it better, but if one truly says that they have players first before cash in you should fix some things, first make it separate vet. buying option, so one can spend ~5Â£ to get vet. Not 15Â£ to get vet and leftover gold.(one day saw over 10k players on steam, if half have a vet it's already reasonable cash on month) In my opinion it would be nice sub model for beta game and still would make money. As Well player should be able to see all clases himself in advanced training so they know what they are getting because now it's buying cat in bagâ€¦P.S. Great game, eager to see it expand and become better:) 8/10"",1"
"8742,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWhere do I begin?  When my friends and I started to first play this game it was a blast.  But this new update was the one of the biggest middle fingers that a developer has ever given me.

"8743,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""After having spent enough time on it (>1000 hours) I can say I have mixed feeling with this game.On the plus:* The idea of mixing RTS map and your own units with a battle in the FPS, it's GREAT. Nothing I have seen before and the main strength of the game.* The weapon system and its improvements it's addictive so you keep playing to unlock and improve some weapons/vehicles.* Did I say how great is mixing a RTS with FPS?On the minus.The main problem I'd say is EXECUTION. Things in this game don't work as they should. I will explain this:* The RTS game is terrible, the interface, the performance, the graphics... everything is awful and slow, you cannot group your units, you cannot sort or search them, the only way is micromanaging. It doesn't matter what computer you have, this will be laggy and slow. It looks like it was designed by students 10+ years ago.* The game balance makes no sense at all. The game is not realistic at all neither properly balanced. So you find germans have the best weapons and then RETO suddenly decides to improve their weapons with no explanation at all. There are many examples regarding to this.* The lack of maps. Although there are several big maps, after some days you will notice you are all the time playing the very same maps, trough different lines but 80% of War game will be in Town or Mountain Town. 2 Maps.* The engine/performance. The graphics look old, they cannot afford any comparison with any 5 years old game but even though the performance is laggy and bad. I play it with GTX 1070 and even sometimes the game is not smooth. I'd say that developing your own engine with small resources is a huge mistake.* The stability is terrible. I have never seen a game that needs to be restarted so many times. Every couple of hours you will have CTD no matter what* The development policy is also total madness. A perfect example: there are 4 big maps although 80% of battles are played in only 2. You would think the first priority is creating new maps right? No way, RETO will release new sounds, new planes, nonsense weapons modifications (most of the time with no notice, aka ninja update) and many other """"useless"""" things instead of MAPS.* Tanks are a joke in this game. I really don't know how to fix it but a Tiger II shouldn't be scared of every infantry soldier they see on a motorbike. Overall impressionWith all these defects, issues and missmanagement. Heroes and Generals it's an exceptional game, don't get me wrong. The idea, the core idea of playing an FPS with your own troops and follow the progress in the RTS is outstanding. The problem is that is the only strong point of the game, the implementation of it it's really poor. I would love to see this game managed by a more professional/bigger company (I don't want to say Reto is not professional but they are clearly short on resources so the game gets old, unstable, poor on performance, unbalanced... and their priorities makes no sense from my point of view) I have to add that late changes done by RETO are following a better direction and they finally implemented some really needed features like giving orders to several AT's at the same time.FutureThis game will die soon (I don't want it but I think it will happen, I still have 1 year veteran) . People have a limited amount of patience and while RETO mostly provide players with promises and poor results, other games appear and they don't do the same mistakes. I really hope this idea of FPS/RTS will be properly implemented by a big company. They will make tons of money."",1"

8749,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis can be a fun game if you can get into a good match. But 90% of the matches are onesided it is either one side full pushes and you do well. Or the other is you get yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥kicked and spawn camping.  It is also a very very heavly game that leans to a Pay to advance game.

8751,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,Early Access ReviewFor the first three levels you will have a good time because you get put up agaisnt people with the same gear skill etc. Then you get put up agaisnt lvl 15 people with one hit kill snipers and overpowered as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tanks. If you dont mind being a wallet warrior then dont expect to have fun with this piece of garbage.,0
8752,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,I have played this game for a while now and i am a light tank commander which isnt to bad just somewhat underpowered how it should be against tanks. Against infantry its quite strong which is good but the second i join as infantry you always get killed by people with fully upgraded weapons for example the m1/m2 carbine of the US is way to overpowered. I see it being used alot and i myself use a ppd-40 semi upgraded. No matter if i have the jump on him he just turns around and shoots 10 bullets in 1 second killing you because i have a slower fire rate. This is mostly done by paying for the game because progress is just painfully slow. I try my best to get a better medium tank but the last 2 unlocks i have to get are going so damm slow because you mainly fight against stronger medium- heavy tanks while we usually only have light tanks that can sometimes penetrate the medium tanks but that takes so many shots that it just doesnt matter since they 2 shot us no matter where they hit us. The game is just almost forcing you to pay for the game to have a good chance against your enemies,0
"8753,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWas a good idea but the devs are making the game worse one update at a time, it's a scam where they claim it's free but you really have to pay money if you want to advance at all sinve the V-update....3+ years in beta where it should be a lot further ahead by now when it isn't, just get a lot of excuses from the devs about a small team. Also, tanks are VERy unrealistic, German tanks are the worst tanks in this game,  don't expect to use a King Tiger and rule the field, it'll take you a year to get if you don't pay for it, and then it'll be blown up in minutes by some guy with a motorbike and some sticky grenades."",0"
"8754,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Heroes and Generals is now out of early access, so lets take a look!Excellent foundation, Good technical achievements, incredibly poor design choices and missing management.That about sums it up. But lets elaborate on that.The foundation of the game- The battles themselves as infantryman are good. Vehicles are well done and fighting over the objectives tends to be pretty big a deal. The physics and gun system are good, once you get past the poor rifle you get at the start of the game, and it becomes more enjoyable when you can actually use a gun that shoots more than spitballs. But then there are things missing, and the game is not really set up for big encounters like it has the maps for. Prepare for a profound feeling of emptiness as you go through a city that is supposedly under attack but without anyone defending anything except one building that has been marked as the objective, and battles happening almost exclusively on a line from your point to the enemy point.Flanking works well, you can stay still and let your camo make you near invisible even with the default uniforms, but this is not really used that much. You can use it all, be the ultimate soldier, and you will likely still not do as well as the guy who just camped the attic of the capture point and shot four guys who tried to dislodge him by making him run out of bullets. There is no penalty for dying- Not for you at least, but more on that later, and you don't really get rewarded for anything you do either. You play to play, and you win because you want to win.Then lets get right to the poor design choices. This game is not just pay to win, but pay to progress. The way it is set up is to encourage you as a new player to quit and find an other game. Do you want to group up with a few friends? If there's more than two, then you have to pay for that or you need to spend some time grinding the 'skill' of having a group. After that, prepare for a lot more grind, as you will need several hours just to get the basics for a soldier. And if you want to do anything other than carry a basic rifle and maybe some grenades, you're going to need to grind hard just to afford your own ammo and gun modifications, because every single bullet shot, grenade thrown, mine placed or vehicle you use will cost you a lot. This leads directly to the playerbase adapting to the mentality"
"8755,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewBelow rank 5 the game is a fun free to play WW2 shooter with somewhat balanced matches and pay to progress microtransactions, like a typical garbage mobile game i might spend 20 bucks on. After rank 5 is where the game frustrates you to the point of quiting, brutal grind, or paying up to be competative. The core of this game is fun  however it's ruined by the extreme grind and cash grab microtransactions that lead to balancing issues. There are no restrictions in place for balance you can bet set up against 4 tanks at once with only 6 noob infantry on your team and just get obliterated. Better grind 20 hours or pay up to get your own tank. The developers should make mobile games they would make more money....."",0"

The sound changes are utterly insufferable, only compounded by the fact that Reto tested it well over a year ago, and we hated it then too.By and large, I can deal with the vehicular changes, modular damage, etc. that wasâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥out into this update, but the sounds and on a lesser note, the gunplay changes completely ruined day-to-day playability of this for me.Hopefully temporarily though."",0"
"8757,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWith every update the grind feels like it stretches out longer and longer. Expect to spend several days of gameplay to unlock that next weapon or vehicle, as """"repair"""" fees tacked onto every action you take in-game cut into what few credits you earn.Paid content doesn't get you much further. Purchasing in-game gold gives you very little for your money. It would feel completely like a """"pay to win"""" game if it did, but the truth is that paying players are stuck with almost all of the same absurdly long grind as the rest of us. It should be telling that despite coming up on almost 1000 hours of play, I have unlocked only 1/3rd of the items, classes, and vehicles in the game. And that's not drawing from a very large pool of unlockables.The weapons are *not* fairly balanced in the slightest. Everyone starts with a semi-auto rifle which is trash, before unlocking a SMG that is unusable at range, but decent up close. Next they'll unlock higher tier SMGs which are still bad at range, but great up close. A bolt action rifle, once (EXPENSIVELY) upgraded to a one-hit kill, is a huge upgrade. Assault rifles make SA rifles obsolete. LMGs manage to be even better than assault rifles (T2 US and German LMGs are absurdly strong).Despite all the problems it has, H&G is built on a fantastic game engine, which manages to feel open world and well paced despite all of the balance problems you'll encounter. The game has incredible promise, and I hope the H&G team's monetization and balance strategies are changed drastically, soon, because they're holding back a game that could be MUCH better with very little work."",0"

But that means evey time you do level up you get a **** load of new awesome stuff! It is way more difficult then COD or BF, its like hardcore mode because you can not take more then 3 a 4 shots before you die (average gun), ofcourse it depends on the gun/rifle.Just try the game...

"8761,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt is a really good game, i have not discovered the full potential yet. LOOK AT THIS REVIEW AS A STARTER PLAYER'S LOOK AT THE GAMEPros: The game is awesome,tanks,infantry,plane and everything you can ever want!!! Cons: 1.Why am i getting matched with 7+levels when im level 0...          2.Did i just get 1 hitted by a sub-machine gun?          3.Pay2win/pay2progress mechanics make the game even worse.          4.Atleast the graphics are allright.BUT if you have a beast computer considering the minimals recommendations umm yeah they are completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t and your game wont even TRY to run at 60 fps even if your computer is above recommended.          5.LAG,LAG AND MORE LAG! If you're not in the European union,or america,dont bother downloading this game. Wait untill it's full release where there are more than 1 server.My perspective of the game is basically this-You start off as level 0. It forces you to get in a match when you start your game for the first time. You end up in a lobby with usually level 5+ players and even sometimes 7+. You get wrecked around them,you attack them with a bike,they attack you with a god damn armed car. Thank god you can shoot them pretty easily. It forces you to buy a sub-machine gun after you complete your first match.There are bugs,glitches but not that many,most of the time they wont bother you. I gave this game a chance or two, and i am still giving it a chance to redeem itself from the ''PAY2WIN/PAY2PROGRESS''  thing. People just buy a soviet tank and LITERALLY OBLIRIATE EVERYONE in a matter of seconds. Also,good luck getting trough a level with 1million xp while you get literally 5 xp for killing someone.I would give this a nice 4/10 in the face because of the matchmaking system being â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t and the entire ''Veteran to increase gains and xp'' thing to the even buying gold thing,to the deepest part of grinding to 1 level to another. These are pretty easy things to fix but the developers dont give a flying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about their fans/players. I saw 1 guy at the forums asking people ''What should we add at the next update?''.Also,this bike thing, like what the actual â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥,ok i know the technology wasn't that great but bikes? Aren't they suppoesed to get to the smallest conflicts atleast by an armed car or just walk the way?JUST WAIT UNTILL THE FULL GAME, IF THEY LISTEN TO THE PLAYERS THIS GAME WILL BE FANTASTIC.EDIT: I just got in 3 more conflicts, when i joined our team had no tanks whatsoever and the other entire team was attacking us with armored vehicles and 2 tiger tanks+ heavy armour destroyer (tank). The game is not balanced and i just dont know if it can be fixable when it got to this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t point."",0"
8762,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,Early Access ReviewI can't recommend this game just because there is so many issues that  ruin the game.1. the tanks are just so annoying spawn killing you from miles across the map with Cheapâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ammo it ruins mathes2. they incrased the anti tank ammo cost so not only will you lose money trying to take a tank out but it cost 100x the price of a tank shell.3. hit boxes are joke they say it server lag your computer lag blah blah blah. However I can only beleive that so much espically when you shoot point blank range and AIM down sight with your smg and fire 15-30 rounds yet only about 7 actually detect that not lag that bad hit boxes.4. Hit boxes again when you hit someone they magically take no damage5.leveling up to get gear/ unit since last build is a joke I mean it will take something like 1 million xp to get from 12-13 with an average of 3k if your a good player per match will take you months and thats not even last level6. Maps can be one sided depending on what lanes are open 7. anti tanks mines are just stupid on how they are used you sneak up behinde a tank plant a mine run away and shoot it(assuming you actually got up that close without getting shot at)8. Lack of anti air planes can domiate maps at times because inf don't have anything to take planes out expect AA guns which do very little damage.Now there are good things as well but till they sort out the major issues in the game i say avoid Espically the hit boxes one the rest if you play smart you can get around it. However the reason I left was due to annoying hit boxes which they claim is no issue it is just server lag. ,0
"8763,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewAs much as I'd like to like this game (and I do), I can't support it due to several glaring problems.The first is how expensive everything is.  It certainly strikes me as pay to win, it takes hours grinding up even individual mods, and to top it off, they depreceate and must be repaired, or special ammo types must be replenished.  It's a game that has too many rewards for paid players, and as someone who really has no problem spending money on games, the fact that it was trying to force me to do it so much turned me off pretty quickly.  There also seems to be a lack of guns, and moreso because beyond 2 guns you can get initially (the semi-automatic rifle or the smg) the rest are trapped behind paywalls or level-ups that will take days if not weeks to obtain.  Not enough choice beyond having a hamburger or a cheeseburger.  Finally, the matchmaking is very poor, and that's why I can't recommend the game.  Several times tonight I was put on teams with people rank 1-3 against people ranked 7+.  They clearly outgunned the teams, had access to things like tanks (when no one on my team even had access to anti-tank weapons), and could just camp objectives with tanks and we ended up losing very quickly.  When I first came to the game, the Nazi's lost 9 games in a row, even when I played as Nazi's and had k/d ratios of 5:1 (and pushing objectives).  The game isn't well balanced.As far as positives, the combat itself is great.  A minimal HUD lends well to the long distance combat.  Shooting is difficult and takes patience, skill, and a steady hand.  The maps are well done and many times I had a great time fighting big battles over objectives, with a constant back and forth attack/defend going on in the domination style skirmish mode.  Even though you only get two weapons by default, both of them perform really well at their role, and seem well balanced.  All in all, this looked like such a great addition to the WW2 FPS style genre, but it really falls flat with balancing issues in matchmaker and pay to win access to skills and weapons.  As much as I want to love it, it still needs work."",0"
"8764,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI used the gewehr for pretty much 75 hours without a scope just to unlock an MG34. That is hell. Also, a new update that came out erased all of the progress that I had done with my guns."",0"

"8766,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewA cool idea created by 15 years old horny teenagers that can't balance, can't design, can't ensure good performance (strong fps), and ultimately, can't make the game non p2w because of all of the above...Yes, technically speaking, this game is a ww2 clone of say, Planetside 2, in some of it's respects (combined arms)... but they have taken every possible mechanic in the game and broke it (they did fix planetside 2's lag, but maps are 100 times smaller so).On the surface, the game's premise looks decent. You have a series of progressively increasing maps that are decently sized and at first glance, look like they provide enough cover... Nothing could be further from the truth. The bigger the map gets, the bigger wasteland it becomes. At the end, at the biggest maps, you might as well be figting in Saudi Arabias Deserts with pine trees scattered throughout. No cover, no damage at any reasonable range by your weapons (even with a scope), a building here and then 500 meters later a building there, the checkpoints always in the middle of a bloody wasteland that you can't traverse without vehicles that arrent available anywhere, checkpoints that are a total of 5 meters squared and bombs that are damage 314 meters squared (10 m damage radius).It would be a sad excuse to call people that made this game developers. It would be a lie. They have no clue what they are doing, the only decent decision they made in the whole game is to enable headshots for the rifles from most reasonable ranges. Everything rest in this (formerly) p2w game (but still effectively p2w in many respects due to the completely broken game mechanics) that had it's free cash per hour increased 4x times yet still being too slow to grind is more or less awfull.So much promise, soooo little delivered in the end, like the vast majority of todays cookie cutter games. Saddest part about all of this is just how little it takes to fix more or less every issue i have with this game (just tweaking the damage settings so it stops being unbalanced (and a slight p2w) and tweaking the stupid maps so they stop being wastelands, i could manage the grind).A fail of a game whose only decent mode is depo (the first and smallest map). They should have stopped development there..."",0"
"8767,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI got this game solely for my brother. The training course gives you the OP guns but when you get the class, you equip  BB guns. The next issue I have is that, this is WWII based and yet we are battling the USSR. Get your facts right. We did hate the commies but they were our Ally in this war. The new update has made it impossible for U.S. to win due to the spamming of tanks that are almost impenetrable.Conclusion: This game is still in beta and shows alot of promise. If they fix the game mechanincs and balanced the classes and vehicles, this may just may be agood game.  Until then I ask those who care about historical battles to wait until the creators of the game fix these issues"",0"
"8768,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI like shooters, but I'm not sold on this one yet.Amazingly frustrating game so far.  I think the concept is pretty good, but it is unbelievably unforgiving.  Kinda takes the fun out of it to spawn 20 times and die without a single kill.  Most of the time by people you never see.I guess that makes it realistic, but fun?  Meh not so much.Will keep trying to see if it improves for me but not holding out much hope.May 2016 update:RETO launched a new update yesterday.  To let players know how that went, I'll just say the following.  Their server was down for almost 24 hours immediately after launch.  When players actually got the chance to play....I found out that if you play tanks now and your tank dies you can have 5+ minute spawn times.  This wouldn't be bad if it wasn't so ridiculously easy for infantry to kill tanks...but it is.  And of course, friendly infantry rarely keeps an eye on tanks.  Why should they?  They gain nothing from helping tankers.  Do yourself a favor....pass on this game."",0"

"8771,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewI want to like this game, I tried really hard to like this game, but it makes it really hard, if not impossible for that to happen. Lets start with the basics, the game has a very big pay to win sort of feeling to it, you dont NEED to pay mind you, but the way the game is set up, it puts you at a big disadvantage starting out if you don't and instead try to use the ingame credits that you accrue slowly during normal play.After that, the maps are huge. Thankfully the developers thought to include bicycles to help you get from point A to point B faster, but thats a whole nother issue I'll get to in a bit. Starting out, the maps seem big, it makes getting around a bit of a pain, but it doesn't seem too bad. You see, your first 3 ranks in the game are spent on 'training maps' or something like that, they are smaller than the average maps, but still pretty damned big. They feel comfortably sized relative to the number of players, although I think they could increase the number of players per side 50% and it would be even better. After your first 3 levels though, you go to campaign maps, and thats where it gets to be painful. Those maps are several times larger, you NEED bicycles or apcs or cars to get around on them, otherwise you'll never see anything, however the bicycles are harder to come by on those maps, meaning you have to hoof it. Thankfully as players progress through the game they can purchase the ability to spawn cars, apc's, tanks, etc. but in my experience, its possible to end up on a server where nobody on your team has them. These maps are so large that the distance between objectives is several minutes at walking speed. That might sound cool, except at least as far as I can tell, the number of players on these maps is no greater than the smaller ones, I've yet to see more than 18 players per side, while the maps themselves are easily the size of larger 64 v 64 Battlefield style maps, it feels like the 'correct' number of players would be more along the lines of 100 per side on these actually, especially due to the fact that the maps are pretty open, meaning that players can easily spend 20 minutes going through the wilderness not seeing anyone, only to pop up behind the enemy lines and just have a good time shooting them in the back... repeatedly... nonstop. Of course, this is something that SHOULD be in the game, but the ease at which its accomplished, due to the fact that at any given time the majority of players on a team will be between their nearest spawn point and the objective they are trying to capture makes it extremely frustrating and it can and does break your momentum and just lead to a frustrated player base.Oh, and those bicycles I mentioned? While nice in theory, they have a serious drawback in that you cannot use your weapon while riding and they make you a HUGE target. You would think that it would be an easy fix, get say 75% of the way there on bike, dismount, and hoof it for the last 30 seconds to where you're trying to go... except on these campaign maps your opponent will usually see you almost as soon as you mount the bike, and they will be firing at you, and probably kill you... and if you do manage to get to that magic 75% mark and dismount, well remember how I said that the opposing team will frequently get behind your lines? Yup, they have an uncanny knack for popping out from behind a tree 15 feet behind you and shooting you dead while you're relatively helpless for the brief couple seconds it takes to dismount.And the other vehicles you can spawn like trucks, apcs, tanks, etc? Those are pretty cool, but again, you have to make an investment to acquire them and be able to use them, something not everyone does, and something which it doesnt seem that the matchmaking service (which is the only real way I've been able to get games... the game does let you pick your battles on the map, but ive yet to be able to get into any when i tried) takes that into account, as i've played on these larger maps where one side was almost entirely devoid of these vehicles, meaning they were forced to walk where bicycles weren't available. In fact, it gets worse, as it doesn't even attempt to balance the number of players with access to things like tanks against eachother. I am writing this, after having just completed a game in which the opposing team had not one, not two, but THREE tanks (mixture of Shermans and Hellcats) against my own teams ZERO, we had nothing larger than a Kubelwagen armed with a machine gun, which is effectively useless against heavy armored vehicles like the ones we were up against. Theoretically this is counteracted by the fact that players can equip themselves with things like panzerschrecks, bazookas, anti-tank mines, etc. but there are two problems with this - the first is that as far as I know this isn't possible DURING a battle, you have to have your loadout, etc. set up before the battle, the second issue is that access to these weapons is a function of both your rank and how much you're willing to pay. Yes, of course you can use the in-game currency to buy a panzerschreck instead of paying out of pocket, but its not really something you want to spend your credits on, as doing so means that you're not spending money on new rifles or weapons modifications, etc. Beyond that, equipping that panzerschreck occupies an equipment slot, which one im not sure, because I (like most it seems) haven't purchased a panzerschreck, which means - theoretically speaking - that you could end up equipping that weapon and ending up on a map where you have no real targets to use it against (I certainly haven't seen tanks very often, and the lighter vehicles like jeeps are easily handled with small arms).  The developers DID however seemingly have the foresight to provide the spawn areas with panzerfausts (and presumably a LAW type weapon for the allies), however that has yet to materialize as a viable solution in the games I've played. Picking up the panzerfaust means you have to carry the panzerfaust, as in it replaces your rifle, so when you inevitably encounter enemy infantry BEFORE you get close enough to actually be able to get a shot off at the enemy vehicle your options are to fire the panzerfaust at them in the hopes that you kill them, or drop the panzerfaust to pull your rifle back out, you'll often be killed before you can manage that. On top of that, the panzerfaust is rarely a one hit kill unless its one of the lighter vehicles like the jeep, and given that its a single fire weapon, that means that firign at the enemy tank won't kill it or necessarily even neutralize it, just damage it, so unless one of your other teammates managed to pick up a panzerfaust (its often not very easy to find), somehow survive long enough to get into engagement range and fire it off, chances are your opponents will have the tank repaired before you have a second shot.Which brings me to my next issue with the game, cover. I love that the game requires you to move tactically to be successful, running in the open WILL GET YOU KILLED. Thats a good thing, I think. The problem is that crouching is terribly slow, and for all the open space on these maps, it will take you a REAL long time to get around that way. And dont even get me started on prone, it might make you harder to spot and hit, but it also makes you effectively defenseless, as you move unrealistically slow, and actually turning around while prone is evidently impossible, so if you need to see whats behind you... yeah, you're going to have to stand back up. On top of that, moving tactically is largely useless when your opponents are just as likely to be behind you as they are in front of you. Most of my deaths come from being shot from my side or rear, likewise most of the kills I have come from shooting someone from the side or in the back, even when I'm in a 'head-on-head' engagement. Anyway, thats all the character limit will allow me to say."",0"

The thing that personally pisses me of the most though is all the unnecessarily useless features in the game like weapon repairing and the fact a scope costs more than â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing tank.

"8788,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's fun with friends, but that's about it.  It really only takes you a day or two of playing to get access to tanks and planes, but then you're up against other people that have been playing longer (or paid) and have vehicles that stomp you.  As infantry, it's frustrating if no one on your team is playing as a pilot or tanker because it usually means that the entire team is nothing but BF-109's dropping bombs on you when you spawn or tanks sniping you from across the map.  The matchmaking is atrocious in this regard, not to mention how long it can take to get into a single match.  Also, I know it's more of an arcade shooter, but it's absolutely ridiculous that I need to use an entire Thompson magazine to kill a guy, or any more than one or two shots from a bolt-action rifle.Plus, the recent Timoshenko update is terrible.  The Russians are horribly overpowered and you're pretty much guaranteed to lose against them - their weapons and vehicles do way more damage than the Americans or Germans and the Russians also get increased capture and spawn speeds.  Then you even have the lack of initiative the developers are taking against hackers.Probably the worst of it all is there is shockingly little content for how long the game has been in development."",0"

But all they keep doing is adding more guns and more tanks to the game which are still UNBALANCED to everyone and every gun that's already in the game. I've played a decent amount of the game which is probably more than I should have played but for what I thought the game had some potential which they're not showing anymore.

"8791,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI first was in love with the game it was fun to play and fair. But as more players with more experience than me in the game appeard it became less enjoyable. The level of fairness dropped dramatically for they were using IRL money to buy IG money allowing them to get expensive upgrades. I could not do this for one of my parents was unemployed so we did not have the money to do that. So i decided i would work hard and earn the IG money and buy what i wanted. But as i finished games i saw that the amount of money u get is miniscule while everything u could want to buy which is major in price. SO in the money category this game fails. The maps are also set up in a way were there is no CQB area it is mostly open fields. Making it impossible to do anything but die as a Submachine gun class which i am. I also played a recent game of assault in which we the attackers had all the objectives ut one. this one was surrounded by vast openess while it had excellent cover. So the losing teamwas able to just sit there and snipe us while we tried to get close. In the end my team which had all but one objective lost because we ran out of lives. The gamemodes all and all make no sense and is basically CoD team deathmatch. All in all this is just a lower quality CoD Ghosts, do not waste your storage space or time getting or playing the game."",0"

"8797,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""I would first like to say that I am not recommending this game at it's CURRENT state.This game really deserves a good review. In fact, it could've been one of the best WW2 games. I really, REALLY want to recommend this because I myself am a fan of FPS, Large-scale battles and WW2 and I was surprised seeing the variety of ww2 weapons and the skirmishes actually feel realistic and the feeling of needing to go prone in a field of heavy gun fire is amazing. Unfortunately, however, to get all the good stuff you're gonna have to grind..... a LOT. The game has a progression system so very slow that it is almost excruciatingly painful and after all the grind for experience. The weapon you worked so hard for is overpriced (92k for a slightly more accurate and lower rof version of the starting weapon). And a thing to note is reaching tier 2. Maybe you dominated everything in the first ranks with your modded grease gun or your accurate sniping with the Karabiner 98 and maybe you've gotten a lot of driving experience from your trusty GAZ and then you reach tier 2.... Holyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Before you know it you'll get killed by a guy with an MG42 or get spawncampeed by a plane. The thing is that, this game has so much potential but a very problematic execution.

"8802,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""If you are a casual player you will hate this game.  If you played any FPS in the past competitively  in the past this game will be like shooting ducks in a barrel.  The average players skill level in this game is a 2/10.  Spent a lot of time playing this game and only ran into 10-20 people that were actually skills in the FPS portion of the game.  If you are a competitive player and want to join a clan to do matches/scrim, dont bother.  They dont even have that implemented in the game yet.  The only way is to que for the same war battle against the opposite faction but thats just rolling the dice and you get randoms.  No true competition."",0"

"8804,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewDo not play this and if you do, don't play as Germany because they were originally a fair opponet until """"The Great Nerfining"""" were they they got nerfed so much that they have to pay royalties to Nerf. And defitinly don't play as tanker because 99% of the time you will get killed by and infantry to the point you fear them more then tank destroyers which are tanks meant for destroying other tanks. And don't forget the PTRD which one shots infantry, cars, light/medium/heavy/destroyers with it's infinite range accuracy and damage. Seriously developers fix the god damn game rather than adding in more and more half baked content that is pointless or makes the game even harder for german players which already have it hard enough.

"8810,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThere is so much to love about this game but there is so much more to hate about it. first of all if your playing with multiple screens forget it because all the sudden it will say on the screen detected mouse moving off screen and your soldier will start running and there isn't a thing you can do about it till you die, and I have experienced it with one screen and it's total crap. second thing and I really hated this one, I purchased a 24 hour membership thinking it would be active only when I play oh hell no they took my money and shoved """"hahaha i got you"""" down my throat and by the time I played my membership was no longer active. they run the timer even when your at work and I think that's totally wrong. I played this game right when it came out and was available on steam there were so many hackers on this game going 40-0 every shot was a headshot, it's gotten a little better since beta but come on if your going to sell an active membership make it fair make it so people can actually think they didn't just waste 20 bucks and I did. they make it to where you can only carry one rifle but you can't carry a sidearm unless your veteran, you can't change your loadout in game REALLY? you have to leave the game and the squad your in to change your loadout you don't know what map your going to play you don't know what loadout you will need till the game starts. another thing that is really stupid is the game timer when you die the timer makes you wait so freakin long to come back into the game by the time you do come back your entire squad is dead. like I said I have been playing this game for quite a long time this last update they had just screwed everything up and the grinding you have to do to get anywhere is not worth the trouble you have to go through to make this a fun and enjoyable game. I have a really good computer so I know it's not my computer messing the game up it's the game messing up because that's how it is. I won't be loading this game up again I will be uninstalling it and never looking back at it. I have put up with the issues on this game for far too long without them being fixed. they want your money they don't care about making it right or fair.  this game is getting deleted."",0"
"8811,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""So attempting to play this game multiple times and I can't seriously stick with it. The game has a ton of potential. As a former game reviewer, I can see it. However, the game has some serious flaws holding it back.First, the the spawn system. You spend the majority of your time running back to the objective in this game which can take between 30 seconds to a couple of minutes depending on the game mode you play. Spawn points are purposely placed away from any nearby objective giving the enemy team an advantage to setup defenses before an attack. You can only create a squad of 3 other members and then queue with random players. Good luck trying to get any organization with your team when it comes to attacking a fortified objective. Most people run in by themselves, get killed and then have to run back and it's just a loop of one person going in and dying.Second, the games economy. This game manipulates you or seduces you to try and spend real money on their game. Want to progress faster? Spend money on their premium service which gives you boosts to progress faster. The game has a huge grind specifically for this purpose. Silver (The in-game currency) comes slowly and you need a ton of it to even purchase upgrades (Which have durability by the way) for your weapons, weapons, upgrades, vehicles"

8814,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,Was an awesome game all the way through beta. Ever since it went full release and every new major patch it keeps going down hill. I kept up with the updates and would try each one in hopes it would get better again. Instead it seems it only keeps getting worst with each update and less fun.,0
"8815,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is a really mixed bag, so it was hard to me to decide whether I recommend it or not.But now I've made up my mind, I do not.The game itself is really enjoyable with different maps and career paths to take.There's a lot to like in this game.However a lot of these types of games get ruined by their economy or atleast fractions of their economy and H&G is no exception.The guns are overpriced and overpowered. If someone uses real money to purchase a gun you'll feel it, the game is very much, pay to win.Free credits are not well balanced, specifically designed to be hard to earn to buy new weapons, so that you'll be more tempted to use your hard earned cash.You think that if a game was to have hard to earn rewards, it'd take a Planetside 2 approach, and make all guns have strengths, weaknesses and be overall balanced. but they are not. The Thompson for example is the be all end all of submachine guns, I picked one up from an enemy and a quick burst of 3 bullets to the chest was all it took to down an enemy.however with the Grease Gun, america's starting SMG it took around 20, requiring the full clip if you miss.The german starting SMG is also stronger than the Grease Gun as well.There's not a large variety of guns either, which makes me question it a little, considering that I remember a larger array of weaponry in similar WW2 shooters.The game is fun, refreshing even, however the unfairness of it's economy and weapon tier system really ruin the fun.Unbalanced weaponry and inconsistent weapons between both factions, leaves something to be desired.This game would really benefit from leaving it's limitations, creating a third fictional faction to make battles 3 ways, or even adding the ability for 3 way battles which would include weaponry specific to that faction based in that time frame.This game is in need of a massive overhaul in order to improve player satisfaction and balance between all players, new and long running.Also, a quick mention for server maintenance, this game is riddled with it, atleast 30% of the time when I want to jump on, there's server maintenance, and this isn't for short periods of time, these are long downtimes, that when the time to be taken is predicted, takes anywhere from 2 to 8 hours, and when the maintenance is unexpected bugfixes or anything along those lines, the game can be done for a whole night, with no time given to players as to when it'll be back up.My verdict: a good game turned sour by it's online shop.6/10"",0"
"8816,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI have been apart of this game since well before it came to steam.  I have seen, well, not much improvement.  They continue to add shinny items, but fail to fix the glaringly broken ones.  Frequent crashes, Funky UI, ZERO clan system, broken and unblanced weapons, wonky maps, buggy vehicles, weapons and terrain.  It seems with the last build this game is looking for WHALES.  They want players to come in and dump tons of real cash to advance.  BE WARNED, THIS GAME IS A HUGE GRIND!  It will take you YEARS to advance a toon.  YEARS...unless ofcourse you want to spend tons of real cash on it.  Every new build brings new bugs and inbalance.  DO NOT waste your time here folks.  For NEW players, you will think its all great until you hit level 3 or 5, then you will see how screwed up the game really is.  3 years running now, and its still in """"BETA.""""

"8820,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWhen i began to play the game it was nice. Grinding to unlock new weapons and upgrades and sometimes even good teamwork. Even pay to win and the spawn killing tanks did not bother me too much.I played this game for 249 hours so i have seen many changes in the game some good some bad.I like to play with the bolt action rifles and i had unlock the sniper rifle i just needed 10000 credits to buy it.But after the last big patch ( 7 july ) you can only get the sniper rifle if you are recon.You can unlock two 4x scopes for the bolt action rifle but it is at the end of the new bolt action ribbon.But what really annoyed me was the if you are moving the bolt action rifle will not fire you have to stop to shoot.And in this game movement is life so as a rifle men you will die constantly.So after two days of playing with the new patch i have come to the conclusion that they broke this game.If you like to use only SMG and LMG this game is for you.If there is an other great patch i will play it to see if they fixed it.But for me at this moment it is over, i'm done with this game.

So my timing on the game might be short, but that is because I am a long time player before Steam release.So I originally got into this game as an alpha before Steam hit, back then the game was starting out and came a long way since then.Graphics: The graphics are actually quiet good and overal a nice touch on the game with some cool effects and detailing when in battle and not.Controls: These actually take some getting used too, I found the character control to be slightly annoying but then that could be the kinda sim feel to the game I think, but it does take some time to get used too, so be warned.Audio: The game is basically WWII sounds and so on, I must say some of the sounds in the game are really good and spot on with detail and worth having it loud.Now the game and it's features:Would you say the game is pay to win? Yes, with what I seen in the game it is very easy to buy some of the best stuff and just run around killing stuff quickly.  You also get a few idiots in the game that just mess around in the middle of battle, which is highly annoying but then in the middle of a battle you see a guy on a pushbike riding past a tank, rather amusing and enjoyable.Even though there that kinda pay to win aspect of the game, you can earn the stuff in the game still as it just takes some more time to get there, so that is annoying but then being a very enjoyable game I cannot really doubt it because the game is very fun and mixed with the graphics which are very detailed I would say, full looking around.... massive plus.Would I recommend the game? Yes and no, and the only no is the pay to win on the game, but everything else is yes without a doubt.A free to play WWII shooter, basically an updated BF1942 game with kinda more."",1"

Now that isn't the case, You will ALWAYS get killed by someone who paid more than you did in this game. The devs ruined this game with their horrible decision to include microtransactions upon microtransactions. Simple decisions to switch a character between roles/jobs (Pilot, Paratrooper, Tankman, etc) costs ingame or real money. You finally want to play the game? So you play 2-3 rounds. Now you have to pay for the ammo you shot! Now you have to repair your weapon!! What's that? You want to MODIFY your weapon?!?! That costs money too! And you have to repair THOSE modifications too!!!

I am not one for review of games, but I had hoped for this first person shooter (FPS) to be different from others.  Many FPS's are plagued with hackers, cheapskates, and denigrates who spoil the fun for others, and this game is no exception.  The game does have a reporting system. However, I have yet to see any repercussions for those who have been reported over my 1~2-week arduous grinding.  While the game does offer an immersive feel as you fulfill the roles of various servicemen and can entice avid world war 2 movie-goers or gamers alike, there are moments that I question this game's community's integrity in fair play, which in time, will tax a newcomer's patience to commit."",0"

I have a lot of game experience, so its easy for me to detect a cheater and I had been seeing cheater in about 30% of the gamesUsually aimbots and ESP (extrasensorial perception).. For example.. a plane that is aiming consistently against infantry while the fighter should not see the soldiers from the air and in the mid game he has +30 infantry killedNo matter if you hide in the bushes!!Or infantry who are killing everyone without even taking coverI think devs are doing their best against cheaters.. but I also think its not enought.. 1/3 of games infested by cheaters is too much!!The other problem I have is..2.- The nerfed PTRD 41.. It worths nothing!!I had been able to destroy tanks consistently from a range of 5-10 meters.. But.. whats the matter to get so close with a very restricted weapon of 1 shot, where you need to hit 3-4 times to destroy a light tank when there you can use antitank grenades wich only takes 2 equipments slot while the ptrd takes 8??  Absurd!!If you shot from 50-100 meters its almost sure you'll miss, no matter if you are proned.The PTRD 41 is a very long weapon with a very big and heavy ammo so it should have a very decent accuracy, but for now this weapon worth nothing.. in fact.. the AT grenades are a lot more efficient than this suposed  AT rifle..3.- Whats really the problem with Reto-Moto?..The problem is that the rich boys that plays for america are continuosly complaining about this and other weapons and reto-moto is so eager to please them..Thats the reason why americans win almost 90% of the wars!!!.

"8840,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""I have uninstalled this game because of rage so many times I stopped counting. I do not have a high-end PC, but I am used to running games with comparable graphics on at least medium details. This here? Lowest details and still only 25 fps and it gets to about 12 when using scopes. Makes it pretty much unplayable. There is a LOT of camping going on. Either on spawn or everywhere else. Teamplay is very bad in random battles since everyone is camping. Tank clas is mostly unplayable because of rambos on motorcycles and other tanks camping in bushesPlanes have very weird controls, I am a Warthunder pilot and I can tell that plane controls in this game are very bad.Horrible credit system. You need to spend hours in game, hunt dozens of tanks (only reasonable way to make money) and loose your nerves just to buy one gun. The grind for guns is okay, as well as for modifications, but the price tag they put on everything is just horrible compared to other games.They removed the ability to switch your soldier's class, so now you have to buy each class individually. That means you get stuck with a guy that has no ribbons, no combat badges, only basic weapons with no modifications and you get thrown against people who have their soldiers upgraded. Very bad MM, high learning curve and big differences between weapons make it a bad experience for a newcomer.Overall gameplay is quite fun and well paced, but it can be frustrating and boring.To mention other things real quick: small amount of maps with repetitive buildings, RNG guns, teamkillers, cheaters, lack of attention from devs and much more.But if you have a very good PC and lot of patience, you can give it a try."",0"

"8842,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewEnglish/German ReviewEnglish:The M1/M2-Carbine is totally unbalanced and gives the US-Faction a tremendous advantage.This weapon can be modified towards an extremely high rate of fire with nearly no recoil through weapon modifications.Thus it shoots faster and is more stable than all machine pistols and thus much more useful in close quarter combat.In addition to this overpowered status of the weapon itself, it has a very high number of reserve magazines at its disposal.The two other factions have no comparable weapons in their arsenals.A post in the forums, to point this Unbalance to Reto (the devs) out, got closed without any comment ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/227940/discussions/11/352788917756843101/ ) .That is a bad service and thus I can't recommend the game at this time.German: Die Existenz der total aus der Balance geratenen M1/M2 Carbine gibt der US-Fraktion einen ungeheuren Vorteil.Diese Waffe kann mittels Waffenmodifikationen auf eine extrem hohe Feuerrate mit so gut wie keinem RÃ¼ckstoÃŸ modifiziert werden.

"8850,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""This game had great potential, it really did. And I was convinced that by the time this game exited early access, the bugs would be ironed out, things polished and improved, and equipment balanced. Man was I wrong. The game has quite a bit of a grind to get anything that is really fun to use, and even then you have to pay to maintain your equipment. Between the three factions, there is a good bit of content, but like I said, you have to play the game constantly to get anywhere. The content is nowhere near balanced, especially the tanks, and the prices on anything are ludicrous. The game seems polished from the menu, but the actual FPS is very lackluster and basic. The """"RTS"""" merge with the FPS is a really cool and original idea, but again ruined by the grind and the developers' constant desire to redo things that are fine instead of fixing things that are not. The game now seems to be abandoned by the devs, and the only reason I would play it is because I have everything for germany from early access, and its occasionally fun to screw around with friends."",0"

Because the game does not reward kills nearly as much as it rewards team based actions like capping and defending bases. You also will be killed very quickly if you do not understand how to use """"cover to cover"""" tactics, or if you just run out into open fields. Understanding and using your stamina at the right times help as well.The negative reviews for this game are generally...A. People who hacked or use cheat software on their computers.B. Players that played the game less than 20 hours and can't understand why they don't get the SNIPER RIFLE or all the best guns handed to them instantly.C.

"8864,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is a really difficult review to make as i have had many fun hours in this game. MY biggest problem in the game is the complete disregard for the balance and the repair mechanic.1. you make tanks way too valuable to hunt down while an infantry unit can chuck two at grenades at your tiger 2 for about 600 credits they will earn 2000 while you spent about 4000 credits spawning it in.2. american tanks the american tanks are overall unbalanced in every sense of the word in the light tank class you have the chaffy with a 75 mm tank destroyer gun that 2 shots all other light tanks and can go toe to toe with medium tanks.then you have the hellcat the only tank destroyer with a rotating turret and once again two shots all mediums and all other tank destroyers oh its also the fastest tank in the game so its the only tank immune to at grenades.3. repairing just shouldnt be a thing yes you want to make money reto but you could just reduce the amount someone earns overall rather than leaving the potential for someone to lose money that match. snipers are really hurt by having to pay around 200-300 per bullet they fire.4. nearly forgot this one, spawncamping americans love doing this since all spawns are fixed teams can just sit at these spawns and instakill newly spawned players costing tankers 1000s of credits per game.But heres the thing even with all those problems Heroes and generals is an enjoyable game but is it worth getting into i would say yes if your looking for something thats fun for a bit but loses traction quickly .just one request of new players please be kind to tankers they have it rough and really please dont play american just play russia or germany.

"8870,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""This used to be my go-to F2P casual FPS game until patch 1.12 ruined it.

Everyone who's saying """"but this new update made the game so much more realistic!"""" ... this game was always arcade-y and it still IS even after the vehicles update. There was no reason to make the game more realistic because (imo) it ruins the charm of the game, but they also completely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up the implementation of it so it's not even a fun kind of realism.

Things I don't like:- It's a free online WW2 shooter...so expect bad team players, connection/server issues, premium currencies and premium status that grants a bonus to xp (basically making you unlock better weapons quicker. Quite unfair)- Your starting gear as the US: An M1 Garand...that's it. You have to level up to unlock a knife, pistol, grenades (you know, things every soldier had that aren't really as handy as a rifle). Ultimately, this makes matches so god damn dull. I never once thought I'd begin to get bored of the M1 Garand sounds but when all you hear is *puff puff ping puff puff puff ping ping* for an hour straight, it will drive you mad. - Battles are really empty. So much so it seems too quiet to be a battlefield. Again, dull. - Wow, I can change the colour of my helmet and the colour of my uniform. But wait, I'll only ever see it in the menu, what's the point? Hell, when changing helmets, the display doesn't even update. - I have great internet connection. Played a lot of multiplayer matches in other games. Not one issue. This game? Rubberbanding every 15 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' seconds. I played almost 2 hours and it was infuriating. Literally no other game I own has that issue. - Saving up for that one class you want isn't going to make the game any better. I had just about had enough of the connection issues and decided to play until I could afford to play as a Paratrooper (Band of Brothers style). Did not help. Very disappointing animations for the character and the plane, not to mention you can get shot out of the sky by anyone with a gun who looks up. And, saving up for that character ended up giving me LESS options to customise. - Stamina system. For a soldier, you really can't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing run far. The Generals part? You have to put a lot more hours in than I did. I love strategy games and I've played thousands of hours of them on here and I'm 100% sure I would have been disappointed with that mode too. - Most things in the trailer/screenshots barely happen and obviously been set up. Except for that stupidâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥cycle. Every time I see a German Tony Hawk, I focus fire on his sillyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥as he struggles to turn the damn thing. Driving reminds me of Garry's Mod addons. I really wanted this game to be at least decent and satisfying. And although I won almost every match I played I was still disappointed. Would not recommend. I'd prefer to buy my friends any Brothers in Arms game instead of wasting their time with this cheap trash."",0"
"8874,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Grind Grind Grind! It's just about grinding, you have to play a lot to get powerful, other than that everything is on sale, you don't have a knife or secondary gun, your gun doesn't have sight you have to pay 75,000 for 2times scope sight (if you wanna know how much is this, the US M3 submachingun price is 50,000 still cheaper than the scope). I got bored that everything needs buying even your ammunation."",0"
8875,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,i spent alot on this game a while ago as i loved the Generals mode but didnt have time or skill for the shooter part. Loved it.I ame back to it a few weeks ago and all those generals things are now locked behind a high lvl cap cutting me off from the generals mode that i Paid alot to play. the assets are still there but without spending more cash or grinding 4 diffrent char types those assets just do nothing. ,0
"8876,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""This game is just garbage, for multiple reasons. I don't even think the creators actually bothered to play their own game, otherwise they'd know they need to fix the capabilities of snipers, tanks, paratroopers, and map layout. Snipers are probably one of the most OP weapons in the game. So long as it has it scope you're good to go. Thats horseâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Where is the need for close quarter combat? Whats the point in sub machine guns if the snipers tag you and snipe you before even reaching the objective? Half these maps are flat spaced with little to no cover except for skinny trees and objective points. It's like an empty sandbox from garrys mod. Where are the good maps and where is the balance? Same thing goes for tanks. Once you buy one, you can almost spawn it EVERYTIME you die and respawn. And half these tanks dont even fight other tanks. All they do is camp objectives and pick off enemy players. The cars with guns just sit at a distance and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing snipe the players from points. Paratroopers also, all they do is flank the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ out of the enemy. Since when was airspace not an aspect of warfare? If your gonna add paratroopers, restrict them to certain airspaces so they can't just land right in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing middle of the objective and flank. Finally, map layout. I don't know how you can fix this but I'd assume its possible by nerfing all of the stupid aspects prior to this. Map layout and flanking. Why make a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bridge an objective point when people can SWIM to flank? Its stupid. You're basically telling players to hold an objective on a mountain with a small square of cover. If they peak, they get sniped or spammed with tank fire. I've only played like 8-9 hours of this game and I found THIS many flaws so far. God knows how many more there are. Don't play this game. I know the free aspect is tempting, but its â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ingâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"",0"
"8877,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Can it be fun? Yes. Is it regularly fun? No.Large battles, (i.e. Tanks & Planes available) run about as well as a parapeligic, KFC addict.There is no consistency in wait times. You could get in a battle moments after joining the lobby, or wait for upwards of ten minutes. The grind is insane. This is directed more at the aquisition of new weapons and equipment than rank. Want a bolt-ation rifle? Grind for about 12 hours. Want to customize that bolt-action rifle? Grind for upwards of twenty hours if you want the best.Oh? You did all that grinding but still you can't get it? Well you're earning Silver at such aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥rate that when compared to the cost of items you're pretty much half-way to square two.I think this is the point where you either quit on the game entirely, or spend upwards of $100 on gold to be able to get theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥you want without grinding for an obscene period of time.Good concept,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥poor execution. Cannot reccomend."",0"
"8878,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Its a NO for me for 2 main reasons.-The worst game ever in terms of grinding..clearly it has been set up so you keep injecting small amounts of $. Otherwise it may take months to get a new gun/tank or class. And most guns youll never have unless you steal it from a corpse for until you die. Very restrictive in terms of choices for weapons and class, pick your role wisely, cause youll get stuck with it for a long long time-Seems like the only colors that were used for the entire game creation are green, brown and green, did I say green already...well, its bad. Everything is so brownish and foggy.and one last thing..games with such big maps should balance the damage vs health a lot better, so you actually feel like you are playing the game instead of looking at a respawn timer. Soldiers you better love running around and be killed by only 1 bullet, then waititng forever to rejoin a war in which you might not even be able to participate in cause you were killed by something brown in a brown background running out of browness."",0"
"8879,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""I have 35 hours flight time, over 1500 kills, I consistantly dominate the leader board and try to teach new players how to be a pilot since before the latest """"warbirds and tail gunners update"""". I have mastered flying in this game and I can tell you 100% that it is FUBAR. this game has for the last year or more only existed to let the old players shame and dominate the new players. I know i'm guilty of it my self. IF you start playing this game some one like me is going to dominate you and laugh the entire time. If you were a pilot chances are you've probably just quit. I loved the arcade feel to this game, I have flight simulators as well as combat flight simulators. I'm an experience air Chauffeur in Arma 3 as well as a mid tier War thunder fighter.  The new flight model is a bad attempt at getting out of being an arcade style game. for example if you press control and W ( which is your accelerate button also) they become your nose down dive into death button. same with shift. This was my favorite get away game and after this last update I see no reason to waste the space on my hard drive."",0"
"8880,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGame has a lot of potential, requires balancing and some work to the scale system in regards to earning exp and in game currency.Customer service/support is non-existent. No longer playing this game due to friends being permanently banned for no real reason.Highly recommend not spending any money on this game if you do chose to play it, until customer service/support is mediocre at least."",0"
8881,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,This game is so unbalanced it hurts.The weapons are a massive grind to obtain and the classes are completly overpriced.Finding a server to play takes 2-5 minutes and I often find myself joining a server that is already mid-end game. ,0
"8882,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewLevels 1-4 as a character in this game are great. It's totally a skill based matchup where you can go out and have a lot of fun. Once you (or any single one of your friends) hits level 5, the party is officially over. You immediately get thrown into much larger conflict against people who have a ton of weapons upgrades/vehicles that you don't have access to, and grinding levels becomes terrifying.The gold purchasing in this game enables wallet warriors to reign supreme, and completely disenfranchizes those who don't have/want hundreds of dollars to go into a single game. This could be overcome with extreme patience and skill building, but pales in comparison to the revenue model of LoL (which maximizes fun, and doesn't require you to spend money)."",0"
"8883,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewHeroes and generals is a ww2 based shooter that uses a more realistic combat system. In this aspect of the game it is fun, however the game quickly lost my intrest. I am a vertan FPS player and i have decent aim. i have many hours logged in various games and the biggest issue i have with this game is that it does not reward players well for there achivments. You make a set amount of money per hour. when you rank up u gain more money per hour but it is not much form 8000 to 18500 or so. the issue i have with this is the player who made 400 xp in a 10 min match will get the same reward as the player who made 20. the cost of weapons is way to high for the amount you have to play to get them. Verdict: if you are bad at FPS games this game if for you. BUT, if you are good you will strugle with getting money and probably get frustrated fast."",0"
"8884,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewDo not play, unless you wish to be disapointed. id say, come back in 2 to 3 years, then MAYBE you can play it normally, right now in its forever beta stage, DO NOT PLAY, DO NOT BOTHER SPENDING MONEY, OVERALL WASTE OF TIME. as of now that is."",0"
"8885,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewVery Pay2Win, massive grind for weapons and vehicles. Dev's are not only neo-nazis that are very anti-American, but they are absolutely terrible at fixing and improving thier game. Its blatant that all they want is our money. Extremely laggy even on high-end computers. 3/10."",0"
"8886,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game was great before. But after a few updates, it died shortly after.  The fact that you have to play for hours upon end to actually get any good weapons or any interesting classes kills the mood for me. It takes too many shots to kill one guy, as you shoot about 4 Gewer rounds into someone and they still walk around like nothing happened. The only somewhat fun thing that I liked was being a pilot, but even then, it still falls short.  I was expecting realism in this game, but it never showed.  The movement of the characters feel clunky, the guns feel weak, and overall H&G toppled over after a what used to be a good structure."",0"
"8887,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Where does one start here? Like really.I have 69 hours or so on this game. However, I bought it about a month before the Soviets were added.That was when the game declined. It will probably never meet the greatness that this game was before the Soviets were added. I remember picking this game up and saying, """"Hey, this looks sweet."""" And it was! Germany and America dueling it out. Skirmishes was the best and both teams seemed to take turns winning wars. Simply because they both had good, experienced Generals/Officers.So what happened? Well the Soviet Union came in. And because the CoD generation of gamers exists, they went to the Soviets because of their stronkness. And so that team got flooded and everyone whined that they weren't good enough.Right off the bat, they had buffed spawn tickets and it seemed like they had good equipment. They needed this because it saved their lives. Then it took a dark turn. They lose every war in last place but win most of the skirmishes because of some stupid HP system and some really stupid OP weapons.Another major issue: TanksFirst off, I'd like to say that when you have a machine gun in the game cost just as much as a Tiger I, you've got issues. """"So, what is the MAIN issue?"""" I hear you saying aloud as you read this. Well, the tanks are their own worst enemy. If you do what their supposed to do, support Infantry as they move from objective to objective, they get wrecked by an Anti-Tank Rambo with a motorcycle and some AT Grenades. So the tanks sit back and cut people in half with 75mm's, 85mm's, and 88mm's from a mile away. So, the infantry and paratroopers are caught with their pants around their ankles with theirâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ which is mooning a taxi driver in NYC by the way, hanging in the breeze. So objectives just get traded until someone, eight hours later, wins.Tanks also get killed for staying still so it's a lose/lose situation if you pick that career option.Oh and it doesn't make a difference if you are driving in a Tiger II or an M4 Sherman, yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥is molasses as Sheriff Buford T. Justice would say.Planes are an absolute joke to fly. I can't seem to do it and others can. Fly Germany if you want wings on your chest I guess? I don't know. The P-38 seems like a stupid option for an aircraft. The P-51 and P-47 were more used than the P-38 for the game's intended purpose so why is this mediocre aircraft there?Paratrooper is the best career hands down. You can join the fight anywhere your plane flies and you get that sweet sweet M1A1 Carbine. Sniper's are OP but I guess that's their role so I don't know. OHK rifles, that ones the snipers get, are realistic but they seem limited to the bolt-action rifles. Most of which fire the same round as their """"starter rifle"""" counter parts for brand new players. And these starter rifles take two or three shots to kill someone at medium to close range. So not realistic then.Infantry is where you'll get the most out of the game. The most weapons and vehicles for all purposes. Before AT mines were nerfed I would destroy two Tiger's in every life I had. Just place the mine below it'sâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ run away, shoot the mine. And the whole thing just blew up. The most fun I had.The Soviets get no MG on their starter utility car/vehicle. So they are at a supreme disadvantage going against level 1 American or German motorized infantry.Currently, this game is turning to garbage update after update. People don't cooperate with teams at all. They just go out to score some Kills because....K/D's are more important.The playerbase is shrinking and no new players are coming because all of the good reviews are in the negative. Some good effort was poured into this game but ultimately, the developers didn't listen to the community. I think they should try again, but smooth things out before adding content.So, I give a negative review for Bicycle Simulator 2016."",0"

"8890,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""im just straight DONE with this game, totally DONE.here is the list WHY1, hackers, even though the forums will DENY up and down that they have seen a hacker in game for nigh 2 years or so. they exist (id almost bet the deniers are hackers) when someone can take a machine gun, one that SHOULD have the worst recoil and accurracy at distance, and fires at a full speed moving jeep, and 1 shots the full health gunner(with heavy set medal at gold) with a head shot from clearly away from easy sight. the likelyhood of that just being """"a really skilled player"""" is slim to none, its totally bs.2, dev bias, the developers have a CLEAR bias for certain factions, regularly when a update comes out, its for the german or soviet faction, never the allied. go ahead, take a look, find the last time they announced any kind of weapon or vechicle update highlighting something for the allied faction. if you find it, id bet its all the way back in early days of production. and with that bias comes...3, unbalanced factions, you will regularly hear ANY allied player complain about being 1 shot with a gewer in the chest. and yet it is 100% impossible for any allied gun to return that favor. the amount of PURE damage guns outside of the allied faction can deal is unbelivable. its rediculous and makes the game completly impossible, hell you cant even get a decent scope for a sniper. vehicles all have this same problem. allied armor is weak in comparison, last i checked, thats not how the war went. this used to not be as much of a problem a long while back when you could buy the weapons the enemy faction had, as your starting weapon. well they took that right the fk out. now there is just a wall of bullets you better hope you can get around.4, devs just dont care, the devs are just cold and uncaring, i had an issue where they did a big update, and it wiped out all of my xp for my sniping gun, i made a support ticket, i think i waited 3 months till i actually heard something back, by then i had uninstalled the game.  the devs response? """"oh yeah we will fix that in a rolling patch later, heres a camo skin for your trouble"""" oh and the only unlocked it, i still had to BUY IT WITH IN GAME MONEY.this game should be ripped from steam, just look at the """"mixed"""" reviews, even hardcore vets of this game are just done with the nonsense. dont waste your life on this soon to be washed up studio and their cut rate biased game."",0"
"8891,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe devs really want to make this game look pretty, with all the fancy screenshots ands artwork and upgrades and currencies and everything. Then you get into the game. I used to play a lot of CoD back in the day, I don't know whether I got so rusty or is it the game. It's just so clunky shooting at things, it just doesn't fell reliable or good for me, it's just really annoying. And I think they know that. Hence the whole currency system. Yeah you're not having fun, but you can earn points and buy better gear, so that should keep you playing. You get a bad gun at the beginning, and you are supposed to kill stuff exclusively with that gun for FIFTEEN HOURS if you want to get a decent one. But have to play more if you want good upgrades. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the more points you get in game the more currency you are awarded. If you just got out out of the low level incubator, you are pinned against experienced people with tanks snipers etc. I personally didn't like running 3 minutes to the battlefront just to get shot down from who knows where (in CoD that only took like 10 seconds).My point is, I am really really frustrated by the game. There is no real reason for me to play it. I found playing the game a drag, with the only motivation being getting currency for better guns. You spawn, you run for 2-3 mins and maybe, maybe you kill a few peeps or even make a cap. If you are new and haven't spent money that will be the case. I know, the graphics are good, the models are pretty, it has cars and tanks and planes and on paper it's a really good game model. But I got little actual fun from it. To the devs: I really don't know what would make me rethink, maybe drastically lower grind times I dunno. Sry. My opinion: A pretty looking grindy waste of time."",0"

"8896,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Tons of equipment to unlock and play with. Owning all your own vehicles, soldiers and weapons really makes you feel invested in the game and not simply logging in to use preallocated soldier types. Large maps that are actually large where you rarely run into invisible walls/walls like in most fps. The large maps are large enough that you can actually flank the enemy without being seen. You can highly customize your soldiers. Everything can be bought with money earned in game. No need to spend a dime unless you want to. Needs more large maps for veterans because we have played them so much. I wouldnt mind joystick support for aircraft. Only players that can issue orders should be assigned as squad leaders."",1"
8897,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,Early Access ReviewTo be fair the game has a good concept and I just love the little unbalace in this game.for example The german Tiger is stronger then the russian and american versions.but the fun thing is all 3 faction have their strenght en cons that makes it very enjoyable.this has decreased a bit since the steam launch though but the cons and pro's still exist.This game however is very grindy and that can be anoying or a blessing the devs keep adding new stuff so if your really like the game you have allways a goal to strive for but that can take some time.you can easily invest hundreds of hours into this game this way.also the game is slightly pay to win for example the veteran bonus (a subsribtion around 20-30 bucks for 3 months) that you will get gives you a extra credits gain extra experience extra warfunds game a 4th equipment slot and a second ribbon slot. the last one is most significant when it comes to gameplay because's each ribbon gives a quite nice boost to your character and the ability to equip 2 can make some weapon ribbon combinations 10-20% better in terms of K-DHeroes and generals is still a little buggy and in my opinion are not all changes to the lenght of the grind have been apriciative but it has a quite unique gameplay style and I have just spoken about the heroes side of the game.As the devs in hng saySee you on the battlefield ,1

I have played the game over several years (about 1400 hours in steam and even before it came to steam), i have seen many updates, many hotfixes and nerfs. I can say that:#This game is dying.#Developers ARE NOT listening the community. #Developers don't really know what they are doing. (Best example: creating tons of skins over 1.5 years and yet not a single new assault map) #Developers ARE allied biased (USA & SU) and taking things personally when someone is adressing questions about German faction / Nazis. #And the biggest f**kup is the 1.12 update the developers rushed in, unfinished, unpolished, unreal.

"8902,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewDont play this game, seriously.the game has a great idea. path progression, faction based fighting. awesome ideas, perfect... until you actually play the game.horrible hit detection, ballistics like shooting tenis balls, and at least one hacker per match. Also snipers, SNIPERS EVERYWHERE, and why not? the game rewards you to be a sniper, the longer range a kill the higher the exp. with an average weapon you get 5 maybe 6 exp for a kill, 10 if savior (meaning you stoped them from killing a buddy) 60 if defensive (meaning inside a cap point). average sniper kill at 200m? 75-80 not adding defensive or savior. so you can imagine everymatch has at least half the teams made of snipers.Also very pay to win, the bought mgs and sub mgs can almost snipe themselves and the basic rifle has to be almost point blank to hit, that is of course the hit detection lets you.laggy as all hell, ping is a very big problem, buggy, just overall a poorly done gameCould be an awesome game if done right... but its not, and sadly this games ideas are almost exactly what i think an awesome ww2 shooter would be, but i end up RAGING 90% of the timeif you want to try it and at least pretend like you found the ww2 shooter your looking for, go for it, but for god sakes DONT GIVE THEM ANY MONEY!"",0"

"8912,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,"" This is my review of this game.For starters, the game is about WW2 where you pick factions in early game. The Soviets, the Germans and the Allies/US.Each factions has pros and cons, for what I observed. It's a free to play game, made by Reto-moto.The game itself is fun, wide maps, you have opportunity to become a pilot, tanker, recon or a general itself. (Please don't be like those bad Generals if you become one, like the map has no cars/bikes etc.) As a new player of the game, you will have an Infantry, as a starter character of the game. If you play US, you will have M1 Garand which has good sights in my opinion. If you play Germany, you will have G43 or Gewehr 43 which has good precision when not aiming. If you play Soviets, you will have SVT-40, it is a flexible gun.Now here comes the new player life, as a new player, you will be on Bronze tier and will be on Encounter match. This is the best part when you try to understand the game mechanics. Use this opportunity to understand the game.. (Just my advice.) You'll be versed with Bronze skills till Silver skills then gold. Once you've hit the Gold tier, welcome to the worst part of the game. Q: Why is it worst when you're onto Gold Skill tier? A: As a new player, you will be just running, using bicycles, using civilian truck and you will be getting camped by Recons or Infantries with bolt action rifles (1 hit).This part will irritate you the most. A: The second worst is that, tanks with HE shells spawn camp you. (Be grateful if one of your teammates are Anti-tank psychos.) A: The third worst part, the planes will destroy you if they see you running in the open. (My advice, if they have fighter planes/Heavy fighter planes and you don't have a car. Go run in the forest area or a place where keeps you hidden with shadows.)A: The fourth worst part, is that once you are onto capping zone, enemies who have heavy set badges will be hard to kill because heavy set badges reduces damage and you are just using your tiny cute stock tier 1 gun. And you will be the one who get killed first because they have better guns than you. A: The fifth worst part for you, you will be versed with insanely good players (In some games, the matchmaking has skill callibration where  you get to your own skill tier and this game has don't.) Q: Why I don't recommend this game? A: The game is way too grindy, this makes you pay a real dollar into a pixel money. Sounds stupid but that's the reality of this game.  (I prefer to grind in an different MMORPG game than to grind in this game.)A: Reto or the game company does not listen to the communities opinion, they just making new BS planes, new guns. They should Improvise the maps with weather and the Infantry character.For me once you get your 1 hit guns, MGs, badges, cars, planes, tanks, best assault rifles then the game starts to be fun.Let me tell you: If you want to enjoy being tilted, triggered or become a masochist, then this game is for you.My game rating: 4/10 "",0"
"8913,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""The game itself could be very fun but sadly the developers decided to create an unbalanced """"free2play"""" where you can fight with your superior equipment (that you bought for a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of money or after a grind that lasts maybe longer than WWII itself) against people that freshly started playing and have nothing but the inferior stock standard weapons.Don't support greedy developers.

"8916,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewHeroes & GeneralsFor those that played Battlefield 1942, this game will bring back memories and seem very familiar.  First thing is that this game is in Beta and has a lot of work left to it.  However, it is playable.  This game is a set on a large scale warfront between Germans and the US in WWII.  The battles are part of campaigns in which wins, losses, deaths, and kills are added up over a period of time to determine the campaign winner.  Recently, a new non-campaign mode has been added to provide a more balanced game, but the battles do not count towards the current war. The game is multi-platform and has three different gametype options"
"8917,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""I played Combat Arms since 2008. Since I started playing Heroes & Generals, I haven't even logged on to CA. This game is the best war game I've ever played. I love this game! If you've never played this game, you need to check it out, you will love it! My hat goes off to the guys that make this possible. The detail is awesome! I wish I could play this game 24/7 but I have to work during the week. That's how much I love this game! Look how many hours I've racked up and so fast! I've only been playing this game a few months. Play Heroes & Generals, you'll be glad you did. Look on YouTube for videos that will teach you about the game & also check the forums. There is also a channel on Team Speak 3. There you can join a clan and get to know some people who have played the game a long time and know the ins and outs of the game. You will learn a lot from these guys. I hope this review will help!

"8919,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Heros and Generals is a unique blend of FPS and strategy unlike anything else around at the moment.. Adding these two components together with a dev team that frequently adds new and improving features make this game one of the most enjoyable games ive ever played. The games nature encourages you to play with other players from all over the planet and getting to know new friend this way makes this game exceedingly addictive and a lot of fun to play.The Dev team are excellent at keeping cheats at bay and despite being a small team do an amazing job at keeping up with player desires.The bad- As they do have a small team offten response times can be slow so getting feed back from the devs is very difficult.Some decisions on the direction of the games progression sometimes clashes with the experienced players (Having each new faction added at war with existing factions. Apparently the plan is that once the British are added they will be at war with the Germans the Rusians AND the USA) The devs can be slow to revert to """"better systems"""" after getting feedback. Some decisons do leave players wondering if the devs have time to play the game much themselves. ie Squad 2.0 and new Spawn sites/protection system.Overall thou this is an awesome game with no competition out there that offers such a wide range of toys and playing levelsThe grind is horrendous but still worth it if you can stick at it."",1"
"8920,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI don't know how I feel about this game. As of now I haven't played very long- but I can say I have enjoyed it.On the one hand it most definitely has some P2W elements, but the starting equipment isn't too bad and it doesnt seem like it takes too long to get up there, and this is coming from a person who fundamentally hates P2W games.The early game is pitted against you, enemies have grenades, tanks, automatic weapons, and all you have is a basic semi-auto rifle. Fortunately I discovered most people in heroes and generals aren't very good and despite the unfair advantages they have over me, I still manage to score reasonably well sometimes.I have only played as an infantry and am rank 5 or so, so dont take this review too seriously.The vehicles are solid and it's good fun to jump on a machine gun while your mate is driving a jeep into a control point. CRACK CRACK CRACK! (the sounds do need some work though.)Gameplay is kind of clunky but no where near dayz or arma2.I would recommend this game simply because it's free. If they made me pay $10 and removed and the pay2win elements, I would accept in an instant. Hell maybe even $20."",1"

"8923,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI love this game so much. And I like the fact you listen too the community as well. I would give this a 9/10. There is a few things a dont like, here is the list1. I unlocked the grease gun as infactry, didnt buy it. When I switched to a tank crewman, I had to unlock it again, which I dont think I have to do, since I aready did.2. It says tank crewman can use a semi-auto rifle. But it wont let me use my M1 Garand.3. I dont like the repair system. I like realism in a game, but that takes it a bit far. The reason I say this is beacause some battles a die a bit, use some gernades, ect. And at the end I can get 2-4 thousand credits. But with repairs I dont get much back, sometimes I lose money. So I suggest either remove it or make it so it doesnt cost as much.4.I think you should increase the amount of gold you get a day. You would have to do 1 battle a day for 20 days just to get 100 gold. And some people just dont have that time. So I suggest you increase it to 10 gold per first battle, so It cuts the time in half.5. I can feel the unbalance in battles. It seems the germans have too many tanks, and the soviets have to many half tracks.I know you guys are working on this and I am grateful for that. I think it should be like this, The germans have good tanks, but not much of them (Harder to get). The americans should have """"ok"""" tanks, but plenty of them (Easier to get).Like how it really was in World war 2. As for the soviets, I dont know, I dont know what they had in WW2.Other than these few things I really enjoy the game and I hope you kepp on improving and updating the game. 9/10 IGN would definatly play again.

"8929,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Update: The game has been getting worse and worse and I think it's funny how the trailer says 'millions of players in one grand war' when the entire player-base is around 6000... At this point I have to say my rating has dropped to a 4/10.300+ hours of the game have taught me a few things. Most important being that this game is grindy - 0% doubt in that, but in my opinion that is the aspect of the game that makes it stand out from other FPS games (that, and the fact that it's one of the few WW2 themed MMO FPS' around). Sure, when you start the game with your horrible SA rifle which takes 3-4 hits to kill someone, you will die a lot. A lot. But! One day you think: 'Okay, I'm getting better at the game, I have figured out some decent strategies with my starter weapon!' So you go in and try them - die a lot again. But you try again, you die a little less. And after a while (50-75 hours +), you start to get the hang of it. It's really these first couple of steps that separates people who are used to COD and CS, where there is little-none grinding, and then these people might post some pretty angry reviews just because it's different. Of course, another important fact is that stronger weapons can be bought with real money - another thing people complain about. However, hours and skill generally go hand in hand, so even someone with a purchased gun is beatable if you are more experienced then them. A good way to go about these people is to:1. Kill them.2. Steal their gun.3. Kill them with it.4. Repeat step 3 until satisfied.So, to conclude, I recommend this game for people looking for a different experience to traditional FPS games where everything is available right off the bat."",0"

"8932,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Product received for freeHeroes & Generals, the WW2 MMOFPS about stradegy, conquest, and war isn't the amazing and stunning game the trailers and promotional advertising and trailers says it is. First off, the gameplay is really awkward because it lags alot, the gunsights are really difficult to use and relying on spray and pray rather than strategic accuracy.  The game is full of cheaters and people who do cheap moves such as spawn camping with sniper rifle, spawn camping with mines etc. Since the game doesn't have much hack prevention, there are many cheaters who just ruin the game for everyone. Finding a game would take very long have when the game starts, you get a high ping too. BTW, the friendly-fire in this game is infuriating accidently killing teammates by explosives, vehicles, etc. being reported for accidently team killing, and getting killed by someone by accident/a team griefer.Secondly, the game is Free to play, pay to win because the grind takes so long, you might as well play your other games in your library before getting a weapon/vehicle/upgrade etc. or you can buy the in-game currency which is gold that can rank up and buy stuff faster which gives signifant advantage over other players that don't buy in game currency.Lastly, Reto-Moto"

The last """"balance"""" changes to some iconic weapons hurted the game, specially for SU, which was in a pretty bad spot already, but they dunked us in the mud by making other factions weapons even more OP than ever.That, combined with the poorly development focus on what really matters  and the game needs (maps, balance, mechanics, RTS) but besides on $$ like camos, promos, etc, or even new planes (which was indeed a good addition but on a stupid prioritation level) made me loose my trust in this developers.Tanks are jokes in this game, since any infantry can oneshot them with AT nades. Anti-personal mines spam AVIABLE FOR EVERY INFANTRY will make you look more to the floor than to the enemy itself even inside capture points and specially at chokepoints like doors or stairs. And planes are just godmode_on, because you have no real way to counter them aside for other planes.Its so hard to see the game die the way it is right now. I wish Reto put his hands on this and save it, because it needs to be done ASAP.To sum up, the grind is very hard at the starting levels, there will be a niche time in which you will be able to actually enjoy the game, but once you see the balance issues, your love for the game will be slowly crippled.

So that is the reason the game is P2W, so you will pay Reto-Moto instead of grind. Pay $$$ for good class.I met players that wasted more than hundrends of dollars for this game, smh, I would give them a penny, this game is Free to Download and Free to Play, but not to be a good player that instead of grinding wastes all of his money to play H&G. btw many F2P players exist, so if you are one of them than welcome to the club. 5.0/10 -Good Gameplay and fun, P2W ruins everything.

"8959,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""All memes aside, this game is pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad. Infantry on Infantry combat is extermely rare as everyone just sits in their indestructable tanks or sits on a hill with a 1 hit kill rifle. The game is also extremely grindy and has a lot of pay to win. By default all the semi auto rifles are 3 hit kills, and the bolt action rifles are 2-3 hit kills. Tanks are pretty much just giant indestructable insta kill sniper rifles, and noone has AT so they tend to just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up the entire game.

"8966,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Before playing this game take a look at all recent reviews and you will see they are more or less all negative and the only reason this game is on MIXED is because this game USED to be good.This game has been in development for over 5 years and there is still huge amount of problems. I will list just a few of them down below. Bad Netcoding.Huge amount of Bugs/Glitches that takes years to fix.Terrible optimized game end game pc's will have 200-300 fps in the beginng of a match and once all the players spawn and get close to one another the end game pc's will drop down to 60-80 fps on LOW GRAPHICS and medicore pc's will have 15-40 fps.Insanely slow with the updates and when they finally do have an update it is just minor things like a new camouflage and a bunch of stupid balance changes that was unnecessary that nobody asked for.Unbalanced weapons,Tanks,Planes and credit/gold prices between the 3 factions.Insane grind (even if you pay money)Unplayable for new players once they get out of the starting stage of the game because of the huge grind and veteran players will just instant kill them because of better Badges + Weapons.Takes ages to find battles during the Morning/Night you will have to wait 20+ minutes to find a battle.People abuse game mechanics and Reto don't care as long as the players abusing bring in the $$$.Developers make the game worse by each update and all they think about is the $$$.If you dont have friends that already play this game you should not waste your time on this still in """"BETA"""" staged game.The only reason this game is still not in beta is because the terms of service of steam prevented them (You are only allowed to have a game that is under BETA on steam for X amount of years or your game will get kicked out of the platform)"",0"

If developers doesn't change it, I will stop to play and ask friends to do the same."",0"
"8969,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's a free to play game, so I expect some grind, but the grind in this game is outrageous.  I've played plenty of other F2P games that really drew me in, and made me want to spend my money.  This game is not like that.Example:The bazooka unlocks at a fairly low level, there are tanks everywhere, and no-one shoots them. Why?  Each bazooka round costs 1/6 of the credits (in game currency) I typically make in a match, and it takes 3 hits to kill most tanks.  This means, If I try to help out my team and destroy that tank that's been shelling us for 5 minutes, assuming perfect aim, it's going to cost me half of what I make that match."",0"

8971,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,Early Access ReviewAt first when I looked into this game there were pretty decent reviews and gave this game a shot. My god the time it takes to grind out stuff in this game is not worth your time. It doesn't take a great deal of time to get to the tank or pilot class but anything other than that strap in you are about to take make a massive grind. And even then theres massive set backs. It can be a pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥to save up for anything new after a point. For it you use your item you have to pay to replenish your stuff after every fight. Ive lost money from battles because I was going ham on tanks and other enemie vehicles and personel. Now there seems to be the worse lag and glich issues ive seen since i played this game let alone all the aim bot kids on this damn thing. Theres better shooters out there that will take a hell of a lot less time to get where you want to be save your time and money and move on from this game.,0
"8972,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWhen i started playin iwas so excited, then the horror began, i was killed by tanks and guys with smgs, and other high level weapons. I was wasted eveytimeAnd the worst part is you can barel xp do to all the people who pay real money and kill you in a flash and since you may no t want to pay the developers basically make it a death simulator for people no willing to pay. Finally in a personal not the only way i could get any experiance at all was to capture points and thats it because m starting gun did nothing to the enemy. Overll ill say that its a money trap."",0"
"8973,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis review is my opinion if you agree then so be it, if not then dont i can careless.Ok to start off with this review and why its negative for such a good game.This game was so much fun at the beginning its just a great game with so much potential..... Until it forces you into the bigger map's with higher levels that have all SPENT IRL $$$ for better guns or just earned every weapon already im stuck with a basic rifle vs machine guns, lightt machine guns, high power'd snipers, planes that constantly drop bombs on you, tanks and so fourth how is this fair that im stuck with a basic semi rifle with no addable items in which i mean you cant add a scope or anything to it. And have to wait A SUPER long time to even unlock anything good! i had a 2.20kd until i hit that certain level where everyone had better weapons than me and i really couldnt do anything, so THERE GIMIC is spend irl money to get a decent weapon.... another thing is how do they expect a BETA to get about 11.50 for each month of member just for bonus xp and lil extra s*** i very much enjoyed this game and loved ALMOST every moment up until the uninstall and i thank the developers for a good game to use some of my time on, but i will not recommend any game that forces you to spend your hard earned money just to enjoy a free game, sorry but no i'd rather find another free game to enjoy or spend my money to have a whole new game.P.S. thankyou for reading my review and i hope you take it into consideration, and you dont support such cheap gimic's so they can take all your cash and run."",0"
"8974,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI decided to come back to this game after a few months of not playing, and after a full night of playing with a Soviet soldier (the last time I played I was an American soldier) I noticed that I had unlocked essentially nothing. I went from the initial rank to barely rank 2 in three hours of play, and had unlocked no upgrades. Remembering that the leveling and unlocks went faster when I first played, I checked my American soldier. Despite having played him for only 2 hours, had many fewer kills and objective captures with him, he was rank 4 with many more ribbons unlocked. Have I mentioned that you need a great deal more experience with every subsequent rank?The game is basically worthless to play without paying at this point. I am entirely for supporting free to play games with microtransactions to get things faster, but not if they make it entirely worthless to play without paying.The game is fun. The bullet mechanics are fun, the realism aspects are fun, the idea is unique, but they have butchered the game by crippling any XP gains."",0"
"8975,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWith the new updates Reto Moto started regional bans. When a game starts banning by region it's the begining of the end. Would not recommend this game. Reason, if you live in a part of the world they don't like, you don't play."",0"
8976,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,Early Access ReviewIt seems like it could be a quality game but i had a serious problem. every button i pressed on my keyboard made me crouch down. this was very annoying and i tried many things to help it but it made the game unplayable.,0
"8977,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWaste of time. Normally you would think the guys with 1000 hours would write the more helpful review, but thats the opposite on this game.  Most of them did their grind when it was easier, they received more credits per mission, more xp, more everything. Simply put, they are out of touch with the new player experience, and it is outright horrible.Rank 1-2 was pretty straight forward, fighting infantry and infantry manned light vehicles. Not too bad, even rather fun. But as soon as you hit rank 3, they throw you in with the sharks. Now you're dealing with tanks. That in of itself would not be bad. However, there isn't any restrictions on the type of tanks you can face at rank 3, so you might be facing heavy tanks vs your first light tank. Why not buy a better tank? Because you have to grind your light tanks before you can.Ok, there is always the AT infantry option right? Wrong. You get the bazooka/german equivalent fairly early if you kill enough people with your grenades. However, killing a tank will not cover the cost of the rockets spent killing it. Fire enough rockets and kill enough tanks, you will end up in the NEGATIVE at the end of the match. The other option is just to be fodder and afk in the forest somewhere to wait out the inevitable defeat. Example, one match I fired 22 rockets, killed 5 tanks(missed a couple of rockets). End of match result is I earned 4k credits, then spent another 12k rebuying the rockets I used.People will say to let the tanks deal with other tanks, that's fine too I suppose, but I already said you may not even have anyone capable of pulling one, have no idea if their tanks are up to the task, or if you will have the sufficient quantity. 3 T34s vs 1 M5 Stuart?Then there is the infantry side. Again, no rank restrictions upon hitting rank 3. So you got your starting rifle, and maybe you bought your factions starting SMG. Then now you have to grind 9 ribbons with your rifle for the BAR, or 5 ribbons with the grease gun to unlock the Thompson. All the while dealing with snipers, OHK Russian anti-tank rifles, MP40s, and the Russian PPsh, and various lmgs like the MG42, which can be fully fired while standing might I add. Insert above tank situations and that is the new player experience.Normally I don't write reviews, harmful or good. If its good I play it, if its bad I move on, but this was so atrociously grindy I had to give a heads up. If you are fine with just messing around a little to kill time and are fine with being fodder, then feel free to give it a try. However if you want to be rewarded for your time, then look elsewhere.Have I mentioned you need to buy ammo for your starting rifle too? Yeah, thought I'd throw that in there. Once you turn your soldier into a driver, or a pilot, there is no returning to regular infantry combat. It isn't like Battlefield or Planetside 2 where you can have 1 guy do everything. Once your soldier specializes, that is it. You have to purchase another soldier, and then start all over again from rank 1. With nothing but you know it, the starting rifle. There is no having your 2nd guy using the stuff from your 1st soldier. Brand new start for everything you wish to do."",0"
"8978,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFirst of all, I just want to say that everyone you see below me is right and totally and absolutely correct.This game has gone so far south, that it has managed to encompasses the globe enough times to reverse the earth rotation from its normal gravitational orbit of east to west, and changed the course to north and south, thereby effectively causing global warming.Okay but seriously though, this game is so terrible, that I cannot literally even begin to describe how bad this game has turned out to be, without literally repeating what has already been said. If you have not yet taken everyone elseâ€™s word for it, then PLEASE at least take mine.I started playing this game last year and to be honest, it was a HECK of a lot of fun. And all the things that people are talking about with play to win wasâ€¦ Wellâ€¦ Frankly not there. And it was great. Skins for your soldiers and extra gun slots or commander perks"

"8982,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game shouldn't be recommended until development team actually makes progress. After playing for several months on this, I can only come up with one conclusion: The development doesn't want your feedback and thinks that they are superior as to what the entire concept should be. Love it or leave it. That's their kind of trust to customers who have paid into this game..."",0"
"8983,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access Reviewso where do i start? First off the game looks great for whatever engine it is running, it is also understandable that the game is in beta/early access and a lot will still be implemented... I am giving this a thumbs down for now since it is far from being finished and the fact that the cons outweight the pros...try the game out. im pretty sure you will love it up until you pass level 3 and/or encounter these issues more and more...Pros :If you are looking for that WWII feel, one where you and your buddies can feel as if you are part of the inglorious bastards, or part of the team of FURY then this game will most likely put you on the right path, it has nice maps and i feel they are made nicely and seem pretty balance where no other team will dominate simply because its better for them starting on whatever side of the map they are...  Sadly that is the only Pro for this game so far...Cons:PAY PAY PAY... although it is possible to get pretty much anything with the ingame currency you will have to force yourself to grind grind and grind some more just to get that upgrade. (note the higher you rank up the more credits you get). like every P2W game anyone with the cash to blow will always out power you. The slow climb to power (weapons and vehicules) will always leave you on a disadvantage...Balance is so far an EHH factor since 7 out of 10 matches i played one team out number the other with tanks and planes, which results to a quick end game, fastest round i played so far from start to finish was 3 mins.Dont expect to be able to upgrade your weapon like you would in todays FPS games, there is no scope attachments or suppressors, but you can upgrade the triggers, barrels and so on (the little things) YOU ARE STUCK WITH IRON SIGHTS!!!! until you unlock the sniper rifle, which you can get once you reached the RECON class, which is some way away and would take anyone some time to get unless you pay with real money. same goes with the upgrades... You will forced to bus the Veteran pack membership if you want to level up faster which costs 2400 gold that you have to pay for with real money and there is no option to buy that much gold so you are forced to buy more gold than you need, which is about 4700 gold for 19.95 Euros below that it is 2200 gold for 9.95 euros...The hit boxes and damage effects is another thing thats messed up at the moment... for example i snuck up behind a tank to place these Anti Tank grenades on it, for some reason the gunner saw me, how? i dont know since the pilot and gunner have a very minimal point of view (dont think Battlefield when i say limited i mean you can look a few degrees to the left and right, and see next to nothing since the scopes you look through is way to dark, makes you wish for night vision) anyway then the gunner jumps out and starts shooting at me, at this point i already places the ATG on him so i ran for cover, as i reach my cover i turn around to see the gunner standing right next to the tank and i watch the tank explode in a massive explosion and i watched the gunner just stand there in the brunt of the explosion with not a care in the world and just kills me with one shot (note i had full health)...Damage, like ive mention above this seems to be off by i dont know how many factors, forget the invinsible tank gunner for a second and lets go to the weapon damage, you start with the standard rilfes of each faction, The US using the M1Grand, Germany  Gewher 43 and the Russians the SVT40... then you get a sniper riles one unscoped and one with a scope (scoped can only be purcashed once you reach RECON CLASS or with REAL MONEY). now damage can be upgraded by upgrading your weapon like the Trigger, Barrel, Sights, Ammo and Internals which is the bolt or spring... I have the russian sniper rifle which is the Mosin-Nagant 1891 upgraded for maximum damage and for some reason it still take more than 2 shots most of the time to kill someone, which others seem to be getting one hit kills by shooting you on the leg while you have full HP... Could be hacks or could be there is something that i am missing? who knows..Objects have rough edges there are countless times where i find my weapon aimed perfectly at someone and clearly nothing in the way of my weapon and ones i shoot POOF invisible wall saves his life... Example i saw a guy proning about 50 meters from me. which is an easy kill, he was looking my way but was busy shooting at someone else, i had a perfcet shot on his head since he was proned and it was the only thing i could see of his body, so i lined up my shot places my sights right on his head and took the shot, and of course invisible wall saves his life. so i line up again to take another shot since he didnt see me yet. i fired, and yup you guessed it invisible wall again, so i move a little to the left *note he is on higher ground so all i can see is his head and it is the only thing i can hit, so standing a little to the left now i took another shot at his head, but instead of killing him (with my maxed out damage upgraded scopeless sniper rifle) all it did was damage him even though i had a pefect shot at his head). He saw me as a result of this shot so i take cover behind a boulder and started to reload my weapon the all of a sudden bang i get hit with a headshot, so im like F**k someone was behind me. buuuut noooo it was the same guy according to the killcam... and this has happened a bunch of time on different matches and maps... latency issues? hacks? unsmooth edges? who knows... There have been an extreme amout of BS deaths that just makes you stop and wonder like WTF HOW? but then you just stop and think the game is still in BETA and there will be issues, but once it happens often you just stop and think â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥T!!! the game is still good though if you have friends to play it with, i wont recommend it if you want to play it alone at the state it is now, you will just spend most of your time wondering how the F**K did he manage to kill me like that or how the F**k did i manage to do that...Jumping in the game is also broken, most of the time the command does not even respond and when it does you will feel as if you are playing Counter Strike with gravity off, you jump high and it takes you a while to get back down, ive gotten a bunch of kills like this, it makes for easy targets...Match Making is also another headache, which results in unbalance like mention above. if you make a squad you are stuck on the squad page, so everytime you want to make a change or an upgrade you will have to leave the squad and make your changes and get reinvited back in... a pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥if you are the squad leader...If you leave a game you have a lock out of a few mins from the looks of it, kind of like in NOSGOTH...All in all the game is good aside for these things which kills the fun to be honest but the game is still Beta and i will stick around to see the finished product, but for now it gets a thumbs down until these issues are resolved.Including the unbalance, this game is reall really really bad when it comes to balance, there are no words for how unbalanced this game it... i fly Russia, and ive never been in a single round where there were more than 3 pilots on my side, worst balance i ever had was 3 pilots vs 11... 11!!! like is i said, there is no balance in this game, one side will always out number you with tanks and planes!!!!To sum it all this is like playing Day Of Defeat/Battlefield... only it is unbalanced because of the P2W factor and because of the issues ive mentioned."",0"

"8986,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewJust going to throw this out there first off, some reviews are actually corret. After reading about a page or two of reviews I decided to try it regardless, thinking it might be a knock-off battlefield 1942.. and it kind of is in some sense. It was fun at first until you reach rank 3 and then it all changes. It turns into a completely Pay 2 Win game. You do not stand a chance if you do not own tanks / planes (Pilots & tank crew men) along with anti-tank / vehicle weapons. Maybe it was just me trying to stay loyal and play with only my US troop when Germany is clearly stacked and gets a lot more benefits in the war such as two spawning points, more lives, and their guns seem slightly better in general.All in all I give this game a 2/5.It has / had a lot of potential but as most F2P FPS games it falls on P2W in the end.. or really in the near start.

The game punishes you at every step of the way for playing the game. They do this by requiring you to level everything you own in order to unlock better, flat-out, straight up, better equipment and weapons. It gets worse, they go further by requiring you to pay upkeep costs for your weapons, the mods on your weapons and the ammo you fire. Modded weapons are required and become unreasonably expensive to maintain. However, if you pay premium you may use them without any draw backs.  Weapons themselves are expensive and nearly impossible to obtain. Unless, you pay money or put in hundreds of hours to grind out the required levels.

"9007,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Heroes & Generals had potential, but had to mess it up with greed and apathy. This game had so much potential to be a good game, in fact it was a good game before these updates messed up EVERYTHING. The updates ruined the German faction to the point that any game with the Germans is a near certain loss, they don't listen to community requests and go on their own to buff things making them OP or nerfing the hell out of items whcih devalues the time put in that endless grind to get any item in this game. It took around the 60 hour mark to actually get a bare sniper rifle for my infantry which needs an extra 30 hours to get the essential attachments to be any use in matches. Moving to gameplay, it used to be pretty fun with games having an even match that last a considerable amount of time compared to the current match stomps, where you only see paratroopers and people sneaking past the lines to steal the obj while the other team goes for their base. I have seen countless times where our or the enemy team, after a long battle capturing the objective, getting their point capture by those paratroopers that drop in every minute right before the point was secured. Moving past that, infantry destroys tanks which makes them obsolete, there's barely any reason to play recon since everything is speeden up from the constant stream of crappy updates, and they ban many people who hadn't even done anything, there's too much to list and it makes this game incredibly boring as well as tilting. I can't find any reason why you would play this game in it's current state unless you want to waste time or money (which I might add is completely pay-to-win since the most OP weapons are sitting on top of a hefty grind or a pretty penny). This game is horribly executing and since the developer don't care of the popular reception, will continually to dig a grave for this game."",0"
"9008,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""I've put many months into this game both here on Steam and on the browser variant back before they had a steam option, and I won't lie. This game was (key word there *was* ) pretty decent. I enjoyed the strengths each faction posessed, how each fight was based upon the steadfast response of the generals and how quickly the soldiers (players) could react to a confrontation especially in a 3-front war zone. battles would last many hours, and you'd make a ton of money in the war mode. Tanks were difficult to deal with due to the very few ways you could actually take care of it, planes could change the outcome of a war with a well-placed/timed bomb, snipers consistently moved after kills and kept enemy troops on high alert. And the two-front spawn protection (spawning on the point or if it was being taken you spawn around the outer edges, all of which with an invisibility protection until your first shot/20 feet movement.) helped keep the battles continuous and fairly balanced even in a tough situation when outnumbered or people attempting to spawn trap instead of capping the point...But then came the plague that is Reto as they do with every patch """"in the name of fun. Originally all three factions were to get their own Anti Tank Rifles, this was a highlight for me! I love the idea of having a fair shot as a soldier to fight armor if you're smart about where you put your shots... Well.. that was 2 years ago or just about at this point. The only faction of those 3 to get an AT rifle is the russians with PTRD's. Things then began to steadily become more... aggrivatingly skewed, from """"fixing"""" LMG's to have severe conical spread almost right out of the barrel, to their recent changes that force players to purchase generals instead of career changing to them [unless that's just a bug but i'm not entirely sure of that]... The Long Version The War [Generals] tab gives the losing factions an """"underdog"""" bonsus... or well, it's supposed to. In the past few months the """"bonus"""" has become forever hooked to the U.S.S.R. [this most recent being a 67% bonus to their faction even when they were in first place for the last several days.]Sure, perhaps it's just a glitch in the scripting i'll accept that. It's just a buffer afterall, don't get much out of war except better income for your efforts... But then come the more notable skews.The most notorious being the Yak-9's. Unload multiple clips of an AA gun or P38 / BF 109 into it, it remains alive. Yet get shot by it as a P-38 or BF-109, and you're chopped down in seconds, and its bombs reach several meters further than either of the other two planes (by almost 30 feet).The second being the simple fact that the Russian playerbase are rather arrogant and extensively hate-based against anyone who doesn't use the Russian faction, and will enter others' factions just to hate on them. This ends up causing a domino effect which gets the butt-hurt individuals in the other factions to start going around doing the same, which ends up being a giant rage-fest instead of gaming.Third one being the skew in AT methods... While this has recently been """"fixed"""" (i use the term loosely) by giving the U.S sticky-grenades and (much later) the Lawn-dart grenades for the Germans, the U.S.S.R have RPG grenades, once again having had them far longer than any other faction and giving them extensive bonuses due to the fact that they can break through near triple the amount of armor compared to the others. (3 stickies to kill a light tank, 2 RPG-43's to kill a medium... 4 lawn darts to kill a light. Lawn darts being far more expensive than the other two.)Paratroopers primarily based on the U.S get a carbine, which wouldn't be extensively agitating if it wasn't for the fact it can get so ridiculously powerful and accurate at range that it puts the K98, Mosin and M1903 to shame. [and FYI, Reto... Bowl shaped parachutes WERE NOT CONTROLLABLE IN WW2. Having someone able to avoid quad-50 cal AA gun fire just by spazzing A and D rapidly is stupidly aggrivating, especially when 6 paratroopers are dropping on one point and can land on the *same roof* when dropping from almost 600+ meters seperation on dropping from the plane.]Then comes the most recent rage. The pontoon-vehicle introduction. getting those vehicles was awesome. don't get me wrong. But to suddenly have Russia with the *only* water-capable tank, AND the *only* water-capable jeep that can use an MG mount on it, is far from showing a desire for """"fun"""" in the game as you so callously flaunt at our faces. Germans and U.S forces were known to use snorkels on their tanks for a reason.The most disgusting thing they've done though, is the spawn change. Now you end up being spawn trapped by paratroopers and tanks more than you do getting shot by actual combatants. Not only this, but if you lose the point while you're fighting *THEY TAKE YOUR GUN AWAY* because you're suddenly in an enemy spawn zone! This leaves you completely incapable of guarding yourself while you try to get away! GIVING them a free kill! On top of this, due to the spawns being pre-determined in 2-3 locations *per mark* you will not be able to avoid spawn killers. The moment you're spotted, you're screwed. ALSO, when you end up being at your last point, you end up getting spawned several hundred yards away! So if you're the only one left defending (which happens alot) You end up running over there just to realize you're too late.In recent updates their camera has been freaking out extensively, primarily when prone on a hill or small incline/descent. This leads to your character looking like it's jerking off extensively, especially when you're trying to aim, which ends with death to you due to being unable to even fire unless you stand or crouch.TLDR for those who can't read a player's rant aka The Short Version...: 1) Underdog bonus is bugged to the Russian's benefit and has been for several months... could just be a bug, doubt it though.2) Russian players are irritating rats who don't like to lose and will enter others' factions just to rage at them in the war chats [which leads to flame wars in the chats in various languages on all 3 factions AND in support chat]3) AT weaponry is extensively out-performed where it actually counts. Russians seem to be in the lead as far as damage capability.)4) Paratroopers, especially U.S, are extensively abused to spawn kill using their M2 Carbines since they only use 5 equip slots.5) water-capable vehicles are awesome! Russia having the only water-capable tank AND jeep able to carry a gun? Not so much6) Spawn change SUCKS BALLS, and has destroyed the ability of defending troops to actually do much on the matter.7) laying/going prone on a hill is a BAD IDEA. Your camera spazzes out, and they refuse to listen when you send in a ticket about these issues. even when given video evidence of it happening on anything less than flat ground. (recent patch has """"fixed"""" this issue.)Final outcomeGame: 5/5Developers: -2/5You want a game to pass the time, this'll work. Everything is acquirable free of charge, even premium time! It's just a very long grind. But be warned YOU WILL RAGE at some point for one reason or another. Don't play war without a squad of at least 3 people. And don't expect a team to work as a team.Their help desk, ticket support and reporting system are crap as well. Don't expect help when you need it, and don't expect much to happen when someone starts flipping off in the support channel/faction chats/global chats and so forth. At least they fixed the player search function next to the chat to actually see all the players in the chat, albeit it resets your search when someone new enters, which makes it just as worthless as it was. So don't expect to be able to block/ignore them unless you see them in-game.Update 11/27/2017: No differences. Still broken bias."",0"

Good luck even geting out of the base unless you pay real money to buy ranged anti tank weapons.

THis of course is all expected in open-beta games, so I was rather suprised to find the game launched a few days ago even through a lot of these problems still remain and my friend wasn't able to join a match. Hopefully one day the game will be good but not quite yet."",0"
"9022,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""I played the game about an year ago and stopped because of the horrible optimization (could have been just my computer back then), small player count and huge unbearable grinding, came back to the same, altho a bit better performance, mass amounts more of grinding and an upped limit of players (was 16, is now 20 I believe).Still not worth my time to be honest, I'd rather prefer Red Orchestra 2 at 20 bucks with it's 32v32 maps and at least somewhat bareable grinding."",0"

"9026,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewFirst off, this game is HEAVILY pay to win!With that said, the gameplay is fun, the controls are responsive and the assault team / generals system works well. That's about all the good stuff I have to say about this game.Everything that can be bought in game (and I mean EVERYTHING) is absurdly expensive, most of the maps are god awful, the battles are majorly unbalanced and I have noticed the odd issue with net code (almost as bad as it is in Battlefield 4, but not quite). So, imagine this. You join a battle, but the enemy team has tanks. Well you can just get your own tank right? Nope, once unlocking that it costs over 20k credits to get the basic tank, and that doesn't even have a cannon. So, just give your soldier an AT weapon? Nope, again, it costs a ridiculous amount of credits.So quite often you end up going against heavy armour and cant do anything else about it. Sure you get the odd AT weapon that spawns on the map, but they spawn in the most stupid places, like out in the open for example.Most of the maps are so open it's not even funny. They all seem to favour either snipers or vehicles, which you'll be grinding for hours and hours before you get either one of them, oh my bad, you can always pay REAL MONEY to get them early. So if you can get past the crappy maps and the unbalanced teams, there's the people who have actually paid into the game. You then have to deal with people with one shot kill weapons, better vehicles and a certain badge that gives you more HP. There's probably a lot more stuff you can buy to **** over people who aren't dim-witted enough to give this piece of trash they call a game any money, but honestly I gave up at that point.Conclusion:Don't bother with this unless you like unbalanced games and having to pay real money to get anywhere or having to pay to have fun. Like BrazillianSoldier said in his review (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brazilian_Soldier/recommended/227940/), buy Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2. It's very similar to this, only you pay for it once and you have the whole game, no having to deal with and damn pay to win crap."",0"
"9027,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAfter playing a handful of games H&G starts off really interesting and really cool. The nastalgia of playing a WW2 game is the main driving force of this though, and once that wears off you start to see the uglier parts of the game.Overall I'd give this game a 6/10, although I can't really recommend it, either as a shooter game or a world war 2 experience.The game falls short in portraying the weapons and items accurately, instead choosing to make weapons stronger/better than others simply based on when you unlock them. I played a match where my gweher rifle got wrecked by a guy running around with a 1911 pistol. Why? Simply because it is hard to unlock the 1911 pistol and the gweher is the starting weapon.The game falls into some seriously bad free to play pitfalls. It is hard to progress without spending money and players that do spend money have some significant advantages over the free to play crowd. F2P players are locked out of a perk and progress much slower. Normally not a huge deal, but the later tier weaponry is so much better than the starting gear that you'll feel the punishment for sure. Especially when tanks and planes show up.Some other minor issues:The graphics are lacklusterThe spawning system is obnoxiousShooting is challengingF2P model hinders the overall experienceGuns are unbalanced (later game guns are uncontestedly better than earlier guns, no reason to use M1G over springfield).Some positives that I love about the game:The maps are really coolThe big scale battles feel epicShooting is challengingProgression system and unlocking careers for soldiersTanks, planes, all things WW2 (I love WW2).Overall if you are looking for a cool WW2 game this is a cool little game and will satisfy in all the right places. If you are looking for a shooter game to sink a ton of time into (that is based in the past) though, maybe try Red Orchestra or wait for Battlefield 1. "",0"

But I was just get continuosly killed as soon as entering the brawl. While I'm surely not a killer machine, in other similar games I at least am able to kill other players here the feeling was that my relatively high ping (250 to 500) was punishing me very unfairly. The developer said ping shouldn't be such an issue but I can't find another explanation. Note I even tried the one day premium account to see if the problem was there, but not luck even here. Another very disappointing thing about this game it is way too expensive if you try to accellarate your way to more advanced skills and weapons. Again I don't mind to go premium as I don't have the time to grind for ever. I do it in other games and the rewards are worth it. Not here sadly.

These are very easy to flank, but guess what, as a new player, you have absolutely nothing to damage it with!!! I remember when I started out, I chased a panther for 15 minutes in hopes the comander would stick his head out so I could blow it off, but he didnt. I ended up diying because his coaxal machine gun clipped me and send me fliying into the air, because, just like every other terrible fps with this """"feature"""", momentum doesnt transfer over to you from the object you stand on.- Snipers with onehit kill rifles will go in cqc, camp the attic of a building, and kill everyone that attempts to shoot them- they call your soldiers """"heroes"""", but your """"hero"""" couldn't do the 50m dash for his life. The pu$$y can't even sprint across a road half the timethought about playing as a sniper then? Want that one-hit sweetness?- too â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad, the snipers are 2 hit kills (unless to the head, which is almost impossible when theyre moving) by default. To get the sniper to a one-hit to the torso, you need another 30 hours of grinding to get the credits to purchase the stuff you need, and another 10 hours on top of that to finish the """"ribbons"""" that unlock the parts for purchasing- the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sniper doesnt even come with a scope by default. you need to buy it separatly! Also, the scope alone costs as much as the gun itself !!! (a 3.5x that is) if you want a higher magnification get ready for a 20 hour grind, just for the scope- An entire team of snipers will auto win the game, they will kill you long before you can travel from the base to the objective- really the only class worth playing if you don't feel like constantly going for the objectivefeel like playing airborn?- I'll admit this is a pretty cool class, you actually jump from an airplane and land where you want- pray to god that some tryhard pilot doesnt shoot you out of the sky before you land. These guys make me ragefeel like playing as tank crew?- prepare for the longest grind in your life- Rambo's will ruin your day. Trust me. Getting Rambo'd is extremely infuriating, however tankers deserver this since the tanks in this game have rediculous reload times on their cannons.- prepare to be sniped from across the map by another near invisible tank How about as an airman?- Not a bad idea actually. Hard to learn but rewarding.- borderline broken class. their bombs destroy everything within a 15 meter radius and they magically regenerate quickly- almost always top of the leaderboards, they earn a ton of points- Because the devs don't play anything but airplanes (sarcasm) , they don't put a DECENT limit to how many max airplanes can be there at one time, then you get a bunch of tier 3 airplanes completely ruining the match (also, suicide bombing an airplane does absolutely no damage for some reason(feel like playing as a general?- might as well not, it's basically a stupid board game, you don't even fight, you just """"move forces"""" across a map of europenew player expirience in general :- not getting a single kill in a match because the iron sights on the starting weapons are horrible- getting killed by heavy vehicles you can't even scratch- walking simulator. You arent provided basic transport, you have to buy it, until then, you are stuck with1- going with another player that has transport (assuming there even is one) and entrusting your fate to their driving skills, but i wouldn't do that (I'll explain later)2- getting a bike or a civilian truck. Both are faster than walking but slow enough that you can be easily sniped blindfolded from hundred yards away.3- walking simulator 2018 (HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!)- the physics will make you laugh1- getting shot by a plane will kill you and send you 100 feet into the air2- getting shot by a tank will kill you and send you 100 feet backwards3- getting hit by a mine will kill you and send you 100 feet in a random direction4- getting hit by a car will kill you and send you 100 feet at a 45degree angle upwards5- when you finally do get a hold of your very first jeep or motorcycle, you will learn the horrors of driving. You think you can go fast just because you have a motorbike? well .... you should be able to ... but in this game, there are so many micro bumps in the map that going at them high speeds will send you .... flying.... and will turn your vehicle in an unpredictable direction ... and in the 1.5 seconds it takes you to """"switch gears"""" and go from 0 to """"barely moving"""", your head will be long blown off.- some of the longest grinds i've ever seen. Honestly, this is almost as bad as SW battlefront 2, the only reason people tolerate this is because it's been here first. Apparently at one point the devs doubled the price of everything....- poor game optimization. Though this has been worked on in some patches, it's still pretty bad- the netcode does this stupid linear extrapolation stuff. basically, if the enemy moves side to side quickly, they will move furthar than they actually did, then they will teleport back to where they are on the server. You can imagine this throws your aim off.tl"

Airplanes are terrible to control properly and the physics of the game driving cars and tanks around is just terrible. Some of the weapons they add to the game makes no sense. The Russians are given a rifle that can pick out light armour tanks like nothing.The UI has become even worse then what it was before. There is now layer uppon layer with chat windows, Squad information and all other kinds of nonsense making you feel lost if you where new to the game. Introducing friends to this game takes them about an full hour just understanding the basics. And last but not least. Micro transaction and a terrible grind to get access to new gear. The XP grind is so slow if you do not pay for membership. For the amount of money these guys are making for this game, progress and quality should be moving along quicker then this."",0"

"9061,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access Reviewâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game. about half a year ago i loved this game, but since then, it has been updated and it has been ruined! 1: the developers has changed the maximum hp, well in theory this can be a good idea, it has ruined the game! you die in an instant, you can get oneshot with one of the base rifles, in the torso! you have under half the maximum hp as before! you get killed no matter what under a second i am not joking! 2: there is no main menu! you can either quit the game completely or log out, only to to be stuck in the loadout section without the ability change loadout or customize character because the game thinks your in a match! 3: no more casual domination! itÂ´s been removed! you can no longer enter matches with low rank players without there being tanks, planes or overpowered weapons! you die! you just die! 4: fps isâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when i played the game (when it was good) it had proper fps, but now itÂ´sâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game has been RUINED! what happened?"",0"

"9064,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""I have never written a Review yet ... and the Company who made this game just made me get this much out of my comfort zone.Recently they  increased the Cost of acquiring In-Game-Content with In-Game-Nonbuyable-Currency while at the same time reportedly nerfed the Income-Rate of mentioned Currency. (mind you, i am NOT talking about IRL-Buyable-Currency, a.k.a. """"Gold"""")So i have not played for some time, had a hard time grinding enough of that nonbuyable currency to buy the next soldiertype and now after login they are again unreachable until i have grinded some more. This kind of price-change has already happened to me at least once and never was mentioned beforehand. So as a last measure i started to write this and after having sent this comment i will uninstall this game.Let this be a warning to you, possible new player. If it happens to you: Told you so!

"9066,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Ok, this is my honest review. Its not a bad game. Its not my favorite game. But I had playing the game here and there. I suckI suck alot. The Vet thing provides a lare avdange when I got back. But this didn't stop me from reconizing some magor problems. Most games are land slides. Which means you straight up win or you horrible lose. Every so often you have a close game. Its very rare. Such as finding a speck in the sand type of rare. My first game had 5 Fighter/Bombers on the enemy team. If you so much had stepped outside you die. If not by planes. It was by tanks. All I have are 2 mines and 4 nades. If I go anywhere near a tank, it kills me, crew spots me, moves, is being protected, or drives while I am chasing it to but that AT mine down infront of it. I rarly find any RPGs or Panzerfaust. I have very few momments of pure happyness in this game. Finally catch a tank. MG42 support kill 10 peaple, I had stole a MG Bike while playing Russians. Mining the entire house waited for a while, enemy tried to cap and I blew them sky high. Those momment where all in bad games. The main problem for me is credits. Money is scarce. Equiment cost a little too much. 29,500 for a wrench while I have a soviet vehicle which I constaly crash. Well It would be a good buy, if only I got it on my American tank crew man too. Also the cost to turn them into a tanker is costly. 114,000. That must be one hell of a tank I am getting if I am paying that much. Also Boculars which (Could) be useful are 25,000. RPG cost around 165,000 Which suck even more.Vet provides a advatage that kills off most Free to Plays like myself. They get 1 more equiemet slot and 1 more skill slot. This kinda sucks for me. So If you don't mind. Fix your MM, Fix your prices. But hey Its just me I guess. Have a lovely day. I not going to say I hate the game. But they do still need to fix it."",0"
9067,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,Sad kinda game. Very grindy. Seems like pay to win a lot to me. Waiting to get into battles is about 2 minutes. Not counting the queues untill finding a game. Good graphics on th eplus side. In the end a MEH kinda game.,0
"9068,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""The games was kinda fun at the start, but when i started encountering higher level people with maxed-out weapons and vehicles, that's when things got out of hand. Its either you grind for hours to get a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ weapon or just win games with microtransactions. Its bad game design and developers should feel bad. The fun part of the game is completely ruined by an inbalanced system."",0"
"9069,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Sure, it can be fun. And it's free to play.But when it's play to play, then it's not so good. It would be fine if it weren't so ingrained into the game. You have to have veteren membership to even have an equipment slot. And by the way, that membership can in no way be permanent. So you have to continue to give them money, or you can't play the game like you SHOULD be able too.Also, I would recomend that the developers make it so that your guns and unlocks TRANSFER between characters, but thats just me.Unless you have a stupid amount of money, or you just really like WW2 multiplayer shooters, then I wouldn't recomend this game to you 100%.It's a very solid WW2 shooter, with massive battles and epic momments that I really enjoyed. But its pay to even play status makes it seem to want to exclude many people who simply don't have the cash to have everything the game can offer.I'm okay with a bit of microtransactions, but when their everywhere, it's very hard to ignore. I'd say tone it down a notch.This is all I have to say."",0"
"9070,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""For some reasons, first levels, you are matched with low level players and there are no vehicles. It's pure soldier fights. Then you reach level 5 (or something like that) and suddently there are vehicles everywhere, you are matched with very high players and the game suddendly become really uninteresting and annoying. I remember my first game with vehicles. No one had weapons to kill said vehicles in my team for simple reason that we were all too low level to have unlocked the weapons required to fight against vehicles. So we spent the game trying to avoid the unkillable armored vehicle of enemy team. Dont even need to mention that we lost because their armored vehicle was camping our spawn.The second game I joined: I spawned, started to run for 10 sec and suddently a plane dive on me and kill me... Spawn again, another plane dive on me and kill me... planes camping our spawn...The third game? There was no third game with vehicles. I uninstalled. I had fun til I reached the required level to have vehicles in my game which mean approximatively 10-15 games without vehicles. Then it was just a spawn camping boring fest.The decent items/weapons, you have to pay for them. This game is exactly what you can expect from greedy developers.  I hate to say it but I tried Battlefield 1 (even if I promised myself to never ever play this franchise because the last good BF game was BF2 and all games after it were just money grabbing pile of poop)... Well you want a good war game? Battlefield 1 is way better than previous BF games and honestly, the balance between weapons and vehicles was really good. I never felt overwhelmed by vehicles. Yes they are annoying but not unstoppable. If you want to invest few bucks, get BF1 and have some fun worth your money. Avoid Heroes and generals at all cost. You'll just waste your money into it.The only thing that was interesting in H&G was the """"general"""" part of the game which is not open to new players. The best players are generals and they can take decisions on Europe map to decide where they are sending their soldiers. Goal of each side is to conquer all Europe. And then ordinary soldiers will fight for objective decided by their generals. Every win is a territory captured on the map. It's really interesting idea honestly. A part of the game is a kind of RTS and the other is FPS. But yeah, again, the greedy devs are making this game absolutely awful and unbalanced to play. Sadly. Too bad for them! Go get BF1 "
"9071,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIts a good game but it has alot of issues, mostly with balance. Get it if you like world of tanks because thats all you will get form it, every battle tanks vs infantry."",0"
"9072,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Ive played on 2 accounts (Including this one). This game is addicive but the spawn points and spawnkilling is so bad. Not the mention the teams are super unbalanced. Its either you get super good teammates (rare) or you get xbox 360 controller players that are so bad, maybe even be bots. The recoil for weapons are terrible, but the sway of the weapons are even worse. I would suggest playing this but its so messed up that its not even worth your time."",0"
9073,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,I've played this game for a long time. This game has slowly become grindier and grindier. The devs were good of thought but they became greedy with prices. You used to get a base rifle and gernades with all three class and unlock the smg and bazookas fairly early on and now you start with one faction and only the base rifle.In short was good and become too grindy. They keep taking things away from players and raise level requirements over time.,0
"9074,Heroes & Generals,,""PAY TO WIN [written @ 33 ingame hours]Changed from negative to positive because I REALLY like this game. It really reminds me of the good old Wolfenstein ET days. A WWII shooter that doesn't take itself to seriously. Sadly this game is pay2win but it's not horrific. You can earn ALMOST everything with just playing but you will need to sink in hundreds of hours and you WILL lose lots of 1v1's just because the other dude has a better gun in the meantime. What makes a gun better? More damage and more bullets in the magazine for me but that depends on who you ask. At around 50 hours of play I can unlock the same so than we're even with that. But theres tanks, planes etc. You will be a huge disadvantage for a long long time. Plus you can't buy the 2nd passive without spending IRL money. But it also comes with some positives.Over time your weapons will get damaged and you'll need to repair them. It's not super expensive, but grenades are VERY expensive. If you spam them you can easily make a negative income. IMO this is a good thing, less nade spam like in COD and Battlefield.Overal it feels a lot like Wolfestein ET to me, which for me is good. There's a only a handful of small maps sadly, but they are made very well. I wish they had a SDK like WOLFET had, so people could make more maps, that's really what this game needs imo, more small maps. It got a lot of big maps for tanks and stuff, but ultimately that's a huge battle of which team has the most 1000 hour players and or payers (pay 2 win) and are therefore less fun to me. Now you can have fun being free2play but a lot less. This game kinda requires you to have a subscription running in order to make a little money.I hope they go for a new business model with this or a new game because this model really upset most people. The only reason I stick is because it reminds me a lot of WOLFET my favorite shooter like ever. It's not the same, but it gives me the same dopamine rush so it works for me. I really wish they made it less grindy and find another way to monitize so it doesn't put people off.Also this game is NOT full with sweaty try hards so casual players got a decent chance at this imo. As a casual myself. Of course sometimes there are a few sweaty try hards who annihilate you, but that's it."",1"

"9079,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFun for awhile then just tedium and dissapointment. Every patch and update breaks more then it fixes and the Devs seem more intent on gougeing player base of time and money with new bells and whitsles then fixing things.

Might get better might not but don't spend any of your hard earned money on the game and you may get some amount of fun out of it for a time, assumeing the servers work anyway.Also virus's is a thing they add some patches and updates...just sayin.Recently added mobile AA to help with the plane dickery, so IS gettering better.

"9083,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game has been in beta for over 3 years. Recently they just did a patch that made everyone's previous grind worth nothing, and put a paywall up to play the generals portion of the game. So they made the generals portion of the game unaccessable to the players, and the FPS portion of the game is ABSOLUTELY HORENDOUS. There are 6 FPS maps. 6. In 3 years of open beta, they have managed to design 6 extremely buggy maps. The equipment's pretty imbalanced towards the allies. They actually have Shermans beating up Panzer IVs. The vehicles aren't even upgradable. There's planes but each side has 1 plane and they're really glitchy.You're better off anywhere else for an FPS game, and you're better off anywhere else for strategy game. It was kinda cool before the last patch because at least the common player could play in the strategy game and then go and influence the battle in FPS, but now you can't play the strategy game and the FPS has always sucked, so just playing this for the FPS is a dumb idea."",0"
"9084,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWell I've clocked a lot of this game... Got really annoyed after about 3 weeks - 2 months of playing it and decided it wasn't worth my time. Came back to the game hoping it might be different, only to realize its even more money driven than before. If you want my honest opinion. Don't bother. You'll probably drop a significant amount of money (excess of $20) to get anything good or fun. And by that point you mine as well have bought a different game cause the graphics and play experience aren't worth any dollar amount (in my opinion). For that reason have to give the game a 2/10Reasons:-Developers aren't interested in gameplay (you have to buy bullets with your hard earned in game points or gold (bought with actual money))-Gameplay is medicore for a FPS (Red Orchistra or almost anything else looks cooler)-Time required to earn anything is too much for the grind to be fun (and someone else could just drop money and beat you there)-Having better equipment is a HUGE advantage... If you're looking for a good WW2 game, get Comapny of Heroes 2 or something. But don't waste your time with this game. If you do want to check it out and try it, download it and play a little ( It is free to start). But don't invest any money cause you'll be disappointed you did after about 5-10 hours."",0"

In the most recent update, they decided to take that scope away from me. You now have to buy the ''recon'' class to be able to use the scope, which I've already owned by giving them REAL money. You could/can buy that very same rifle for a much more reasonble price/grind. I am now stuck with a rifle that costed me alot more than it would have if I'd purchased it today.. (Scopeless)This so called ''recon'' class costs 20â‚¬. I am not buying something i've already owned.I am very disappointed with how the developers skrewed me over like this. They sell something to you, takes it away, repackage it in a different form, then sells it again for a much higher price... The greed is strong with this one.

With every single one, the game got worse and worse. Constantly messing up with the stats of vehicles and weapons just got ridiculous. Even though the developers claimed they wanted to have each faction different sort of gear, good and bad, they started to mess things up so in the end it doesnt really matter what side you are playing, its the same.The worst thing is that this game became PAY TO WIN. So if you are not willing to sink hundreds of dollars into a computer game, dont install it. After the last update the prices went triple and possibility to earn credits in game was reduced by half. Another funny thing is that the developers claim there is """"5 million players"""" Well there is at MAX 10 thousand online every time, so i guess the total amount of active players cant be higher than 100k..which is  1/50 of what they claimTo conclude it, it gets worse and worse with every update.

"9099,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI did recommend it, but now I donÂ´t recommend this game to nobody.Seems like 80% of the people playing uses hacks, and trust me, they will destroy your experience.ItÂ´s a shame that such company doesn't seems to invest enough in protecting this game from hacks.If you donÂ´t trust me, start playing and take a look on how many impossible circumstances other players will kill you.Take a look at Youtube, you'll find an immense number of hacks for it.Would like to receive my money back if possible, because itÂ´s very unfair waste it this way."",0"
"9100,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""The game devs awkwardly try to balance realism with an arcade-style shooter, and the result is a game which while fun initially has increasingly strayed from anything that could be considered enjoyable. This is not helped by the fact that most of their design decisions seem to be based around making as much money as possible, a not uncommon reality with free to play games. Rather than fix bugs or ridiculous game mechanics (like people being able to jump off of speeding motorcycles and accurately shoot a bazooka within the span of two seconds, or the ability to teleport into and out of vehicles, dodging bullets in the process) they simply try to add more customization, more guns, more ribbons - fluff that adds no value to the game but lines their pockets with cash. That, and making the amount of time it takes to grind to get good weapons ever longer, an effort to encourage people to spend money on ribbon boosters and veteran membership.This game's simply becoming their cash cow. If you want to find a fun World War II shooter it's best to look elsewhere, rather than braving the months it would take to grind up to a reasonable level to be competitive in this one."",0"
"9101,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewActual for V-buildOk i will try to summ up things:Wouldn't suggest it to anyone because of atrocious grinding and poor economy. Imbalanced FPS and RTS part being almost broken.Used to be a good game at closed beta but then dev team went full retard and way too greedy.So in generally speaking it's P2W at its finest. Some people may tell you that it's pay to skip grind but its just a half of the truth. First of all because if you will try to grind for something decent to be on the same lvl with guys beating you like grinding for weapon or badge it will take you days and even month for some stuff.Just one example to show you the atrociusness of grinding:""""As it stands, it's now roughly 1706 hours of continuous biking to run through the Physical training badge. (at a rate of roughly 1200 per hour, I'm sure someone has a more accurate value.) 71 days, specifically. Bronze is 5.8 hours (reasonable). Silver is 105 hours, or 4.5 days (that's pretty ridiculous). """"If you buy stuff with gold you can get machinegun or heavy tank instantly. Nuff said.Some people may say but you still have to grind ribbon to modify your weapon like making an ohk rifle. Yup but with gold you can boost your progress like x2 or something like that and it still take an f2p player month to get something decent(remember my example) moreover you have to maintean  your weapon and  most likely you will went broke with most of weapons but if someone buying gold or premium he will be able to keep his weapon which for example can oneshot people but your gun needs 2 shots to kill anyone.This pretty sums up the game.The game could be good BF clone for """"poor"""" people but instead of it it tries to squeeze all your money like an angry mobster.Moreover the game have been Beta for years. And with such atrocious grind and prices it's obvious that devs use Beta as a lame excuse to avoid responsibility.For RTS i will just give you this link:http://forum.heroesandgenerals.com/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=43625Conclusion- bareable for free till you reach lvl3 but I wouldn't suggest anyone ever spent even a penny into this one. Just buy yourself BF or GTA V."",0"
"9102,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""This game is unbalanced, broken, and dying. Tanks are worthless and unplayable due to the incredibly overpowered Anti Tank, Recon is worthless after the new map update, Planes are worthless due to repairs and costs, infantry has a worthless matchmaking system, and above all the client is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing broken.

To enjoy this game you have to grind or pay. I have put 806 hours into this game (biggest mistake ever) and I still don't have everything I would ideally want. The thing which is sad about this game is that as a concept it had so much potential and I think for the most part that is why I put so many hours into the game just because I always thought at some point this game might get better but now after all these years I can't say the game is worth the time. And yes, I know someone will end up saying itâ€™s """"Free to Play"""" the only thing I can say to that is it is not you pay for the stuff you want with money or time, I made the stupid decision.I don't want to give the game a rating or anything but I hope this helps."",0"

Just recently did I move to the Steam version.""""Great servers in great locations all over the world"""" is the biggest frikkin joke of the 21st century. At an average ping of 63ms, you will be subject to lag like you were playing with 500ms ping. I wish I was exaggerating, but the delay really does range anywhere from a quarter of a second to a second and a half, two seconds. The more likely answer is that the servers are being operated out of tin cans in Somalia.The game tries to make a selling point of massive battlefields with tons of players, when really you're lucky if you get 20v20. I mean come on. That's just barely better than the typical 16v16 on a console. This isnt a console game.The economy is HORRIBLY steep.Repair and rearm costs will put you out in the streets, and a bolt action rifle from WWI costs you as much as a medium tank.The hitboxes are buggy and suffer from horrible hit detection, much like Battlefield 4 does, however, this game doesnt have nearly the amount of calculations per second to handle that BF4 does. Even when the game detects that you hit someone, it doesnt always detect that you did damage. I've had instances of five confirmed torso hits on a player before with the M1 Garand until he died"
"9106,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you enjoy playing a game against a ton of aimbots, getting shot through walls, and getting one in 30 battles that you might not encounter an aimbot and actually have fun, then this is the game for you.

"9107,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Waste of 15.3 hours, In current state. Would not recommend.Things wrong with game:- Unbalanced gameplay between teams. US VERY underpowerd some of the worst guns in the game (especialy at the begining. Be better off beating someone to death with a shovel and then taking their gun.- Poor melee mechanics and hit detection. (I understand that hit mechanics may be difficult to impliment properly but this is the worst I have seen melee in a game.)- Very poor upgrade system due to everything needing upkeep and being absurdly expensive to buy with in game cash.- You will strain your eyes trying to see what pixels you are looking at through your sights. Only to be killed 3 sec after you figure out what it is, by someone who is more than likely using a magnifying glass taped over his screen.- Good luck when you get to the level where you can start fighting tanks you will struggle to go anywhere as tank damaging explosives are quite rare on 90% of the maps.- Most annoying thing is that death is near instant yet it will take you 1 min to get back to the fight. And thats if you have a jeep. If you are walking you might as well leave the fight then, because you finally get back to the fight only to die 2 seconds in and have to do it all over again.- Lastly the time it takes games to finish. Some games I have been in have lasted over an hour... of course not after waiting 10 min for the game to find a match for you. A solid 3 hrs of the 15 Ive played have been sitting at my computer playing on my phone while waiting for the next open spot in a game.Things I would do to fix the issue:- While the slight sight sway on the guns is more realistic, reduce it.- Slightly increase zoom on iron sights. Small difference but it can help reduce frustration by a good amount for new players.- Make melee do more damage to counter the lack of hitting or increase the range that melee can hit.- Add more rocket boxes but reduce their per shot damage and blast radius.- Reduce spawn time for spawning at vehicles... 30 seconds+ is too long.- Allow rewards at a reduced rate for people who leave early. Most people do not have the time to sit through such long games. - Remove upkeep required on guns/equipment or lower the price of buying new equip/characters.I hope this review could be of some use. As for me, I will not be comming back to the game. As of posting this the game has been uninstalled. I do however not want your game to fail. I do understand the amount of work put into games like this. I also know that you have to make money while doing it, so I understand why everything is so pricy. Face it, its new players that spend the most money not the Vets, if no new players play the game more then 1 time then you wont make any money at all. Its a fine line and Im sorry but I think you are currently on the wrong side."",0"
"9108,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""This game had so much potential. I used to love this game back when it was optimized decently well and there were little to no problems.

I spent hours trying to fix problems just to make it playable.I spent hours fixing it's black screen glitch then after that i spent another few hours fixing it's resolution bar missing glitch then after that I spent hours fixing the login glitch.

Because as I had stopped playing for a while, things changed, and not for the better. Now the devs are making it almost impossible for you to play without ripping your hair out because of grind, now they've changed so many things in favor of veterans and p2w players. And that's not where it ends either. The reporting system does absolutely nothing now. And because of this the game is now riddled with aimbot and other trash hacks like those.

"9116,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""This game is absolute garbage.

The weapons require severe balancing and the base weapons are terribly inconsistant in both accuracy and damage. this game could be such a good game if the devs would just start giving a $#!%. The final compaint I have is the in game economy, Id rather pay 20 to 30 dollars upfront for the game than play a game where the guns and equipment are so expensive that the only way to progress in a time effective manner is to spend money.

However, when you want to squad alone and are being forced to with the new squading system... kinda... no IS very freaking irritating, esspecially when you want to play as tanker, and your friend is a rifleman and you can't squad because of it.

"9132,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""I tried to like this game, I really did. Nothing is wrong with the gameplay besides the game developers incredibly biased point of view towards the American faction. I tried playing the German faction and its just too much bull. This stupid bias has completely ruined the game. An example of this bias: German AA guns have very slow moving shells and are super innacurate if you can even find the right place to shoot at a plane, however, American AA guns have the fastest moving AA projectiles and are highly accurate, capable of shooting down the smallest German fighter unlike the German AA that cant even shoot down the biggest American heavy fighter. This bias makes the game not worth the almost $200.00 I spent on ingame things.

"9133,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""The game was awesome when it started, germans vs americans, but it later went down the drain.  First there was the mighty german team, but they were nerfed in a few months by some devs who think the americans should win.  before the nerfing i played around 460 hours, but the nerf was the reason i quit, i tried to join later, but they still wanted germany to lose, this was the time the M1G was buffed, and could one shot at body shots with full hp.  at that time, the players for germany were needing the less damage upgrade to survive.  they then added russians, whom, at the start were destroying the buffed americans, and the nerfed germany.  at this time there were at most 80 germans playing matches.  then they nerfed america, and the russian were buffed.  later when i quit playing and joined back, the iron sights of weapons, such as svt, gew, m1g, kar, mosin, and m19 were nerfed, the guns down sight were put further away, and you could barely see where your reticles were.  after that, the accuracy of semi, bolt, and rev weapons were nerfed, so the rifles were becoming terrible.  a few days ago, the game itself was having some players one shoting people in the leg at full hp, which i hope to hell the devs figure out, but nothing has happened for a long while.  this is where i am now, i noticed they made the sound of foot movement quiter, and the fully upgraded silent foot movement makes no noise at all when walking.  so now, you cant easily tell who is nearby, even if you check map and right click.  the game was great starting, but it was terrible near the end, if i were to rate it at start, it was 9/10 for everything but some maps, but now i rate it 2/10 for the terrible conditions that are now in effect (the graphics and maps are better, at the cost of the experience).  i would suggest playing better ww2 games now, but if you have a time machine, go to the time the game was started, because it was better then, than it is now.  #edited #1 also, even if you dont have or do have a good pc, the game will compensate by slowing down the better pc's game so the other terrible computer can catch up, an example is when say, you get in a gun fight, your game might glitch out, and a hint is, you dont shoot where you aim when this happens, so you are going to die.  i found out that there is no counter measure for spawnkilling, so be careful, or leave the terrible match.  btw i would suggest leveling all the countries up at the same time, cause if you get to gold level, and you want to start a new character for a different country, your new weak character is still put in top tier gold matches, so you end up getting screwed most of the time, by mg, snipers with sidearms, or tanks which you cannot do anything to at the moment.  #edited #2 Spawn points for the assault maps are terrible, some of the maps i suggest not playing are mountain town, town, and forward airfield.  The terrible skirmish maps are hill 60 and village skirmish.  both encounter maps are great, but once the battle is nearing an end, the spawnkilling is unbearable.  IMPORTANT NOTE: when you die, or use your gun, you lose credits, so try not being on a losing map, say when someone picks your gun up, you still lose credits for the use of that gun.  Germany is known for better late game weapons/tanks.  America is known for better rate of fire/planes.  and russia is known for better damage/infantry.  By the way, the soldier skins are not shared with each one, and germany skins are more expensive than both america and russia.  German green pea can cost 790k for body, and 107k for helmet.  American nagual can cost 352k for body, and 97k for helmet.  Russian Palma costs 352k for body, and 97k for helmet.

Want to get your soldier to have long range weapons on the fly, Pay over 100,000 silver for it. Or do you want give one of your lower tier soldiers one of your high tier guys weapons to help him level up, Yeah thats not happening the other guy needs to buy it himself... think the matchmaking is good, just lumber everyone in together in a game where equipment differences are MASSIVE. As an FPS game on its own the actual gameplay is nothing to be amazed about its between Poor-Okay nothing great. And the command thing is different but overall a high level exclusive irrelivent peice of crap. If you ever complain about BF5 or CoDWW2 on some ground or another because the developers did something you dont agree or whatever you want to say, be thankfull you dont have to pay for all of your soldiers upkeep and worry about the cost of that greande you could throw.

It has,-Good Graphics-Smooth Gameplay-Free-And thats all i got to say.The """"That someone took aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on"""" part is obviously the bad part which i would say is,-For a game which you can puck multiple sides, it is very one-sided, I say this becauseOne side (not naming which) has weaponry that is 10x stronger than othersThe playerbase is very one sided too. (But what can you expect from a game that has the USA as a choice of side)-The battles are very fair at the start of a match, but whoever wins that first charge pretty much wins the entire game and makes it s hellhole for the other team(s) (And may i note that the battles can range from 30M to 2H?)Now i will note some things which are neither bad or good, but may affect your stance of the game -A bit grindy, It will take you a LONG time to get somewhere, i had to fight somewhere close to 7 battles for rank 2? And like i said a battle can be from 30M to 2H.-Battles are long, some people enjoy long hard fights but some people enjoy shorter, 5 minutes fights that you can get alot of kills in.-The game is a hellhole for new players, After you rach acertain amount of silver you can choose a career. At first you are a American/German/Russian Footsoldier but you can become a fighter pilot/ tank crewman/ Sniper/ paratrooper.it sounds fun right? Yes and no, The classes are fun to play with, one has this advantage over a other one but than another one has an advantage over this one. Its kinda like a game of rock-paper-scissors-Tank.but back to the point for a person who has not yet gotten a class and is still a footsoldier? They get picked off by snipers, they get blown away by tanks, bombed by planes and get flanked by paratroopers, (Which is not to big of a deal, the paratroopers i mean.)Now for the conclusion it is a GREAT game, for its price. But if it had to be compared to some other games? Not worth it, so i wanted to give it a negative review but because of its amazing price of just 0.00 USD, 0.00 CD, 0.00 EU it is worth it."",1"
"9140,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is still being developed, I understand that.HOWEVER, from watching Dev streams lately as well as playing since beta release I have come to the understanding that The US is favoured most of all, followed by the Germans and then the USSR gets what's left.This is shown in a number of examples, both in gameplay mechanics and in available weapons (and their stats).The US seems to spam every match with tanks and other armoured vehicles (which are either too hard or too expensive to counter), the Germans tend to do the same followed by the USSR and their underwhelming vehicles and expensive AT weapons. Also, on release, the USSR was started from scratch progression-wise wheareas the US and German factions were comfortably in the lead with many, many tank drivers, pilots, recon and the like. This forced a painful attempt to progress in battles as the USSR due to being very under-powered in the various ways previously mentioned.YES! I realise this is a freemium game. """"They 'need' to make money somehow"""" I hear you all say, but really??!F2p is slow and for the USSR completely not worth it (not to mention not at all worth it for any faction after a certain rank or set of weapon upgrades due to the negative costs for playing a match( even for very skilled players)) and that it what sucks about this game, money-grabbing. In order to progress or have decen chances at competing you MUST buy into the game and that is terrible. Why offer a f2p model when it's secretly forcing you to buy in to its pricey premium account??Now don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed aspects of this game. The weapons available are cool and the maps are large and varying but the cons seem to outweigh the pros. Atleast in my own opinion.Pros:Decent map sizesGood selection of weapons etcFairly accurate historiclyGood game for a groupCons:Poor mechanicsUnbalanced factionsExpensive itemsSubtly forced premium attemptLack of VOIPLack of competent playerbase\communication"",0"

9143,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,Early Access Reviewhave folowed development for 2 years (yes the horible browser launcher) and game does not change to any  significant degree. sadly this game is not free to play but free to try becouse you will need to pay if you want to do anything else than run around with a gun as standart inf. this is not a bad thing but tanks are not balanced properly as they dominate. yes as inf you CAN kill it but good luck on open ground with that.so is this game funs as inf. well it can be however gun play is clunky at best (it got worse from last time i played it on browser). there is bad mouse accel wich makes aiming an absolute pain and no way to turn it of. the attacking team is at a BIG disatvantage becouse the camping side has a good atvantage due to 1 headshot kill mechanics (hard to pull of on moving targets) and how difficult it can be to spot ppl. HOWEVER getting headshots and kills is verry rewarding and there is real tension due to 1 shot kills. conclusion: the game is verry good in places and at times however it is pay to win becouse everything that isn't standart inf is clearly better to a more or lesser degree. the game has issues balance wise and some smaller ones in other departmends but don't count on any of them being fixed sins there were no noticable changes in my 2 to 3 years of not playing the game. there are better free to play shooters and this game is only free to play in the most strict meaning of the word.,0

"9147,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Quite honestly this is the worst FPS I've ever played. Extremely clunky and frustrating mechanics. The physics are just riduclously bad. You can't drive a vehicle over a railroad track, it just stops you like a brick wall. Random boulders are hidden at river crossings seemingly purposefully just to get in your way. It is so frustrating, not fun at all. Weapons are all extremely unbalanced and often get magical headshots out of nowhere. This is rage-inducing when it happens to you, and when you do it to somebody else, it's not even fun. It's just like, """"Wow, I killed that guy? Oh."""" Game is also riddled with bugs. One in particular locks you in crouch mode and won't let you do anything. All you can do is sit there and get killed. And don't even get me started on the greedy money grab of in game purchases.

Absolutely not. Look elsewhere."",0"
"9148,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewBesides the fact that it can takes hours and hours of farming in order to get something (Or you could just spend real money to buy it... because its THAT kinda game!), I would have to say this game sucks. From the """"realistic"""" gameplay, the completely """"balanced"""" factions, or maybe the """"realtime"""" wars that players influence, I would have to say that it doesn't really live up to anything that it says!Lets start with the free to play part! It, as stated above, can take upto weeks just to get enough money and XP to buy a weapon. However! If you think that you're above this, and don't want to wait, you can just spend the ~10 US dollars to buy it right there and then. (Buying it with credits even allows you to COMPLETELY skip over the XP requirements, along with the money!)Then comes the """"realistic"""" and """"Simulation"""" battles- IF one could call them that! I believe that the biggest contender here is the movement model, which although had some nice hopes... is for lack of better words, sh*t. Many a times I have been in open fields or with large arm movement areas, when I get into a firefight with another soldier. Mid shooting, my gun pulls up and does the action that it does when your muzzle isn't in position (Because APPARENTLY my gun was running into some invisible force?) for firing. Then theres the maps... Oh! how I hate ALL of the maps. From large open areas with almost no cover from base to base, to the maps where it looks as though you must camp in order to be successful, or maybe the maps with overgrown areas with large amounts of fog? All in all, the maps aren't that great either, simply compounding upon everything else that is wrong in this game.After that, there goes the """"balance"""" which just as everything before is little but existent. I'd like to paint a little picture for you here... American Bombing Planes: 2 bombsGerman Bombing Planes: 1 bombSoviet Bombing Planes: 4 bombs! (Kinda crazy right?)But, the German plane must have SOME redeeming qualities right? Like better mobility, or stronger bullets? Nope, its the exact same as the other, if not worse. After the planes comes the tanks and weapons. (I'd like to just say real quick, Germany is EASILY the most underpowered, and it seems that the developers neither intend to make it better, or debuff the other factions as they just recently added the Soviets into the game, which look to have the best weapons.) From the poor guns of the German, to the crazy one shot rifles and ludacris fire rate and accuracy of the American weapons, to the overly good starting Soviet guns, its blatantly obvious that the developers favor some faction WELL over others. Tanks/vehicles, while pretty well balanced, are VERY overpriced, and some seem to have the sole function of spinning in circles or denying friction. All in all, the game's balance seems to be lacking, and its actually rather annoying to see the devs. favor some factions over others...Those """"real-time"""" wars you were expecting? Or that """"huge scale"""" battles that you thought you were going to get? Wrong again! While yes, there is a mega server that most of the battles take place on, and are ranked, most battles are only 16 V 16. This looks to be a rather small amount of people for all of the """"class variety"""" that the game has, leading to searching for game up to 10 minutes (And thats without a squad... being in a squad can take AGES). Finally, after getting into a game, you may notice that THE WHOLE SERVER consist of just THAT class, or very few other... You can see that this leads to frustrating gameplay, and overly long searching time for a game that it may 'plop' you in, which ends roughly a minute after your joining! (Also, I'm not really going to approach the whole, campaign thing, as its seems to literally be pointless. Wars end within a day and most of the time it doesn't give props to the right faction... but you can almost always bet the Germans lose, even when they win?)All in all, this game really in a trainwreck, that yes, I have had SOME fun playing, needs A LOT (and I cant stress enough how much I mean that) of work. Also, before you say, """"Oh well you've spent almost 100 hours playing the game, it MUST be good!"""" I would like to state that I have only spent that much time in game because I wanted to be able to expierence a large portion of it so that I may give a proper rating and suggestions!"",0"

Instead of removing it and fixing it they will keep it and fix it in a later build(Big builds take 3-6 months to release)Example is when they released a new faction(Soviets) with out adding a reduction to grind/free migration or any other form of buff to the new faction. Which led to the game being broken for over a year before the faction grew enough to survive. It's still broken as of today since the new faction only has 1/4 of the players of the other factions.

"9151,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewBeautiful idea, okay concept, but all that running just to be sniped, blown up by a tank that your team has no means to destroy, or shot by a camper because he (and their team in general) lack the incentive to defend/attack a position just kills that gameplay. Expect many one-sided games, gameplay that consists of running and wondering where you are, and a lack of any weaponry that can actually kill someone accurately (the higher-level guns will instantly kill you btw). Don't get me wrong, this game was kindof fun at first, but as you progress you....lose the ability to progress unless you buy up.

"9152,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewAs of currently, I can not say I like what I see. Even for a Beta, this game is quite broken. Though Gameplay is the only one that isn't broken to my knowledge, but it's the loading, the buffering, the waiting, it's too long. I mean, I expected this to be basically Planetside but in a WWII Era, instead I get a Battlefield Free to Play. Though I'm not arguing on that subject, I actually don't mind in the slightest. But the fact that I had to wait nearly 15 minutes just to get to the main menu and an additional 5 minutes to get into a game, I rather just update Planetside 2 and play that. And after the game was done, I got to the point where I could unlock / buy weapons, and that broken too, everytime I buy a weapon it doesn't respond, I keep clicking and I never unlock the weapon. Again, I can reason it being a Beta, I should expect some issues, but this has been out since July and it's nearing the end of August, I think there should of been plenty of time for this to not be an issue for future players like me. I want to enjoy this game, but with the waiting and the non-response of the menu, I can't exactly say I'm impressed nor makes me want to come back. What's the point in waiting nearly half an hour to play one game when there are other games like it that are not only polished but finished to where it can take me just mere seconds to play a game.

"9163,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""so 1xp for hitting someone okay. half of my total XP taken away because im not veteran (paying real money) okay just not letting me play when i try to press the """"combat"""" button okay, but making me grind for every little thing for hours on end and thrn trying to get me to pay to rank up. having to spend 40,000 silver to get ammo for my bazooka. having to buy ammo and repair guns NOT OKAY. shoving micro transactions dowm my throat every 2 minues NOT OKAY. making every little item cost thousands and thousands of silver or hundreds of gold â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ off. just put a real progression system in, take out the micro-transactions (which you wont because youre money hungry â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s) and make it a full price game. without all the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t of buying things like guns, ammo, vehicles, ranks, perks, ribbons, medals, camos, and anything else i missed and just sell me the god damn game like a normal gameEdit: I was lookign at my play time and found out half my time has been spent in queues.i tried to play one match today. spent 30 minutes in a queue. when i get in to the match my team is at the last objective and withing 2 minutes of me joining we win and i get sent back to the menu. this game is terrible. 0/10 dont recommend.

"9166,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is amazing. It's totally awesome. The gameplay is sensational. I really enjoyed it. The UI was a little clunky but okay, I could deal with it. It's a fantastic game. However.. The in-game currency system is a sham. You have to pay for EVERYTHING. Every single little thing you want to change about your character or even KEEP PLAYING, you have to pay. It's such a shameless method of the Developers forcing you to keep playing the game more! What's worse? If you choose a new career path after spending AGES getting to Rank 5, YOU HAVE TO PAY to change. This limits all your character options back to Lv.1 again. So you start from scratch, again. You also can't use certain weapons. So what if you wanna swap back to the career you've already unlocked?... YOU HAVE TO PAY AGAIN!! I've wasted 100,000 finding that out! You only get about 7,000 per game!! I am constantly taxed on every piece of this game. I olve playing it, but this is well enough to force me to stop. Let us play the F-ing game!!! I don't mind paying for things, but it's far too expensive and they should STAY UNLOCKED. Unbelivable. Ruined a great game."",0"
"9167,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewHeroes and Generals is definately a game worth checking out, it's free afterall. PROS   Good gunplay: feels very satisfying.  Very good sound engine: sound carries a realistic distance and with good headphones, enemies are easy to hear  Distinctive sounds, carrying on from the last point, all weapons and viechles sound unique and distinctive and can be distinguished given enough time.  Great implimentation of RTS and FPS aspects into one game  Good UI design, many features are intuative and easy to use. (ammo pouches need to be more obvious though)  Weapon modifications to suit many playstyles (even with one weapon)  Everything gameplay changing is unlockable (given enough time) There are no paywalls that lock away content (except for some christmas weapon skins that are no longer available). Expect to grind a lot though. Neutral   Graphics, good textures but lighting and distant items still need work  Maps, what maps that are available (9 total) are very good, but there needs to be more added.  Free to play model, Obviously there has to be an advantage for paying, but altogether not very Pay-to-win, but more to reduce the grind.  Balance, within the """"tiers"""" of weapons, balance is mostly very good (excluding light tanks and assault rifles) but the top tier weapons are significantly better than their lower tier counterparts. Cons   Big grind, even paying users have a very long grind if they want to unlock everything, at the time of writing (745hrs, 600 approx as free user) I have less than half of the unlocks in the game. This could be toned down a bit, especially soldier purchase costs.  Lack of tutorial, although there technically is a tutorial it is one of the few things bueried in the menu, and it does not cover many of the essential mechanics (capturing points, squad orders etc.)  VERY high learing curve, veteran players are very good and experience is key. There is a system to try to get newer players acclimatised, but it is still woefully inadequate. Conclusion Heroes and generals is definately a game that is worth checking out, and has potential. It is not for everyone and has a high learning curve and massive grind, even for paying users. It is very accessable, and every weapon, viechle, unlock, and combat badge is available to free users. The main thing it is lacking is a good tutorial(s) for each class covering the basics and a tutorial based on capturing points and squad orders. It has come a long way since I started playing and is better than ever in my opinion."",1"
"9168,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""(I HAVE RESUMED PLAYING THE STEAM VERSION)This game has the potential to be something great, it really does. Unfortunately that potential is wasted.The balance in this game isâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥poor, mostly early on when you are just starting off. For tanks it is painful, especially for Germany as you can be fighting light tanks from 1944 while driving a tankette from 1934, a full decade behind. Tanks with machineguns should only be fighting tanks with machineguns, otherwise they are goddamn useless. Even later tanks are pretty badly up tiered, with an M3 Lee, a tank from 1941 that only lasted until 1942 because it was obsolete the moment it was put into service, is fighting Panthers, T-34-85s and other tanks from 1944. Low tier tanks mostly involves being seal clubbed, that's all it is until you get lucky and fight stuff on your level or get a better tank. The grind is hilariously bad, you need to put in twice the time to get ANYWHERE in terms of progression with equipment, and most of that as stated before is just getting seal clubbed a whole lot. Credit income is VERY low and you have to pay for ammo and repairs for vehicles and weapons alike so that just makes it worse along with the RIDICULOUS prices of stuff you need to buy. You pretty much HAVE to buy veteran membership to progress without grinding for days on end, and that costs a lot of money. From what I have been hearing some people have been getting banned for """"cheating"""", when it's just a brokenâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥anti-cheat system or a scam so people will make a new account and spend money on it to progress.Short version, this game is terribly imbalanced and the devs need to get theirâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥together and fix it becuase it's not getting any better. Go ahead and try it, first few hours in you will realise how painful the grind is from the bottom. I'm not saying not to try this game, do try it, it has great potential and can be quite enjoyable at times, it just becomes painful to play rather quickly if you dont advance or get uptiered."",0"
"9169,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""After 100+ hours GRINDING this pile ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥i can 100% guarantee you this game suck balls!The Pay2Win is really stong in this game, Little kids who stole there moms credit card with just 3 hours into the game and they already own a full set of one-shot sniper gear. Spawn camping is also a huge problem in this game, Russians plant your spawn full with land mines so its almost inpossible to spawn with your vehicle. 9 of the 10 battles i have played dont even have a propper balance, your team has like 15 soldiers, 2 tanks 1 plane and 1 sniper when the enemy team has 6 snipers, 4 planes, 5 tanks and 15 soldiers.

"9170,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewHeroes and Generals is  a Pay-to-Win title from Reto. I have been playing this game for a couple of years now, only to find that it gets worse with each patch.If  you like unbalanced gameplay  with fanatsy skinned weapons where the team with most paying players have the supreme advantage,  then this game is for you.Some typical scenarios you will encounter on a daily basis:- Facing an opponent with tanks, planes and sniper while your team only consist of infantry- Having your entire team camp because despite the dedicated recon class, everyone can buy a sniper and camp- Glitching like flying people and missing textures when using a scope- 450 ping servers after waiting in queue for 5-10 minutes- Dying while exciting a vehicle- Hitting a person, seeing blood but no kill (this also happens sometimes when you hit an object)- 20 minutes of pure tank sniping while waiting for an impossible game to endI woulld not recommend this game to anyone because investing time and money  into a game that's getting worse for each patch seems dumb"",0"
"9171,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewNew update: It is virtually impossible for you to earn more war credits in a game than what it cost to repair and refill ammo in just a single  game. Basically this means is it is impossible to progress through in the game without shelling out some real money. The issues with the game with new players still remain below.Don't play this game, it is very unfirendly to new players. The community is very toxic towards new players as well, the 'vets' claim it's skill is why 'noobs get owned'. But if you happen to pick up a dead vets weapon then it becomes apparent that skill has nothing to do with it. I picked up a dead vets light machine gun and it was more accurate than my infantry standard bolt action rifle at long range. Clearly my score increased dramtically whenever I had the opputunity to pick up an upgraded weapon, so 'skill' as the toxic vets say is just their way of inflating their eâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥It doesn't help that the game throws you in the sharks pit once you hit lv 3 (roughly 5 hours gameplay). After level 3 you can be matched with anyone, this puts you at a severe disadvantage and you are forced to try and grind (performance based leveling up) vs oponents that are much better equiped than you are. If the xp you gain was fixed rarther performance based (kills etc) I would feel the need to try and slog through it. But it feels like you're trying to push sh*t uphill rarther than play the game."",0"
"9172,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWell I gave it a good shot and played for 18 hours.Damage:You probably don't remember the days when Soldier of Fortune came out and you could literally blow the bad guys arms and legs off. Well I'm not looking for that, as there are kiddies present, but what I am looking for is some damage effect. Since when can a person get wounded by three or four bullets and still run, move and aim like a champion?HUD:So you've stealthfully walked, run, swam and crawled your way across half the map to capture a point and when you do a big circle appears over your head and tells every player on the map where you are. Almost as incoherent are the 'enemy spotted' tags which appear over your head if you ever dare fire your weapon. No matter how cleverly hidden you are, every enemy soldier on the map will see a nice red arrow pointing at you if you do. The only solution is to emulate the snipers who camp on top of a hill at the back of the action if you want to rack up the kills.    Tanks:The tanks are seriously over powered which ruins it for anyone in the infantry. This could so easily be balanced with early access to anti-tank grenades.Linear Warfare:The main disappointment for me is the linear battles where you must take point A before point B before point C etc. This makes it far too easy for the enemy to park a tank at point B or just pound it endlessly with shells knowing that if we fail to take that one undefendable barn then the whole battle is over.Conclusion:What could well have been a great open world game is now a counter strike clone with tanks that take no damage from rocket launchers. Spawn, get sniped, spawn, get tanked, spawn and get shot by the guy hiding in the loft where you spawned. I almost gave in and was going to spend some money to buy a shovel but thought better of it. Play it for a while until the battle fatigue and shell shock sets in, even throw the devs a dollar or two, then go do something constructive."",0"

"9174,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""Its fun when there arent any tanks involved. Be prepared to get mad at how semi auto rifles are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing broken because you can spam them and kill someone with an smg(that isnt german) faster at close range than they can kill you. I regretably spent money on this game because it was fun at first and I wanted to support the devs.Then I found out how much of a tedious grindfest this game really is.I get wanting to push players to pay but holy heck, the grind in this game is more attrocious than world of sodding tanks.And that says a lot.If you're broke and have way too much time on your hands, go ahead and play this game.If not: STAY AWAY FROM IT YOU WILL UNINSTALL IT AFTER ONE HOURIt's sad because I genuinely do have some fun memories of this game that I made with some friends and I hate that it has become a giant boring grindfest."",0"
"9175,Heroes & Generals,2018.0,""TLDR: If you have any amount money don't play this game. If you don't, then try it.  -Start game.-Equip basic rifle and join game.Grind for hours to upgrade your basic weapon while getting seal-clubbed by people with scoped assault rifles.-Finally get a basic submachine gun. You realize that you still die a lot, but slightly less to be fair.-You decide to grind to get a paratrooper for 71,000 coins-Grind.-You get the paratrooper. You realize that whenever you spawn there's 4 enemy fighters trailing your paratrooper plane.You drop early behind enemy lines, the minute you drop you get sniped by a guy with a 1 hit kill sniper rifle.-Realize that playing paratrooper is horrible so you grind your paratrooper to get some higher end guns and badges and ribbons (abilities/bonuses).-You finally get a badge to open your parachute late to avoid snipers. -The parachute glitches and you get a negative XP penalty for killing yourself.-You sigh, quit, then start another game.-You spawn in a glitching plane right before it crashes into a hill due to bad AI.-You quit the game, ask yourself why you're playing this, then realize that you don't have money to buy other steam FPS  games.

"9176,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Do you like tanks? Do you like planes? Do you like ww2 games? Because this is one of the best free online games on steam, taking place in a ww2 setting, you can join the American side, the Russian side, or the German side. With your choice, you are subject to diverse weapons, vehicles, and character personalization of that country.  There is an advancement system of Ranks which is achieved when you gain experience from battle. Fight in large maps to aid your country in the War, or fight in a skirmish map for practice and less experience gain. Heroes and Generals is unique with it's scenery, an the maps created are greatly designed for the action that ensues. I myself thoroughly enjoy this game and always come back to it, again and again playing it to enjoy the thrill of my team all charging in with  vehicles and on foot. Heroes and Generals definitely deserves a better rating."",1"
"9177,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewOkay, so like most things, this game can definately be improved and I would hope that it would considering it is still in beta. I am going to say a limited amount of things since I still do not know too much about the game yet, just based off first impressions. I am running this game on a non-gaming notebook, and runs very well. Matchmaking, for the most part seems to be balanced. I don't really like the spawn system. You can either spawn at the main base or a APC/jeep, but you cannot spawn directly on a Base you have taken (at least in the game modes I have played). Most of the people in this game aren't super terrible and seem to have at least average intelligence of how to play as a team. It is taking quite awhile to rank up, compared to how fast I thought I would rank up, but I guess that is not such a big deal. Only the fact that you unlock certain classes/game modes after you reach certain ranks. I will edit this review as I play this game more."",1"

"9185,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI love this game, especially since they made it less of a grind. It still takes a long time I unlock new guns, and yes, I do consider this a pay to win game, but its the good kind of pay to win game. If the other guy bought a mg42, you could still easily beat him with your starter weapon if you are better than him. Really the only problem I have with the game is with the OP M1/M2 Carbine. You do not need any skill to use this, it has the fastest fire rate, no recoil, its accurate and a 4 shot kill.

"9188,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewHello Alll,I've been playing this game for nearly 4 to 5 months now and I'm going to go through stuff that I think need fixing about the game. 1] The things you can buy on the market guns, bullet, custom for your gun and a lot more but I've seen they really do cost a lot. So in two days I've made over 40k and I could only but a ppsh as the russians I think they really need to lower the guns and custom bit for your guns right down. Because I just feel I would like to go on the game and have a shoot around with a ppsh or a mousin with a scope onit to feel more into  the WW1 style. Also to buy a tank commander and buy a pilot is WAY to much even if someone was playing for a week non stop they woulden't be able to get to that kind of cash.2] There should be more maps and gamemodes I would really like more games modes such as plane battle such as what DICE did to battlefield 4. Also their need to be more maps their is hardley no maps and It just feels boring to play the map  over again.I played the same map 5 times in a row along with my team.3] The amount of tanks and players inside the game in just complete annoying. I've had a game when Russia has 1-2 tanks and the german have over 4. Really? do you think that is fair in that match I could even get to the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing batllefield and you expect me to make all the money to buy the guns. I know this is the RPG's but they take over 1-4 hits depending on the damage. 4] The amout of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t of the guns has just complete confused me. The mosin in real life is a 7.62 round whitch is 1 to 2  shot depending on where to hit. But, I am fireing up close about 20m away and it taking me 3 shots sort it out, This problem need to be fix because, It's stupid how people are killing you with a 9x19mm In 3 hits. 5] Okay the graphics are okay not the best considering But the iron site need to be more close to you so you can see the Iron site. Because I can't really see the SVT Iron site. 6] Heroes and Generals wanted to be a WW2 type of game. But I just feel that you are not in WW1 It feels more like your in call of duty. Witch I didn't likeThanks, Rogans"",0"

"9190,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is a pay to win game, if you want to unlock weapons and buy them with in game credits you will be grinding for hours just to save up enough in game credits to buy one weapon or an upgrade for the weapon depending on what upgrade it is. you would have to spend hundreds of hours to get the load out you want, you get rewarded an average of 2000 credits per game and thats not including the the credits that are taken away to repair your weapons and upgrades and refilling your weapons. If you want to get all the upgrades you want on a weapon you will have tp spend more than 24 hours to get all upgrades. the most expensive upgrades are the barrel, sights, springs. You might as well save up for another weapon that you want and better weapon at that point. The ranking system is also too slow, I'm level four with my german soldier and I have spent 9 and half hours playing this game and i still need about 10000 XP until next rank. thats a lot of hours to get to next rank. You are going to spend about 12 hours just to get to level 5. Unless you pay real money to get to level 5 and get the weapons you want. Some of the game mechanics make no sense. For example: when you're up close to a wall it automatically put your weapon down. this is fine mechanic but it gets annoying sometimes, when I'm looking out of a window and I'm close to the wall it draws the weapon out of my sight, or if the window has wooden frames it does the it, and if there's any obstruction in front of the weapon it automatically puts the weapon down even if im looking down my sight. Another thing that reallyn annoyed me is that you couldn't spawn on squad members or the objective you have captured. I spend most of my time running to get to the objective to capture or defend. I know there's vehicles but sometimes they take forever to respawn back. There is really no point in having a squad, and they also need to add in team icons to be visible at all times. I'm tiried of bying team killed because my teammates don't know I'm in a building. In conclusion: The developers need to add more XP to kills or give extra XP when you get a headshot kill or give more XP when it takes less shots to kill an enemy. Lower the cost of weapons and other upgrades or increase the gain per match for in game credits. The developers also need to fix certain mechanics in the game to make the game more enjoyable.        At the momment I give this game a 4/10.This game has the potential of being good if they fix some mechanics in the game and get rid of the Pay to Win mentality."",0"

The p2w (Pay to Win) system. Now there are a lot of games that have microtransactions and within the game it is arguable fair because in game purchases can be obtained with both the game currency and actual money, but the difference in quantity is just fu**ing obsurd. So imagine when you first play the game and try to find your barings and learn how to actually play when people who have X amount of hours and with no doubt have an edge over you because of the p2w system, the game's flaws really begin to shine and the fun factor cracks.

Please, look at my hours played. I know what I am talking about. If you play in the game, American teams lose 9/10 games. This is not an exaduration. Once you commit a soldier to an alliance, he cannot change. You have to start over as a German or Russian. This is, seriously, the worst production for an online game. Acceptable issues in beta, not in a finished product. Game designers, if you are listening. GET YOUR HACKERS UNDER CONTROL. Until then, bye."",0"
"9198,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Now this game is really addictive but it has some problems like the spawn system and game mechanics. like the fact that you canÂ´t go trough a wooden fenche with a tank even with full speed. Air planes are kinda over powered since they are hard to kill and they can spam bombs. the spawn system is annoying because of the amount of waiting you need to do is HUGE. reasons for that are spawn deploy queue, Travelling to location and many others also the spawn points are simply cancer because they are so easy to spawn camp with a tank or sniper. The biggest reason why  IdonÂ´t reccomend this game is that I like realism specially in a ww2 game and I love tank/airplane combat and this gameÂ´s vehicle combat is rather buggy. go ahead  and download this game try it. the game is addictive and fun but someone like me these little problems will ruin the fun."",0"

"9204,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewTo sum it up: pay to win.You start off playing training missions, and for the most part is is quite fun. The game's mechanics are not on par with other WW2 shooters out there such as DoD: Source or more importantly Red Orchestra 2, but you're willing to look past that because of the overarching goal to 'win the war' and the fact that the game's progression gives you incentives to keep playing. Unfortunately it's when you rank up and step out of training missions into the campaign missions where the game comes undone. Whilst it is refreshing to finally see the game as it was meant to be played, that is with multiple goals and not just the domination gametype in the training missions, you'll often be outnumbered or outnumber the enemy team and crush them. Not only that but you'll start playing against people who have spent inordinate amounts of money on ridiculous weapon mods that will one shot you and they'll also take 3x the amount of damage of a normal person due to some insane perk they unlocked via money. Yes you can grind to attain some of these advantages but it is a long and arduous grind, not something the average person could hope to attain. I'm willing to have some iffy balance in a WW2 game seeing as in real life battles are not always fair, but when you get the drop on a guy who is peddling a bike, you put 6 rounds into him and then he jumps off his bike only to one shot kill you it is incredibly frustrating.Something that I very much get in a RO2 match is the feel of war"
"9205,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewNot sure if I should Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down this game, so I'll just write a list of pros/cons and then choose depending on what list is bigger.Pros: Large scale battles on big mapsExtremely well thought out character progressionUnique classes and buffsGreat selection of weaponry and vehiclesPersonalised soldiers that you actually care aboutDifferent game modesAccess to nearly everything using in-game credits won by playingModify every gun with unique mods that affect its performance. Repair these mods with in-game creditsChoose your faction and tell your friends because even though the teams aren't permanent (they re-set every week) you are locked into your faction choice until the war is over.Cons:Can be very laggy if you are placed in a foreign serverMaps are massive and if you have no transport it takes ages to get anywhereGood weapons are expensive and may take several days to aquire if you are short on play timeCan be very buggy as it is in BetaIf you are up against an enemy team with Tank classes and you don't have any then the game becomes extremely unbalanced and one-sided.There is a """"griefing"""" system where if anyone does even 1 team damage to you, you can press F1 to automatically report them.

"9209,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewBattlefield 1942 Nostalgia Simulator.Really, the game is a reminder of to what point the industry has come. While BF1942 was a well optimized, balanced and supported game, then Heroes and Generals' """"potential"""" that is so often mentioned in these reviews comes from actually cannibalizing the old school WW2 shooter. The controls are similarly floaty (yet still way more awkward), the battle maps are equally large yet fairly linear (but with fewer people on teams to create a real ghost town effect) and the concept centered around combined arms warfare (without the class system that actually enabled infantry to compete with mechanized branches of war).And to make matters worse than the """"borrowing"""" from BF1942 being done ineptly, it is all coated with a great helping of P2W glazing. Where you could just jump in a plane or pick a sniper class in BF1942 and have the experience guide you to be better and better and eventually a competitive player of your own, here you either need to slog through a horrifying grind where you are essentially left at the hands of those people who fate has somehow decreed to own better weapons than you (and be grateful if it's only a high tier SMG instead of a freaking tank), or simply those who (for some reason or another) have decided to support the game with their hard-earned cash.Now, I can see why the game piques one's interest. The concept of being a foot soldier commanded by humans high up the food chain is something video games don't really do that often, but as things stand, for an FPS player, the """"Generals"""" aspect seems foreign and indecipherable as they seem to do little more than imbalance specific scenarios, which, from a strictly FPS point of view, is incredibly infuriating. Maybe I'm just not clever enough to pick up why things happen the way they do, but as a simpleton of a simple soldier, the fact that I'm given a low tier weapon and am expected to die against opposition far better armed than me is immensely unfair. Maybe this is what """"Heroes"""" references - the men of WW2 who were indeed put in hopeless and unfair situations - but I cannot see how such exposure to real tragedies is fun to anyone but the most sadomasochistic roleplayer.And as such, I'm left with slogging through the game, hoping to unlock that amazing sniper rifle I picked up off the ground once and went on a fifteen to nothing killing spree with. But it's way too long of a stride and offers little on the way - and considering how the battles are empty and chaotic (20 players per team seems to be a good haul - on maps that force you to ride bikes to control points only to be scythed down by better-equipped players it means that you will almost never be allowed to """"pick your own battles"""", if you catch my drift) it doesn't really strike me as being worth it. Unfortunately these core issues do not look like they'll be fixed any time soon. I can handle floaty and imprecise controls when the concept gives me enjoyment, but there is so much infuriating me about every aspect of the game that long playing sessions are out of the question. As such I'm left with quick spurts of 30-40 minutes of gameplay, which obviously means that unlocking any of the high tier weaponry is a pipe dream at best.So is this game worth contributing towards? Honest to god, if you have any money to spare, organize some kind of revival of BF1942 instead. If you play this for free, consider that you won't get any long term enjoyment of it. Value the initial few hours skirmishes and move on. But all in all, this one is just a major let down."",0"
"9210,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI may not have played a large amount of the game but I feel I've played enough to give an educated opinion. I tried the game in hope of finding a sort of WW2 themed Battlefield game as it promised large scale vehicular combat. I was then saddened when I realized that the only combat I would be seeing is tiny 'skirmish' battles with civilian trucks in place of the large panzer tanks I'd hoped for. But before even reaching combat I had to tackle the loadout menus, which are utterly confusing and drastically over complicated and lets not forget the propaganda for buying premium currency. Eventually, I gave in and began to enter the skirmish battles with my  new US character. This I regret. I took up position behind a rock and began firing away at the grey-green enemies against the grey-green backdrop. I stared down the useless iron sights, which obstructed my view more than aided it and fired a round at an enemy that was closing in. Hit. However I was utterly flabbergasted when the enemy retorted with a barrage  of bullets from their machine gun. I was chopped down in a matter of seconds, questioning how I could fight these bullet spewing monsters. I continued the cycle: spawning, firing a measly few bullets before being destroyed by those blasted machine guns. The battle then boiled down to a relentless spawn killing and, needless to say, I was on the receiving end.Frustrated by my beating I navigated myself to the shop in search of my own machine gun. I then had to pick my jaw up from the floor once I saw its price tag. But rest assured, you could easily purchase it with some 'premium' currency. Against my instincts I grinded enough money to buy another american rifle - this one a bolt action as i wished to begin sniping. If the starting rifle was bad then this one must have been the worst, it traded the semi-automatic fire rate of the starting rifle for a measly damage increase and even worse iron sights. Meanwhile, I'd also  unlocked the ability to finally engage in the actual battles the game advertises. It was nothing like what I'd hoped. Instead of being able to partake in ordered offensive and defensive battles I was greeted with the barrel of some high-rank tank controlled by a guy ten times my level. And to make matters worse, if I dodged the tanks then I would surely have my brain splattered by some grey blur of a sniper on a hill at the other end of the base.And this is where I uninstall this game.

"9213,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game just can't get my recommendation. I'd leave it at neutral if I could. The game itself is fun. You got vehicles and explosions all about. I enjoy that it does retain some sense of realism to it. Here's why I'm neutral on it: The best teams to join in when you start off the game is American. If you start off as Soviet Union or Germany though, you will probably not see victories unless the opposing team has way less members than you, or until you reach the point of seeing automatic weapons on your team being used. When you join a match, you'll begin to realize that the Americans have fully automatic weapons and even vehicles with MGs on them. As for the Soviets? Well, we start off with semi automatic rifles and jeeps/trucks that serve no purpose other than transport. Why is this a problem? A lot of the starting battles take place at close range so the full auto guns have complete advantage over the Soviet Union. The armed vehicles actually suppress and deteriorate any advance made by Soviet Union. You could say """"Get skill"""" but really, it wouldn't matter. You can be extremely skilled and yet, be so limited due to the crappy Soviet loadout. It seems you would actually need to PAY to win as the Soviets. So unless I begin to see the starter battles look less biased towards Americans, my opinion won't change."",0"

"9216,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you're a big ww2 fan then you should check out this game. It has many cool weapons and vehicles such as tanks, planes, smgs, lmgs, rifles. But in order to get them you must work hard for it (grinding). This game also requires some skill when you need to compesate for the bullet drop at long distances especially if you're going sniper. Normally nowadays, the snipers are very op in the game since it has 1 hit kill. i've had around 200hours in this game because i'm a big fan of ww2 and when you first play this game, you are going to die a LOT, so my advice is that you should just continue to play eventually it'll start to get real fun and you'll have a great time. I reckon why a lot of people dislikes this game is because right after they got it, they rage quit too easily since they don't have any good weapons but they haven't experienced what its like to actually own those weapons since it takes too long to get them. But in the end i reckon it was all worth the effort.Overall this game is recommended to all yous out there who is either a big fan of ww2, likes to grind for hours or basically whoever likes a challenge."",1"

So I sit there waiting for litterally 14 minutes trying to find a game, when it finally connects, there is more loading, then guess what? THE GAME F***ING FREEZES. I then patiently attempt to load the game back up, GETS FROZEN ON THE LOGGING IN SCREEN. I just want to play the thing, I really do, but PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND EVERYTHING HE LOVES, FIX THE MAJOR PROBLEMS! I don't want to give the game a negative review, but it forces me to.

9235,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is good infantry vs infantry wise but the biggest problem are the tanks and airplanes.

(I really hate it) - Lags - OP Tanks with sniper rifle accuracy - Planes that bombs with sniper rifle accuracy and shot down all paratroopers all the time (para planes has no defence) - You can feel a lil bit Pay-2-Win there (some minor stuffs, but may be useful) - Cheaters (they also exist in this game) - Small ammount of maps (and some of them like Airport are really terrible to play) - Too many vehicles... - Maps are big, but they feel empty (almost no covers) - In most situations, the higher fire rate, the better weapon (hail the MG42) - So far I've noticed that German weapons are the best (where's balance here?)Hmm... I may missed some but anyway... I can only wish that this game will be more like a Call of Duty: United Offensive mixed with Battlefield, but for sure it won't happen...If you want you can try it - it's free, but grindy and sometimes it feels a lot like a Alpha/Beta Test game.

"9243,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThius game could be great but so far its horrible. For starters you stuck with a MASSIVE grind to even get a pistol. Than dont expect fair fights, most the the fights ive been in the match STARTS with a 2-3 to 1 disadvatage or advantage. Meaning the game has no auto balance feture, and can easily join a game where you are losing 2-1 or even more and are being spawn camped.The class system seems nice but like everything else feels half finished and thrown together. You can switch to another class only after grinding rank and once you join a game as that class, your stuck, there is no planning and you mainly see games fulll of infantry and nothing else becasue you cant change character to one that is needed on the battlefield.The UI and lighting and visual in gerneral frankly are the worse ive seen in a long time. the lighting seems to either bee to bright like you just left a dark room, or too dark and cant seeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ The FOGis so horrrible that you normally cant see or make out an enemy till your 5 feet from them. The grapics are dated and poor quality, and the mechanics of the guns and vehicles are even worse.Frankly i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone and the excuse that its BETA isnt working here. This is another game that will probably never leave early access becasue it gives the developers and excusss to never fix or finish the game."",0"
"9244,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWhen I played this game last summer it was very fun and enjoyable, and I don't remember it being much of a grind. It was a complete blast to play with friends, but unfortunately I can not say the same now. This game(like almost every free to play title), has now decided to go down the pay 2 win route, if you want to get a gun it will probably take you hours upon hours just to unlock it, that is unless you want to pay real money of course. It is a damn shame, because this game had a lot of potential for a free to play game, but unfortunately falls flat on its face due to its heavy shift towards pay 2 win."",0"
"9245,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewAddicting game. Brings me back to the days of battlefield 1942 so the game feels very nostalgic to me. There is a little bit of a grind but once you know how to get the most xp out of the game its rather easy. Many different ways to play. Rush into the enemy head-on jump out of your vehicles and start blasting working your way to the point. Or slowly work your way up through the tree-line looking for a tank and waiting for him to poke his head out. The choice ... really isn't yours... you're going to have to adapt to the different situations this game throws at you.Build your own mini-army of soldiers one in every branch of the army. Tank crew, Recon, Fighter pilots, Para-trooper and of course the most important branch infantry. Level them up to generals and they can command their own squads and you can directly affect the war! Deploy your troops into battle and save the day. You could be the one that changes the tide of a battle sending in your fighter planes to destroy enemy army numbers by the dozen... or will they just be fed to the enemy shot out of the sky one by one. Fight on! Heroes and Generals, Play it!"",1"
"9246,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe Good:Multiple soldier classes to choose from, meaning multiple play styles to utilize and select from.Separate resources for soldiers and assault teams.The ability to rank up your soldier and their individual weapon skills to specialize them how you wish.The ability to unlock more powerful gear and vehicles by investing time and experience into the previous levels.The ability to unlock and choose a perk for your soldier in combat, such as faster reloading, reduced damage taken, and carrying more ammunition.Three nations to choose from, allowing different gear between factions with few exceptions.Each soldier can earn more for fighting based on their rank, providing an incentive to continue to improve and rank up.The ability to give a General's gear to other soldiers of the same faction, once said soldier becomes a General.The Bad:Each soldier starts with no experience, base gear, and must play through the same tutorial to start earning credits in battles just by playing.Experience gain is painfully slow, with gains and rewards becoming more insignificant over time until they start becoming not only more miniscule, but more time-consuming as well.Each experience tree not only unlocks different perks, but different items, and do not intersect, often holding new items in the middle or later stages of the trees.Each nation unlocks different things in different orders, meaning some nations will be able to unlock better equipment at different points, such as tanks.At least one soldier must reach the rank of field officer before you can participate in the Generals part of the game, unless you purchase a General or high-ranked soldier using real-world cashAll weapons, vehicles, classes and assault teams can be purchased using real-world currency. The only exception is ribbon levels and perks, which can be unlocked faster using boosters or a premium accountEach player is thrust into matches with high-level players randomly upon reaching rank 3 with one soldier, meaning they often face off against vastly superior enemies very early on.Even the â€œbalancedâ€ matches are not balanced, because soldier numbers on each faction in battle can be uneven to an extent.All three factions are treated as separate entities, making a game based off of the second World War seem more like a free-for-all game.Spawn points can be easily â€œcampedâ€ by enemy players using tanks, making for a highly dissatisfying battle.Vehicles can be spawned sideways, upside-down, or in the immediate line of fire, making high-action points a nightmare to use, especially when said points are the only remaining ones to spawn from.Weapons can be modified to allow for instant one-shot capabilities, no matter where the victim is hit.Frame rate and connectivity is a huge issue, especially during high activity in small areas.Weapons can be modified to allow for extreme fire rates, making it nigh-impossible to react before one is killed.Allied players are able to repeatedly kill their own teams with little to no recourse noted as of yet, other than a minor loss of experience.Gaining any type of currency is slow and tedious, on top of the high cost of modified and specific gear.Players can join battles late and end up earning absolutely no reward for participation, even if they play a significant role in the battle.Players can buy the ability to equip two perks, a fourth weapon, and gain a boost to resources and experience earned through a premium account.Certain perks either do not seem to work right or are considered overpowered, such as the ability to remove the â€œkill cameraâ€, which is actually the ability to see where you were killed from.Players can enter matches in which they will be forced to fight against tank players, even if their team have none, and oftentimes cannot do anything about it other than be crushed. This happens even in the â€œbalancedâ€ game modes.In-game â€œWarsâ€ last an average of 2-3 days, requiring players to select their server and faction all over again every time one ends, even if they themselves did not participate.Paratroopers cannot jump out of a drop plane that is currently plummeting without incurring a suicide penalty, meaning whomever shot down the plane gets a free reward for killing them. [EDIT: You might not occur a suicide penalty or give another credit, but you still die instantly once it's started to plummet.]Fighter planes have little to no variety, and are built almost entirely for joystick users in their controls.Players earn a miniscule amount of gold funds once per day just for playing, and would need to play one battle every day for 294 days in order to purchase the lowest-ranked War Bond in the shop, which rewards them with a total amount equivalent to 310 days' worth of first-battle bonuses over half a year. Meanwhile, the lowest amount of gold available for an equivalent of 350 days' worth costs under $8 USD.For whomever considers that this is an unfair review for a game considered to be in Early Release, still, please note that this is a personal opinion and an Early Release review, on top of that, meaning that as more patches are added, this review shall be edited and reconsidered over time. As it stands, though, I cannot recommend this game to anyone for the reasons that it seems highly primed to detriment new or less skilled players and benefit not only the highly-experienced or skilled player, but also the one who throws money at it.And yes, I did calculate the equivalency of currency to time needed to reach that point."",0"
"9247,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Pay 2 Win, Game could be really good BUT.Battlefield is very sparse and without using a paid account everytime you get killed in Battle it will be a long walk back to the point, in this time enemy normally has an advantage and caps the point.I love WW2 games and am always fair to the P2W model as it can work but this is geared for Free players to completely Fail.If you like WW2 then go ahead and take a play its not all awful, but unfortunately you will grow tired of how Unbalanced the game is.Day of Infamy would be a better bet if you want some WW2 action In My Opinion anyways."",0"
"9248,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game. Reto constantly adding new features, weapons, maps, etc. Sometimes a bit buggy when they first release it but they iron it out fairly quicklyThis game is split into 2 parts. First Person Shooter side, which is fairly straightforward, but depends on what units are positioned on the RealTime Strategy map. As you level up, you'll be able to move some teams around on the RTS map yourself, and give your FPS player some backup/respawns etc. The three factions fight for control of Europe, which you win by capturing the majority of the major cities on the map.Expect there to be changes to the gameplay, they intend to change it a lot as the game develops. But i think thats a good thing. The game will never get old, and you know they're activly working on it and adding new stuff."",1"

It's getting steadily worse instead of better, and the dev team seems to be asleep at the wheel."",0"

9254,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,Early Access ReviewTerrible pay to win game that never comes out of early access. Starter weapons are bad and the good stuff you have to pay for. Capture point music will blow out your ear drums. Gameplay is fun at times and vehicles are fun.,0
"9255,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""This game pretends to be about WWII, yet doesn't respect the equipment (and therein the people who were forced to use that equipment), nor the art or of war in general.  In the """"F"""" version (or Update if you prefer) the mountains were so steep that most tanks could not climb them, which led to limited avenues of advancement (not to mention so many rocks that one could often get stuck simply by sliding down the hillside into either a tree, a rock, or both at the same time).  If a tank attempted to go anywhere but open fields, they spent more time dodging trees and rocks than scanning for the enemy tanks and infantry, much less supporting their own forces.The infantry weapons are completely screwed up.  The US Thompson submachine gun has nearly no rise in it's automatic firing (unlike the real deal).  The MG34 and the MG42 (both """"modern"""" machineguns) as well as the K98 bolt action rifle, all used the same cartridge in WWII, yet for some reason the developers have chosen to cut the machinegun's damage in half (how rediculously pathetic).  Just because everyone's running around trying to use them as room clearing weapons, doesn't mean that they were less effective (though I know of some very good reasons why they aren't as effective for room clearing operations -- too bad the developers don't).  I never got the chance to explore the USSR's arsenal at all before they made the game even worse (more about that in the next paragraph), so I cannot really comment on it.In their next update (the """"G""""), all of the maps were completely changed, which was nice for the """"leveling the playing field effect"""" that it had on all the players, but the introduction of huge amounts of brush, deliberate placement of inpenetratable wooden barriers to protect vehicles as they crossed  bridges, and the placement in some locations (such as on the airfield's runway just to deny fields of fire that were open in the previous update), completely made the game unplayable for tanks (the tanks could no longer support the infantry nor lock down ANY avenue of approach).  I can only speculate that the developer's deliberately chose to screw over the tank players because some people believe that they should be able to drive a jeep over a bridge while a tank is watching it (that's why the infantry can swim across the river, come up behind the tank and blow it up)!  But considering how often tanks were being destroyed by infantry in the """"F"""" update using anti-tank weaponry, I feel that in the """"G"""" update the fun to being in a tank has been lost completely (In my opinion, tanks should dominate the battlefield where they happen to be present, not the infantry, and that's why they need their own tanks to defeat them with).Now for the best part.  To """"protect"""" players upon spawning into a flag station (a capture point), the developers created a deployment zone where the spawning players are invisible until they leave it.  These are usually areas not far from the capture point.  The problem is, one can be maneuvering around to get a cleaner field of fire upon that capture point when they run into it.  Then the offender cannot fire (though they do become invisible as well) yet the spawning players can (I was killed once by accidentally driving my tank into one of these zones by the invisible infantry throwing AT grenades at me - another time, as an infantryman, I was trying to get into an alternate shooting position when I blundered into one, which totally screwed up my endeavor and wasted my time as well as the team's resources, though I was not immediately discovered either).This game has serious issues, not the least of which happens to be the ease of access to certain weapons.  I mean, when every player is running around with a machineguns trying to use them to clear rooms with, or an entire team is made up of only tanks... against infantry who in the """"F"""" update (at that time) were the only ones capable of capturing the points (so the tanks promptly lost every capture point in the game and the battle), there's a problem with the gameplay.  I've seen battles where one side were all tanks facing off against all snipers... It was rediculous!The game has potential, if the developer's get serious about correcting the problems, but I cannot recommend this game as of the """"G"""" update.  I'll look for something else to play instead.Follow Up Edit:After continuing to play the game and seeing the lack of improvement, I am convinced that this is the ABSOLUTELY WORST FPS I""""VE EVER PLAYED in twenty (20) years.1. The weapons are not seriously based upon the one's that they represent and perform completely unlike their real world counterparts.3. Their Armor Penetration statistics listed with the ammunition types are inaccurate (no where near what the real tanks were capable of in WWII).4. There's an emphasis on zergling-style infantry charges where everyone has their very own personal vehicles (but don't expect that vehicle to be there if u return to it since the game despawns them).6. The developer's installation of """"window dressing"""" on the runways which makes it impossible for the pilots to actually land on them (not to mention raising them, turning them into dikes...  (How many real airfields have you seen like that?).7. The maps are too small to decently maneuver around within.8. There's a lack of terrain & map diversity9. Even with a low ping (17ms), the packet loss attempts to crash my plane into the ground on attack runs10. The addition of amphibious vehicles for the infantry, allowing easy river crossings and thereby even easier methods of killing tanks (which I normally wouldn't mind having additional options, but it's rediculously easy to do this already).11. The inability to deploy one's Assault Teams at the start of the War (for the strategy aspect of it) that you have purchased (you have to purchase their deployment and there's no guarantee on having the resources ready - I've been in a queue that was over 5000 people long).  I played as Germany once and Berlin fell before I could even deploy either of my assault teams (one was infantry and the other was armor).12. The cross-country movement of vehicles is totally inaccurate (I've seen motorcycles flying full speed across farm fields, run up behind a tank and then plant anti-tank explosives on the tank... It's totally rediculous and false), yet travelling across a river crossing will slow your vehicle down...13. One cannot fire from the prone position unless the ground is flat (which makes for at least 75% of the map being unusable), so sniping is practically useless since one has to lie prone to get a decent stability level for long-range firing.14. Once a player joins a battle (and an individual gets no choice in what squad they're put into), they cannot leave it to go play elsewhere if they so choose.15. My character's (infantry, sniper, and paratrooper) have all died because of the inability to either shoulder / unshoulder their weapon quickly enough to escape a grenade (which there was plenty of time to do so), or to outshoot an opponent (because the weapon refused to come up to their shoulder).  This supposedly, is a """"known bug"""", yet the developers have done nothing about it.  This practically makes playing the infantry worthless because when I go to raise the weapon, it not only raises up, it goes back down (and sometimes), even goes back up and back down again...  There's absolutely no control, nor capability to seriously engage an opponent unless you simply """"run n gun"""" with a fully automatic weapon.I've played Nintendo 64's Goldeneye (and several others), Soldier of Fortune, Battlefield 1941, Battlefield Vietnam, Battlfield 2, Battlefield 3, and Project Reality - arguably one of the best FPS I've ever played, and Heroes & Generals doesn't compare.

So if you hated PL2, you'll hate this game.As soon as you hit rank 3 with ANY faction, you get COMPLETELY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ED by the game.Matchmaking suddenly becomes a broken mess, people are one-shoting you from across the map with tanks, you get bombed on by planes who fly so close to the ground in reality the bomb should have blown them up as well, you can't doâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥because your being spawncamped, you shoot a guy 3 times in the torso with a semi-automatic rifle only for him to one-shot you with a bolt action, ECT ECT.As soon as I hit rank 3, I was like """"Alright!

WHATS THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING POINT OF A TANK IF IT DOESN'T HAVE A CANNON ON IT? IT MIGHT AS WELL BE A SLOW JEEP WITH 2 MG'S ON IT AT THAT RATE.

Go switch to your german soilder whos rank 1, WHOOPS PUT YOU IN A GAME WITH A BUNCH OF RANK 8-15'S, HAVE FUN â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.I should probably mention, you have to rank each faction individually. But for some stupid â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing reason, as soon as ONE faction reaches rank 3, the other 2 factions get the benefits of hitting rank 3 even though they could both be untouched. Because everyone ranks on their own, you have to deal with the starting equipment and ribons and medals ALL OVER AGAIN WITH EACH FACTION, ONLY ADDING TO THE GRIND THIS GAME PRESENTS.This may be because I'm not a patient person to begin with, but this game is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing broken due to it's matchmaking and utter grindy-ness for each faction, that I can't recomend this to ANYONE.Unless you played this when it first came out and you're all geared up and whatever, get ready for this game to shove a 10 foot pole up yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and then shove a 20 foot pole into yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥while the 10 foot pole is still in there."",0"

"9264,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewHaG plays a lot like Red Orchestra II, except if the graphics were about 3 years older, and it had severe server and hitreg issues, and was """"Free to Play"""", but approaching Pay to Win, and had terrible balance, and...Let's say you just started. You're given a semi-automatic rifle and a pile of grenades. Seems not bad. The problem comes when you realize that that rifle, being only semi-automatic in a game with such atrocious servers, struggles to hit, and also takes far too many shots to kill. You can, of course, buy an SMG early on, as the game """"helpfully"""" directs you to. At that point, you are the god of CQC, at least until you're flanked by another fine gentleman with an SMG. But then, when you reach level 3, you're thrown into the big boys' servers. There, you get to play with enemy planes, tanks, paratroopers, and snipers. And of course the enemy side always has more of whichever is the most problematic for you. In my case, that turned out to be mainly tanks, with a side of pesky snipers. The tanks are hard to fight. As a foot soldier there is little you can do to start off.There is the occasional Panzerfaust (single shot) in a box which can be picked up. On some maps they're nonexistant, on others they're in locations vulnerable to enemy fire. Later on there is a reloadable rocket launcher to unlock, but I can't force myself to play long enough to get enough money for it. Most maps have a lot of open ground, which means tanks can spam from hundreds of meters away, and snipers can pick you off from similar distances.The game doesn't have a ping counter on the scoreboard, but I'm sure I'm getting at least 100, maybe 200 ms ping at all times. The deal is also sweetened by the fact that everything that matters is serverside. There have been many, many instances where you shoot a guy and even see the blood spatters, but the server doesn't count it as a hit.I can't reccomend that you play it at this point. Maybe it'll get better"
"9265,Heroes & Generals,2014.0,""Early Access Review Bad game. Game is 100% pay to win, tanks are op, teams are always going to be unbalanced, runs â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The only defence to tanks to rocket launchers but to be able to afford one would be easily 30 hours of grinding for money... leaving you with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ guns.   You have to repair your attachments for some stupid reason, I already paid aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ton of money to buy a gun and now I have to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing maintain them?? 3/10 would not re-download. Ok graphics, terrible spawns."",0"
"9266,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""My friend bought a tank crewman after grinding for 2 weeks. The starter tank is absolute garbage and I was further along so I grinded to buy a good two seater tank. I finnally got it and he had to buy the same tank to even be in the same squad, let alone game as me. Most greedy and anti-consumer developers in existence."",0"
"9267,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""H&G is a fun WW2 Arcade shooter. Updates are frequent, most of the official discussions are on their forums. Support has been fine for me. New renderer works fine if you have a new PC. Ping is the real enemy faction.Devs stream often and give sneak peeks/reveal information and sometimes take community input.I would say worth playing, at least checking out. It's free to try out and free to play. Vet membership averages around 7 bucks a month with some pocket gold to play with."",1"
"9268,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Uber pay to win!! The game was fun at the beginning cause they try to suck you in but soon after you will be going against people with tanks and planes and the best guns while you struggle just to keep your rifle repaired from game to game.. I would recommend playing it for about 40 hours and moving on to a more balanced, less money hungry game.."",0"
9269,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,this seemed like a fun game so i figured i would try it out but it seems if you are a new player you can't get into any games because your too low of a level to play any game modes except the beginning one,0
"9270,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Best part of this game was when they released the bicycle HAHA. Now i dont even have it installed :/ And when that came out it wasnt even close to being on here, And the american camo lol give me a break only camo was the frog camo. Almost had the mp44 then it went to pay to own, No more no thanks iam done. It was fun when i t was first released outside of steam now...... No."",0"
"9271,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""Unfortunately the devs stopped giving aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥about developing the game a while ago. Instead they try to maximize profit in a very consumer unfriendly way, making progress without spending loads of money on the game quite painfull."",0"
"9272,Heroes & Generals,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt used to be a Play to Win game, and it was fun. But then turned into a Pay to Win and now is justâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the game is also buggy.Edit 2: February 2017, decided to give the another shot to the game. At the first match the game gave me an error that made the game freeze and then crash. It took two weeks to have a reply of my ticket. Turns out I can't play at Steam and I lost a 24h premium that they don't have refunded. So yeah... This game is not worth your time."",0"
"9273,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is kinda enjoyable until you get to level 5 when it becomes a mess.you get terrible match making (3v6?) almost everyone is put into servers where they lag, and it takes ages to get into a game.once you get into war mode you find out how unbalanced it is, US get M1/2 spam cannon and destroy everything in CQB. all the Veteran players have more health and upgraded weapons that kill in one or two hits... still locked behind hundreds of hours of grinding or... pay. how about trying to take out tanks, grab a panzershreck and waste your credits trying to destroy tanks, every shot costs 200+ credits and you get less back from the tank.graphics from 2005 at best with massive texture pop and fog everywhere.

"9274,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewA great game if yu want to sit at your computer for 2 hours and earn 10,000 in-game credits. The gameis really fun probablly one of the most immersive WW2 FPS games. But it is really painful to play game after game and only get 3,00 credits when guns are 100,000 or more. If you can't grind with a really bad gun (starter rifles) then this is a not a good game I spent 300+ hours on it just to be able to get the m1903 rifle for the american's. I had to actually buy the thompson couldn't grind no more. The xp comes even slower.... so slow. I have only played with the american and he is a rank 6."",0"
"9275,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Product received for freeTried it for a short shooot while, and was almost directlyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥of by many diffrent aspects that made me yell more at the game than actually play it.The performance was good enough, i got a High end rig, BUT I also have 29"""" ultrawide screens.* The crossair is not adjustable which ends up filling my screen THE CHARACTERS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING ARMS AND WEAPON, just because I have a UltraWide screen* Just trying to join a battle with is impoissible as only my game seemed to bug out and not join the other...* They also have a system (anti cheat?) that BLOCKS the games input, meaning you cant move, quit or anything...

"9276,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI really do enjoy this game, its fun for me. But since recent updates, the game has simply felt pay to win and """"Whoever has more tanks wins no matter what""""."",0"
9277,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewIts just completely pay to win. So get to the main game aka tank vs jet (sorry propeller aircraft) vs infantry comabt you have to be level 5. Now the problem is its so hard to get to level up and ironically there is a membership program to level faster. Its a good game but its so pay to win.,0
"9278,Heroes & Generals,2016.0,""I have only a few hours on this game and while I went with an open mind, my first impresion are pretty bad. the UI is akward and counterintuitive and the game doesnt bother to explain to much about it's mechanics. You could argue that you learn them over time, but it's hella frustrating doing even that. However in spite of the crap UI the first few matches were okay, everyone seemed to have the same gear (semi-automatic rifles) untill someone came around the corner with smg and just mow you down, but hey I could get over it since it was just the lowly smg, but than all of a sudden i was put in the same match with players with superior gear with 1% chance of winning a duel, cause i was still stuck with the base rifle...progresion is steep and it's meant to be so to incentivise you to buy gold and get that nice gear.I wanted to like this game, but the UI, unbalanced matchmaking ruined it for me."",0"
"9279,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""It was a nice game back in a day. Now with last patch(es) they totally ruined many things,specially UI.Before: You could see list of active war battlesNow: You can't, You need to roam around generals' map to manually check every single battle if there are peopleBefore:100 players per faction at peak times,everyone active on chat willing to help etc.Now: over 1000 players per faction,not at peak times, noone helps out on chatBefore: Everything about assault teams was very clear and straight forwardNow: Game shows I got 0/1 active assault teams, but doesn't let me activate my assault teams on 2 characters,while on third character I easily ticket assault team and got it to 1/1 O.oBefore: You could see where you can spawn on map ingameNow: You can't, You have to click every spot to double check can You actually spawn there or not...Before: You could change your squad/character in combatNow: You can't"",0"
"9280,Heroes & Generals,2017.0,""I loved this game until the moment I reached gold ranking, at which point the game was complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, it is nothing but people who have overpowered weapons, spawnkillers and campers, you will not spend time in a gunfight you will spend time being killed by a person way too far away for your rifle to reach or being killed by an aeroplane, this is not me doing something stupid, no matter what you do there is no way to progress unless you hack, spawnkill or keep going and hating the game until you reach the level where you can then be impossible to fight.Great idea."",0"
