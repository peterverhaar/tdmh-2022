Bought mainly cause the commentsafter that game didnt dissappiont me. played as iceland got in a beef with people in north africacouple years later no more white people in iceland.  10-10 lovely random fuck 30-10 of make your own game of thrones world!
You made me so sad with this new update...
I've spent a long time playing CK II and enjoyed it but would I recommend it in its current state. I'm unsure. So many DLC components that to get the full game working costs over £130. That's a lot of money. DLC which often delivers functionality but not the graphics ... severe price gouging. They need a new model and it really leaves a bad taste in the mouth for me and many other players. SHameas the underlyingb game isn't bad.
Tutorial Sucks. dont know what it wants me to after reading directions over and over again. frustration with game is over 9000. might refund it
Complicated. Not user friendly. Hard to understand what's going on. Not fun...
It would be good if the CKII collection sold all the expansions instead of just picking and choosing.
Extremely Buggy for Maccrashes all the time and has other issues. Don't reccomend it if you intend to play it on a Mac. Otherwise it's a good game.
Sure going to pay 300 bucks for all that DLC or start playing a game that thus feels like half a product. Are you on cracked cocaine paradox?
Why does every paradox title seem to suffer from the patented paradox tiny text syndrome? All the money you make from DLCs and you can't afford to implement a 'font size' option? Or at least set the default size from 'migraine-inducing microscopic' to 'somewhat readable if you squint really hard'. That'd be a 1000% improvement.  I shouldn't have to rent the hubble telescope off NASA just so I have the ability to read your damn games' text.
I love this game.... but.... why does the DLC collection feature only like half of the DLCs? Its very misleading. It doesnt include Old gods or Son of Abraham its kinda stupid. Its very hard to recommend when i couldve had to pay 80$ for half of the gameit makes the game stupidly expensive.
Easily one of the best Grand Strategy games. Crusader Kings II masterfully combines complex game mechanics with an easy-to-learn user interfaceas players rule realms spanning from the 900-1450AD. Players must make economicdiplomatic
My philandering as a minor Irish lord led to the assassination of Charlemagne and the decline of Christianity in Europe. --11/10--Would start inbred Irish Empire and cleanse peasant revolts with fire again...
That feel when you're on to some real big expansions of a good empire and a ruler that is loved by all is replaced with a cravenarbitrary 6 year old child who's weak because your first in line dies in battle.  That feel when the regent is replaced by a family member who wants your titles and is an unmovable -100 opinion  That feel when your glorious empire that you spend hours growing crumbles into rebellion and disarray.  10/10 would rage and cry at again.
Not my cup of tea 4/10
I thinking Thatcher Thialf game has a lot of improving ti do espessially in the graphics department. i meanderende Thialf game rücksichtslos Dickens because it is bad. Complete waste of ur Monegaskische and ur time.
This game is incredibly complex and tedious.
this game is way too confusing i have no idea what the fuck is going on and the explaination or learn scenario makes no sense it dsnt even say anything and dsn tell u to unpause game and i dont even know whats happening
The problem I had with this game is it is really difficult and time consuming to learn. I spent more time watching user created youtube videos than playing the game.   This game doesn't have any playable tutorial (only some in game description of things) and instead expects you to learn the game from user generated content.
i have no idea what to do. the tutorial doesnt show you how to do a damn thing so fuck the devs for that and there is so much dlc that finding a server with the same version as yours is impossible so dont think your gonna get to ask other players for help
I used to like Crusader Kings II. I stopped playing for a little while then updated the game to play again. It is now as if all of my saves are worthless because they changed the game so significantly that my armies and whole kingdom makes no sense under the new rules. It looks like Paradox has lost a good customer.
game stoped working i want my money back
Game crashes on 'Loading sounds...'  Back to EU4  0/10
Was 'fun' in the beginning but now it's seems to developing in to a money grap.
I clearly don't have enough patience for this kind of game. I've heard if you take the time to learn it's really a lot of fun! I'm more of a casual gamer so extensive learning before you begin playing isn't fun to me. That's cool if you do and this game is for you!

I am sure this game is amazingand fun to play...but the learning curve and the sheer amount of things you need to know in order to play this game just intimidates me.   Don't let this review steer you away from trying this game.
Bought the game only to figure out i dont have access to many featuresbecause DLC nightmare. Go to hell Paradox.
The game is constantly crashing. Paradox make that every their updates a trap for everyone that don't buy their DLC. I will never more buy any of their games or DLCs. Illegal version oddly were fair more stable and reliable that original version when you are playing long timelines.
This game used to be a very fun game but I just can not find it in me to enjoy it anymore. I truly wish that the developers would STOP MAKING DLC for this and just make a sequel already its long past time to make one imo. While I do enjoy seeing a developer supporting their older games I HATE IT when a developer does not progress and instead just continues to update the same game making very minor tweaks half the time at a certain point which this game is LONG PAST it just becomes boring plain and simple. No matter how many little new baby death screams or children education bs that gets added in at the end of the day its the same game. SO MAKE A NEW ONE ALREADY
VERY difficult to start playing. User interface is horrible. Spent my first hour fucked off at this game. Not worth my aggravation to try to figure it out.
Didn't realise how lacking in visuals this game wasbit to turn based for me
Long time Civ player. This game was not for me. Refunded because I already have a strategy game fix and the interface for this game is too obtuse for me to want to learn how to play. Hopefully Steam will honor my refund since I'm barely at the 2 hour mark.  It's probably not a bad game for those of you willing to learn the UI and really dive into it. I originally purchased it on the recommendation of several friendsand I can respect why they enjoy it for its historical worldbuilding and potential depth. I just genuinely can't handle the UI design. Bittersweet.
I wanted to like this game but it seems like I wasted many hours figuring out how to play only for the game to be unplayable. After sinking hours into building my dynasty I boot up the game and find it crashes every time I try to load a save. It seems like this is a problem other people have experienced and there is no complete fix for it only a hodgepodge of suggestions that may or may not work (didn't work for me).  At least I know to avoid this developer in the future. I'm not sure if its the time or the money I wasted that I'm more upset about.
My favourite part was when some hacker fuck stole my CD Key so I wouldn't be able to play
Shortly: I want to like itbut no.
After playing this game for several weeksone simple free patch made it unplayable. It is impossible to contact anyone in support. All e-mails are generated by a computer. Game support is the worst of any that I have ever been involved with. Save your money and frustration. Do NOT pay a dime for this game!!
Great conceptbut too dependent on DLCs to make it a fun game. I look for games to play not cash cows to pay... notice how there's no 'L' in pay. I should not have to pay to play and enjoy the game for which content the company was too lazy to put in or rather attempt to make money off.
You will lose. Over and over. Your vassals will hate you. Their armies will be bigger than yours. You will lose. Be Charlemagne. You lose. Be William the Conquerer. You lose. On easyyou lose. This game sucks. 0/10
The game seems funbut the tutorials are absolutly terrible.
LOL What the fuck was i thinking.
I really want to like this gamebut the tutorial does not explain how to play it and I am bad at guessing
Screen is oversized and doesnt show start menu buttons. Unplayable. free for a week thoughThanks for not being like all the othe guys and stealing my money for unplayable games.
game wont load for me
-Installs game of thrones mod -Creates custom High Valyrian count of Elyriaof the dynasty Valkyrienno dragons in the whole world -Has 6 children -Forms kingdom of North Valyria -3 generations of incest later... -106 Dynasty members
the game cant even launch
It's shit
The DLC is far to expensive!
dont buy this shit
The way the load/save game system works is terrible. They don't explain some things in the tutorial which kind of screwed me over in the gamehaving to start over because of these things isn't very enjoyable for such a long game.
Would be a good game if I could load into it :/  (Get EU4 not this heap of ****)
Too much DLC that is just fluff or major game changes for the sake of changes. Like the conclave dlc. Which turns every kingdom into the BEmpire. Which means that you have vassals who have 'power' and there for if you dont bow to their whims they will rebel. ALL the time. It cannot be stopped. The game only gives so many spots for power. All the slots filled up? Too bad going to nag and rebel anyway because you didn't bow to my 'Power' The only ONLY way I found to deal with this problem is to build up a massive pile of gold. Which isn't fun. Not to mention that before the conclave DLC vassuals would just go 'King who has been ruling for 40+ yearsthis 0 year old should be in power.' THE fuck? I have not played this game since Conclave DLC and I do not plan on playing this game again. I dont know who Paradox is making this DLC for either the money probly or they have their head so far up their  that they think that their fuck ideas are the best things never but ingoring what their players say.
From the Makers of DLC Universalis Paradox the Greedy Harlot brings you a NEW slew of DLC's to ruin your day. Don't buy this crap.
Most unpleasant game with greediest publisher and overpriced dlcs Hate it and addicted
I Still have no idea what I'm doing.
So much some new information... The Game is hard for new player's familiarization(for me). I think game should be more attractive for beginners.
unless you buy all the dlcyou are basically locked to central europe
Buy a game without even having acess to some of a basic game features for 40 euros. Or buy an acutal game to be able to use all it's aspects and actually enjoy it then. For 145euros.
Cost of game : 270 kr. Cost of DLC : 1392 kr(separate) or 1059 Kr(in a package). Be aware of how small a part of the game you buy when you buy the 'main' game.
why so much dlc!!!!
I Bought the crusader kings II collection for 100$ and it keeps crashing at the first loading screen and this irrates me greatly. i would like there to be a patch for this bug.
IT IS VAREE HAD
At first this game looked playable and I love in depth strategy but this game was exhausting just to try and learn. Give your uncle this titlebla bla bla. When can I club a hooker?
Great gameunfortunately more than 40! DLC. No thank you.
game makes no sense im not sure what im supposed to do and the tutorials dont explain enough...
This is a more political version of Civilazation 4 and as we all know politics is where the fun lives.
It's a shame what paradox do to their games.
good game but the dlc is fucking obnoxious. costs 100+  to actually play the gamenot worth it imo.
Game constantly crashes. Can't recommend until it's fixed.
CK2 just bogs you down with a lot of considerations over long and slow-paced games.  Ultiimately it doesn't provide enough enjoyment per time investment.
Pros Great conceptsgreat ideas. Cons Poor implementation. Buggy UI. Intermittant crashes.  This game was praised to be Game of Kings the video game. Its not bad but I would not go that far by a mile.
This game should not be this difficult. I am in learn senario mode and the easiest learn how to attack a country via fleet combat is all but impossible because my army is 3500 people but my fleet wont combine correctly to take them. Yes I hired all the merc ship companies the senario gives you and raised my vasal fleet levies. I think this game could be a great game but the simple mechanics are just too obsecure. If i have to google and youtube game mechanics during the learn senario portion this means you have design gameplay issues
this game sucks
The games WAY to complicated to me.... I don't understand what it wants from me........... It uses these OLD WORDS.... WHO DOES THAT??? AND WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO THAT???
I have a tiny cock this game requires a horse cock to enjoy to the fullest.
This game is one of the most boring things I've played go buy Civ 5
Installed but cannot play. When launched only the map with no buttons to push to start the gamemultiplayer etc Please help!
Do I recommend this game?  I don't know. It's the first game I've spent almost 50 hours inand I still understand nothing about it.  Overly complex is the first quality that comes to mind. Good or bad? I have no fucking idea.
This is totally fuckt. I cant even choose non christian countiries because ? need a dlc which is more expensive than the game. So this is what the game industry became
very difficult menus and sub par tutorial
Do not buy this game. Unplayable at purchase and Steam refused to reimburse and then threatened to terminate my account. Quit using steam for a couple years as a result.
Wish there was a better tutorial
sucks so bad I want my money back.
I couldn't point-and-click :c
Mehit bored me too much
It loaded to loading sounds and crashed
The game is interesting but it's riddled by greed from the autors trying to squeeze money from player with every little change trought DLCs and with bugs.  For instance (amongst others) there is this outstanding bug in Mac for more then one year where the top of the screen gets a black bar and pushes the content down making the game unplayable. After one yearthere's still no fix for it.
A flawed game. I enjoyed it for a while but the more I played the more I disliked many of the mechanics. I felt there was not much scope for interesting stratagies and it felt as if I was just making the obvious desition every time.
russians and spyware
Thumbs up if you love this game :-)

I love strategy gamesthis game feels like a chore to play!
Cuckolding the kings of Europe has never been easier   Which is why I can't recommend it until they rebalance Way of Life and fix the AI
Fantastic game overallwith $220 worth of dlc needed to play the full game on top of the $40 you already payed for the base game.
Font size are not configurable and way too small. Since it's a very text dependent game and that it burns my eyes to try and read that just makes it unplayable.
0/10 Mongol Faces Pack
I found this game overly complex and hard to navigate from the start. There is no in game tool bar guide to help you learn the basic movements let alone even attempt the more complex ones. That is unfortunate because the content is excellent as is the story lines you can evolve. Also a BIG drawback for me is all the DLC's and added material you MUST BUY to play effectively with others or solo. I do not want to be forced to go to YouTube to view other peoples' play and hints. I will not buy this game....
Game of thrones without a proper 'game'.  You must buy a dlc to play your mouseand another dlc to press 'a' button on your keyboard. And don't forget about breathe you can't breath unless buy this 20 dollar dlc.
you need all the dlc's to play the game more than 1 day
very costly for DLCs that should be free (great deal if sale is on)
Found this to be hard to get the hang of.
The game has been seriously broken for almost a monthbroken as in the AI cannot declare war! the company show little haste in addressing this issue. I would avoid this game until the developers stop messing about with it and leave it in a fixed state!
I wanted to enjoy this game but I just couldn't keep up with all of the superfluous dlc the company are continuously releasing.  I refuse to support any company who operates in this fashion.
This game sucked. Very bad instructions on how to play.
I really like and enjoyed this game but along with a lot of frustration cause bugs and some mechanics. No place to write it all down here if someone want to find it there is a lot about it on forum. Overall game is fun and worthy to get. But where come to terms of time you will spend in this game and money to make it proper (by buying DLC) it's not worthy anymore. Prices of DLC are RIDICULOUS and amout of them also. Some of DLC bring bugs which aren't fixed even after few months after release. You don't have to buy it all of course but u will stick to christian nations only with limited options it's playable sure but in long term boring for me. So now - NO leater complete pack yea.
Crusader Kings is too expensive and confusing.
Difficult to figure out how to play. Lacks any good tutorial or help
Patched out murdering your children 0/10
A game whose difficutly comes from its interface designrather than the strategy at its core.
Was to confusing to meI spent the whole time trying to firgure out how to play.   Would not recommend considering the abundent of other strategy choices out.
Watch outwe're dealing with a new EA wannabe over here.  What next? 'Save and Exit To Main Menu' DLC??
Hard and Boring -Plays as Holy Roman Empire -2 PEACEFUl years pass by -5 tiny provinces delcare independence -Gets rekted even though we outnumbered them 2 to 1 -The war for independence apparently stops for no reason saying that I won the civil war as clearly in the war I had -28 war score -Ragequits when 1/2 of the HRE rebel
Was to confusing to meI spent the whole time trying to firgure out how to play.   Would not recommend considering the abundent of other strategy choices out.
Crappy DLC policy. Thieves.
The hundreds of hours it appears I've spent playing this game are the hundreds of hours I've spent on the launcher trying to get it to work. Do not purchase.
Crappy game without dlc
i managed to fix the game myself no thanks to steam or paradox. if you like troubleshooting game errors and program issues by yourself then get this game. if you like games that work as they are when you purchase themthen you probably want to spend your money on a different game
I found this game pretty fuck -
Not Much to do.
really good game. but too much dlc's and random factors. good luck is more important than a good strategy
Good gamebut need buy more DLS...
Incredibly boring game of Menu simulator 2012. If you enjoy a game based entirely on nothing but menus and random events that you have little control of this may be for you.
This game is absolutely impossible. I've read guides on the easiest way to start and still get stomped on. You literally wait and wait and wait and your armies get no bigger and you get stomped on by whomever you make a claim on.  Also buggycrashes on load screen. If you exit to main menu and go into a new game you can't click on land or units. Crashes often while playing. Not worth $40+.
Takes forever to learn. Billion menues and systems in place. After you've figured everything out the game turns out to be incredibly shallow and you can barely do anything except go around and kill stuff and wait for fuck to happen.
Cost WAY too much money.
This is a great game. If it doesn't crash on you. Which it does every time you play it. You advance through the game until you come to a crash. Every time. And the worst part? The logs are a joke! Nothing is there to give you a hint why it's crashing. This is totally  unacceptable ! With 2GB GeForce GT740 and 5GB  FREE  RAM it's simply unacceptable!!! I wish I never payed for this $#%*!@.
I really want to like this game i honestly do there is so much cool about it howeverThe lack of interaction and tutorials dosen't let me enjoy this game
I've recentyl bought this game... But i cannot play for 15 minutes proper game due to random crashesruntime errors etc... And i cannot find any usefull advice for fix. I try 4 times reinstall the game and vcredit++ etc.... I strongly suggest do not play this game until they fix the crash issues...
i advise people to get medieval 2 total war. crusader kings 2 just sends you into the game no tutorial or not an easy to find one so you don't now to play nor what the objective is
keeps crashing on loading sound regardless of what I do
Wait stop do not buy this. There are so many things wrong with the game. They try to trick you into buying all this stuff but it dosent work. The unit packs are badly made and they value it. To just advance you have to by the dlc. They dont allow you to play any of the non christian characters untill you buy the dlc. 2 out of 10
This game is poop. I want to kill stuffnot read long texts and do boring stuff like marriage
Not as good as the first one.
Fun for a bitbut terrible military strategy piece makes it no fun for me at this point.
I spend more time arguing with my vasssals and putting down rebellions than I do doing aything else this new conclave addition has completely changed the game I would like to see it made optional but until then it is far too tedious and seems more like a chore than a game at the moment.
It's not finished yet.  This game is entertainingbut still too bug-ridden to recommend right now.   If Paradox can fix all the CTDs then maybe I will flip. Here's an idea Paradox: how about putting some error-checking into your code instead of just unceremoniously crashing?! You might want to think about it....maybe?!   You have mod support but no error checking. Absolutely brilliant.
Money stealing devs witholding content in DLCs and witholding content within the DLC in DLC Content Packs. Disgustingespecially the portrait packs.
As a fan of alot of Paradox Interactives games i figured I'd enjoy this one too. Unfortunately I found it kind of dull and limiting. It might be unfair though as EU IV was my first love.
Does not appear to work correctly on my computer. (Alienware Alpha)
The game UI is really poor and hard to understand. The tutorial does not help as it is quite bad. I gave up after 30 minutes. Would not recommend this game.
It was laggyand I have a good computer.  Like I have intel hd graphics-first generation by the way  4 gigs of ram.  core i3  I have the best computer in the world and I cant run this game
I find the game slow and boreing plus the tutorial is crap cause there isnt one nothing to help learn how to play!
Tried the tutorial... after clicking around and not getting any guidanceI uninstalled. Guess 8 minutes is my threshold for no information.
I downloaded the game for free and tried to play it after playing it for a day or so and then it said i needed purchase it. And when i tried to purchase it it said i already had it in my steam librarybut it still doesn't allow me to access it.
i think i should go for stronghold crusader 2 than play this strategy gameits to hard for me
After pouring about 2 hours into CK2I still have very little clue of what it is about. Whole UI is a mess..
Still cant play CK2 on windows 10:(
Just get EU4it's what this game would be like if paradox took the time to turn this into a half-decent Grand Strategy game.
The most CONFUSING thing i have ever played. I bet its an ok game but i was just amazed by the amount of stuff i had to do and watch for in order to not loseso much stuff that it was not fun for me at all but frustrating. so unless you are willing to spend alot of time trying to learn the things this game has to offer then fine but just saying theres alot of stuff this game has for you to learn.
This game is unplayable on a UHD monitor. The user interface is sub microscopic with no way to change it. Unless you have an old sub-HD monitor lying aroundgive this one a skip.
Haven't played the completed game yet as waiting for the dlcs to be a reasonable price.
fun game but all this DLC you have to pay for ... 75% of it should be included with the game... Im shocked they didnt have DLC for volume and graphics options aswell...
brillant wene it worked it worked on windows 8 then crashed and whouls'nt come back I get a blanck screnn on xp and vista I don't have windows 7 so it was the biggest wast of money ever!
Bought the collection assuming i would get everything for that ridiculous price. boy they sure do fool you by putting all of those terrible useless dlcs in it to make it look like it inludes everything. base game isnt even worth playing and their collection doesnt include most of the big dlc. cannot reccomend at the current price point. the 2% of this game you can play for 40$ is almost playable. i think all of the dlcs would be amazingly fun but getting ripped off by their 'collection' isnt very fun
Why the UPPDATTEEESSSS!!!
I cant really explain it but this game is infuriating in all the worst ways. I dont know how people can stand it. Alsoa good half of the characters/realms in the game are dlc. Consistently had a bug which caused me not to be able to claim certain strong claims.
It's an interactive atlas like most Paradox games of this genrebut this game has the added benefit of playing the Sims. 11/10. Best game I've seen since I watched Nekopara.
Croatian citys misplaced -rate from me (i mean wtf Dubrovnik in serbia)
the hell is this dumb crap
Overly complicated and not very fun.
How do you play this game
Bought this game awhile ago and enjoyed it immensely. Thought about playing it again 'cause I haven't for a long time. 50 new DLC packs I am too intimidated to play. Thank you Paradox.
Always crashes in the loading scene !!! i couldt even play !!!
Only for autistic people.
cant play cause crashes every 5 years or so on auto saves and if not that it crashes when i save the game
Constant glitches and crashesparticularly when trying to save. Have never finished a game all the way through to the end due to hard crashed on certain years.
This game was extreamly fun for the 6 hours i played it. But other then that the game is one huge buggy mess. I think the main thing that has caused me to not play is the fact i can not play it. It refuses to launch and i have tried all known fixs. None have worked.
-1
It's possibly one of the most annoying and difficult to learn games I've ever played. If you want to play a game about conquering Europe then go get Medieval Total Wae 2
Tutorial is broken and can't be completed.
way overly complicated with a subpar tutorial. there doesn't seem to be a way to easily learn the game before being overwhelmed.
Be very careful with Paradox.   I bought this gameand now Paradox has changed the EULA.  They now require me to either   a) delete the game that I had paid and never play it again b) ALLOW THEM TO SPY ON ME FOR MARKETING PURPOSES WHILE I PLAY THE GAME THAT I HAD PAID  They had gone full-Microsoft obviously.
Tutorial is broken. Will not go past where you unload troops on the northern island. Has done this seven times in a row. I am done.
This game is THE best example what happens when you have an awesome game and then the developers attempt to milk it with DLC to the point of ruining what made it wonderful. With the introduction of certain DLC (biggest offender being Conclave) a great deal of what made the game fun was tossed out the window. Extremely sad :(
At some point it's down to clicking through the people finder to identify vulnerable heirsand that's not fun.
Not really that good without all the DLCall said and done.
Game has a lot of depth if you have the time or patience to learn it. You'd like this if you've even an inkling of interest in history. PersonallyI couldn't get into it
More like DLC kings because Paradox just wants you to fork over money for their subpar DLC that should already be in the game.
I am unable to read any of the menus or text in the game because they are too small. There is no option to increase the size of the font. Forum posts suggested a mod but the mod causes a crash to desktop at start. The game is unplayable to me as it is.
just crack it if you really want to play it that muchits not like paradox bothered to ever make the multiplayer actually functional or anything
I have no clue hw to play this game. It super confusing
Crusader Kings is the single most infuriating game I have ever played. My friends and I only wanted to have fun but our eyesthey bled.
This has to be the worst game ever....
fucking shitty game is sooo not worth it
I really wanted this game for a few years now but after playing it during a 'free 2 play weekend' I changed my mind. It's not as great as I thought it was nor does it even come close to the Total War Series. After seeing there's no naval battles or ways of preventing the enemies from dropping off armies on my land via ships it's not worthwhile. Also so many things are limited which can only be accessed via the DLC which I refuse to waste money on. Just because a game releases DLC that took no effort in making doesn't mean it should raise the individual game's price.
This game is so boring
The game is really good overall but the facts that this game has no Unicode support and the only up-to-date localization is English make me think that 40 for this game is a bit too much especially when updates and new DLC are constantly relased for this game.
A quick look at the paradox forums will tell you that this game is in perpetual beta hell because Paradox keeps release DLC's without properly testing themeven old bugs from two updates ago are still there. Now the game has gamebreaking bug like AI not disbanding troops during peacetime.  Don't bother with this game if you are not prepared for bugfest.
Played it for a couple of minutestoo much history
This game is so boring
Good:   + Historical Context + Roleplay Possibility... ...but broken by lack of graphic design (sold as DLC) which breaksdown immersion   Bad:  - Tutorial Essentially Broken (still in 2016) - Unintuitive User Interface (UI) - Lack of creativity in graphic design (Graphics sold as DLC) - The game core is around character interaction but character portraits are DLCs - DLC for music in game? - DLC for Unit Packs?   DLCs should add something extra to the game here the DLCs looks like are got cut out from the main game to be sold as DLC
dont buy it it will crash
Unplayable due to ludicrously small interface size which apparently has no options to increase or remotely alter. I tried mods and settings on windows itself but these either did nothing or made it crash. Then I realised I had spent half an hour just trying to get the game into a playable state and it simply was not worth the effort. How any competent company can release such a badly designed game is beyond me. My eyes are still hurting.
I'd rather fill out crossword puzzles than play this game.
I do not like the game because i do not know what to do. I do not recomend this game to people who doesn't understand complicated english.
I feel like this is an amazing game but as I dont have 2 months to devote to studying guides on game mechanics and interface concepts I am unable to enjoy it. I may be an idiot because I really wanted to like this game but it played more like a video that paused to tell me how badly I was doing every ten minutes and then proceeded to continue giving me messages I didnt understand and flashing colors that meant nothing to me. This game is like the cockpit of a 747 passenger planeIf you wanna learn all the buttons and fly it you can have a good time but if you sit down expecting to understand everything immediatly you're gonna have a bad time.
Wow! Steep learning curve and some very strange game mechanics ! Its like the fun has been subtracted from this title no wonder its 75% off! Avoid!
I find it impossible to recommend this game mostly because of how I am treated on the forums every time a buggy release comes out and people ask 'where is the quality control' then the army of moderator backed fan boys comes and insults you and if you dare argue back the nazis moderator bans you for 'trolling'. Not the guy who told you to go 'f' yourself no he's off to insult the next person with dissenting opinions with no consequences. High inital investment in paradox games makes you chase the dlc hoping for just another dlc for them to finally fix the gigantic problems they design into the game from the beginning. DO NOT BUY.
I played this game for a few hours one day and I never figured out how to play it. The tutorial was all over the place and of little help.
This game is absolutely horrible takes forever to do anythingand you need a reason to invade anything and when you start they set a lot of other territories equal to those around it. So if you attack then your most likely are gonna fail. It's boring and overly complex when all you want to do is invade those around you.
You can tell this was made by some nerdsbecause the UI is atrocious and they put Wikipedia links in everybody's profile.
way too confusing a game and the tutorial is not very helpful no wonder it does not sell
Multiplayer is completely broken and unplayable do not get this if you're looking to play with friends.
To much DLC
waaaaayyyy too complicated. It would take me all day for a week to learn how to play this game. It's got the complexity of Total War x10.
Tried playing this game during the free week trial. Kept getting run time errors whenever I launched the game. The only available technical helpand place to ask for such help is locked away in a PRIVATE forum in which you have to have purchased the game to have access too. Outrageous.
Way to complicated. No really good help or in game tutarial. I spent two hours trying to work it out and still no wiser how to play it.
the poor mans europa universalis IV
Not playable - cannot see the menu on my 2560x1440 monitor. Impossible to change resolution - no menu. :-(
What type of crap is this. Can't even figure out how you play
yeah nooo.... dont know how to play it. lost i think/when my first leader died of ageI gave up.....
the base game feels very limited not a ton of content for the price. i really dislike that a lot of the more intresting factions to play as are dlc only. dlc every where i cannot support a company that choses to use buisness pratices like this. should of been called dlc kings
The game is one hig bug I cant even play normal game. Also there is no wat to acces your save files.
This game is as fasinating as watching paint dry. It is not user friendly at all. To make it even moderately interesting you have to pay out of the ears for DLC for every detail.
MAN fuck THIS GAME I CAN'T EVEN fuckING PLAY IT AFTER THE UPDATE! IT WON'T fuckING LAUNCH NOW AND IT JUST STARTS TO CRASH WHEN I USE THE DLC I fuckING BOUGHT! SO fuck THIS GAME FOR fuckING DO THIS TO ME AND fuck THE PEOPLE WHO UPDATED IT! fuckING DUMBASS fuckfuckfuckS.
The worst. Not fun at all.
What is going on? Reading stories about people playing the game is sadly more interesting then actually playing it. Go play something else.

text is unreadable on a large screen
I'm surprised they didn't try to sell the main menu to me as DLC.
I really dislike the new dlcs. Game is way to easy now. I use to love this gamebut now I just hope they make a ck3 so they can get back to the basics of it again.
i dont know what i am doing
Rip my 150 euros :( A friend said it was a good game. I but my brother in prison and murderd him at the start. And pepole hated me for it wonder why!? Then i made a child. And prisoned him and killed him aswell. Then i died but i was such a nice guy. Oh well nice quality though
Dont buy or download. Crashes at load screen and ALL of the 'solutions' posted online do no work. Have not been able to play game since purchase.
Not much here to do. Boring.
Lags too much to play
cool idea... but not a fan of the implememtation...
Pretty much thought it would be age of empires... Nope...
I feel like this game was a bit too complicated for me and I didn't like the formatting.  Sorry if anyone disagrees to my opinion (I saw this had very positive as a average review rate.)
The game crashed and I spent 20 minutes staring at my desktop before I realised it wasn't the game.
All the DLC's and paid updates are making me unable to enjoy the game.
Complicated doesn't mean better. You have to pay for most of the fun options and it does not give you any real clue as how to playleaving you stranded. I prefer the original.
fuck after the update always crush on loading
All the DLC's and paid updates are making me unable to enjoy the game.
There has been no official Chinese?bad!
.
50 cent played this i pluto
That thing DOES. NOT. WORK. on some computers.
lotta the dlc is just texture packs and as i play this game on my microwave and dont need texture packsits fine. just be ware there is a 20-40$ extra cost inr required DLC. so wait for a sale or dont buy.
Crash Kings II* But fun if u have patience.
you can be muslim  well not exactly you have to pay money  to muhummed  allahu ............ akbar allaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh taaaaaaaaaaaakkkkkkkkkkkkbbbbbbbbbbbbbiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr INSHA'ALLAHU AKBAR
All i can say is the DLC cost more than the game.
I'm too broke for all those DLC's
Nowhere have so many been micromanaged by so few.
DLC: The Strategy Game
any game that crashes on start up obvouisly shows that the developers need a few slaps to the head to realign their brain
just buy it 
SteamOS/Linux version crashes in under 5 minutes every time I start a new game.  Unplayable.
fuck ass game. dont play it. it is soo bad. i do not recommend this game.
The game looks amazingbut will not run on my computer. I have a high end gaming PC and every time I try to load it up it freezes.
way to hard and complicated... i just tryed the game and found it way to complicated... thank goodness i didnt buy the game!
Far to confusing. Not much is explained even after playing the training campain several times
its too complicated i cant even do the tutorial
The game looks so aweseme that I had to buy it and the DLC. The problem is that it is the hardest to learn game I have ever seen in over 30 years of computer gaming. I just can't grasp it but I wish I could.
If you want to brood again and again about why things won't work that should work and about what you can do at all - then it's your kind of game. If notthen not.
dude i dont even know how to play this game so i cant say crap.
Bugged peace of fuck
Pile of fuck. No idea what to do. Try suggestions at the top? OK. Can't do it not enough prestigecan't do it not enough money.  Garbage waste of money
fucking unstable game. Feels like it's in early access.
not impressed so farcrashes on launch every time
Do you enjoy staring at tiny icons marching back and forth across a static screen? What about clicking through various spreadsheet like pages and sliders? Then this game is for you!
Way too complicated. A better tutorial is needed.
The only good Paracucks game is one that is no longer being spammed with new DLCsand that being said this game is currently garbage.
i cant play this really all i can do is scroll around and do nothing
Not great! 0/10 im bored as hell... total waste of time 'don't even try it'
after 20 seconds ingame all the buttonsoptions are responsabilities got to me and i had to ALT+F4. This game is hella scary!
I was having a really nice time playing CKII until a new patch broke my savegame. Countless hours of play are gone. If you want to get similar experiencethis is definitelly game for you. Otherwise stay out.
fucking paradox and their sheckle hoarding ways
Please research the game VERY WELL before you make a final purchase! This is one of those games that can be very overwhelming and confusing to learn. I played for 5 hours straight... And pure frustration has led me to pursuit a refund.   BEWARE!
These game is hot fuck! 6/9 Times I played it I literally cummed on the screen!
Guys game became unplayable I can't run it anymore after past patches despite the fact that it used to work perfectly and I've not changed anything in my pc all solutions online didn't work for me and support won't do anything unless it's recognized as a bug. Don't waste your money and get another game.
You have like 10 things to doe.g. become a pilgram or tax the jews. Combat consists of watching numbers on the screen go down. Total war series is much more enjoyable
This was a great game until the patch was released. Now it just crashes to desktop... a lot. I think I discovered what the *paradox* is... the patch totally fucked it up. It will probably be another 4-6 months before another patch is released. Avoid until fixed.
literally the dumbest fucking game ever created and i wish they had steam refunds when i bought this garbage
I loved Europa Universalis IVfigure'd I'd give this game a try. I honestly don't like it. 4/10
How can a game of such complexity not offer a thorough tutorial at the beginning? Almost impossible to learn the basics. No thanks.
Game is fun. Too much DLC.
I've played over 6 hours of this gameand I still haven't the slightest clue as how to be any level of talented in this game.
what the fuck do I do?
dont buy this game crash crash and close by it self if u know how to help pls help
The game has issues right from the get go. Difficulty with resolution. On my Lenovo 1920x1080 res. Yet this game with the same res is settings is about 4x larger. The launcher starts in the bottom right corner and wont move. Very disapointed. Cant even play
wtf is this confusing thing they call a game?
If you like reading endless tooltips only to be more confused than before this game is for you. User interface is the stuff nightmares are made of. Play Medieval II Total War and save youreslf a headache.
so i dont know how to swich it to english because its in german or something so i have no clue how to play it i need to know how to play it for a full and better rating 1 out of 5 stars sorry
A somewhat dry turned based strategy.  I found I couldn't muster the patience to learn this game. The game literally gives you no direction as to what you should be doing in game.  Perhaps some other time.
was bought as a gift played it once....i dont play board games on a pc thats just....idiotic and fans that play need to go outside
cant really get into it if you are new to this. the tutorials are even more confusing and half of them didnt even work. if you are a true hardcore fanwilling to spend 100+ hrs to understand the game (wich is clearly NO FUN BUT WORK) this is prolly ur game.  or if you are autistic.
Spent a day trying to resolve start up crash issuesfollowed all advice on forums still not working. Submitted a ticket for a refund. Buyer Beware.
Have not enjoyed. The campaign map is aesthetically dull and the gameplay is essentially like a board game simulator but without humans to play with and with added annoying interruptions. Possibly just not my thing.
non-PhDs need not apply.
overall game play are ok
it was very confusingand the ruler u could be was randomly generated and they were very ugly.....
great idea but very slow to start and takes way to long to learn the concept/ basics.
idk wtf is going on in the game and i'm not the type of person who will do research on the internet just to understand a game.
Too much going on in this and not enough clear help either. Medievil so much better
Worst experience with bugs since 'BattleCruiser 300ad'
I played this game for 23 hours and still couldn't work out how to play it. Does that mean I am fuckfuck?
I only played it for a day and i know nothing about paradox games. But i have no intention of changing that. This game costs 150 euros. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY to get the whole game. You either do that or you get to play version where you can't do half the stuff. Thats kind of funny but also frightening. Seriouslyend this DLC fuckt.
Because of serious crashes which occur every 5-10 minutes this game is unplayable right now. Devs recommend to not use the latest patch whithout patching the game on their own. The crashes seem to disappearif you buy the DLC 'Sons of Abraham'. But I never buy a DLC to be able to simply play the game.
Not worth the money.
If you like games that are overly complicated that are in depth with insane amounts of dipolmacy you should get this.....  Personally - I don't like that kind of game - so i'm giving it a NEGATIVE REVIEW
The tutorial is so simple and rubbishin game hints are useless and the overall replayablity i think is terible....dont waste your money.
If had done my research on what kinds of games Paradox makes I would have never have bought this game. This game has a large learning curve that you have to go through to make it you dont lose early. IF your the kind of person who is willing to spend more than a few hours just learning the game then I would say give it a shot. But even then the game will screw you over with some random roll during a battle at makes you lose 300 troops making you lose an important battle and making wonder why you even thought buying this game was a good idea.
is this a game or an excel spreadsheet???????
boring
BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Make a decent tutorial for the game at the beginning. I'm not reading pages and pages of crap!!!
No dank memes in this game. At first I thought there was one pepe in italy but it turned out to be a pope.   0/10 needs more pepes
Overpriced so hard.... This game is so damn expensive. Nobody wants to pay 159.99$ for fucking DLCs. It's ridiculous this game is way too overpriced and should only be 30$/w DLC. When I buy a fucking game I want the whole fucking game not just a part of it. To do that I gotta pay fucking 159.99$ gotta be taking a fucking fuck it isn't worth it at all!!!!
Fun gamebut really? 160 dollars for the whole thing! Thats an outrageous price! They already make you pay 40 for just a simple demo of the game. Not worth the money unless you have a lot of money to waste. However if you have so much money why are you wasting your time playing video games. So overll just dont get it.
9/10 Would be assassinated repeatedly again.
Nice game. I should say yes this game was entertaining but its drawbacks are so critical.   I watched roughly two hours of tutorial guide at youtube because I could not understand how this game works through in-game tutorial game. I am not from English speaking country so most of my friends are not good at English as much as I do. That's the main reason why I regretfully thumbed down this game. Besides the language problemtutorial system is generally too poor compare to complicated system of the game.   Second reason why this game really sucks is that there are too many fucking DLCs and the fact that they are still making it(LOL my ...) This is almost disgusting. I spent 9USD for the main game during weekend bargaining. It does not take me so much time to realize that the main game itself is not even a half of the game.   This kind of 'qunatumnizing' of a game marketing strategy is clearly a harm and threat to reasonable and trustworthy game market. It simply does not help make people buying games and keep them away from pirate market. I wish Someday and somehow Paradox realize this fact and start make some real games.
i fell asleep on my keyboard.very boring.
I dont get all the hype. The game does not impress me at all in any of its segments. First seems deep and engaigingends up shallow and boaring.
THIS NOOB ACTIVE I WIL NOT PLAY THIS I ALREADY HAVE IT
Attempted to explore this game during a free weekend trial and soon discovered the tutorial was broken due to a known bug. Spent about 8 hours trying to learn how to navigate the rather opaque interface before giving up in frustration. I might try playing again the next time the game is available for free to see if the developers have fixed the tutorial.
It crashes at startgreat game for 40 euro
dont you just hate when you have to read 10 books to play no sorry its more than 30 books\\
So confusing and not worth it
I do not own this gameI played it for free. It might be a good game when you learn how to play it but it is not a game you can jump into. It feels like a homework assignment. I dont even know where to start with it. people tell me it is amazing if you give it a chance. I dont have 10 hours to give a chance to something. I feel this style of game is out dated.
Ever wanted to handle the boring side of the Roman Empire? Me neither!
Nearly everything you click on requires DLC.
This game is complete garbage. I've played 29 minutes of loading flags and then it locks up. I've tried the forum suggestions and made it past the flag loading once. I have a intel i7 with 16gb ram win 7 64bit and gtx770. not my rig just a crap game.
0/10
Whenever I play it it never loads ):
I've tried to play this game two timesand in both it crash at the loading screen.  10/10 would crusade again.
it was too hard to understand and i diddent like it all that much. :( liked the idea though.
This is not really a game just more of a ideait's a good idea but an idea. Negative:  -The combat doesn't exist it basically makes battling noises and says You win/lose. -Don't get this game if you don't want to spend hours of searching how to play it correctly. -You have little control In the game everything is either simulated and or done by AI. -DLC Simulator. -Basically a Board game. -Ai is pretty dumb (AI not attacking when I basically right next to them and they could easily win) -HUD is very confusing kinda just splattered everywhere.  Positives:  +Lots of events +good graphics +Great Historic Knowledge. +Great content in game (if you get dlc's)   This game would be amazing if they actually made a combat system (which the player has to do actions etc) and made the game less annoying to learn (as theres about 20+ tutorials to understand all of the game which can take many hours)  For now though Not recommended.
At that point Pdx should really stop advertising their games as historical.
This game has an extremely poorly designed user interface and tutorial system. Do not waste any money or time on this game. After eventually learning the game from a friend I spent several hours (mostly boring hours) becoming the king of Walse. Have concured Walse my King died and instead of my heir becoming king of Walse he gave away all the land I had just spent my hole afternoon concering to his brothers. What. The. Hell. Biggest waste of time since Dark Souls II. Once Paradon have leanrt what 'design' is let me know.
Boringslow and overpriced at any price. Avoid it as if it were cancer
F your review
Get Europa Universalis 4 instead.
The tutorial is too damn fucking long that I rage-quit without completing it.
The whole game is horrifically overly complicated and RNG basedto an unreasonable extent
Not saying that the game has no charm but not even 40 minutes in and i was so over whelmed with all the text pop ups i had no idea what i was doing and i was going through the tutoriali wanted to punch my computer screen
this is the worst game i have ever played hands down clunky wierd interface terrible music bahhhh i was hoping for some historical strategy i got a big irritating mess.
this game sucks fuck ballls
Game crashes repeatedly on load screen. Cannot recommend
crusader kings II?more like Boring game II.Game reall boring everything lagswhen game is loading it always stops and closes and everything i hard and boring.Dont buy this game!!!
this is a really good stategy game and i would normally reccomend it HOWEVER there is the issue of DLCs so first of all im a bit enraged that ruler designer and customization pack are seperate DLCs but most importantly YOU CANT PLAY THEOCRACIES if paradox made a DLC where i could play as a theocracy(ex. hashashins) i would be happy but until than i am upset with this game
235$ for a complete game with all DLCs ... just let that sink in for a second ...
Most times you wonder if playing is the best term for what you are doing. Boring game.
I've played 8 hours of this game and I still dont understand how to play.
i already have this game. it's called Europa Universalis...
Very bad interfacecouldn't find START button for 10 minutes after choosing king.
**Removes Assassination.** -10/10
its fuck
Game was hard to figure out lot of reading. i never figured out if I could control the battles. i think girls would like this but I dont know.
Not entirely sure how I came to own this. Humble Bundle perhaps. But let me tell you something. I'm not paying £178.20 to play the full game.
After not even hour of game play regret set in. Boring. Wish I could get the money i wasted back. Save your money guys!
I've played this game long enough to know what it's like It's basically a game that has to many dlc's and paradox are just looking for money out of the game They've stripped it down to bare bones for the original and expect you to pay money for stuff that should already be in the game It's a really good game it's just the fact of paying money for something you should already have with the game is my problem
This game will have you squinting at the screen wondering why it takes 10 months for find a fucking cock for your general's daughter to marry. I wish I could return this
WTF? What a bad game. There are no anime cat girls. SMH  0/10
I've heared a lot of good things about this game and have many friends who like it. But the tutorial was lacking and because of that I was never able to understand. I'm sure it's a very good game but it has a bit of a high wall of entry. Unless you want to do a lot of experimenting or some better online tutorials you may want to consider something else.
this game is hard to understand....needs more rules to explain what everything does at the start of the game...i played for 20 mins just guessing what to do and eventually gave up.
An awesome game for people who love to spend hours just trying to figure out how to play the game.
The staggering amount of DLC Paradox games have nowadays is downright shameful.
Very new update forces you to restart a new campaign. Newest update will not allow you to save you're game unless you restart it new. So there goes 50 hours wasted??
Far to much DLC
I found this too hard to get into and the tutorial was unclear about things
Don't buy this game. It crashes and steam will not support it
Too complicated and UI is poor. you'd be better off getting a romance of the 3 kingdoms or a civ game
The game looked like it might have been fun but after some time playing itI never figured out what the point was. Really sucked since I was really hoping to enjoy it.
Steep learning curve. When finally somewhat mastered still pretty boring. Also de-syncs alot while playing over LAN/WAN.
Do not buy this game.   Even if you know how Europa universalis works and enjoy that game. This game is nothing like it.  You cant fight and take multiple provinces at once. You dont own the provences yourself your vassels controle them. they give you almost no troops. and they rebel every year ingame. Progress in this game does not exist. Your army is too small to fight and take an entire country over even if you have 20 more provinces. I played this game on king level (easiest) and still achieved nothing.  If You liked Europa Universalis 3 go to the 4th one. Don not buy this game. STEAM TRADE THIS GAME FOR EUROPA UNIVERSALIS 4 ON MY ACCOUNT PLEASE . (They have the same price.)
Family history simulator
Great concept and a well rounded game engine and AI (pretty rare these days). But game is a drag and it seems that I spend all my time arranging marriages and killing off family members - why the sole heir would find it worthwhile to rebel is beyond me.
Its scary when people plot to kill me 0/10 would not play
Do not buy this game. Too hard to understand and complicated. Buy only as it is your only game to play. You will spend a lot of time on it and will still not understand. Tutorial is a joke! Don't waste your money.
Sucks fuck. Much Crash. Very Cancer. Such wow. Hungarian blames me for the game crashing because he's a black fuck
Well lets start off from my experience from the start it's fuck i hate it this one time i actually did really good and my entire family magically dies. (note without warning it was probably a fucking glitch) its fuck did i mention that oh and it looks like fuck and the battle system sucks hard cock
confusing as fuck
A must have for every white nationalist on tumblr.
I really like the idea of this gamebut the learning curve is a bit steep for me.
What the hell is going on in this game? I don't even think that I've found the 'next turn' button. No idea. Needs some kind of a ... pacing system. 'First you start with your one little city. Then you get one character. Then you get one country. Oh lookthere is a neighbouring country! Let's say hello!' Something like that.
if it worked on my mac it would get a thumbs up its a good game its good on the pc but it crashes upon start up in mac dont even get the menu screen just crashes as soon as i click play
suck fuck
It's not a bad game and doess capture the difficulty of desigions of kings and queens. I didn't acctually like it becuse it was to compliacted and it felt like being in a history lesson than playing a game.
multiplayer takes either modifying your router or downloading a 3rd party software package that doesn't work! WORST $40 i have spent
Its too complicated.
i cant recomend this game cause its to steep learning curve and unless you sit trough a lot of heavy tutorials you are not going to understand what your suppose to doi didnt.
Almost as fun as filing my taxes.
This game is terrible. It is extreamly complicated and does not tell you how to play the game at all. In the time it would take to learn how to play the game I could go learn a forign language or play through 20 much better games.

do a fuck load of nothingtry to make your kids not fuckfuck but they become hunchbacks anyway gg 10/10  reccomended if you're boring
Gave a Jewish guy landKingdom became infested with Jews Everytime I dropped a penny it disappered  Too many Jews Kingdom was over run Kingdom became Jew Land Jew Land calling Holy Wars Jew Land spans from Ice Land to Sri Lanka All people without jewish nose was given a Gold Star They were rounded up and beheaded  Lesson of the day: Never give a Jew land or you cause a reverse holocaust
What garbage. Had to get a pirate version just to get the game to work. Paid copy still crashes at start up everytime. Paradox is a company ran by useless cuckolds
Book the game. Also incest simulator. Not for me personally.
I still don't know how to play this game.
its a piece of poop
high price
This game is something you love or hate. When I bought it I thought it would be like total war but it is completley different and I just can't get my head round how to play it. The pace is slow and basically you are staring at a map waiting for alerts to pop up where you need to make a descision and I found it difficult to work out what the best descision was.  Overall I never got drawn in enough to put in the effort to understannd the complex gamepaly mechanics and I imagine most people will be in my situation so unless you are sure that this is the sort of game that appeals to you then leave it well alone.
boring
Wanted to like this grand game  Wanted to not find it a boring struggle wanted my money back  wanted to curse the computer game gods for tricking me into thinking i was getting something good.
What a crappy game...   'Click on the map to select a character' it says after selecting single player game.  20 minutes later I still havn't figured out how to proceed after selecting character and I have clicked on everything I could find and used every key on the keyboard.  Only way to exit the game seems to kill the process...  It can't be right that I need to google how to use a game like this when I am a very experienced gamer and software dev.
it sucks
If you like tefta idlingyou will love this game.  It's boring as fuck :)
Basically total warbut for autis for smart people.
It's too complex. I can't even figure out what to do to get started. While some will like the excruciating detailit makes it virtually inaccessible to people who don't have someone to guide them.
As a fan of the totalwar gamesI thought that this would be right up my alley. I got bored after a couple of hours. It is boring. Do not buy it. It's just a text-based game on a pretty map. Pretty awful.
Paid $4.99...got what I paid for
Awesomely complicated. Little to no walkthrough. Even on steam sale its not worth it!!
too old  +soundtrack  -very long loading times
this game is bad because fuck
Nope.. Nope.. Nope.. Nope.. Doesn't worth so many money.. 4 real.. you can get other game 10x better than this.. xDDD
You cant go to war without reason and it takes a real-life forever to distinguish yourself enough to march if you not a major nation like England. Your wasting time with this one.
lmao this game is for nerds get cod ghosts insted it is good it has guns and brown people that arent islam
One of the most boring games i've ever played.
too slow to paly hated it
This Game Sucks!!!!!!
how can i write a review when i dont have this game rettards
I just could not get into this game but I shall keep trying...
I'm very disappointed how this game runs under Linux and FullHD 15' display. The font is totally unreadable and icons so small that I can't properly see them. This game is not ready for 1920:1080 resolutionat all. I regret the purchase..
it is a good game but becaus of the steam community bacht i am going to not recommend but it is the e best
i really don't know why people are so obessed by this gameit's boring and unbearably slow paced.
Very indepth gamepretty revolutionary very fun to play. MANY glitches and with Ironman mode these are permanent game destroyers.
Crashes on Startup.
The collection does not contain the full contenteitherway it looks like this game is nearly out of beta and could be ready for release in the near future with the grand epic master emperor edition digital deluxe 100% uncutted edition final release thnx for the $$
please stop breaking your own gamethx.
Totally not for me
doesnt actually work ...... i have the specs . this sort of problem shouldnt happen its only 2 years old
Can't beat this game. Its awesome. But every hour the game glitches and bugs out on me. No reason whyso very hard to play. Game gives a error and I am using Windows 7 Ultimate.

Some of my best childhood memories were sleep-overs playing Khan II - Clan of the Gray Wolfand Gemfire for Sega Genesis with my best friend. Afterwards I came to play ROTK 7-10 before arriving at a desert of decent strategy gamesyears later I saw this and it was like coming home.
do not like this game like most trune based stragey takes to long for me to get anywhere perfer games where in the frist few mineuts you know what your doing not games take weeks or months to complete frist story. only got because it was 9.99.
Horribly slow paced gamesteep learning and and over abundance of uneeded information. Not worth anyone's time...
Very Boring
man i cant even get the damn game to work ...keep getting a c++ runtime error when loading sounds
I've had more fun with this game than any of the myriad grand stategy games I've played over the course of my entire life. If you're new to games like Europa Universalisit might take a good 10-15 minutes to get used to the pace of this game as opposed to other strategy games (don't be afraid to use the fast forward button often!)but once you do... There's such an amazing amount of depth to this game it's astounding.  The bittersweet fun of building a dynasty off of a single noble couple and watching how the tendrils of your bloodline spread throughout the medieval world is something that has never
I can see its appeal of a 'grand strategy' / country ruler type of gamebut its complexity is overwhelming for me personally.
its ok i guess. maybe it did be more fun if i had the dlcs.
Well when entering the tutorialactually having pompts woould be helpful.
Wordy and confusing. doesnt even give you the satisfaction of watching medieval knights go fuedal age with morning starys and lances on each others a$%es.
This game takes several minutes to load. The tutorial does not explain adequately how to choose an ambition and once the tutorial is finished the diplomacy and presevering your kingdom becomes harderthere seems to be no way to balance generating income and building a decent sized army. CK2 also autosaves frequently and locks the game for several seconds. I do not recommend this game.
Just bought this game after checking out all the rave reviews. Have spent 3 hours trawling through forums attempting to find a fix for whatever problem won't let me even launch the game. NOTHING WORKS !!! I can't even get on to Paradoxes forum to ask for help. This may be a great game but currently my £29.99 feels wasted.
THE fuckING TUTORIAL CRASHED!!???!! then it says raise an army and fleet... and load the army on it. and you fucking cant. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.
Complete fuckt. As much money as I have spent on this gameand it doesn't even want to launch. How doesn't Steam have a phone service to deal with this stupid crap?
The buggiest game I've ever played! :(
-Started as Makuria in the 9th century. -United Nubia. -Invaded and united Abyssinian Empire -Invaded Arabian Peninsula -Got invaded by Muslims -Defeat Muslims because they try to fight three major wars at once -Invade Egypt -Jerusalem taken by Catholics -I take Jerusalem from tactics -Invade Africa -Invade Morocco -20 year old Emperor invades Italy in a series of wars -Now 32 year old Emperor gets assassinated -12 year old Emperor faces rebellions from every single other religion inside his Empire -Multiple peasant revolts -Vassals revolt -I become a duke in Jerusalem -Start process all over again during Mongol invasion  This game is awesome.
Crashing and no multiplayer?
The Game was amazing. Intill you run into the classic road block 'you cant play so and whant unless you got dees dlcs' this game is rather empty without them. and the price is just to rich for my blood. 5/10
Be a great game if it didn't freeze when loading sounds....
Text is incredibly small. Completely and totally unreadable on any laptop screen. For all I know the game may be funbut know you can only play it if you have a giant monitor or amazing vision.
Constant crases since latest patch. Onece every 2 years at least.
I recommend this game to anyone except myself.  This game has everything for a (grand) strategy fan. I thought I would like thisbut there are too many tabs with text in my opinion. There's also a minimum of action in a battle for example.
Horrible lag after 2.5.1 patch  Fu.ck you Paradoxthe new feature is really wasting my time and patience.  The game was great until you add more patches and more sh.itty mechanics such as bull.fuck council and coalition which gives me lag.
dlc excrement simulator: all your money edition.
I played it for only 4 hours. I have played Europa Universalis for over 500 hours. I recommend Europa universalis over CK2. I like the potential for stories but CK feels clumsy and overdone. Why put a tech tree in game if you admit in the tutorial that tech wasn't that important in the middle ages. It makes the game more complex without adding fun. Same goes for battle. Battle has a bunch of tactics and statistics that just don't add funbut makes the game harder. Lastly the UI feels a bit old.   maybe if the game was 'lean' it would have captured my attention but now i'm desinteresed by the learning curve (also because I already learned EU4)  I do not recommend because I recommend EU4 instead
fuck this game i can't loed my saves
i did not like this game slowboring and frequent crashes to desktop. I requested a steam refund.
Boring as hell.
Freakin DLC. Stop it.
NoNot at all. Waste of time unless you spend alot of money seeing all those great dlc things when watching youtubers.
it sucks is horaerball
I'll be brief:  - Great mix of grand-strategy game and RPG with an amazing replay value (just check other reviews by people with hundreds and even thousands of hours into the game)  - You WILL need 5-10 hours of WORK to get used to all the game mechanics. Youtube videos provide good assistance. Just be patient and spent some hours checking out other players or try parallel playing/watching with a tablet or smartphone and your PC  - Questionable DLC policy... but at least the developers keep supporting their game   BUT:  Only buy the Crusader Kings II Collection when it's on sale for roughly 40! For the best experience with this game you need at least some of the DLC packs. And the vanilla version of CKII just doesn't contain enough of the important/fun mechanics to justify it's 40 (or $ or whatever) pricetag...   P.S.: Ignore my displayed time with the gameI'm playing offline and steam doesn't seem to be able to recognize this. If you want to know: I spent roughly 100 hours with CKII.
10/10  -1 because of texts too small
I used to recommend this gameand now I don't.  I feel like the most recent updates ruined this game.
A neverending tide of crappy and poorly optimized DLC along with game-breaking and seemingly untested patches have ruined this game. Understand the most of it's high ratings are from years ago when it was a fantastic game. In it's current state I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
I nominated this game for the 'Best Use of a Farm Animal' award.   http://kotaku.com/that-time-a-horse-conquered-the-ancient-world-1757913762
You will spend hours murdering your grandchildrenusing your daughters as pawns in alliancesand homogenizing the unique cultures of the lands you conquer. You will send your children to be tutored by someone with a -100 approval rating of you just so they get that +1 bonus to stewardship
There seems to be no way to load a saved game.
This is a fantastic representation of mideval Europethat is incredibly fun to learn and play. You can play as anyone from the year 867-1456and interact with thousands of npcs
It's a strategy game with stong RPG elements. You take the role of a ruler (KingDukeEmperor) in Europe and guide your country through history (870s-1300s). You manage your family
Do not be daunted by the wealth of information and options presented to you. At it's core this is game about people and the lives they lead. There are few games as engrossing and deep as thisand will surely be remembered as a classic for all time.  Or at least for 1066-1400 or so
Game Dynasty Mechanic is great but over time game becomes stale even with DLC could use more customizable history etc
I don't know WHAT is going on...so many buttons.....so many....
CrusadesHoly Wars and Jihadsoh my! Religion and politics were never so intertwined as they were during the Middle Ages and you get to relive the entire experience from the late 800's all the way to the mid-15th Century (thanks to the Norse Gods xpac). The original starting scenario is one of the most historical battles in history: Stamford Bridge. Selecting this scenario you can either play one of the three combating forces to decide the fate of England or perhaps some other noble elsewhere in Europe while the Battle of Hastings takes place or... doesn't. The second original starting scenario is after William the Conqueror has become King of England. With the advent of xpacs such as the Sword of Islam and The Republic you can play as an Islamic lord and invade Europe from a foothold in Spain or eradicate the Byzantine Empire or play as a patrician and establish a Serene Republic. The best game I played thus far was as the ruling family of Bohemia
Maybe I'm missing something but I'm unable to even complete the tutorial because the options you are told to click simply don't exist (e.g. the tutorial explaining how to marry fails because the spouse is still alive whilst the game tells you that she's dead). Maybe the game proper is less buggybut I'm not inclined to recommend it at this point in time.
It do not work with Win 8.1. I cannot play it at all.
HOW DO I DO ANYTHING  7/10 played as a muslim named Jorbel
Absolute Crap I don't even know what to do waste of 40 bucks
The tutorial does not seem to work. Also i think you will ind it very hard to play this game as a perfectionist wanting to be good I find this game far to advanced for my feeble easely bord mind  But if you wnane use hours to gett into this entertainment i belive it to be great
not worth it
Very steep learning curve. VERY STEEP!!!  Poor tutorial that ends too quickly without explaining the full game mechanics.  Control layout not intuitive.  Information not handed to the player in either a timely or instructional manner. eg. - Why marry this woman over another?  - Why hire this spy master?  - Someone joins your  court.....So?   - How do you add a guardian to your children?  - Where is the fleet I just razed?  - How do you stop everyone hating you?  - Which army on the map is marching through your land and which is about to knock you out of the game?  - When and what and why should I build something? - An incident occurs with no advice of possible ramifications on my decisions.   Every game I play I am left with more questions and frustration. I am glad I bought it on sale. I was hoping for something like Medieval War but deeper. Instead I bought a spreadsheet covered in a map and nice music.  That all said...I then went and read the negative reviews...many with LOTS of hours. Others also report its not only very steep to learnbut eventually you run into the DLC issue. Apparently (and yes I have already run into this) you need to buy a LOT of DLC to get the game to work properly.   My advice. DONT BUY.  I love deep strategy.... provided its playable. And I am not talking about 'Civ' as deep strategy. Games like Grigspy's Pacific War are the depth I like. This game seems deeper and less intuitive.
if you are going to buy a game that crashes you might just well pirate it.
This game is fantasticalthough it takes some getting used to. You play as a family dynasty instead of a nationand deal with feudal Europe from about 750-1450 AD.
Almost impossible to figure out!
Wow... Huge (-F ) on the last updatea very extreme Nerf to assassination. Interesting how the NPCs can happily go about killing everyone. While I need to spend 10months crafting a plot that will likely not work.
the controls are hard and the tutorial is too vage
for grand scale games its over all alright but i feel like it focus to much on the people
I wasted money on this crap game on a friend's recommendation. If I had 10 years to dig through all the complex fuckt involved with this gameI still wouldn't know how to play it. The only thing I ever did was watch my wife pump out 7 kids.
Another truely incredible game by the masters of stradegy. Played for the free weekend and loved it. Then I got the full game and still loved it. There is so much to do in this gameyou really have unlimited amount of possibilities. Some minor tiny glitches but behind that I was amazed at how great the game handled. I completely recomend this game to all.  -10/10
The game is pretty good but I just can't give a good review to 'DLC the Game.'
always crashes upon start. eu4 is great though.
Polish Count Spends 70 years to get the throne 10 independence factions pop up and my sister kills my eldest heir Last male dynasty member is a celebate (-1000 fertility)  420/battletoads would waste 6 hours again
Dont buy this game its full of DLC these people fucking DLC out the wazzo also this games mechanics arent a marvel or even to great such as combat and building and doing anything really is just a huge pain in the  i hate this and i wish i could get a refund on this game way to much hype and Fanboy reviews written.
Great game but......  difference between demo en de full game...........   nothing everthing is dlc :( :( :(   EVERTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't reccommend this game to anyone that hates not knowing how to play a game.I hated that it didn't tell me how to play.Also the campain doesn't allow you to attack until your forty (1 hour 30 minutes into the campain).In the campain you can only recruit 2 types of units.I recomend people play Empire Total War because it is simular to this game but way better because you get to do a lot more stuff and you get to controll your army in battle.
Terrible. The tutorial is garbage and the game was basically unplayable. I couldn't figure out how to do anything and the tooltips were annoying and not helpful. Hard to get into a game when you can't even get through the tutorial.
I have no idea what to do to progress in the game. I've resorted to watching youtube clips and online guides and it is still unclear what you actually do in this game.
The 15% of the game I was allowed to play without spending another £100 was great
Too much DLC.
$200 of DLC later I finally got what appears to be the complete vanilla version since there is no depth.  I sure hope the next expansion improves this way too easy game because strategically speaking it's shallow as heck.
You start playingthen you realize it's dark outside. Eight hours have passed while you have been scrutinizing nubile aristocratic women to betroth your heir to. You realize you aren't actually certain whether you've had any fun yet. Time to go to sleep you have work in the morning.

My head exploded
looked good but incredibly boring waist of money
A Game of Thrones Mod sneak peek -start as aegon the conquerer  -conquer some stuffbecuase why not -conquer westeros and parts of essos  -keep my religion instead of convertingbecause i love having 3 wifes and 20 kids -become 'Emperor of New Valyria'' -life is going swell... -4 of out of my 20 kids rebel against me  -i put down there feeble rebellion and feed all 4 to my dragon -now im down to 16 kids  -2 more die of greyscale -down to 14 kids -1 dies for being inbred imbecile  -down to 13 - another rebellion pops off this time all of westeros is rebelling -i burn the castles and enslave there daughters and sons -regrets decision -all of essos rebells against me -5 more kids die for being fostered out to foreign nations -down to 8 kids now -burn pretty much everyones castles and enslave there familys -everyone hates me now  -my son plots to kill me  -2 more of my kids join the plot  -imprison kids -demands trial by combat - all 3 die from trial by combat -now im down to 5 kids -oh look someone assassinates my heir -down to 4 kids  -my oldest is 12 years old and already lustful and a drunkard -plots to kill 12 year old charlie sheen -12 year old dies -down to 3 kids -my wife plots to kill me -i stop her and execute her -the bloody flux breaks out in my capital -i catch the bloody flux -all my kids catch the bloody flux and my remaining wifes catch it -everyone slowly dies by bloody explosive diarrhea -my wifes and 2 of my kids die -left with 6 year old heir -i survive my explosive diarrhea disease -fast forward 15 years -my only son and heir has been groomed to command and lead -his name is Aegon II 'The Dragon' Targaryen -hasnt been married yet plan to marry him off soon -BUT THEN -he plots to kill me -i imprison him and call for a trial -he demand trial by combat -i am his opponnet -Aegon The Conquerer and Aegon The Dragon have a bloody fierce battle -its a close one -but in the end -The Conquerer put his sword through the belly of The Dragon -i am known as a kinslayer  -with my last son and heir dead my empire begins to crumple -rebellion after rebellion start popping up -i try to put them down -then my dragons gets slain in battle -but then a event pops up -someone pushes me through a balcony and i fall to my death -with all the rebellions and my dragon dieing i hadnt noticed someone had plotted to kill me -the killer was none other than my court eunch  -never trust a eunch -i lose my empire and i lose the game after 30 something years -THE END  the moral of the story is if someone trys to converts you to another religion you do it or your empire will fall

If there was a pre purshase for crusader kings III coming in 5-10 years from now....I would buy it today!
I just cannot get on with this game. The learning curve is steep and the game is not helpful or willing to teach you the 1000 things you need to do. It is quite difficult to distinguish who is on your side and not on the map. Starter game on very easy immediately got attacked by the Norse and Norman armies from across the sea giving me absolutely no chance to learn the basic actions of the game. This game might eventually be rewarding if you are willing to pour hours and hours of defeat to learn it but it is definetly not for me. Back to Total war :)  5/10
-married princess of hungary -got my son to marry princess of danmark -got my other son to marry princess of sweden -fucked both of my son's wives and my own -get confronted by son's about affair -plot to kill both of them -both ded -muslims jihad my nation -muslim kill all of my people -they take all of our wives for their harem -10/10 would decieve again
This game used to be fun before they ruined it with Cossacks and the later DLC.
boring
A fantastic entry into the Grand Strategy Genre that is unfortunutely being slowly eroded and destroyed by content updates containing completely untestedunbalanced and complete garbage features. The theme of these content updates seem to be 'upload them now and fix them later.'  Couple this in with fuckt DLC at exorbitant prices and you have a great game that has been turned to fuck. If you buy this game I suggest you set your game to the legacy versions pre-conclave update.
its 2016 get a window mode.
I was really excited to play this gamebut was very dissapointed. Tutorials would not work correctly and wouldn't let me past Tutorial 1 page 4. I tried to learn the game while playing but it didn't make any sense to me at all.
The game crashes on launch to many times for me to be able to recommend it. But other than that its a good game if you're looking to sink some hours into somthingAnd if your a fan of in depth diplomacy im sure you'll get a kick out of it.
I dont usually do reviews but this game at this moment is so ridiculous it has made me write a review rant. So first off this is one of my favourite games... Or it used to be. Somewhere along the line paradox thought of an ingenious plan to harvest money out of their loyal fans. Albeit you dont need to buy the newest dlcs but the dlcs just DO NOT WORK ON ITS OWN!!!! So thus they are forced to release patches into the CORE game to help the TERRIBLE dlcs make sense and work IN A ALREADY BEATIFUL MASTERPIECE and now the results is they literally fucked up the game by trying to make the game work with their very depressing dlcs that I and many other suspect is some paradox devs retirement fund. Making dlcs that add NOTHING but only change MANY aspects of the game is NOT A fuckING DLC AT MOST ITS A fucking PATCH!!! So excuse my language but summary they seem to be abandoning CKII and EUIV and making the last bit of cash they can on the two games with what i feel little to no effort on them actually creating decent dlcs. I actually thought they were a good company but... I was wrong again. Have fun fighting 6 rebellions and the Abbassid Empire while youre ruler yolos and dies for a several generationswith their heirs and children in general always getting a negative traits whilsts also suffering 10-20 negative event panels and vassals even with content trait start fabricating a claim on one of your  cheeks. Oh and btw winning is overated so lets give the enemy army random buffs with 5k soldiers fighting 5k soldiers should be an even fight ehhh? No fuck you youre gonna fight 7k now! Thats right! For free dollars were gonna have enemy numbers skyrocket by 2k during the fight for no reasons at all! If you act now and defeat them no worries theyre going to return with more than they started! Yes i know right?! Happy times oh happy Paradox times.
Why you should buy Crusader Kings II  -CK II is not your ordinary strategy game like Civilization or Endless Space. You play as an individual leading a nation instead of the nation itself.  ---This means that you have a dynamic game in which you can 'game of thrones' the ckii and secure lands without declaring war.  -CKIIPlus (Mod) expands the game dramatically and gives more depth to your empire such as coronationspolitical factions (More than succession factions) that you can use to your benefitand an improved pre-1066 religion system for Europe.  -CK II has been patched to where it isn't the same game as it was on release. There are bad things such as defensive pacts but these can be removed with modding.  -CK II mods besides CKIIPlus can have you play as a one living in a galactic empire
Since conclave the game is onplayble!!!
Used to love this gamenow i feel really frustrated everytime i try to play it thanks to the horrible DLC politic of Paradox.
Conclave sucks fuck just give up fam
I have such a love hate relationship with this game I can't even properly explain it...
