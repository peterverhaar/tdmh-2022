review_text
17-04-14 new update. Game doesnt even open.  Error Fatal Error- Cannot load Library. Please fix. Unbale to open CS 1.6,
i had it on a crcked version. i had over 2000 hrs on it. when i was 10-13 damn what a game.,
This game is a classic. I lost many hours of sleep and spent a lot of time playing this game from the 1.1-1.6 clients of this game. 1.3 will ALWAYS Have a place as my favorite time i played the game. Still love to pub with friends.,
You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didnt kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alI have. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemys next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You cannot do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you dont do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You gI have info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isnt on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they dont expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you dont have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being actI have in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you dont so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, dont play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you cannot play a normal match since cheaters will destroy you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..
Game full of cheaters nice valve.
Eh, its alright
full of russians
Best Game, I dont recommend it though, very high skill cap. tried to go pro, ended up becoming an alcoholic. sad story. RIP.
Yet another great game ruined by its community. 4/5 people got this non-steam. Almost every server is not English. 3/4 servers have some mods, which make the game unplayable if you have a low lvl on some class, because how much shitshits think theyre cool because they bought a premium class and camp in a corner.  Oh and did i mention the servers without mods have no players, or use mods without telling it.
Was it good then? Probably. Is it good now? Hell no.  It might just be me, but I really dont find the appeal behind this game in 2016 - whatever year it is now. Global Offensive have and Source are the series best for me.  Dont get me wrong, I love games from this era like Quake, HL1 and I still enjoy those more than newer entries, but I just cannot see why you would buy this when CSGO is miles better for a tiny increase in price. In this case, its a matter of whether the game holds up against it newer entries or by itself and I just dont feel that this fulfills those properties.
My Love Its Cs 1.6
my game is so broken, and so stupidly made i cannot do anything in all time reconekt and spit out!!! May i cnow the reason for it?
when I would go in and play. but when I arrI haved, all in giant zoomed know someone what to do to zoom out of the game. ???
i used to play cs before since 10years ago. but this cs i purchased it sucks. cannot play properly.. thats why i wanted to refund. even the settings cannot fix it.
cool
THIS GAME WILL GET YOU A VIRUS IF YOU JOIN ONLINE DONT BUY I BOUGHT IT IF YOU TRY WITH BOTS IT WILL SEND YOU TO MULTIPLAYER SERVER THAT HAS VIRUS
fuck off I cannot get refund
My negatI have vote is for this Steam version only. CS 1.6 is a great game but for some reason valve removed bots and the main menu music in this version so I cannot recommend getting this version.
I remember playing this game on WON. This was one of the best games on the market until GO came out. I have wasted so much time playing this game and I regret every second of it. Waste of time and itll turn you into a homeless nerd with no friends.
2 Thumbs up!!!
Its shit.
physics? not here.
CLIENT MODEL WORLD IS NULL !!!  wtf is going on, i have vertyfied the game, and went into the folders and deleted all the things in cs-download, and it still dosent work !!
I cannot think of a single reason why someone would install this today. Used to be famous but is now archaic and empty. Those servers that do exist are full of non-English speaking hackers.
Only shiting brazilians play this game.
I like old games, I mean, i grew up playing the Lands Of lore RPGs. This game was awesome when it came out for its time..but i like to move on with the times and experience newer, better games. I want to push my rig, and going back to a game from 2000, wont be doing much for me. I can understand why alot of people have trouble letting go of the past, and playing all the games they did when PC gaming started to become more relI havent, but common, there are so many better looking, newer games out there that people dont gI have a chance. Even CSGO needs a buff,graphically and mechanically but thats just me.
hello....not good, maybe anyone can help me, i cannot play counter strike, every time i connect to some server, sometimes it allowed me to play but sometime not, its connectic to other servers all the time, like reconnecting....showing that loading bar...precaching items or something like that....very sad i both this game only yesterday, one more thing...tried to purchase a gift for my friend...they took my money, but didnt gave my friend a gift, nothing.....
you cannot add the bot to your game so basicly its kind of pointless to play the game
people said it was the best cs of all time so i figured i would pick it up. when i got into my first game, i had problems looking around... this didnt stop. im stuck sometimes looking at the ground and as much as i move my mouse im still looking at the ground. sometimes im looking at a wall, and i move my mouse as much as i can. but the mouse keeps going right back to the same place on the screen. please help, i cannot play until this problem is fixed.
This game is crap
shit
Bad compared to CZ and GO without skins and new community.  Still better than Source though. If there was an option between Recommended and Not Recommended, I would choose it.
incredibly hard to get a vac ban
DONT FALL FOR NOSTALGIA BIAS  Pros -classic feel  -people still play itbarely -no skinsalmost  Cons -80percent of the players are hackers and do not speak englishso no real teamwork -real servers with the gamemode actually being a CS type are almost non-existant -actual enjoyability comes from whether or not you like to deal with the above  This is one of gamings most treasered games and it is sad to see it get like this. Nostalgia can only get people so far and it is a shame thaat few people explain the reality of this game in their reviews. The fun is not totally gone, although it is something you have to really try to find. The gameplay is as you would expect it at least when you find a server that doesnt have CSGO surfers on it, nothing has changed and thats good. The problem is the community. It is hard to find a server with a team you can communicate with because of the major language barrier the game now has.  Communication is key in this game as you would expect, and it is very rare because almost everytime you get on a server it is from a central american area and the players mostly speak spanish. Making it difficult as you would expect.   The amount of hacking in this game shameful, it is more common than it is in CSGO and is a real problem that makes the experience more bad than it already has become.  The server types are just like what you would see in an old game, modded to hell with new terribly unenjoyable game modes. If you were to see you would find many gameplay modded servers that gI have you trash that nobody wants to see surfing.   Take away the nostalgia bias that everyone tosses out and you will see that this game is a former shell of itself. It has all the elements of a typical old PC game that only a few people will try hard enough to enjoy. The enjoyment can still be found, but at a heavy heavy cost. RIP CS1.
too manny anti trumps
IMHO this engine should be end on single player.
.
i have ban alot of time i whant a play
Outdated but still fun. Nothing like I remember though.
I dont see whats so great about it, beware new players. You will get kicked alot /
I got banned from this game in 2002 by VAC just because I logged in from a computer with hacks installed in a LAN SHOP. It has been 11 years since I was banned and I still cannot play Counterstrike with my account. I am already 25 this year, even prisoners in democratic nations are gI haven 2nd chance but not STEAM. Shameful!
Why the helll my server is keep changing all the time and how i can stop that?
NONONONONONONONOONNONOONO  WTF HAPPENS? I buy the game and i just try to play it.  List of servers [FREE VIP] 20/32 users in ALL servers. When i enter the message of the day never gets out when i press OK. Server disconnect and automatic send me to another server. JUST FEW servers works fine, and not so much fine.  CSS Location Folder God.. i was searching the problem about that ↑↑↑ and i just found a note block just says.. Have a nice huge d*ck up your as*! and another folder with insult too.  WTF Valve? i gave the game to a friend to check if was just MY error but no. He also get the same error than me.  Maybe the first things i saw was just an error.. but founding a folder that was insulting me? I dont think so Valve, i can report this error but i didnt.  I buy this game just for enjoy my old times.. So i prefer download it pirate.  PS I never touch any file or change something. Again, idk how Valve can do this and i dont think was a hacker.  
I like it but its too hard............
with W10AU game not starting anymore
No Gmod textures 0/10 get CS Source instead
dosent work and i want refund it  
People say its a classic, Classic is the mod for half-life.
the good old days lol
full of mexicans. not trying to be racist but i dont understand anything they say.
- Bad recoil controll - Grenade can kill you trough wall - Stupid wallbangs - Lots of cheaters - Viruses 

-rep bad graphics, not as good as CSGO
  this game dosent work for black people
This is honestly one of the worst games I have ever played.
Horrible, just horrible. Everyone gI haves this good reviews based on nostalgia. I saw all the good reviews and thought I should try it out. Upon opening the game, was a cringy menu. I fiddle with the settings, and theres no damn graphics options! I put the crosshair on small.Definitely not small So, I go to servers and all the servers have horrible maps. Plus, closest servers had 0 players. I click on a Dust 2 server with 10 players. When it loads up, nobody speaks shiting english. The buy menu controls were so shited up I couldnt buy a gun. So, I stuck with the pistol. I go through the middle, and all the players look the same! You cannot even tell whos who. Literally, the shiting same. So I die instantly because i couldnt even tell it was an enemy. shitfuckt. I finally managed to buy a gun in the shited up menu. I find someone, spray at em, and surprisingly it was enemy. My gun starts shooting in the shiting sky, recoil over 9000, and I was burst firing! Absolute shitfuckt. Another HORRIBLE thing about this game, its graphics and audio! It just doesnt meet todays standards. I think I might have to bleach my eyes after glancing at this game. Its horrible. I only played the game for under 10 minutes and I already want to kill my self. Trust me, save your money. If you loved this game as a kid, I dont care get it. But if youre looking for a good FPS, to TODAYS standards, dont get this garbarge! Save your ten dollars and use it to get your shit sucked by the girl down the street. So, simplest way possible.  Graphics 1  Audio 1  Community 2  Experience 1  Controls 2  Gameplay 2  Overall Game 1.6 Haha, Counterstrike 1.6
DONT EVER BUY IT  CONTROLS ARE shitED UP TO THE ABSOLUTE MAX  WHEN I PRESS SOMETHING IT CONECTS ME TO ANOTHER SERVER THIS GAME USE TO BE GOOD
its its ew... too many hackers, communitys all about the bass, outdated graphics, hard to play,
You had only one job, valve, and you decided to remove bots.
It keeps kicking me for no reason 
This game run like an asthmatic shit  http//forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=781721 
Cheaters Heaven ! x.x
Help! I cannot aim with my mouse ! What can i do?
I keep hearing that CSGO is a good game but this is way outdated. How is this a new game?
can i get my money back plsae
You cannot be globally Offensive have in this game...
the best fps game ever
I get disconnected from a server whenever I join one, and sometimes I get sent to a completely random server. The game is unplayable
Always hated Counter-Strike, got it as I got Half Life 1.
Stupid minecraft shit doesnt work on laptops. Poor FPS
game of year!  date 03/05/2016 russia
Full hacks everywheres ..
This game makes poop come out my peehole.
cs go clone bad game
  This is just a s.hitty unrealistic version of Call of Duty! Dont buy this c.rappy knock off, it looks like a f.ucking Iphone game.
First please read the review because there are a lot of fanboys who downvote all negatI have ones just because you want me to think perfectly of this game!  Well first of all i wanna say i dont have much to say other than this game is amazing i have played it my entire life but not the steam version a pirated version and please dont hate me for that but the most stable version of this game is pirate version wanna know the reasons why? ok fine here they are 1.CL_flushentitypacket error which is extremely annoying gI haven the fact that it will lagg you out and it cannot be fixed because most of the servers are against the fix and usually that fix doesnt even work. While that error occurs on pirated version too it occurs really rarely while on steam version it doesnt stop the whole damn game and it is either the server that will kick you for using that fix or VAC that will kick you if you are lucky and ban you and you arent even using the third party software!!! its a console FLIPPING COMMAND!!! 2.There are a ton of servers that have a virus that will rebind all of your keys to join their server once you join the server for the first time and honestly i dont know how will this benefit either the owner of the server or you because you cannot even play the server normally you will just reconnect all over again when you try to do something and in all honesty if you do such thing on your server shit you and i hope you get cancer. But you might be thinking how is this connected to not buying this game? well simple and i have 2 reasons for that. First reason is that why do you want to spend money on a game that has this type of issue and second of all the reason why this is a biggie is that in pirated version of the game you can change your binds and it will all save but unlike the steam version the Synchronizing feature will save stuff but if you change the binds it will come back because people who use this exploit can work their way around it and trust me you will encounter a lot of servers like that. But trust me i dont hate this game in fact this is the game that got me into pc gaming back in 2004 but is it worth it buying a game that doesnt benefit you in any way as a legal version? of course not but its not me thinking that this game is shit in fact its evolutionary its perfect and i have spent 1000+ hours outside of steam version and i gotta say i have been getting a lot less errors and a lot less shitfuckt messages from vac for me trying to fix this error and a lot less problems than i had with the LEGAL VERSION THAT SHOULD BE MORE OF A QUALITY THAN THE ILLEGAL VERSION!. And im not promoting piracy in fact i think its lame but this is the game that should be pirated because it doesnt offer anything good in legal version in fact it downgrades a lot but when there are 50000 people that are hidden off your charts of cs 1.6 just because they wanna play normally and pirate the game there is something seriously wrong with the legal version and i really dont recommend buying this its the same as the pirated version but with more game breaking stuff! 
bad game  all cheatrs
This game was good because it wasnt crashing [for me] like now. Every time i open it up, it shows Half-Life Launcher stopped working. This happen all the time i open it up. Help me fix it.
You can already get it free on the offical website
There are NO good servers on any more.
after playing a few rounds on different servers now I cannot move around using the mouse...on other cs types, i.e. CS GO, its works perfectly
shiting cod rip off
Very Old Game And Its shit Graphic and ...
WTF is this IT Lags and you cannot even move smoothly
This community is full of 12 year old horny fukbois who upload pictures with bad shit♥es      PSAfeel free to down vote this review because its the truth.
next gen graphics
Nice Game But Low Graphics.
This game was ok, and fun. Then it just stopped work. It loads a black screan with a white box, and just hangs.   I would not but this game.
thats it! i cannot take this anymore. im not buying anymore of valves classic games. its just too old! im trying to look for instant respawn servers but i cannot find any. the only good classic game valve made would be the old half lifes but i cannot take this anymore! Tf classic, day of defeat and now this. im sorry, im done, im actually done!
i have vac ban.. offf
i shitin hate shitfuck
Need Update
Its a good game but due to how long it has been out people that are just starting have a massI have learning curve you would be better off just getting the new version Counter-Strike Global Offensive have
Easy for the hackers to exploite
As of 2015 I get a resolution problem loading any Goldsource games I cannot see any of the menu buttons. I have tried every fix I could find nothing works.
not as fun anymore since there are more empty than full servers and little to no communication
counterstrike 1.6 not so good game  buy? notsomuch
the game just dissapeared
Dickson Horroe hates the game. I got this becase stewie got good from this game and then got good at counter kike go, doest make me a good player.
shiting romanian servers
the scran is larg i cannot play and enter the game to
3
Mouse doesnt work for mac version 
i cannot play offline there is no option offline waste money on simple cs1.6
i brougth a counter strike but it doesnot working  
Got banned for using SuperSimpleWalls v 13.22182 by amidamaru, this game is obviously a shit compared to others, I spent 49.99$ on this hack and still got banned fuck u all
better buy cs go
Waste of money!!! Bought it recently downloaded just yesterday.. when i open, all i see is a blank screen!!!!
When u buy it u are happy. when u have play counter strike in a 1h u will fuck kill u self
I could NOT move forward at all! Waste of 10 dollars.
cannot EVEN CONNECT TO TO A LAN GAME. LET ME JUST GO KILL MY SELF FOR A SECOND. no offense ,but i hate this. ITS JUST A PRANK BRO.
how does this cost money! its a shiting mod lol
I love battlefield  10/10
99percent of servers force you to join only that server. shit this game. Waste of my money.
The community sucks.
i liked the part where i used to own this game on my steam account.  i dislike the part where i logged in one day for the game to be gone from my list and steam refusing to gI have it back to me even tho i have almost 1k + hours played on this account? HOW CAN I PLAY THZE GAME IF I DIDNT OWN IT?!?!?!?!?!??!  shit u steam
Counter-strike, my childhood! Brings bad memories back...  One of the first Valve games, and this one is a total shit. I understand why Half-life sucks so much, but how famous multiplayer trash shooter can be so badly made?! There is two teams, terrorist team and counter-terrorist team both acts like scumbags. Your goal is to kill other team or place the bomb as terrorist. Allahu akbar! Never seen this before, bad guys can actually win. Its terrorism propaganda! Counter-strike playerbase is worst part of this, they dumb as shit and hot headed of course, alot of cheaters who cannot play fair, this makes this game completely unplayable and innocent people get VAC ban like me. Valve dont want to take responsibilty, they want to have fun with their shiting Steam money and spit on us! There is only one official game mode, kill each other and take score. Pfff, we need more! Like capture the flag, zombies and singleplayer officially i dont know what else to say, those freaks done so little about this game.  0/10 Blood-Brain win
I love CS as much as the next guy. But you will have more fun with Counter strike Source or Counter strike Global Offensive have. Why do i say that you may ask? This is filled to the brim with hackers nowadays to the point where its basically unplayable. I personally like the classic feel of CS, but Counter strike Global Offensive have is still fun in its own way. Get css or csgo. Youll thank me later.
I thought I would receI have comfy nostalgia with a small but nice community, instead I got a bunch of shit-talking mexicans 14/88 its not like you think it would be
I really would like to recommend this game, its amazing, but this game is infected with hackers. The Valve Anti-Cheat in this game has gone wrong, it would never ban a cheater but bans innocent gamers. A friend of mine got banned from this game, fI have years ago, and he still cannot play, even the prisoners IRL have second chances, but not in a game? Really Gabe Newell?
still sucks after 15 years
Autism at its finest.
Was good... Now... Now its full of hackers, non steam players with toaster computers that cannot speak basic english, and bot servers.
Counter Strike is even fight between highly trained American anti-terrorist team using latest in military technology to battle a group of really shit♥♥ madmen possessing crude bomb and surplus from USSR 1980s army supplies. Despite all training and technology terrorists still have good chance of blowing up market therefore much like real life.  Game is currently full of hackers who fly on top of map so unless you hack or like getting aerial teabag please play better Counter Strike Sauce or Counter Strike Go game. This game has had its day and only exists for historical purposes. I remember times when internet cafe and mosque full of this game. No more.
No good quality servers, and most people are hackers or get a cracked version of the game and threaten to DDOS you. Get CSCZ, CSS, or CSGO because they have bots to play with if you cannot even find a server. Might have been good 15 years ago but now it has been left to rot.
Shoots at guy 1 health I die  CS Unistalled  Installs Farming simulator LI haves life as a farmer The End
weird and clunky. all servers are mexican.
Šit! csgO the bešt!
DO NOT BUY! Steam is up to their old tricks again. I thought this had some sort of controller support but it doesnt. Steaming Pile of Crap. I Promised myself I would never buy another Steam game again but couldnt resist the prices. Un-Playable.
What?
Looks like the rest of my life is gonna be waiting for server to fill up.... Screw that #### im out.
It isn t working!! i bought it at twice on 2 profiles and it always tell me error Couldn t find UserMsgBase pointer. ... who knows how to repair it? 
on my imac CS 1.6 the mouse glitches, lags whatever... lost 7 quids ...  CSGO way better despite of its usage, my imac can play the game perfect with lags!!!
There is a huge lump in my throat as I edit this review. If you own this game and reading reviews for fun, keep scrolling. So this game is only MP without mods and its dying atleast here in my countryIndia and its $10 which is way too expensI have in terms of our currency. Get the physical copy of Counter-Strike Anthology from a local/online retailer which will have half the price of this game alone without any sale! RIP Counter-Strike 1.6 
havnt played it a lot but source is good
play to have fun shit♥ !!
If you were a fan of this game back in the day youll feel nostalgic and want to buy it but dont, it doesnt hold up if youve done any gaming of any sort since then.
From this game i remember the good memories . I dont like good memories 
Does have some multiplayer, but all the modes are gimmicky and not fun. Not many english servers either.
This will always be the best counter-strike ever, but I can no longer recommend it. 90percent of servers are hosted by mexicans so if you dont know spanish.....2bad... Try CSGO or CS source.
its a great game, but i dont recommend because nowadays there is a map rotativity of just two or three maps
  Is Counter-Strike Global Offensive have worth to buy?
There is no point in playing this game. I was banned for using hacks when I have never used any hack programs on my steam account. Wasted $10 for this game. Good luck
its way too shit♥♥ to play!
dont buy this is crap 
ratchet
when I play offline there is no bots
i want my money back , i dont like the game!
i dont know is it ebcause i didnt play it when it was first out but to me it seems shit theres no competI have mode and the graphics arent good either gameplay is good but id just get global Offensive have
IT STOOPID, GET GO, 0/420
Not worth the nostalgia, clunky and slow. Youre better off getting Counter Strike  Global Offensive have
This game sucks for 4 reasons 1. Its now outdated, and there are better/newer ones. 2. Its purely multiplayer, not even bots to practice. 3. Its super boring even if you play with people you know. 4. People complain if you loose. Chill, its just a shiting game! Thats about it. I dont suggest this to anyone unless they want to waste their money.
Loved this game and i played it 7 years but now it has no scope.If you want to play, you can play for fun only~
16 years after its release people are still palying it, which, in my opinion, says a lot! People are dumb as shit...
This version of CS is obsolete. Your game can get hacked if you join the wrong server. It happened to me. Now when I try to join any server it just sends me to a foreign server with bots.  i reformatted and reinstalled and now i can play. its not an easy thing to fix.
-Do you like empty servers? -Do you like a long list of empty servers? -Do you like servers with nothing but junk map after junk map and none of the originals? -Do you like boring themed gun play? -Do you like a chaos fest of 32 players on a small map? -Do you like to waste your money?   This game is for you! Once a great game, but no one plays it anymore. Which is a shame, CSGO is trash.
its glitchy
This game is pretty much not fun anymore, if you want to play it, crack it. Its not worth 10€ anymore its just bad.
im love counter strike im myth counter strike 
because of the worst updates that valve made for this old and beautifull game i wont recommand it anymore
I got motion sick
one of the worst games i ever played and the most corrupted with cheats ... i would never recommend such crap garbage to anyone
Is old
Only people who still play are either Spanish or former Pros.
It was my favorite game, but since steam tried so much to screw this game with all that useless updates that ruied it...and it dosent work on windows 8, plus they got out D3D the only option that you had if you have windows 8, now...its a piece of crap, if we are talking about cs 1.6 when steam gI haved a **** about it, then its a 10/10 but now its just a 5/10 or 4/10 RIP cs 1.6 THANKS A LOT STEAM! 
dont buy it ... when u will have some error and u cannot find a solution no one will help you ... i cannot play for almost 1 month because error  connection problem  at this game only !!! and i tried everything and no thing is helping ... new steam &amp new cs &amp new windows &amp new antivirus ... and no one at the steam team really care !
This game is old for now we have the Counter Strike - Global Offensive have its really better and very nice game   the CS1.6 is really old sucks texture but old times it was great.
get css its safer i tried to join 2 servers it loaded for a bit then failed manged to enter the first one for 2 seconds then gone then some arabe dude on steam added me 5 seconds later and he was playing cs 1.6 wtf i didnt even enter server for 2 seconds shit this shit im outta here deleted this game and blocked that dude XD hell no here proof  http//steamcommunity.com/id/tabdeli 
Terrible game. 1/10 WOULD NOT PLAY.
When you play Counter Strike, the terrorists win.
This game doesnt have 7 day bans. 0/10
This game is so bad that if you play it it will suck your will to lI have.  Yes, like in Waynes world.  Yes, it will suck.
hey i pey but no working 
Spent nearly 2 years on this. Dont know why
One will find it is quite easy to encounter persons of highly polished skills in the original version of the Counter-Strike games. This is evidenced by thousands of hours on many of the players records keep in mind that Steam has not been tracking game hours for a good few years after it first came out with this mod!  I highly suggest one passes by this out of date game, as classic as it may be. I compare an exaggeration of the experience for a new player to that of being anally entered, spontaneously, by barbed nethers. Overwhelming, painful, and a strong sense of defenselessness.  One would do well to instead spend their time playing the latest, sexiest version, anyway. After all, the gameplay is an evolution on the one this game has to offer. I also recommend passing over the current middle-child version Source.
in 2011, I would have recomended this game, but sadly, it has degenerated beyond recognition. its sad to see such a great game fall. you need only join a server once to see that cs 1.6 is no more. get cs cz or cs source as theyre better choices these days.
It was better before 2010 when there were not so many hackers. Now is full of hackers... in CSGO are like 30percent-50percent of hackers but in cs 1.6 there are over 60percent hackers. Poor game now.
AFTER I BOUGHT OFFICIAL CS 1.6 ON STEAM, I WAS KICKED FROM 7 OF 10 SERVERS BECAUSE OF FAKE CS CLIENT. HAIL GABE. 
Thats a good game
A fun walk down nostalgia lane. That being said, I havent seen a reason to replay this game in some time.
Never Play This Game Ever Period End Of Story.............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
I find it impossible to improve at this game in any way.
Not many servers anymore. No point in buying.
cannot connect to any servers Reasons Fake client i was on idle And other reasons I JUST GET KICKED AND ANOTHER ONE THE SERVER IS FULL BUT NOT! I rate this 1/10 its good but the servers man and wheres the bots? WASTE OF MONEY
Second worst FPS game i have ever played after CSGO
really bad game all time if i press g or t its connect to server
Old but gold. But CSGO &gt CS1.6  Buy this game only in bundles with CSGO. Because game itself is outdated. Still there is plenty unofficial server you can play with awesome gamemodes yo couldnt find in CSGO.
i love counter-strike and all the others but the only problem with it is that it doesnt have a bot system for offline
in this game u shoot and its sucks
What was probably considered then to be the definitI have shooter it has now become a boring somewhat empty game with either pros or trolls. 6/10
Honestly it does nothing to explain to the player the concept of accuracy and it ruins the experience, how with just a crosshair am I expected to understand the difference between it being a little wider and a little narrower. Its a fun shooter dont get me wrong, but the whole crosshair shitfuckt is bad and should have been reworked instead of kept in every CS game
 Old game.  Old graphic.  Old engine.  But never get bored.
we cannot play single player with bots anymore? not recommanded 
full of veterans
For Nostalgia only the game has aged horribly, not only the graphics, but also the gameplay, and the multiplayer is overrun with cheaters and nerds, ugh, some games are better left in the past, where they belong
This is great if you like shitshit things like bloated adminmods and wanna be CAL-i rejects
Won the game in less than an hour. 10/10
This game sucks cannot hit shit
its time for cs go
I have god VAC BAN and i dont use cheats ,if u can help me send me an email to  60centx@gmail.com  Thanks
cannot join any servers, I only play alone 
Classic game. Very innovatI have at its time and its fun to play. You should get its second remake Counter-Strike Global Offensive have though which is improved in almost every aspect of the game. Only get this if youre a nostalgic freak -
Counter-Strike, this one also known as Counter-Strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. And a very well known one at that. It was first available as a free mod for Half-Life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got its way onto Steam, as a serapately sold title.  So, how is the player base? Counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an actI have player base. You will see many servers, up to 32 players. At very least there are many Russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, cannot really see past them. On bad side, most seems to prefer Terrorist plant C4 mode and then De_Dust2 is the most played map. A lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. And most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning.  Counter-Strike is a very well known realistical FPS. It gained its popularity while being free mod for popular Half-Life, because it provided something else what wasnt overused yet - realistical shootouts using models of real weapons, you know in team multiplayer. Unforgiving and furious. Or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. Whichever one you prefer.   Counter-Strike has two types of map. First, de, is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. One of the terrorists spawns with C4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of Ts victory. Roles change as Terrorists will have now to defend this place from CTs, whos aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case CTs will win the round, no matter how many more Ts are left. Pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. And if one site is too well defended, Ts can go to another one. And then there is a second type, cs, in which CTs have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. The problem there, is that hostage NPCs arent perfect though good enough and since CTs have to rescue them all, Terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since CTs will have no choice but to come to win. Much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday Team Deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. Much simpler anyway.  Now, the core gameplay... There are few rounds. Each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. There is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. There are no items placed on map itself either on correct, official maps, no kind of medikits. In spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press b button or whichever you set to bring up buy menu, where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. Yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. What you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. Yep, if it doesnt smell like prototype of modern military shooters Once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. And here comes the art of recoil and aiming. For you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. If you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. It drops while you are shooting too. Thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. You will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving it also makes you silent, so do it often, or just stand and crouch sometimes. Burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. Another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. So dont be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. The game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a MASSI have damage. And you also got three kinds of grenades. ExplosI have HE, which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. Flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. And Smoke Grenade, when you dont want enemies to see you coming and dont want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers who instakill you when you peek around corner. Protip You run slightly faster with knife out.  And well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. The weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. There are just best and bad weapons. From pistols Desert Eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. Shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and Assault Rifles can kill even better at close range. Sub-Machine Guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to Rifles. Rifles category has two best guns all-range assault rifle like AK-47 and all-range sniper rifle like AWP which doesnt even require headshot to one-hit kill, exactly what majority of people use. The only Machine Gun is pew pew pew cannot hit. And all-range is all-range, random is random. You may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your AK-47 by luck. Or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. Its just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. Slow-down when being hit doesnt seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. And random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. And yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. Exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that Counter-Strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. And well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didnt make the game any more amazing.  But you know, its not too bad. It does teamwork well. Sometimes the game just works. When you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. Provide covering fire to the corner. When upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases. And its pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you dont feel like could be prevented. Yea, getting shot by sniper.  And yes, this game has good enough sounds. No music, sadly. The graphics are quite HL1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. The levels are a bit of bland though.  cannot really recommend it. Because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. And player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. Its not like there arent enough military/realistical shooters anyway.
I keep getting owned all the time and I am bad
death
Best FPS team-play game ever made untill CSGO was out. There are too many cheaters and cracked players that are spoiling all of the fun out of the game. Besides, the game itself is way too old for me.
This game is overrated.
Cheaters only trust me its gross
This reboot of the series fell flat just go back to CSGO
i dont really like this because it can gI have you the WUMBAAA virus it is a bit of a classic though
its bad, because im banned
terrible game.    waste of money.
I just bought Counter-Strike and I cannot play it because the mouse aiming doesnt work. I really want my money back.
Very boring, played it a few times, and never played it again. Waste of money.
One of the most over-rated game ever. Other mods died while CS didnt die when it should have. The lack of changes and improvements to the base game trough years is utterly disgusting and not a proper excuse. Character slows down when its shot? Server side location tracking instead of client based for better accurate data? Years behind other mods, that died.
Its so boring itll put you to sleep! A must have gay game!.....NOT! Do you love spawning every 5 seconds and then dieing instantly? Then this games for you! Do you love hackers? Then this games for you! Do you love outdated graphics? Then this games for you! ZZZzzz....
It doesnt load, if it does Ill change this.
Graphics are trash.
completly oudated
This was one of the best first person shooter and fps games. After steam updated the fpsengine and made other changes to the game after more than 10 years of good gameplay, I would rather say that this is a now a rip-off. The game doesnt work properly and the developers isnt listening to the players when theyre updating the game.   If steam would roll back the game to before they update I would recommend this game because of the good gameplay. At the moment because of the update I just want my money back!
Dont buy this shit !
My mouse sucks with this game it keeps teleporting
If you like this old game then you must spend wayyyy too much time on Xbox LI have or something.
Outdated graphics, and my bullets wont hit ever except when im really close. Why would anyone buy this when there are free games like battlefieldheroes that have better graphics and control better. Also, the amount of hacking in this game is tremendous, i join a server and about 30percent of the people playing are using some form of hacx. The biggest rip-of off my life.
well i know its old school BUT no
I recommend this game to anyone who is a shit up sucmbag
-10 cheats for all -_- shit kids
This game has its ups and downs but I cannot stand playing it because of this damn resolution. Damn. I suggest getting css or csgo. Counter Strike original is good but there are no actI have servers. If youre buying this game you should also go get a subscribtion for ESEA as well.
wasted too much of my life on this one
The servers are dead,Vac anti cheat is dead so mexicans and hackers rule the semi-alI have servers. Vote trump to make counter strike great again.Also God is dead. All gold source games removing Sven coop and half life are dead
wrost gaem i evre prayed
Because Im such a huge fan of CSGO and CSS, I decided to purchase and play the original Counter Strike. However good the game may be its all based on petty nostalgia. If you were to compare the game to CSS or CSGO you would realize how inferior it really is to the two. You might say that CSGO turned crap once Valve added cases and payed cosmetics, and in turn that makes CS 1.6 better than CSGO. To that I say CSGO has better graphics no surprise and better controls, if its the payed skins that turn you away from the game then just dont buy skins/cases/keys. Overall I would say based on CS 1.6s time period its a revolutionary game, however compared to modern choices the game is shit.  5/10
Graphic rly bad
i love this game
oldschooll...
game sucks hard
VOLVO DELETE THIS GAME PLS!!!!!!! THE shittiest GAME I have EVER PLAYED
i cannot even open it waste of money completely i want my money back
With this new CS 1.6 you cannot play.Lag as f*ck.Got an awesome PC but this CS dont mind that,just keep lagging. My internet con. its great too but this CS aint giving sh*t.Just keep on lagging!
yuck dont make me sick
I payed money for this?
got called a suka shit idi nahui and was told to go kill myself. gr8 community.
...................
The others always kill you and your team mates only just fooling around and show to everyone how many mocking word they know.    I cannot recommend this game no-one.
I wouldnt recommend CS to anyone, not even my worst enemy.
If u are bored and dont know what to do with your life play this.  Good MP.. Alot of Cheaters.. And can be downloaded for free.  Overall 3/10
Installed the game  Joined a server Server changed every button on the keyboard to a command to join this server Changed the menu screen to ads for this server uninstall.exe This game is 16 years old why isnt this fixed for shits sake
NegatI have cuz no skins in this game. Ez skins ez lyfee
I cannot shiting start this game, its not even loading....
IT DOES NOT WORK! YOU HAVE TO shitING DO A LOT OF THINGS IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK! ABSOLUTELY shit!
I want my 3 h back
Every button I  f ucking press connects me to a different server. 
Counter-Strike Global Offensive have is the current iteration of Valve’s top-in-class competitive have shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. Learning from its experience with Team Fortress 2, Valve has a miniature economy in CS GO that revolves entirely around gun decals. Players get a few ‘drops’ a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate – the latter of which cost £1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. Obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins with prices in the hundreds of pounds, then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies.  I don’t pay much attention to the CS GO economy as a whole, though it’s interesting enough, but it’s important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the game’s audience takes it very seriously indeed. In the days after a new Operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, Twitch streams with gI haveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. You get the picture.    I gI have such context on CS GO’s economy because – even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself – it is the molten core of Operation Vanguard. CS GO is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of Operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around £3 for an access pass – with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards.  To gI have an exhaustI have history of Operations would be no more useful than a general overview. If you play Counter-Strike then the chances are you play a lot of Counter-Strike. What the Operations do is freshen things up a bit – naturally they don’t disrupt the regular Dust-Mirage-Inferno cycle of competitive have play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, £3 a few times a year is chicken feed.  Operation Vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. The first problem I have with it is major the way it’s sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. To participate in Operation Breakout you bought an ‘All-Access Pass’ for £2.39. To participate in Operation Vanguard I bought an ‘Access Pass’ for £2.39. The difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when OV popped up in Counter-Strike’s home menu I bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing.  OV’s selling point is two ‘campaigns,’ a series of missions with three branching paths. The missions are things like ‘Win 16 rounds on map X’ and ‘Kill 20 chickens in Deathmatch mode,’ and completing one bags a pre-determined award – either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. So far, so OK. But in fact OV has two more campaigns, both of which cost £1.79 to access – which follow more or less the same pattern.    To be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. I’m happy to pay for Operations, and OV’s combined total of around £6 in the context of the time I put into Counter-Strike is really not an issue. But that switch from ‘All-Access Pass’ to ‘Access Pass with the right to buy more access’, just shit♥♥ me right off.  First of all I felt conned. I bought the OV pass in the same way I’d bought all the previous Operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised I’d been fooled by the removal of ‘All.’ Secondly, what the two ‘extra’ purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of OV’s mission book. But thirdly, and this is the real killer, you’re encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly Offensive have design decision in Vanguard.  There are multi-day cooldowns on missions. That’s right Rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to lI haven up day-to-day business in CS GO, but in fact Vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one cooldown timers.  Let me set the scene for you. I love Counter-Strike. I saw Vanguard was out on a Thursday, and cleared Friday night. Got in a few beers. Booted it up and bought the pass. I played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. Chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. So around half an hour into my evening of joy I was gI haven a four-day cooldown for the next mission.    You can slice this any way you want, but it’s shitfuckt. The sad thing is I get the thought process behind it. Consider you’re Valve, in charge of a game where players a want new content but b put in so many hours that they’ll rush through anything almost instantly. For example, mission chains. Operation Breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. It was fine but the missions never felt… important. So Operation Vanguard’s missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are gI haven the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. You will not complete this content before we say so, because you can’t.  Oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now you’re allowed to do more missions in a set period. That’s right. You’re basically paying to reduce cooldowns. In a Valve game.  The thing is that Operation Vanguard is only a ‘campaign’ in the same way that a pile of biscuits is ‘lunch.’ The missions are basic objectI haves like ‘Win 16 competitive have rounds on Season’ or ‘Get 100 FAMAS kills in Deathmatch mode.’ And what do you get for completing them? Either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. The first is fair enough, but the second… I mean, at this point I already felt pretty rinsed by Operation Vanguard, and now it’s ‘rewarding’ me with crates that I need to pay more money to open.    There is a school of thought that says Valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesn’t flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. To that argument the only appropriate response is – who cares? I play Counter-Strike GO because it’s a great game, I don’t play it because of the economy, and while I accept the latter is how Valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game – if indeed this explanation holds water – then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. That is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it.  The sad thing is that Operation Vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in Season and Back Alley that feel like potential classics. Yeah they’re all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with CS GO and will be tweaked over the coming months. Every CS GO operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of Operation Vanguard’s structure is to elongate this beyond a few days – to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. It at least manages this.  I want to emphasise that I’m an enormous fan and c
 Counter-Strike 1.6 Go play CSGO...
The game is outdated and I dont think anyone plays it. Its better to get the newer ones.
Worst game ever, bad graphics and only Mexicans play it.
i dont care if its old, i cannot play it because it looks like sНit
wouldnt mind this game if the community wasnt full of wife beater enthusiasts and Nazi supporters...  just sayin
FOR THOSE FROM CSGO Im sorry but it feels very strange, and doesnt make much sense. GI haven its differences in handling sensitivity, and just everything really, unless youre commited, youll just got 40 to 160 on a DM like I did. Not the best experience, especially since there was nothing I knew to even improve.
was disappointed with the low graphics technology. i made the mistake of purchasing the whole CS game pack. only decent CS game is CS GO
the graphics are terrible and theres no aim assist why play game? why
If you enjoy stressful online multiplayer games in FPS format then you will like this game.   I just dont like this game because the rules are in a normal match is if you die you have to sit in spectator mode until the round is over. I know there is other gamemodes and mods available for this game but the core game itself isnt the best.
Boring !Poor graphics .
shit ass
Bad effects , its like mario .
shit-Strike is a lame game where you tell scrubz LOL I shit YOUR MOM LAST NIGHT I PWN YOU NOOB XD, and by thou words, you fornicate the offsprings mothers, hence the title shit-Strike. This game is really gay, even the title shows two dudes. WOW, THERES NO WOMEN IN THIS GAME, ITS SEXIST AS WELL. I also hate the bugged aiming mechanic where you cannot use your iron sights, its like the gay soldiers jacked each others peepees so hard that their arm muscles cannot move their guns, shiting gay game, only turbonerds play this turd.
This game did a lot of neat things for its time. But dont get it now. Theres no reason to buy something that isnt an M4 or an AK-47, and if you are a CT that just got a kill, you drop your M4 and take his AK, unless you memorize the recoil pattern on the gun youre firing you will lose every time, not that it helps because anyone still playing this game has been playing for 13 years and will know where you are at all times and be able to AWP you a new ventilation shaft in your forehead from 400 yards the same second your arm moves into visibility from behind a door. Just hold your horses, and lets hope they save Counter-Strikes from itself with CSGO
i love this game,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, born to plat 1.6
If you are looking for a straight-forward shooter with confusing controls, this is it.
Not enough 1v1 QS servers. 2/10 would not buy again.
Its like CSGO, but worse. Uninstalled.
WOW 1.6 IS SO PURE BEST COUNTER STRIKE AM IRITE US OLD shit HUHHUHHUHH LELELELELLEELLELE XDDDDDDDDD god 1.6 shitfucks are so elitist dont play this unless you use esea go play source THE BEST COUNTER STRIKE
this game sux
cannot play this game on my dedicated graphic card thanks to valves brilliant update.   Edit And now my game is cut again. What the actual frak.
Like downloading Quake sounds over and over? THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!  Also hackers.
In my toddler times I spent a great deal of time playing this. Many sequels have come and gone, but so far I still think of this as one, if not the best version.  However it did not aged well. Most servers are filled with hackers or oblige you to install shady protection solutions on your computer.  So nowadays youre better of following one of the following options   - Turn around and check TF2 - Turn around and check CSGO
THE OLD COUNTER IS STUPID THERE UNBOXINGS ITS FOR LIITTLE LOSER WITH NO MONEY WHO STILL PKAY shit♥♥ fuck OLD GAMES FOR DUMB fuck KIDS.
big piece of shit
boring
I first played Counter-Strike back in 1999, when it was still just a mod. I went to it on a daily basis, for several hours, as my main source of entertainment and gathering of friends until about 2002, when other activities came along. I only went back to it now, in 2012. This unveiled the greatest disappointment and proof of destruction of a game I have ever experienced. As it is today, this is not Counter-Strike. It is a broken, unrecognizable, nearly useless form of the original game. Valve has let this game rot to death and still make an easy profit for nothing. The server browser is a joke. It is simply broken. The results it returns are completely inaccurate and all servers you will find are run by non-Steam users, with the game settings altered to who knows what, and 90percent of them playing the Dust map. The other servers are running non-official maps and pointless game modes. In addition, you can not set your client to disallow the automatic download of custom server sounds or other trash that is force-fed through your connection to alter the game. Counter-Strike has been so blatantly abandoned, that it is shocking Valve still charges something for it. You will also see advertisements while you are connecting to the servers, and while you wait for the next round once you have been killed. Counter-Strike is the epitome of falling from grace and becoming an outright failure. It has become an embarrassment and a gaming tragedy.  Counter-Strike is bad.
Never liked old games. And I was right.
A good old game, still able to have fun with it  9/10
this game sucks lol
shit game cod ghosts is better
is good game, better than the rubbish ruski cs go
cs source is better
no drops    What a shit game
what is this a cod ripoff
it does not works with joystick. 
AddictI have, dull, and repetitI have, Counter-Strike will eat up hours that youll want to have back. There are two newer iterations of this game now, both of which are similarly wasteful of time. While one might argue that any game is not a productI have use of ones days, Counter-Strike ranks one step above almost anything out there unless youre freakishly good or an inveterate camper, youll spend the lions share of your gameplay idly waiting to respawn. More, youll inevitably especially in 1.6 run into players so good that youll be unsure whether theyre superlatI have gamers or superlatI have cheaters. And in Counter-Strike, theres really no way of telling. Prepare yourself for frustration, either way.   Avoid.
This game destroyd my life, I shiting hate it.
Since this game obviously doesnt have a negatI have review section...  I like to wear dresses sometimes and cuddle my dog whilst telling him, Good Boy
I cheated a student in a class in my high school out of ten bucks for a boxed copy that didnt register on Steam. He literally begged me for two days to buy it. I finally relented and sold it to him. He then spent the next day bugging me to gI have him a refund because he is an idiot. Also my true life story has single handedly brought down the community around this mod, so you shouldnt buy it. Take that, Valve!
its basically just clicking on people until they die
Great features such as shooting a deasert eagle at speeds that would break your wrist
they should have just renamed this game to de_dust2
Sorry all lovers of this game but no, i dont recommend this game because it is too old better buy global Offensive have this game is only if you want feel old times
WORST GAME EVER. WHY NOT SOURCE? WHY ? THIS GAME IS SO shitING shitshit
OLD. Dont play it unless You WANT TO GET STUCK IN A DOOR AND LET IT SING THE SONG OF ITS shitING PEOPLE!!!!
Writing this review because of Valves paid mod policy
shiting terrible. Waste of 10 bucks. CSGO is much better
You must be legally required to own this game to apply for citizenship in Mexico.
A game that was released when i was a couple of months old, I dont play it that offend that means i will gI have it a  big  buy counterstirke global Offensive have.
I am not recommend for this game! !
The graphics are awfull! Looks like it was made in 2000 or something like that!
cs go ripoff
This Game Sucks So Much It Makes COD Look Beast. Screw You Gaben You Fat Piece Of Sh*t
What servers?
Saw a hostage pick up a Mac-10 and kill a terrorist.  10/10 recommend CSGN.,
The best game in the world at one time. But now, its time to admit that other, newer games have taken its spot. Theres little reason to play the original CS other than for historical curiosity.
This game ruined my life. Played beta-1.5 30 hours at a time. Easily have hours clocked in the 6 digits between versions, just not on this steam account. Stopped going to school. Stopped eating. Dropped out,
Nah, this game is fun but glitch as hell serch for a popper game..
10/Oct
Really Great Classic But Every server I go on I get kicked and banned because people kick me because im not good enough for them and thats not fair is it? well oh well some times.We cannot just sit down and enjoy the classics.....
age 10-16 lost to this game. kinda good XD,
Game was fun when i was like 7, lol now many years later, there are few servers to play in still packed but not fun levels. Just the same one over, most on the global Offensive have, and I liked the plane one with many more but no one plays em! Cheh
cannot even play it because screen for some reson is super sized and i cannot adjust it because you cannot get into the opitions

Get every single cheater off of this game. Permanently. VAC isnt doing its job well at all. Many cheaters roam in this game. It needs to stop. Cheaters, if youre reading this which you proberably are, you are a shitshit♥.
So i bought this game, and didnt work it appears only a black screen.Can anyone help me 
This game was amazing but now it feels really clunky and pointless interms of gameplay. There is a safe way of playing this game and that is to spray like crazy. Sense this game is very old headshots are far to easy to land making sprays all the more cheap, you are litterally being rewarded for being a reckless player.  if you want to get a better feel of Counter-Strike just get Counter Strike Source. Its pretty much CS but fixed with a better physics, online sync, and better hit detection.  This game doesnt hold up with games today.
wtf happened to the fps? did they put a limit on it?
Dont Buy This Game!  If you can buy the cs pack with all games for like 4 pound then sweet, gI have it a go, but if your like me and new to playing csgo you are not going to find the original that good.  Yes it would have been good back in the day, but csgo is were its at, and alot more fun, if you like hacking, and people harrasing each other, then play this game.
-slit my wrists after playing this game -killed my family by failing to defuse a bomb and being told to save by my grandparents
cannot play with bot 
In its day, CS 1.6 was the shining example of a multiplayer FPS experience. It was just one of those games that, if you didnt own it, you were just statistically worse than everyone else. Oh, how the might have fallen. Nowadays, the game is plagued with a general lack of interest, as most of its fans have moved on to its vastly superior brothers, CSS and CSGO, and for good reason.  I would recommend playersonly play on servers they trust. This is because apparently one server overwrote all of my unused keys to connect to xdd.ms-shadow.ro27015, which is also a server i would recommend avoiding at all costs.  This game is a relic, a fossil from an age of gaming long past.
the game removed on steam I would be happy if you can return it to me thanks
I am spin all the time when i enter on a server...please help
The best FPS game in the history for a reason. The game is 15-16 years old, but still peoples playing it. I played really really lot with this game, when i was younger. Thousands of hours. ,
Ehhh its okay
People still play this game? I was forced to buy it due to ex g/f. She was actually a professional, as in got paid, counter-strike player.
this game is sh*t literaly. Most of the servers are ok but when you shoot your gun you really cannot tell where your bullets are landing after that. Also the registration is crap as well. Dont buy this game unless you want to get sh*tted on by a bunch of perubian butt pirates who cannot afford anything or run anything else besides this terrible game.
Osm Loved To play 
Real shit game nowadays. Not playable anymore. Go Source or Global Offensive have.
to much cheaters
CS1.6 in my top 10 all time favorite games including its previous versions of which I have played 1.3-1.5 without a doubt the keystone in FPS gaming history and a must for all who claim to be hardcore gamers 10/10,
This is the best game ever I have playded. It very is nice i like lot
The devs must be shitshit, 2015 and take a look at the graphic... 2/10
