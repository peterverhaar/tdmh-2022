"10911,Neverwinter,2018.0,""Overall, it's a fun and easy game. The leveling is kind of fast, and it doesnt exactly pace you for when it starts slowing down and in order to get good gear by the time you reach lvl 70 (when things get real difficult) you need to extensively farm (in my  case) to avoid spending real-life money. The developers really push you to spend real-life money on the game, and in order to upgrade guild things and all that junk, you basically HAVE to spend real-life money to get the things you need. There's a lot of in-game currency, but if you're not planning on spending money you really only need to pay attention to only a select few. Since the leveling is sorta fast, most of the lore went right over my head ( also because i was too busy farming to read any of the journal crap ). This was my first time jumping into D&D and I love it."",1"
"10912,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I played until level 40-ish and I can say that this game is extremely Pay 2 Win. At higher level it is almost impossible to get any decent gear (without investig a ton of time or money). Professios require quite a lot of time (which people with a life don't have). It keeps the player tied to the game.Missions are repetitieve and lack any originality. And soon after the level 30 even weak mobs will be able kill you.PvP is poorly balanced and you will most likely get matched with some overpowered players, who paid for their gear.Overall the game requires a lot of time from the player, oferring very little in exchange. Unless you have a lot of money to spare for this game, you will unlikely enjoy this game."",0"
"10913,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Fun game with some interesting ideas that falls apart into a P2W mess if you *really* try to play it like a traditional MMOIt has a massive amount of content, both from the development team and user-generated through their map editor, and really, you could do a lot worse if you're just looking to waste some time and have some fun on a free game. It's fun even if you play it as a single-player action game.I rate this game 3 out of 5 paywalled races."",1"
"10914,Neverwinter,2016.0,""just put it this way, the game is F2P, its an RPG, lots of folks play, you can still quest and do dungeons even without the super rare legendary """"ive been playing a lot longer than you"""" gear. could the game use some more work, yeah, but the way it is, the game is still decent. IMO, they should focus on improving the game overall rather than keep releasing new modules. or at least focus on game mechanics, etc for next two major updates, then go back to releasing modules. i may not have a lot of time invested in the game to voice my opinion about the game overall, but i like RPG's and while im not a hardcore player, im sure somebody would value this opinion/review."",1"
"10915,Neverwinter,2017.0,""I have been really enjoying neverwinter, and while i haven't reached end game yet (level 60 cap is 70), i do think this is an excellent game thus far. Made a note for a few points below.PROS :Combat system is the BEST i've played in any MMO (ESO, FFVI, Tera, and Wow)Free to playLarge variety of mountsYou can hire companions to fight alongside you (NPC's) and outfit themYou can earn ZEN (market currency) without spending any actual moneylots of achievable goals VIP is only $10/month vs $15 for WOW or FFVIGuilds can own strongholds, and can level up the stronghold for special benefits for their members (+health, +exp, ect.)Promotional events where Crypted studios (or partners) give away in game itemsConsPrices in the market seem a bit high for items ($10 for a 24 slot bag)Loot - Low variety of loot, seem to find the same looking loot constantlyNo Set items - Haven't seen any set items (I'm level 60) .I miss the variety of set items from wow.Leveling up goes by too fastThat's all i got for now. As far as leveling goes, some people may enjoy leveling up quick, personally it is too fast for me. I'm almost to the level cap and there's an incredible amount of area's i haven't touched. Overall this is a very fun game thus far and i'm glad i picked it up, highly recommend."",1"
"10916,Neverwinter,2016.0,""This game makes me so frustrated.  It has pros and cons, and if tended to could be so much better for players and producers. After playing various characters reaching endgame this is my conclusion-->PVE - Amazing tho a bit linear, still has good stories and quests compared to allot of other grinds out there.  I enjoyed many of the zones and contrary to many critics on vioce acting I didn't find it too bad.  Which is hardwork considering it's f2p.  Combat is fun and fast paced (not too easy, not to hard) and allows for some room to make character builds.  And if you have friends to play with and choose not to pay money to climb this game could be very extensive on PvE terms.  The foundry is one of the best aspects of the game.  It doesn't take a computer science degree to understand the fundamentals to allow for campaign creation. (However it does go down quite often which is unfortunate)PVP - *sigh*  This is the most damaging aspect of the game.  It has the potential to be great but anyone who plays who has not sunked 1k real money into will admit - """"Is broken""""  Unbalanced and pure p2w.  Literally post upon post will say the same thing without a change.  Unless pvp is fixed the competetive fan base will dwindle like a candle as it is already and continue until gone.   But in overall opinion it is a fair f2p game but has the potential to be one of the best if handled better."",1"
"10917,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I'd say it's one of the better free to play games out there, but with that being said, there are some faults with it. Since it is a F2P MMO, there is obviosly going to be a microtransactions store. However, I wouldn't exactly say that it is pay to win.With the aiming and casting mechanics, early game is fast paced and fun. The only problem I have with this game is the end-game. After reaching the max level, everything becomes a daily quest. You log in, do the quests, claim your reward, maybe replay your favorite dungeons, and then get off. It becomes tedious and boring after a while.If you're looking for a casual MMO to get into where you don't have to farm for hours on end, give this game a try."",1"
"10918,Neverwinter,2015.0,""After 16 years of MMO gaming, this has been the most innovative and fun game I have played. I was an old school MMORPG player and also a long time reader of the books of Forgotten Realms and this game has kept to what the actual world its set in has been portrayed as in the books which is rare. The combat is more than just click and go, you have the ability to completely dodge an attack and that makes this game require some actual skill which only a few MMORPG's have. It gives a sense of challenge and doesn't empower those who spend money to a point in which a person who doesn't can't compete with them. Very fun, and a very friendly atmosphere, I give this game a 10/10 in all points. Give this a try if you enjoy games where you can be uber without years of grinding or dungeon running, and enjoy a game that is completely playable solo. See you ingame!"",1"
"10919,Neverwinter,2018.0,"" Hmmm adveritsments for this game i would give a 3/5  it looks   like a common ftp mmo.

"10920,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Overall, the game is passable, if not that user-friendly.A few points, qualms, and nitpicks about the game, and the latest expansion:- I get the impression that the shift from F2P to P2W is becoming more and more pronounced"
"10921,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Hearing stories of Dungeons & Dragons seemed epic and I loved the concept. I've never played the card game with anyone, and when I stumbled upon this game, I was quiet amazed.I have experienced many MMO's, from WoW to a million of other titles - but I've never really engaged in them since all of them seemed similar to WoW. All of them were reflections of what WoW became and it seemed pointless playing other MMO's. This is a whole other story.The character creation stage of the game didn't amaze me, although reading backround stories about each race was quite nice. Choosing the back story of your now-ready adventure is also unique allowing you to rolepay and """"bond"""" with your fighter as weird as that sounds. With these sort of games it's hard to see the things that """"make you stay"""" from the very beginning, but the main reason behind all the hours that I put into the game is because of the combat system. You don't have a million spells compressed into hotkeys that make you smash your keyboard at any important battle. Here, you have a limited amount of tabs of spells available at one time. It's easy to handle, and easy to get a hold of. Having such limited access to a wild root of spells, prepares you to make serious choices - but also allows you to develop your own way of battle with a few classes, which is quiet special and makes the game more enjoyable. You might have a friend that is a Priest, like you, but he might be a """"engaging in battle"""" priest (obvs not a tank) whereas you may be a support priest healing him. Having a group of friends that are all of a different class is obviously the best resolution, allowing you to see how all the classes engage in battle and how all the classes can work together to reach the same goal. The opportunities are endless and with no time limit on how long you have to spend playing, you can be deciding your own way of fighting technique - in your own very way for some time. That is the main reason I stayed and I'm not vouching for anybody else. The game is more enjoyable (not better by any means) when playing with your friends. Dwelling in deep, dangerous dungeons with a group of close companions sounds like a dream and if that's what you're looking for in a game, then Neverwinter should be your choice. There is a large number of dungeons from an early level with them getting more advanced as you advance. The monsters get tougher and more bigger with each new dungeons available. Each dungeon ends with a final, gigantic boss which you SHOULD find challenging. They range from demented souls to... dragons.But yeah, that's just a small ounce of the game. If you're trying to find out more about the game, the best advice I can give is to actually play the game because streams and recorded videos cannot capture the full essence of the game.By no means am I an expert in this game, but I hope that this helped the newcomers that are trying to get in the game."",1"
"10922,Neverwinter,2017.0,""Ever since I played the first Neverwinter Nights, I've always wanted to be a Drow Rogue/Shadowdancer.With Neverwinter Nights 2, this dream became true. Drows were added as a playable race and I was damn happy. Unfortunately the game played awfully and I could not get used to the controls.And then I've found this game and holy moly!Drow race? CheckRace specific quests? Check Good story? CheckGood controls? CheckGood graphics? CheckWhat more can I ask for? It's fun! Check it out. You can't be a Shadowdancer though.  "",1"

"10924,Neverwinter,2015.0,""Hands down one of the best free MMOs I have ever played.  The game is not the most gorgeous, but it looks good.  The game is not incredibly complex, but it has an intricate balance.  I really enjoyed my time in the game... and even outside of it.The dynamic of playing the game from a browser with my companions is brilliant.  The fact that I can craft from the same browser is amazing!  If they had an app that did something similar, I'd almost pay a small monthly fee for it.  The companion system by itself is actually pretty awesome.  Someone to hang out with you and support or tank or fill whatever gap you have is pretty awesome.  While some of them could stand to be a little better, they are pretty good overall and the ones at the beginning of the game are very helpful. My favorite part, however, is the user created content.  The ability to run a """"dungeon"""" created by another player is amazing.  I've run some good ones and bad ones, but that feature is awesome!  When I say dungeon, it does it a bit of dis-service.  It is more like an entire zone built with encounters, buildings, bosses and loot tables that plays out as a full quest or mission.  Some of them can be done in 10 or 20 minutes, while others may take more than hour.  The difficulty is also variable.The micro-transactions for this game can get pricey, but I didn't worry too much about them.  They have some interesting packs and people who plan to invest a lot of time can easily wait until a sale and get a great deal.  IMO, the game is good enough to at least invest a little bit."",1"
"10925,Neverwinter,2015.0,""I would recommend this game to others, however not the payable content. It is quite confusing to install, and  the customer service takes over 24 hours if you happen to need any help. Overall really enjoying the game."",1"
10926,Neverwinter,2015.0,Game is amazing they push out a lot of content very quickly but havent fixed a bug in years match making hasnt worked since closed beta even the healing potions in pvp arenas have been bugged for nearly 2 years now.  we are talking game breaking bugs being completely ignores becuase content sells at a higher price than bug fixes.,0
"10927,Neverwinter,2016.0,""I enjoy many aspects of the game, i don't mind the graphics I love where they're taking the mods, BUT this game is so damn spendy to be equal to others its not worth the time/heartbreak.. I would sub to this game for 15.00 a month if we were equal in the ability to gain items, but I'm not going to match Mister fat wallet for content.. Look at all the DLC costs.. 434.00 omg. I could buy 8 games for that. or sub to one game for years..."",0"
"10928,Neverwinter,2014.0,""This Game is not bad as I thought. The only thing I wanted to complain with it the Zen. I wanted to try different classes, and I need Zen to unlock character lot. I cannot buy Zen neither on their website nor in game cash shop. It keeps saying """"cannot buy Zen at this time."""" Well, when can I buy Zen then? If you really want to make money, you should not stop us from paying you money. Come on! I beg you, here is my money, give me some zen. =. ="",0"
"10929,Neverwinter,2017.0,""It's quite entertaining at the beginning but the farther you go the more it becomes obvious that you have to pay.

10930,Neverwinter,2014.0,Worst support ever!! Don't play this title.   I thought one of the mounts looked neat so I bought one of the DLC packs for the game for me and a friend. About a week later my account got hacked and I lost all my resources I had gained in the game.     I issued a ticket and got a reply. What there support said is that there was no way for them to see if the attack was from me or another IP so they would not do the rollback. I had high hopes for the game the idea is neat but if you are just going to be one of the many hacked accounts where no rollbacks are given what is the point in playing the game.     If eventually all your stuff will be gone and you will have to start over then what is the point. Perfect world has terrible support google around and you will see for yourself terrible response times and no real support when they do get back to you.,0
10931,Neverwinter,2018.0,most of my playtime belongs to the downloading/patching from the 3 times i have tried this game and everytime i find it substandard and dreary. We must ignore the p2w for it was foretold in the prophecy.,0
"10932,Neverwinter,2018.0,""Played this game for a few hours. I'm kind of a casual mmo player who enjoys stories, lores, and exploration. I'm not so much into PVP. So far I'm enjoying the game. I'm up to lvl 25 now and it's been pretty easy... maybe too easy.There's a lot of weird mechanics like if u pick up some special loot chest you need to pay real money to open them? However, those loot boxses seems to only give out cosmetic drops, which aren't really needed. Beginning at lvl 25 you'll start reaching the limit on your inventory space. I'm not sure if you can buy bags with gold coins, but I dont think you can?Over all the game reminds me a bit of the old golden MMO days. It's fun to play, but I probably won't play the end game after reading that it will be a money pit. However, I may spent some $ on invetory space or subscription as a courtesy to the game developer since I did enjoy the game a bit. (I prefer subscription model over P2W model) "",1"
"10933,Neverwinter,2017.0,""If you're a regular D&D player, you will be disappointed with this game. While going through the character creation screen, I was amazed how much only appeared to be from the D&D world and mechanics, yet much of it lacked any real basis. For example, Half-orcs are particularly dexterious while half-elves have a better constitution. If you just want a free MMORPG, I'm sure this game is whatever. But if you're looking for a real Dungeons & Dragons experience online that connects to what you do on the page, look elsewhere."",0"
"10934,Neverwinter,2017.0,""People often say that the only way to get anywhere in the game is to just pay to win which is just a lie. Yes there is the occasional pay to win players who say oh its so good just pay the 10 or 20$ but if you have ever playd good old d&d online you would know that you can do everything for free with just time. You can get Zen with standard Astral Diamonds or AD for short with just a little time spent grinding just by running one character to lvl 70 with some side quests and pvp here and there I get about 60-70k ad after bying a mount from the auction house for about 34-35k. depending on how much ad zen is worth at the time iv seen 300 zen for about 383 ad per zen and when you add it up thats 144,900 ad, just running one character to lvl 70 not trying to get ad i make about half of that. now i know what your thinking well what can 300 zen get me? to be honest not very much however there is a easy way of makeing ad like crazy once you make a little zen from grinding. its called VIP, VIP at rank one gives you 10% bonus to xp/glory (PVP)/and Professions, VIP zone access to Moonstone Mask, 15% bonus AD on daily quests in Protector's Enclave , 10 Level appropiate Identification Scrolls , and one free Enchanted key perday. Encahnted keys is where you make the ad, you get enchanted lock boxes every where I mean there like dirt I swear, So everyday of vip (30 days) you open a box and you sell what you get on the auction house untill you have enough for another month of vip and trust me you will. once you have enought for vip what ever amout of keys you have left is yours to do what ever with. so in theory you can do everything in this game for free with just a little bit of effort."",1"
"10935,Neverwinter,2017.0,""(Steam reported hours 1/20th of my playtime, standalone launcher used mostly)All in all, an incredible implementation of the D&D Universe, all fans will be thrilled especially with Dragon fights! (omg!) loads of content, stunning environments, easy to learn yet hard to master - meaning you can simply mash your way through as a dumb hero, or become a god if you apply yourself - and an RPG well worth putting time into.The amount of content and WEEKS of gametime provided in the f2p model is incredible. The voice acting is world class and the quests vary from profound to wonderfully ridiculous. If you then choose after finally completing all of the story content, which is immense, to then push for the end game content or PvP, you can attain equal footing through some grinding (which is still fun in a group), or you can go ahead and PAY THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE YOU THIS ALL FOR FREE and continue to play with the grinding aspect lowered at that level.Alternatevily there are regular events (all grand fun) and many other dungeons you can immerse yourself in without end game gear and have a fantastic time just exploring all the locations properly or socialising in one of the very many highly active guilds.People complaining about P2W must get off their high horse as I fail to see how they expect servers to magically stay active and fresh content (in this games case pretty much monthly) appear without the PROGRAMMERS GETTING PAID! Servers need upkeep, designers need to feed themselves and coders need their coffee people.Free to Play models are essentially an involved extended Demo these days imho, and if you like it, buy it!"",1"
"10936,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Honestly didn't get very far but I fail to see how this in any way reflects on D&D as an RPG. My rogue had """"super powers"""" and no stealth really to speak of, not to mention skills. It's a pretty game, but I can't say much else about it"",0"

"10939,Neverwinter,2018.0,""This game is great, I've netted about 3k hours on Ps4, and now im switching to PC.  This game is MMORPG meets dungeon crawling.The game is heavily instanced which makes for adaptive environments. you can actually seem the impacts you make on the world, which gives you a sense of importance.There used to be a foundry(hopefully their still working on it) where you can create your own scenarios and stories and quests that people can experience. The level of classic fantasy themed worlds in this game is incredible. and the environments mixed with lore books make for quite immersive zones to quest in. The dungeons are a little lengthy, but the higher level dungeons require puzzle solving that isn't really that hard, but the idea is kinda cool.

Wish there were a few more spells to use though, but other than that, I enjoy my time in Neverwinter. It's worth trying out, the only thing that I didn't like, was the fact that you have to spend money on character slots, but.. You can spend $5 and get all of them but one, so in a way, it's not really that bad.

"10945,Neverwinter,2018.0,""Review here - but I know play on PS4This game is fantastic, I only switched to the PS4 because I like the controller better for this game and some of my friends only use PS4's. Solid MMO experience for casual random dungeoning, soloing, and even doing public party stuff.There cash shop is completely nullified if you play their in-game astral diamond stock exchange (took about a month to get everything I wanted, not any of the insane stuff, but things like extra character slots and other necessities). End Game is as expected in an MMO - repeatable quests, raids, PVP (not great at all compared to other MMOs)The Amount of End Game Content is absurdly massive. If you're casual, you may never finish with the amount they put out, if you're hardcore, you can get to an 'end' point, but then do what I do and stay logged off for a summer and come back, then you'll be behind again.The game itself feels like a all around good MMO and the 'free' part is really that, free.

It takes some time getting used  to after other MMORPGs but once you're into it it's really fun and way better thatn WoW. Ypu get so much content for free and the game is awesome. Of course there are microtransactions but you should just ignore them. The game si free, they need something to make money of. Overall I advise anyone to try this game out for themselves"",1"
10948,Neverwinter,2018.0,although its a struggle getting to level 70 once you reach it the experience is much more enjoyable. This game takes alot of commitment if you wish to become a good player with good gear score. If grindy games is your thing you will surely love this game. i would rate this game 8/10,1
"10949,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Never played WOW, but I assume this is as close as you could get for free. Awesome game with tons of features and events, you'll never run out of things to do. You do have to pay actual money to get any of the cool stuff though. :("",1"

10953,Neverwinter,2018.0,Good game. Simple and easy to understand. Variety of mission/Side mission. Grind is hard but worth it. Never get bored trying to grind for higher level equipment.

10954,Neverwinter,2018.0,I'm having a blast playing this game with my kids. It's a bit linear but the stories are good. The game play is a lot of fun as well. The action aspect to combat is a lot of fun and a nice change of pace from games like WoW.,1
"10955,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I really like this game. I almost didn't bother with it after seeing such bad reviews. I realize that this is a free to play MMORPG. Something a company thought of to give the public something to do with their time. These reviews sadden me because I feel like the people who wrote them were being truly ungrateful. Some things you do need to buy but they give a lot of different items so you don't have to pay. You get a horse for crying out loud for 5 gold and a variety of companions for 2. Some games that's completely impossible. You can get astral diamonds from the online gateway and you get nearly 10,000 a day for repeatable quest, PLUS you can sell any rare items to accumulate more astral. You can even get rare pets from events pretty easily. I recently got a flame sprite, and it's awesome,  if you don't have 300,000+ in a month then it's probably not the games fault. It's probably yours because everyone has a life but the game gives you what you need to be successful. I haven't gotten to the higher levels yet BUT so far I've leveled up VERY easily with no problems. Runestones are dropped left and right from any dungeon. I love the dungeons, I love how it's practically got a video game type interface. Don't let the reviews make you turn away from this game. Check it out yourself. If you like it fine, if you don't, that's fine too, but don't leave a nasty review making other people turn away because YOU can't get something you might want. I recently got a 3ds and I am thankful. I am not going to complain about how I have very limited games or about the color. Going to be grateful the damn thing was free. Not all games are for everyone but that doesn't mean it deserves such negativity that half of these reviews displayed."",1"
10956,Neverwinter,2014.0,seems a bit laggy when in main cities but once outside its fine it's not the greatest looking game but it brings me back to a better day when yes there is a main quest but really you don't have to you can just walk away do something else entirely open world within boundaries would play again,1
10957,Neverwinter,2018.0,Until the stop with the locking of bought zen threw steam wallet i will give em a thumbs down this needs to be fixed and i urge others to do the same so the developers wake up..Do not buy zen with ur steam wallet ur zen will be locked and untradible all u buy will be soulbound..Basically they punish people ingame for buying threw steam its just mind blowing,0
"10958,Neverwinter,2014.0,""PROS1. Interesting combat system.Heroes are able to press the Shift button to execute unique abilities e.g. dodging, shield. Red areas showing AOE appear in the combat zone to show where enemy abilities are about to be cast allowing players to have an interactive PvE environment. It gives players simple but fun instructions on what to do.2. Quest directions. A shiny path will light up a waypoint to your quest helping players to end their quest faster and removing the need to search aimlessly or look for an online guide. Minor bugs do occur as the shiny path tends to jump to quests that it thinks are closest to you e.g. Switches to Quest A when you intend to do Quest B when Quest A is miles away and Quest B is next to you.3. Graphics. Better graphics compared to some other MMOs.CONS1. The game is too biased towards players who spend money. There are 2 in-game currencies called Zen and Astral Diamonds that can be exchanged with real-world cash. Both currencies are able to buy essential items such as bank storage, bags, mounts, equipment, refining, auction house items and etc. E.g. You can only upgrade your companion for 200,000 Astral Diamonds or 30 in-house currency. You can buy your level 60 gear using Astral diamonds from the auction house.2.Tedious system of leveling. Players have to spend points into 1. Feats 2. Power 3. Attributes. Each tree can actually conflict in min-maxing your skills if you are not careful. Astral diamonds must be spent to unlearn skill points. The number of points gained per level is 1, so skill point placement might be quite important.3. Quests are repetitive. After the first few quests, the same pattern will emerge. Enter dungeon, kill monsters, kill a big boss, rinse and repeat. Monsters come in standard small, medium, hulk and boss sizes. There are only some semi-unique quests like """"Artifact Recovery"""" but they still revolve around bashing.4. Tedious teleportation system. Zone-to-zone transport only occurs at locations called Gates. You must tranverse the whole way to a Gate in order to teleport to another area. There is no way to """"summon"""" your ally to you. Even right-clicking and teleporting to the player's instance is bugged.5. Bugs. Dungeons do not reset and do crash e.g. Cloak Tower (CT)6. Game Environment. You can't swim or fly. 7. In-game currency.There are too many forms of currency creates a confusing system. Almost like the EU before the Euro. Value of the different currencies depreciate extremely fast for non-cosmetic items e.g. Seal of the Manticore will be much less valuable when you get Seal of the Pegasus and so on so forth. 8. No utility rewards The only focus is on combat. E.g. Epic Hammer of Forging +25 to Blacksmithing.9. Not enough storage slots.Not such a major issue as you can easily clear all the enchantments for gold. Gold is mainly used forrefining.10. End GameAssuming you collected all your boons.Your end game will revolve around only a few areas1. Protector's Enclave2. Ice Wind Dale3. Neverdeath Graveyard OR Icespire Peak OR Rothe Valley OR Whispering Caverns OR Ebon DownsThe reason for No 3 being grouped together will be due to Cult Secrets that you do daily. They rotate and you only ever need to go to one of them to kill a dragon/dracolich.Everything else is a dungeon/lair/skirmish and you can queue for those.You will be doing skirmishes quite often if you did not pay cash for zen/astral diamonds.11. GauntlygrymGauntlygrym can be done but it's quite boring. Most players simply turn on their computers leave Gaunt to run it's course, the combatants are not even active. They come back after 15 mins to run Delzoun Crypts regardless of who wins. The map is extremely large but there are very few things that are exciting.You have to convince a storm giant to join your cause by feeding him and giving him treasure. You build catapults by collecting wood and explosive balls. You fill up mine carts. You kill Duergar to get their items. They are mostly fetch quests with a time limit.12. Dead EnvironmentEverything is dead. The people function as lamp posts.13. Respeccing costs Astral DiamondsMy CW costs 78,000+ AD just to respecc Feats and Boons. This is a lot of in game currency.  On average, you can earn around than 5000 AD/hour."",0"

The important thing here is players can get right into the game and begin playing without friction.Neverwinter boasts one of the best combat systems in any MMORPG on the market today.  Itâ€™s not the bogged down tab-target â€œsit-and-watch, hit 1 2 3â€ that the genre grew up with, nor has the pendulum swung all the way toward the oft touted â€œaction-MMORPGâ€Every class in Neverwinter can solo quite easily, and because the combat is probably the gameâ€™s greatest strength, thereâ€™s no shortage of fun for those electing solitary confinement."",1"

This game is one of the most epick MMORPG's out there. It has a greate sistem and a lot of content.Me miself i like to play FPS's like TF2, Tribes: Ascend, CoD: BO2 and so on. Buth i take a brake and i get into this. A open world game, and really fun to play by yourself or with friends. When it was in beta it came out good, buth now it is just a complete sistem of playing for fun. No money nedded to be spended and if you will have a """"thing"""" for this game go check out the guy whos link to a dicusion i sended. He will teach youa nd show you a lot more than i will (no that guy is not me).So if you really like World of Warcraft and games like that, this is the best thing you will come by. I would play WoW, buth spending 5-10 euros a month just so i can become higher level than 20 its just too much. Now this game is rare also in this: Economy. It has a greate economy and it works like TF2 Tradeing. You can exchange your in game money (dimonds) for Zen (currency to buy with money).Owerall the only thing id sead that is wrong is that not a lot of people know this game. Belive me you will maybe not like it a first... Buth after some days (just to brake the ice) you will fall in love with it.Greate game if you are bored and if you are not bored. PvP, dungeon raids, and manny more is in it. Go now download it, put a like on this game and start playing."",1"

"10963,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I definitely recommend Neverwinter if you are a fan of D&D and MMOs. Pros:+ Combat - Easily one of the best features of this game. For me it was hard to play the traditional MMOs again as they suddenly felt slower paced. + Fast leveling - You can get to max level (70) fairly quickly as compared to other MMOs. Also, they recently reduced the post 70 """"overflow level XP"""" requirement from 1.875 million down to a mere 100K XP. This lets you build up the power points quicker.+ VIP sub - I list the subscription as a pro because you actually get a fair value for your money. In addition to 12 tiered VIP level benefits, you also get a daily lockbox key (one per account) and Epic Dungeon key (per character). You don't have to open the loot packs that you occasionally get from the lockboxes. You can actually sell them for a pretty good price for AD. There are ways to reduce the cost of a sub even further if you time Zen sales and use coupons.  + Easy LFG/Dungeon/Skirmish finder - It's very easy to hop right into group action whether you queue or just watch the LFG chat.+ Guilds (strongholds) - You can get some serious stat buffs in the form of boons from a high level guild. Find one.+ End game campaigns - Again, good stat buffs with multiple boons available per campaign.Cons:- Not open world - The areas are big and look great but it's a hub style MMO where you are HQ'd in Protector's Enclave and can fast travel to other areas.- Multiple in game currencies - You are starting to see this more and more and Neverwinter wasn't the first or last to do it. You have Gold, Astral Diamonds and Zen to juggle in game."",1"

I just do not understand how this game could crash my video driver, but whatever it is deleted now."",0"
"10966,Neverwinter,2015.0,""Stay away from this game, like from every other PWE games. Not only that it is D&D 4th Edition, which is already the reason to stay away from but it's also Perfect World Entertainment, the biggest crap game company out there."",0"
10967,Neverwinter,2015.0,Astonishingly bad graphics and repetitive unchallenging game play.  The pop ups and reward systems suggests it as being grind and shop centric.  The mechanics of play looked like DnD 4e as a computer game.  I much prefered Neverwinter Nights 2 and I'd rather return to that very dated game than endure any more of this.,0
"10968,Neverwinter,2015.0,""I really had high hopes for this game.  It isn't that it's a bad game.  The fact is that most Perfect World games are cash shop oriented.  I intend to go back and play the new expansion at some point, but this game drastically fails at endgame.  Many of it's counterparts suffer from the same issue.  It's 4th edition mechanics as they were meant to be enjoyed, digitally.  It's a solid game for the most part, but the business model, and endgame inbalance means I can't fully recommend it.   Unfortunately there aren't very many D&D games available.  I would say go play Sword Coast Legends though if you want a proper D&D experience in a game."",0"

I understand that this is how they make their money, and it is a well designed game so they do deserve to get paid, but the amount that it costs is ridiculous.  There are certain packs like the dragon born and hero of the north packs whose price translates into well over 100 dollars for a small amount of items that give you minimal help.  This is by far the most expensive free-to-play game that i have ever participated in, even more expensive than dungeons and dragons online unlimited."",0"

"10973,Neverwinter,2015.0,""This game used to be amazing I played most of my time on Xbox One and i still think its a brilliant game but my review is based on how it is now and not the fun ive had in the past.Effectivly all the content before you hit a platau is to get you hooked in the story is pretty unimaganitive its all about better loot as are all MMOs really. Once you cap you have weeklys and dungeons/the real campaign but to really get anywhere in this game its hugly pay to win. want a decent mount above 80% speed how about 10 pound minimum spend...how about a new decent companion? yep 10 pound minimum spend. Expansion for the game how about 40 pound and theres a few. I bought the Dragon expansion a mount a companion and a few other things and realised even then i was nowhere i end up spending 80 pound to hit another platau and before i could even get to where most of my clan where the game would have expected me to pay 200 - 500 pounds. The game is infact VERRYYY expencive and it tries to hook you in with the first buy then you think ohh i cant go back now just no its a game with no real replayability unless your willing to spend a fortune. You cant even make that much in game money that yes is transferable to real money to buy stuff but untill you have spent to much the more you spend the more you make.very very pay to play if you want a game you can keep playing without having to spend more and more money then id not recomend this game at all.as my old mate Admiral Ackbar said """"ITS A TRAP!""""

PVP on low levels is kinda balanced but then high levels its not , You are in pvp with 8k Power and the other guy is there with 27 k power :) thats like totally â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t . so PAY TO WIN GAME .

10977,Neverwinter,2016.0,After having played this game for almost a year I can't suggest it. The game is a good concept driven to the grown by bad marketing and unbalance. The basic of the game is you running around in glitchy maps and trying to do quests that may or may not exist anymore. After leveling up 68-69 levels you will experience an extreme grind to 70 which is the cap. End game content includes you running for almost a month in the same map doing the same 3 quests every week with little to no compention.If you're hoping PVP is better try again as it is highly unbalanced with Trickster Rogues which will Stun you into death and can go invisible taking the lead. The next pvp prefered class are Paladin which can restore their own HP so good luck dying to them. If you choose any other class besides those get ready as the Devs and everyone involved with this game love and exploit you for your money. oh and if you want to bot exploit or scam you can too! just add money every week and they wont even ban you for cheating they'll suppend you for a week tops. I know its a great system! In any words ready to be exploited and used because neverwinter is for you.,0
"10978,Neverwinter,2016.0,""Allow me to start this review by saying that the game in it's basic,free to play version is a decent one to say the least,with a pretty nice community and enjoyable gameplay.Why then am I not recommening this game?It is common knowledge that these types of games are leaning more and more towards P2W,but while other games might actually care about you if you spend money,not this one.Not if use your Steam Wallet to buy the products at any rate.I used my Steam Wallet to buy some currency called Zen,hoping to sell it in game for quick Astral Diamonds,which is basically the common currency.Not only was I not rewarded the First Time buyer's pack,which is reserved for people who buy directly from Arc,my account was put on Probation: meaning anything I buy is bound to my account and I am unable to sell Zen.You would think a day or two while they verify the payment would be understandable,but it has been a week and a half and I am still on probation.I thought fine,lets try something else,so I bought Enchanted Keys which let you open Lockboxes,hoping to find a decent item to sell in the Auction House.The keys were also bound but what they fail to mention is EVEN THE REWARDS IN THE LOCKBOXES WILL BE BOUND.So for example if you found a mount selling for around 6million Astral Diamonds which you do not like or already have you're stuck with it.I can almost hear people say """"Dum*a// of course the rewards will be bound,your key was also bound"""" but you are wrong,VIP players (and yes I am one) get an Enchanted Key everyday which is also bound,however the rewards opened with it are not.So to recap,I do recommend this game in the Free to Play mode,possibly get VIP,but do not bother using more money to be treated like a third grade citizen."",0"

That's 1 class every 6 months or so, such speed.I guess it's a great plan if they're wanting to keep this game going for 20 years, since that's how long it'll take them to cover the usual 12 base classes and each of their 3 or 4 archetypes."",0"

These packs should by no means be more than $10 for what you get in them. Zen is completely unjustifiable at its current price. Astral diamonds, which is the in game currency, can be built up over time, but once you do it is not unheard of for the system to glitch you out of it.

"10994,Neverwinter,2016.0,""Ignore the steam hours listed, I have well over 2 thousand hours into the game - I previously played via the Arc launcher before saying screw that and moving over to steam. With that being said, I do not recommend this game. On the surface it seems alright, especially if you have a group of friends to play with, but the game is...redundant at best.Pros Graphically, it's not bad. It scales well and works great on older systems while still not looking like a load ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Several classes for some flexibility with playstyle. Easy to follow, pre-defined questing. Something akin to """"crafting"""" which is fairly easy to do and progress. Frequent in-game events. Decent storyline, if you pay enough attention.Cons There hasn't been a new class released in literally years, and the devs fight over whether or not there will be a new one anytime soon (there probably won't be, don't get your hopes up). Pay to win. Despite claims from much of the game's population the game is pay to win and there's really no way around that. Certainly, you can grind for (two thousand) hours and maybe, possibly get through much of the campaigns - but as far as end-game content goes you will be required by groups to run """"best in slot"""" which requires SOMEONE (maybe not you, particularly) to pay real-life money for an item (bonding runestones) that can only be obtained from the cash store (zen marketplace). Not doing so means most, if not all, groups will refuse to run with you because you will be deemed """"not good enough"""" since you won't be able to break and trivialize the game otherwise. End-game lacks content and difficulty outside of PvP - and even that is lacking in truly engaging content. Sub-par voice acting. You'd think with how much they charge for things in the zen-market they could have gotten some half-way decent voice actors, but no. It's laughable at best, cringe-worthy at worst. You will literally spend all of your time doing the same thing over and over again for hours on end in an attempt to progress through campaigns - it will still take you about 2 months to do so unless you pay real-world money. Laughable crafting system. While it is certainly easy to do and progress through, it's not worth doing in the slightest since you won't use anything you get from it. It's also a joke, as far as crafting systems go. If you're not running the """"Best in Slot"""" (BiS) builds you will be shunned. Toxic, elitest, stuck-up, and otherwise snobby community. Frequent arguments relating to...pretty much anything and everything in zone chat. Bots. Lots and lots of bots. So much chat spam. No matter how many you report/ignore there never seems to be any less of them. Incredibly expensive for being a free-to-play.TL"
"10995,Neverwinter,2018.0,""Well I played NEVERWINTER for about a week and started to get into it and then the quest tracking system broke for me. I just can no longer track any quests which used to show me where to go to resolve my quests - or even START new ones. It gives me an error message saying """"cannot find path to the quest from current location"""" or something along those lines - on EVERY quest - no matter where I am. This world is far too large for me to just guess where to go - so it's effectively a game breaking bug for me. I've looked for solutions and found that many other people have the same problem but nothing they've tried (from uninstalling the entire game and re-downloading it again which took days for me) to just starting over with an all new character work for me.

"10999,Neverwinter,2014.0,""(This review deals exclusively with Neverwinter's Dungeon Creator and its community)I sunk dozens of hours (all before Neverwinter was on Steam) into the one redeeming quality of this game: the level editor. It's one of the best I've ever seen and writing, planning, and creating dungeons and quests is an awesome game in itself. I can't say enough in its praise. However, even this element of the game is ruined by the toxic community. Creators band together in level-making mafias to promote and upvote each others' dungeons (without letting on that they all in it together), and God forbid you ever give less than a 4/5 to one their quests--they will downvote your creations in retaliation.That this game's playerbase can take something wonderful like the dungeon creator and infuse with all the nastiness and spite of hardcore PvP left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I've never touched the game again."",0"

"11011,Neverwinter,2017.0,""""""Redeem your tokens here!""""I don't recommend this game to anyone who is seeking immersion, or challenges and adventure. This is more about collecting sets of things, and strutting around in bling. The story line, and fantasy theme are just window dressing for what is essentially little more than a themepark arcade, where you perform repetative go fetch quests to acquire various token currencies which can be redeemed for worthless bling. It's all just collectable trophies for owning, even though it's nothing special, really just stuff we all get, or you can just buy it with real money if you're stupid enough to fall for that.I suppose if you want a game which is all about collectables, then this is a fine example of such. There are, however, endless other titles, which are the exact same thing. Different window dressings, and things to see, but always the same basic premise, which amounts to little more than, """"pop a balloon with a broken dart, and you'll win a prize."""" In fact, the only thing I felt immersed in, is the arcade prize shop. The shop keepers don't have any immersive dialog, or personality. It feels like they're just static, and always standing at their station, waiting to take your money. As a matter of fact, there are NPCs in this game which say things like, """"You can redeem your blah blah tokens here!"""" (zero personality).You don't really need any of the fancy gear, because the game is easy enough. In fact, I got ahead of the game, level-wise, and I wasn't grinding, or anything. I felt like it's too easy. The only real problem I had was with positioning, so that I wouldn't agro adjacent mobs, and be overrun. Every time that I died, is because of the lame dodge mechanics. Mobs are way too condensed. Dodging gets you killed more often than it saves your life, in this game. Speaking of the mobs, I found myself asking, """"Why are they all just standing there, watching me kick their buddies butts, and not helping for? Are they blind?"""" This severely destroys immersion. Most dungeon raids suck, because one player is a lot higher level, and more experienced than the others, and will just rampage through it, and not allow you to fight or work on the puzzles. The quests are too simple, and repetative. I found myself feeling like every new zone I have to go talk to some irrelevant charactor just to be told that this area is overrun with some generic faction who I need to save everyone from. I couldn't help but wonder why nobody seemed to be lifting a finger to help out. Instead they send in me, just one guy, and expect me to be the hero, every single time. The factions don't even carry over into new zones. In one zone you're fighting all orcs, and in the next it's skeletons. It honestly feels just a little generic. It all feels setup, and irrelevant in the grand scheme of it all. The individual stories don't even matter. Its just a bunch of text you'll get bored with reading, and start asking, """"Just what are the objectives?"""".It doesnt feel epic in any way. It feels like a bunch of mind numbing tasks to waste some time on for some reward trinket you don't even need, because it's already too easy, your level is a lot higher than it needs to be. And sooooo much running back to the same old shop, where they sell the same old boring gear. Getting new quests from the same old charactors, who are always standing in the exact same spot, like they have nothing better to do. Of course, they don't need to, because they have you. So, they can just stand there letting you sponge up all the glory, while they stare at the backs of their eyelids. All this evil happening, and people asking for help with what is supposed to be an emergency, but you get to it whenever it's convenient.ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....I can't find any more good reason to continue wasting time on such a lame and boring game."",0"

"11020,Neverwinter,2016.0,""Neverwinter is ridiculously fun! I've logged quite a few hours in this game and the storyline is fun and engaging. I actually find the storyline while leveling up is quite enjoyable, when compared to other MMO games. The feel is very DND and the story captures several classic scenarios from table top gaming. Plus, who else doesn't love visiting some of your favorite Sword Coast locales?There is cash shop in the game that is a bit on the expensive side for some items, but they largely appear to be cosmetic and for bragging rights. Some items do give you a leg up on other players, but it's not so substantial that I would consider it to be pay-to-win. If you've got the cash and want to purchase some items, more power to you.As I said before, the storyline while leveling up is terrific. I've not really found another MMO that has the story be so fun and enjoyable. The graphics are beginning to show their age a bit, but this game is certainly on my list as one of the top MMOs available. Just be warned, the end game can get a bit grindy and lose flavor, but that's the case with most MMOs. All in all, this is a terrific little MMO with a fun PVP system and I would definitely recommend the game to anyone looking for a fun story and awesome race/class combinations."",1"
11021,Neverwinter,2017.0,The gameplay is addictive and quick. They have 13 races to choose from (4 of them need to be purchased from the store) and 8 classes to choose from. Decent customization for each race. There can be a lot for you to do in the game. Whether your a casual like me or hardcore player. From leveling to 70 while doing quest or instances and skirmishes. The game has a PvP function. Once you get to 70 you open up campaigns to do which are story driven quest that unlock Dailies and additional skills via Boons. Then you also have artifact weapons and other items you can level up and turn them from a green quality to a poweful Legendary. All of this can be done with out even spending a dime. Of course if you do spend money it can speed up the amount of time certain things are done. But it doesnt give you an advantage over anyone that doesnt spend any money. Ive been able to level characters to 60-70 across all platforms on console and PC and i only spent 20 dollars on 2 months of subscriptions. They are updating the game frequently and quickly.,1

"11024,Neverwinter,2018.0,""Like most free-to-play games, they shove the premium content in your face nonstop, and anything worthwhile is locked behind premium loot boxes.  If you can ignore all that, it's not a BAD game.  Would vote """"meh"""" if it were an option."",1"

"11026,Neverwinter,2018.0,""Has one of the most fun combat systems in an MMO I've ever played. Is constantly updated with seasonal mods that introduce new areas, items and quests, and has a very active population.I also really like their F2P model and it's very viable for one to play at a competitive level (in terms of gear and PvE at least) without paying real money, just by grinding dailies and seeling items in the AH.Overall, I find Neverwinter one of my favorite MMOs out there (even choosing to cancel my WoW subscription over this game)."",1"
"11027,Neverwinter,2016.0,""Definitely recommend giving it a try! The game is fun to play, with great controls compared to other MMOs. As a huge fan of the Dungeons and Dragons tabletop game, the game is even better!"",1"
"11028,Neverwinter,2016.0,""Free-to-play already gives complainers little to legitimately complain about. Level up relatively quick by accepting quest after quest and searching for quests or playing player-made quests when they stop getting blatantly forced upon you. Easy combat interface and locked down advancement trees make it hard to go awry. By the time you're level 15, you should be familiar with enough of the world's nuances to start to make your way with confidence. There is a lot to learn. Most frustrating is the learning curve concerning in-game monetary systems and earning methods. It's hard to figure out how to get money for many items you want, and several aspects of the game (including certain monies) are time-gated. You can speed up the process by paying for various services. My biggest complaint, however, would be loss of The Foundry (the in-game level design kit for players) as an active level design kit (and the primary award for reaching level 15). Thankfuly...user made content has returned as playable."",1"
"11029,Neverwinter,2017.0,""The game has many amazing aspects. I enjoy the many events and quest that are continously happening, joining guilds and having a guild hq is not seen often.

"11031,Neverwinter,2017.0,""I've tried a few different MMOs, and normally I burn out of them pretty fast (tab targetting etc is not very engaging). With Neverwinter I find the gameplay fun enough that I have managed to level up to 64 quite pleasantly. I am a big fan of Dungeons and Dragons, so it is a lot of fun to see monsters and locations from the famous Forgotten Realms setting. The zones are mostly pretty cool to romp around in and I find the combat fun, which is good because almost all quests are of the kill X monsters type. I have set myself up with a controller by using a key mapping software called AntiMicro, which is working really well and lets me chill out and play it with controller, which it is designed for in any case. 64 levels in and I've not spent a penny, which is pretty good!"",1"
"11032,Neverwinter,2015.0,""This game is fun. You can choose a race, class, history, etc. Yes, there is a in-game currency that costs real money and maybe considered """"Pay To Win"""", but A) They need money to run the game, update it, etc. And B) If you like the game, why not support it? You can have a pet. You can create a map (Once you reach a high enough level.) Overall, this game is worth it."",1"
"11033,Neverwinter,2014.0,""People class this game as """"Pay to win"""", I just don't understand how you can think that. Every item which can be obtained via methods of real currency can also be obtained in the game. Some people think that the PVP is just a battle of """"who has spent the most money on their gear"""" and yeah, that's how most games work guys. With your three encounters, two dailys and passives, everyone is very equally matched and the only thing which makes one player stronger from another is the gear. Yes, skill and teamwork do take a part but at the end of the day. Work hard, earn gear, rule Neverwinter, or, Spend real money, buy gear, rule Neverwinter.Either way, this game is a incredible freebie and is well worth a play!"",1"
"11034,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Literally one of the best MMORPG's I have played. Period. The fact that it is F2P is a bit of a blessing and a curse.

The game is very fun to play, not to hard and the most important and good thing about this game. It's free2play. Donating money in the game doesn't let you get better stuff, or stuff you can't get without it. It's just faster getting your stuff without waiting.

11038,Neverwinter,2017.0,I use to play this game alot but i got sick of the chests dropping from literally ever enemy trying to make me by stuff Filling up my inventory...Plus when i was playing a few years back you didnt have good armor if you didnt buy from the auction house which that costs coins/Diamonds or whatever they were called  it was a long process to getting them but in the end you can get them another way but The easiest is to use actual money all the steps would just make you go to real life money or harder options..I liked the graphics but the gameplay was repetitive((Sorry if i got some things wrong)),0
11039,Neverwinter,2014.0,Neverwinter is an amazing MMORPG. I haveplayed this game for a long time now andloved every min of it. Don't judge the game because other people take theeasy option and simply buy everythingwith there real life money! The game canbe fun and exciting if you allow it to be.Neverwinter - 7/10,1
11040,Neverwinter,2015.0,Really fun the first time through...buuuuuuut if you decide to make another character and go through with a different class the game gets really long and boring.It can get really expensive at times too since getting a good mount (110% move speed) can cost like $30-$40. Can also be very repetetive and grindy at times since most of the missions are the kill X amount of these things type of missions.  Pvp can be a completeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥show since most of the time you will go against people with like 3 billion gear score and they will fuuuuuuuckkkkkk you up.Those are all the big cons of the game and im to lazy to list the pros so yeahhhh......Its really up to you if you want to get this game or not but if those cons make u wanna kill yourself then you probably shouldnt get this game.,0

11042,Neverwinter,2014.0,With the addition of the Scourge Warlock recently I decided to give this game another try.  And HO BOY do I enjoy it.  Let me just say this.I hit level 30.  I CAN NOW HUNT DRAGONS.  YES.,1
"11043,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Despite reading mixed reviews I decided to try this game out for myself. I'm pleased to say that I'm really enjoying playing it, the graphics and maps are great"
"11044,Neverwinter,2014.0,""So far one of the best MMORPG's i've played, the fighting style makes up for all the grinding in the game. It's very intuitive,  even though some quests might seem a bit repetitive and as i've heard the PVP is pay to win, but if you're looking for a good story to play through with friends this game is amazing."",1"
"11045,Neverwinter,2013.0,""As someone who has played other D&D games before, but has not played the pen & paper game, Neverwinter felt very accessible. It has the most enjoyable combat out of any MMOs that I have played to date.As a free-to-play game, it has a real money (referred to as Zen) cash shop. While all of the items in the cash shop seem expensive, I never felt like I was required to purchase any of them to enjoy the content that everyone else was playing. As you play, you can earn the in-game currency, Astral Diamonds, and exchange it with other players for the Zen that they have purchased. Depending on what you are looking to purchase, the length of the grind required varies dramatically.As for content, the Foundry and its """"infinite content"""" is a nice distraction from the developer made quest line. Some of the quests that players have created are absolutely ridiculous, both in personality and in quality.I highly recommend giving Neverwinter a shot and forming your own decision. It doesn't take that long to reach the level cap, and it's free - what do you have to lose?"",1"
"11046,Neverwinter,2016.0,""I would like to say this MMO is great.  It has a wonderful system that is in place which is the ability to create your own maps for the game if you're tired of the content that has been created.  Many people feel it is a """"Pay 2 Win"""" game.  It isn't unless you make it that way.  That's the real situation.  Overall though, there is nothing that you can't do in the game to play it and get to the same level as everyone else.  The situation is how much you want to devote to the game to get to whatever progress you as a player wants. However as a """"Free to Play"""" game, there is a lot of free content that a person can go into and I recommend to eventually get into a guild or make sure you do all the required high level content to get some of the better gear.  I know recently there were some network issues but I believe it has smoothed itself out some and has become playable again.  I recommend this game to the hardcore or even the casual player because the quests are instance based but very quick at times.  It's only the raids that are a little longer and more involved.  Also, make sure to do your dailies but everything is solid for that MMO and recommend it to anyone."",1"
11047,Neverwinter,2016.0,I've just recently came back to Neverwinter because I was missing a MMORPG with good story and questing.  There is alot to love about this game.  The fighting mechanics are fun.  The graphics are not bad.  All the quests are voice acted.  So many mounts and companions to get.  So many races to choose from and Classes to play.  The leveling is fast.  There are dungeons to run.  There is someting going on every weekend.  You don't have to pay money to play and get items if you can't.  Most cash shop items end up in the auction house.  If you have the time and no money you can still get good mounts and companions.  There is so much to do in this game I felt overwhelmed when I started playing again.   I recommend joining a Guild using the Guild finder menue.  Now I have other players to help me when I have questions.   The guild Stronghold is great.  Your guild gets it's own instanced Keep and town with mobs to fight.  Everyone is leveled up to 70 in the SH so you can join in the events even if you are a lower level.  Random events happen in the SH area all the time.  If you are a small guild you can Alliance with bigger guilds and go to their SH and partisipate in the events with them.  Give this game a try.  It's Free to Play so why not.,1
"11048,Neverwinter,2015.0,""Honestly, I see all these bad reviews and I can't help but look back on my days playing NW before it hit steam, was VERY fun. until the devs saw a chance to make cash off players, then I quit, it used to be fun. PathOfExile mixed with wow, was very nice graphics. and super fun dungeon gameplay, but I cant blame devs, theyneed to keep the reputation of F2P MMO's alive. -Money grabbing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"",0"

"11050,Neverwinter,2015.0,""I wish I could leave a proper review but I can't... why? Because after 4 days of reinstalling and redownloading and doing what the support team tells people I CAN NOT get past the opening cutscene! I meet all the system requirements but when I go to skip the opening cutscene to get to character creation the program stops responding. I CAN NOT fix this, and PWE/CRYPTIC has no info about this specifically. DO NOT BOTHER with the PC version as it most likely will not work AT ALL!"",0"
"11051,Neverwinter,2015.0,""Just another voice to the choir.  Almost every negative review here on steam is spot on.   If you are playing for the first time, leveling a character 1 through 60 you will most likely love this game and I would recomend it.   It's has great combat that is responsive and fluid.  The quests are interesting and fun (for a first time play through).It's a wonderful experience until you reach the end game.   This is where the fun stops.   The end game is nothing more than a grind fest where you run the same quest over and over and over and over and over and over and over(keep repeating 1000's more times) again. Some of these end game campaigns are so terrible that you can actually buy tokens in the Zen store that lets you skip them. Yes for a mire $50.00 each(yes $50.00 'each') you can skip the 'dead ring' and 'sharandar' campaigns.  Think about it, people are actually willing to pay them money 'not to play' their game.  That is just insane.  Keep in mind that it is only for one character too.   Those tokens are not an account wide option. So if you spend any money for extra character slots to try out the other classes, you're stuck with doing those grind fest campaigns unless you pay for the tokens again.  It almost seems like a cruel joke.On top of that the refinement system is not casual player friendly.  If you are someone that only has time to play maybe 2 to 4 hours a week, there is no humanly possible way to collect enough refinement points to max level an item unless you are willing to spend money.  I would not complain about this if it was only a handful of enchantments you can place on weapons and armor.   But now you have dozens of new artifacts including artifact weapons and equipment.  All needing refinement to level up.  If you played 4 hours a day for six months straight you might be able to max level '1' of these items. yes '1' out of some 15-20 you can equip on your character at one time, which doesn't even include the ones you might keep in inventory to switch around depending on what tasks you are doing.  That is just for the refinement points and doesn't include the Reagents needed for the upgrade.   It's absolutely crazy.  There is no way a casual player is going to do this without spending houndreds of dollars to upgrade them.The other thing to be aware of is rebalancing changes.  Neverwinter has been adding new classes and content that has required the game to be rebalanced with every major update.   I understand that this is needed for better game play.  However as I mentioned above items that require refinement to upgrade is a very costly whether you spend the time or the money to do it.  When they rebalance the game what you may discover is that an item you are working on may no longer be worth the effort.  For example Mod 6 is going to change how regeneration and life steal works.  Anyone who has invested the time and or money to upgrade items that buff these stats might not have choosen to do so. That can be literally months of work for some people who used their time to upgrade those items or hundreds of dollars for others who paid to upgrade.SO if you're a new player starting out leveling a character 1 though 60 savior the moment.  It's doesn't last for the end game.   Once you get to the end game I would recommend you move on to something else."",0"

"11055,Neverwinter,2015.0,""I tried to like this game, don't call me out on my playtime, because I was playing before it came to steam. But since i've come back after a while there are many frustrating problems and ridiculous developer desicions. Firstly, the launcher is complete and utter garbage, most of the time I find myself waiting for 2-3 hours to get in because the loading screen freezes and eventually crashes, then tells me I should verify the files which takes about 10-20 minutes. Then after verifying the files, IT DOES THE SAME EXACT THING RINSE AND REPEAT. It is very frustrating. When I actually get into the game, the begging levels are actually quite fun and the combat is nice, but when you get to the higher levels you are blocked by an immense amount of grinding and paywalls. the events are garbage, PVP is a pay to win, and PVE is like queueing into a pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ who have alot of money and paid for everything, who don't know what to do.

"11056,Neverwinter,2015.0,""While writting this review i've over 1000+ hours played, several characters with max lvl and finished all end game content.The good:- pretty good and enjoyable combat system (pretty much the reason i still play it)- decent graphics- option for free 2 play players to get almost everything from the real cash shop (though it's hard and time consuming)- decent events and promotions once in a while (includes pvp events)- hourly activity event system (this is one of the best things which can happen to MMO, it pretty much helps to reduce queue times and give some bonus rewards to the players)The Bad:- This game had few heavy curreny exploits which totaly ruined the econmy. Lot's of the exploited currency was not removed and impact this game to this day. Many exploiters were not banned and run in Best in Slot items without any penalty.- Real money means very little (unless you can spend several thousand of $ on a game). Basically if you would want to get full BIS gear you'd need like ~2k of real $.- Bugs take months to get fixed (if they even bother to fix them in the first place)- Lot's of Overpowered items which come from Lockboxes. (sadly this game is not living on cosmetics stuff like Dota 2)- Several end game instances is often nearly unplayable due to server lags.- Very poor Class Balance- Extremely poor PvP balance (for example, you can move your Best in slot enchant from your high lvl character to a totaly low lvl character and use it in pvp because it have no min. lvl required) - I think i dont have to explain how much impact it have. Even at max lvl pvp there's insane gear gap between players.- Refiling system - pretty much pay to win feature. It makes all your gear useless so you have to spend lot's of real $ to get nearly BIS or BIS gear or pray to get lucky with some extremely rare drops.- This game does very little to reduce the gap between old and new players.

"11062,Neverwinter,2015.0,""Neverwinter is a very exciting, action packed MMO based off of the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. You DON'T need to be a D&D pro to play however, that just helps you understand the lore and basics of each class. It is free-to-play, but not pay-to-win. Yes, spending cash does help you advance faster, but anything and everything can be earned in the game without spending real-world dollars. The community is friendly in general, but it does have it's share of butt-holes like every online community. Recent changes to the game have been a major improvement, as some campaings/modules *cough cough* Tyranny of Dragons *cough* had extremely hard to obtain boons and gear, and the economy was trashed and ruled by botters. The devs have made huge strides in cutting out botters, and while not 100% clean, they took a hard hit. They prices the botters/scammers offer for their services now are really high, and there aren't nearly as much as their used to be in the zone chat. I highly recommend making friends, some of my best friends are from chance encounters in Neverwinter. It has it's flaws, especially the grind to reach level 70, the games current level cap. I suggest waiting for the fairly frequent Double Experience weekends/events to level a toon. My name in-game is GravitySage, and I am happy to help any new players. Welcome to Neverwinter!!!"",1"

The constant reminder to buy in game purchases utterly destroyed any fun you were about to have with your friends too.

But I honestly can't recommend this game to anyone. Take my actual game time, remove about 30 hours and that's how much I actually played because the launcher is utter cancer. Second the game is horribly optimized, I have to play something that looks pretty much like morrowwind style graphics yet it still has almost no frame and my pc is really not that bad because I play games that look tons better but run tons better too. You can't really do all that much without spending either totally insane ammounts of time playing or spending money. You are limited to 2 characters unless you buy more slots or spend hours upon hours to get enough stuff to sell and then convert the diamonds into zen etc etc bla bla... I really gave this game my everything and no matter how much I wanted to love this game I just couldn't because there were way too many issues. Gameplay is awesome and so is the story and overall lore and I honestly love these but like I said just way too many issues for me to recommend this game to anyone. If you've got a beast of a pc with way too much time and/or money on your hands, pick the game up and enjoy otherwise goodluck actually playing."",0"

I'll give a few examples:+There are free mounts in the game which can be bought with in game gold-These are very plain and basic mounts -The best mounts in the game cost 2500 -3500 ZEN this translates to Â£25...... Â£25 !!!! for a horse skin and faster movement speed which i can buy a whole game for+You can earn astral diamonds (can be converted ZEN) 6 times a day so there is a way to earn the items- we'll say you might make 20000 astral diamonds in a day which i personally wasn't anywhere near doing but 1 ZEN = 380 AD so to buy that horse 3500ZEN you're going to need 1,330,000 astral diamonds which is 66 days of play. Which is stupid.....-downloadable content is ridiculously expensive considering its just items, gear and mounts.-high level items all require astral diamonds or zen-the ingame money is pretty much useless and can only buy health potions and kits-to unlock the treasure chest at the end of that dungeon you just did (not regular quests) requries you to buy a key with astral diamonds-game is too simple, you get 3 abillities, 2 passives, 2 big abillities and a class specific sort of """"mode"""". These can eb swapped out with other skills that you unlock but heck give me some variety-game was never really that challenging, I'm sure it gets more difficult but I got to level 43 with very little difficulty+game looks alright for a mmorpg, very few look amazing-game is very poorly optimized, i'm running a titan x, 32GB of ram, 6 core with hyper threading and  all over clocked on a 4k screen.witcher 3 which is an absolutely stunning game graphically and rubs this game in the dirt always had 40+ fpsIn some areas this game makes me hit 20 fps which is abysmal-quests are quite repetitiveI guess I'll get to some positives then now+areas and mobs are diverse+boss fights are pretty cool+good to just pass some time if you've got nothing to play+game has a lot to do by the looks of it and if you've got hundred of pounds to waste then heck go ahead+very clear dungeons and dragons elements+though you can't use the majority of your abillities there's quite a lot to choose fromIf the developers want to improve this game make your zen exchanges rates better with real world currencymake the regular currency able to buy more things, literally everything should be pourchasable with coppers even if you have to balance it by making it quite a lotToo many sub currencies in the games e.g. seals, astral diamonds, zen, coppers......Things like loot shouldn't come at a cost to just open"",0"

There's an auction house, there's dungeons and you can upgrade your gear and give your companions upgrades too. There are events that offer extra bonuses and something to do besides quests, dungeons and pvp areas.There are new expansions and new race or even new class options, currently there is a new expansion coming soon. There is a new class that will be coming soon. Not sure if there's room for another race at the moment, but one never knows.Customizing a character avatar is really nice and there's even an area under History where you can enter a bio about the character. There's a bank and email system, mounts and there's even player created dungeons/instances that you can play. After a certain level, you can even try a go at making your own.This game offers a lot of ways to play and things to do. I think it's well worth it for a free 2 play game.

"11092,Neverwinter,2015.0,""I love the game, I really do, and I played it years before I ever switched to using it on Steam (and that was only about a month ago, despite the large number of hours listed).However.. I can't recommend it anymore.Why?  They've gone out of their way to destroy the game, especially of late.  They seem to be actively working to drive away the players, and in the last month alone it's worked spectacularly.  In January they had something like 15,000 players through Steam, now they have something like 3,500...Ignoring the stuff everyone else is complaining about (though justified) like the lag and disconnects, they've recently destroyed a player's ability to earn Astral Diamonds (the primary currency in the game) ..yet did nothing to adjust the prices of everything that requires them, making the only way to get enough of them to even get by, is to pay cash.. and with the rate the players are fleeing the game you get less and less Diamonds for the same amount of money, given it's a player based exchange similar to what GW2 has.  Without an adequate supply of Astral Diamonds there is basically no character progression at high levels. I wish I could keep playing, but not being able to get and stay connected to the game for days at a time with lag that will guarantee many dungeon wipes in a row, even with the best of players, it's just too frustrating.  Even with all the extra character slots I bought to try to have extra characters with which to farm diamonds just to try and have enough diamonds to support one character, it does me no good when the lag makes the game virtually unplayable.Truly disappointing to see such a great game be destroyed while the Devs turn a blind eye, stick their fingers in their ears, and keep screaming """"I can't hear you, the game is perfect, I can't hear you, we've never made a bad decision ever""""...  :("",0"

I stayed away from the game for a while because of this but after starting over several times I realized I was this kits to open things where easily purchased in game, follwing the main quest results in aquiring inventory bags, and hey.. sprinkle a few real dollars and I bought another inventory bag that has me quite happy.

Then you've come to the right place, young Jedi.This game holds a great community that (surprisingly) passes as the best community experience I've seen in the last few years. Even though this game is free, for some reason, it doesn't attract 12 year olds such as some other games do.. (cough)Of course, it is not a perfect masterpiece when it comes to PvP and inventory management, but come on, it's a free game that you'd probably still pay a considerable amount of money if it were priced.Everything in the game is obtainable by farming and spending time, there is no - Pay 2 Win - associated with this game. Of course, there is - Pay 2 Advance Faster -, but it's totally up to you if you like the game, therefore you decide if you'd like to support the developers or not, with a little buck.I rate this game 8/10, because it could have been better. Though, I believe that it's engine doesn't allow it...     And it's a little repetitive once you've got the basis of it.Do not hesitate on playing this game! It is definitely worth a try.

"11114,Neverwinter,2014.0,""This game came into my attention sometime ago. Me, having spent my chilhood playing Neverwinter Nights, was one of the many, many people who gave this a try, out of pure nostalgia.I ran into problems at the level of downloading the game, though. Steam only allows you to download the launcher, which then proceeds to leech the 5GB of this game from the developer's site. Which takes five hours. I wouldn't complain much about it if this game wasn't on Steam anyway. Why can't you just download the whole game from Steam, especially considering it's far superior it terms of download speed (Team Fortress 2, 12GB, downloaded in maybe over an hour)? This question still bugs me even now.First things first: this is (supposed to be) based on the 4th edition of D&D. I am not a specialist on this topic, but it seems to be very, very different from older editions - definitely more so than the 3rd edition differences from 2nd. Apparently, somewhere along the way, Clerics lost the ability to carry heavy armor and use shields and even normal weapons - instead, they run around with magical symbols which they basically just hold up and channel divine power or something like that on top of not being able to actually heal stuff directly (their first heals are drain and regen-based), sword-and-shield and two-handed-weapon Warriors were differentiated, Rogues learned to Flash Step, and Wizards taught themselves how to cast spells while wearing armor. This is as utterly unfamiliar to anyone used to NWN and 3rd edition as it sounds.In the race department, we get basically what we would expect from a typical D&D game: humans, elves, halfelves, dwarves, halflings, and halforcs, with tieflings as an added bonus. Also, the game differentiates three different """"subraces"""" of elves (sun elves, wood elves and drows). Nothing out of ordinary here, to be honest. However, it disappoints us when we get to the available classes: we get only Cleric, Wizard, Rogue, Ranger and two types of Warrior (offensive and defensive varieties). Even the 2nd edition had more options, such as Paladins or Druids.In terms of gameplay, other than your typical Feats, we get three different types of powers: At-Will, Encounter and Daily. At-Will is basically your standard """"swing sword to deal damage"""" or """"shoot magical bullets to deal damage"""" things that can be spammed over and over. Your basic attacks, putting it simply. Encounter powers have cooldowns and are more powerful than At-Will. Finally, Dailies - no no no, it's not a viariation on FF11's Two-Hours. It's more akin to Weaponskills: you hit stuff, a gauge charges up, when it's full you unleash a ridiculously powerful attack at the cost of the whole gauge. How do you fill it? Either by dealing damage or doing class-specific actions (such as healing for Clerics). It's nothing really special, but it works and fighting stuff is fun. The game frequently throws dungeons your way, too, which usually end in boss fights, and are definitely a breath of fresh air - instead of beating up stuff on the surface, you beat up stuff underground. Powerful attacks from bosses are highlighted in red on the ground before they hit - pressing a direction twice causes you to slide and dodge any attacks. This makes it slightly more action-RPG-oriented than other games like that. Slightly. Speaking of the bosses, the fights can be pretty much summarized with """"hit the boss a lot of times, watch as it summons more minions and either deal with them or ignore them, dodge the occasional powerful highlighted-and-telegraphed attack, heal if you must, hit them some more"""". It just lacks the technicality and complexity of a D&D game.In terms of storyline, well... our character, besides more-or-less stupid questions, doesn't really get any development. I know this is a MMO, but come on, it's named after one of the best cRPG series and systems ever made. You'd expect something more than an evil old woman who has Evil Overlord List violations up the ante as a main villain.This game is also, well, allegedly free. You can play just fine, but other than the standard """"box that has to be opened by a key bought with real money"""" shticks, you also have to shell out if you want to get the strongest equipment and enchantments on it. A lot of games today take this approach, being seemingly F2P but filled with occassions where you can shell out to upgrade. For example, you can't create more than two characters without buying additional slots. Two characters. Even by character slot limitation standards, this is just absurd.The last, and most important thing to mention: this game takes place 100 years after Neverwinter Nights. Somewhere along that time span, there was a Spellplague that basically caused the whole Neverwinter to be torn down and rebuilt from scratch, much like Warsaw after the 2nd World War. I repeat: the Neverwinter we all know and love is dead. Instead of a great story-driven cRPG with good fights and character development, we get yet another more-or-less generic MMO, which doesn't really do much to its originality besides carrying the names of Neverwinter and D&D.I don't recommend this to neither D&D fans, nor Neverwinter Nights fans. Both of those kinds of players are going to be utterly disappointed in this. That isn't to say this game isn't playable, or fun, for that matter. I would probably look at it from a different perspective if it wasn't named after NWN or anything related to D&D."",0"
"11115,Neverwinter,2014.0,""So far from what I've played, this game is very similar to Diablo 3.  It makes playing an MMO much simpler, without having to worry about what skills work best since its all pretty streamlined.  You want to tank? Pick fighter/guardian and focus on the skills  that pull aggro and increase your defence."",1"

They going to release stronghold soon, wich is a 4th domination match map. PvP is only domination. Only good point of this game, gameplay.Ain't worth it anymore. They don't fix bug there's only 6 dungeon in end game. Only 3 pvp map atm 4 with stronghold. Bug abuser, gold farmer/spammer in the chat. Gear based game(I wouldn't mind it if it was less pay to win). And perfect world is the worst company when it come to managing a mmo.

"11118,Neverwinter,2018.0,""The main gameplay is cool, but all the social and market features are locked off until you complete what appears to be a lengthy quest chain, which occurs after an already lengthy quest chain to introduce the game.The game also heavily incentivises buying lootboxes by flashing notifications every time someone opens one and gets a certain item. Since there are so many players and some people seem to have infinite money, this happens constantly, and there's no way to turn it off."",0"
"11119,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Nothing like D&D in gameplay.  Graphics are sort of OK, but only because everything stays so zoomed out you can't see the lack of detail.  Gameplay is a boring grind-fest just like every other pay-to-win """"free"""" Korean MMO.If you want something that plays like D&D, do Turbine's DDO.  The graphics are a bit dated, but gameplay is truer to D&D."",0"
11120,Neverwinter,2013.0,I'm going to preface this by saying I've only played 3 MMO's including this one and none for more than 6 hours. I really wanted to like this as a huge forgotten realms/D&D fan but the combat is truly dreadful and there's not enough detail from the onset to make me want to go further. From a more technical aspect the graphics are mediocre but then they were obviosly set up to accomodate low end machines. The audio is below par and the controls though not terrible couldbe mich better especially where the camera comes in to play.,0
"11121,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Great MMO RPG for anyone that enjoys a """"free roam"""" type of game. Remids me of my favorite anime, Sword art Online. Please consider downloading this game, and its FREE! Don't listen to all te haters saying bad things about Never WInter, this game is juts amazing."",1"
"11122,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Disclaimer: Iâ€™m only doing PVE content, so if youâ€™re in it for the PVP this review will not help you much.It seems the main point of concern for most people is if this is a â€œpay to winâ€ MMO?  Technically it is not and as most reviewers have pointed out, you can go to max level without spending a dime, though it will take you longer without the XP boost and a faster mount.  But if you donâ€™t feel the need to rush to the end you will get at 80+ hours of free RPG MMO play time.  At max level spending money becomes a real option especially if you want to be more competitive in PVP or do tougher dungeons and donâ€™t want to spend all your time grinding out Astral Diamonds.The Good:1)The Neverwinter Gateway web site and cell phone APP is a cool feature.  Often when Iâ€™m away from my computer I will open the app on my phone and assign a task to one or more of my professional assets or play a round of Sword Coast Adventures dice game to level companions.2)Graphics are decent.3)Even though you have tons of powers you are limited on how many you can have on your hotkeys which cuts down on the number of buttons you have to press in a battle.  Yes I think this is a good thing, or at least it is for me.4)The quest tracking. I like the â€œsparkleâ€ trail on the ground that leads you to your quest area and back, but it can be turned off if you hate it.5)Nearly 100% voiced dialogs, including quest.6)This may not be for everyone but I like the private instanced mini dungeons you get from quest, of course you can also join up with a friend and complete them together if you wanted.7)User created content, this can be a crap shoot but there is some damn fun ones out there.The Not so Good:1)Not an open world MMO.  I know this is not a big deal but I just keep feeling like Iâ€™m missing something and I hate run into invisible walls in outdoor zones.2)No way to open the Tyrannical Lockboxchest you pick up everywhere without spending real money to buy keys.  There is nothing in them that is required to play the game and if you have enough Astral Diamonds you can often find the items from the chest in the auction house.3)Too many types of currency in the game!  Money (normal game currency), ZEN, Glory, Companion Upgrade Tokens, Astral Diamonds, Ardent Coin, Celestial Coin, and Black Ice.  That doesnâ€™t count the other 20+ types of currency you get from quest areas, seasonal events and some chest.  I know they are doing this to make the game more detailed but I find it a pain to keep track of them all and find myself going back to old quest areas to see what I can buy with them.  At less they donâ€™t take up bag space!4)Can be very hard to resist speeding money, for me it is mainly to gamble on those Lockboxchest, â€œcome on, baby needs a new pair of shoes, damn snake eyes.â€5)Limited bag space at lower levels.  I run out of space on almost every quest but I donâ€™t have a full set of the biggest bags as they cost either 1,000 Zen (~$10) or 300K+ Astral Diamonds which takes a lot of time to gather.So in the end my PERSONAL OPINION is that it is a decent MMO and can be fun to play.  But will I play it for hundreds of hours? I doubt it.  Iâ€™m guessing I will finish to level 60 on my main toon and possibly test another class out but not a full level up, then move on to another game.  There are way too many FTP MMOâ€™s out there to get stuck in one.For full disclosure:  I have spent some real money in the game to get a bigger bag and a faster mount.  But I feel Iâ€™m getting my moneyâ€™s worth and Iâ€™m supporting the company as someone has to pay the developers and keep the lights on. "",1"

"11125,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Note: This is being written just weeks after the Mod 5 launch. A lot can change in a few months so the relevance of some of the below information may be questionable in the months to come.I'm not quite certain where to begin with this.. All of this is based on my current experience with the game which I don't feel is really enough time to review it but I am moving on so I figured I could give some answers to questions I had going in.The game is an enjoyable experience and personally a perfect game for me. I love the combat, graphics, classes, etc. While there are a few minor gripes I would consider Neverwinter an positive experience whether you've spent a lot of time in MMOs or not, though like any other title it has it's flaws. If you're going to go in with a strictly F2P route in mind then the grind will be long and tedious after a while. The game lacks end game content, but the Devs are taking big strides in the right direction. PvP - Currently PvP is a super hit or miss thing with the community. P2W players can hit outrageous highs with no real need for a grind aside from a fat bank account. This isn't a big issue however because a typical player can grind out enough to at least nip the ankles of these PvP P2W titans in a weeks worth of grinding.PvE - Dungeons exist, but the time it takes to run with a good player is pretty small. Most dungeons can be solo'd so adding in four other players to one who is able to solo can make a dungeon run a fifteen minute task. There are a few tougher dungeons but you'll often find some powerhouse group in the LFG chat to run you through.There are a few other PvE events that are currently running in the game (post Mod 5) that have added a lot more content to end game PvE. These are small open world events where you (and up to 19 other people) fight an extremely """"challenging"""" horde/boss and get rewards based on your performance, these can also be solo'd once you've gotten enough power under your belt. These are by far the best PvE experience currently in my opinion. The biggest thing to look out for in this game is the horrid zen market. You can easily sink money into this game and not know how much is flowing from your wallet until it's too late. At this point in time I have spent over $1000 between my wife and I on this game with nothing in game to really show for it, which is a big part of why I'm moving on from it.All in all the game is a really heavy grind, especially to get to top tier, but it is possible to become max geared without paying a cent. This is not a pay to win game, to misquote another player, this is a """"pay for convenience"""" game. If you want to reach the top tier of your respected front you can either sit back and enjoy the daily grind for hundreds of hours or pay thousands of dollars to get there. The choice is yours and no one will ever have anything that gives them an advantage over you that you're unable to get by taking the opposite route.Hope this helps at least one person to better understand what they will be getting into here. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope you are able to enjoy Neverwinter for what it really is."",1"

"11133,Neverwinter,2015.0,""An MMO with a great active combat system, lengthy  and robust progression, rich lore from the grandaddy of RPGs itself! Sounds good right? Well yes, this game is a very enjoyable game no doubt but as you may have noticed my review of it is not positive.So where does it go wrong? Honestly most of it can be traced to the development staff on a whole, now being an MMO errors and problems will surely show up from time to time, I mean they're called massively multiplayer for a reason but what one shouldn't expect is downright laziness when it comes to attending to said problems. Examples of this would be various game breaking bugs that allowed users to exploit various aspects of the game to give themselves a huge advantage which would include multiple different ways to one-hit-kill endgame bosses, attack through or lead enemies through what are supposed to be blocked off barriers (which allows them not to be hurt) or simply bypassing dungeon bosses that are mandatory to name a few.Along side the numerous comabt exploits are those have allowed players to  gain vast amounts of items or currency that should be limited. The exploits are usually around for weeks until they are looked in to, some are still present. Next are bots which is not an alien topic when it comes to MMOs but the path that these developers take with them is, which in short is to neuter the ways that legitimate players use to advance their characters into the ground but at the same time increasing the amount required to do so.Last but not least is the F2P model that they use which before module 6 I didn't really have a huge problem with, whilst I did spend more than enough money on this game pre-module 6 it was more of a luxury than a necessity. Now with what I have previously mentioned about cutting back the rate at which players can advance their characters and module 6 upping the resources required to do so exponentially means that the statement Pay to Win feels like it has made it's way here.   When all is said and done I did really enjoy most of my time with this game but would not honestly recommend it to anyone looking to start a new MMO as in it's current state it would either take an insurmountable amount of time to catch up with current players or a large potion of money. Instead what I would recommend if you have tried and liked what you have seen is if you have an Xbox One is to try it there instead as the development team actually seems to be active and willing to help the game and it's community whereas the PC staff seem to barely listen to their playerbase on the whole."",0"

11135,Neverwinter,2015.0,Neverwinter is one of the very few MMOs that I am actually willing to play. Not being a big fan of the genre but being a big fan of D&D I quite enjoy the game.

The game is perfectly playable without the in-game purchases.,1

11137,Neverwinter,2015.0,I really liked the game.

"11139,Neverwinter,2015.0,""I guess I should review this game after 500+ hours. This is my first MMORPG I've ever played so I won't be comparing it at all.I've dropped out of this game a few times and would go without questing or advancing in the story line because of repetition. All dungeons and maps seem similar on arrival: Someone wants you to kill ## of a certain enemy, someone wants you to grab/drop off ## items, enemies are grouped together and charge at you as soon as you're in range. This has been my biggest and maybe only complaint.The story line is vast and can emerse or bore players. I've enjoyed fantasy novels and films, so this was my interactive form of one. The stories of Neverwinter continue to build, so as the developers release modules, there'll be quests and campaigns to engage in. Within the stories there is both humour and seriousness, which I appreciated. The campaigns have brought me back into the game often.The environments are diverse and beautiful. There is a lot of work put into the development of maps. Although not open world, they're still big and wonderful to walkthrough.Level building is easy and is now capped at 70, which was a good move to keep players sticking around later. I was dissapointed I skipped entire storylines because the levelling up was not aligned with the maps I was on, which made them too easy to walkthrough and pretty uninteresting. The campaigns opened at level 70 are challenging, as well as the PVP and and other PVE quests.Yes, there are payment options in game, but it would not necessarily be pay-to-win because a lot of the items are more aestetic or can be purchased through in-game money. I would recommend putting some investment into the game, especially when the workers at the publishing and developing companies do put a lot of serious and good work into adding on to the game and supporting players through it.I don't know much about the social or community aspect, but with the new Strongholds module, there is more engagement with guilds in the game. Check out this game anyways, it's free and very enjoyable."",1"
11140,Neverwinter,2015.0,Very fun and thought out game. Combat in this game is different than most has a unique feel to it. Skill also seems to make a big difference in the game for PVE and PVP. I enjoy the game so far and can't wait to see how it developes as i progress through the game.,1

Im playing this game long time, and been playing since mod 5. Players complaining that this is grinding game, well, you have 2 options - spend real money or time.And then, when you collect gear come new mod and you have to go from beggining, thats not true, you can play with gear you have. Only thing you need is good build for your character. New mod or gear is added for us, to have new things to do.

"11149,Neverwinter,2015.0,""Graphics are good, to me at least there's no fps drop between max graphics and lowest, i think theyre quite good really, i haven't seen much better in other mmos.Gameplay is fun, if you like hack and slash you'll like this. You can have 3 powers, 2 really strong powers that you need to charge, and 2 class features at a time in your rotation.Voice acting in the game is alright compared to most i've seen in online games, might be a big plus if you don't like reading a lot of text.Quests are meh, get sent to this area, get lots of quests from the people, kill this and that, go to that dungeon, then report back to the main city and get sent to another area.However I do enjoy the campaigns, which have greatly improved lore in my opinion. If you're a D&D fan you'll appreciate it more as you actually get some lore notes as you play.In game store is the most expensive I've seen in a while, you'd have to spend some crazy money to buy a good mount and a companion. I will admit i spent 30 dollars so i could get some stuff. However, the game has an auction house where you can get highest tier companions AND mounts with astral diamonds, which you can get doing some daily quests and such. it might seem really expensive and time consuming, but it's not that bad. Also you can buy the zen and exchange it for diamonds, which can get you a crazy amount of diamonds so you can buy what you want from the auction house. I wouldn't recommend spending money in this game until you're maxed out and completed ALL campaigns. Only then should you start worrying about actually having high level enchantments and stuff. By that point you might even have to afford such things with the astral diamonds you'll probably amass. (it took me about a week after i hit lvl 60 to buy an epic set of gear)I see some people complaining about inventory space? Since i started playing i've never had problems with inventory management, i don't think i'll ever buy more spaceI read thru the bad reviews and they're all about the same things, how expensive things are in the game and i couldn't agree more. But honestly no one is telling you to spend money on it, you can get it all for free by simply farming. Oh you can't handle playing a game for months? why play mmos then? I been playing games like runescape since they came out, I played warframe since early betas, same with path of exile and other mmos.This game is fine, has it's flaws but most of the bad reviews are exaggerated. I hit the level cap a while ago and thru ingame farming, i have some of the best gear and weapons, along with those oh so expensive enchantments and what not which only took me about a 2 weeks. People don't realize that all mmos take time and effort to be good at, so what if it takes a year to be amazing at this game? I play many mmos and there's nothing about this game making it pay to win to the max. Only an idiot would pay to win, as you can see how crazy expensive things are. Most people you'll see with really good gear  didn't pay to win, they simply been playing since 2013? If you're getting destroyed in pvp it doesn't mean they paid to win, they just been playing way longer than you (it takes about a week to hit lvl 60 if you play everyday.)Overall, i would say this isn't the most friendly game to new mmo players, but i say its definitely worth playing. It may be a long run, but eventually you'll be one of those guys destroying newbies in pvp. If anything, play with a friend it makes the game much better, i never get bored playing with my friends."",1"
11150,Neverwinter,2016.0,I've played Neverwinter for a few years now and and a D&D and Forgotten Realms fan. This isn't anything like Neverwinter Nights depite being called the successor to that game. Neverwinter Nights was a true RP experience if you played on the player made permanent worlds and this game is a standard MMO. I do enjoy it for what it is. I like the crafting system and you can still levle up your characters without actually questing if you are high enough level to pray to your diety. It's improving all the time and is very solo friendly.The big negative in this game is the cost of the DLC. I don'y ever pay for in game currency and you can play this game without it but it does restrict you. It takes an age to farm enough crystals to convert to Zen which is what you need to buy things. What does interest me in the market is the packs that allow you to play other races but the cost is extortionate. To but a pack that includes  new race it's the equivalent of Â£40. If you played half a day everyday for weeks you might just be able to make just enough to afford that. They really need to lower the cost of the DLC as it's the one thing that puts me off the game and I'm not alone.,1

Get message : """"You have exceeded the maximum number of PIN verification attempts, please wait 24 hours and try again."""" Uninstalled. Waste of time, GG."",0"
"11152,Neverwinter,2016.0,""I like this game. I read a lot of bad reviews about it being pay to win, and maybe it is at higher levels or in PVP, but for a really smooth and enjoyable MMO leveling experience, this game really shines. Some are complaining about the dated graphics, but the animations are great and it runs smoothly on my laptop. It has user created quests, too! Fun."",1"
"11153,Neverwinter,2017.0,""I am going to start off by saying that this game tries far to hard, and it lies. I am not saying it is difficult game, but it's trying to be something it's not. The game was released a year before the final production of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition was released, and everything about the game screams 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons. I mean, if you like 4th Edition D&D, all the more power to you, but it says in an advertisement that this is a 5th Edition D&D game, they are lying.A few things I do like about the game were the ease of difficulty, there is not a huge weight of difficulty starting off the game for most classes. Playing a Ranger is basically saying """"Well, I'm putting Iron Knuckles in my Boxing Gloves, let's Box!"""" I mean there are just so many advantages to some of the classes. Drawback is, you won't be playing more than 2, unless you subscribe, buy character slots, etc.I think this game tries to be unique, but doesn't get far enough along that line. That being said, sure there is a following for this game, but I spend most of my time sitting at a campsite when I play. Which brings me to the Cons of the discussion. The biggest con is the religion prayer factor. """"I'm going to just sit here for a few days, and pray my way to level 50."""" Trust me, you can do just that. Which is completely stupid. In no way, shape, or form is that good for your character, or the game. 1) You lose out on potential items, and gear you might otherwise find through playing the game, and it's a form of cheating in my eyes. You do nothing, and get lots of things back for it.Another con is the simple fact that this game is highly pay to win. They expect you to spend money on at least something as you play through the game. I don't care if it's items, or pretty much anything from cosmetics, etc. They pretty much encourage it, especially if you're praying your way to level 50, you get discounts left and right for 15% off this, or that. Doesn't matter what it is, it's still going to cost you money, as the money transactions at set evenly with money, which is fine for some games, but what I mean is $10 is minimum you can use, and you get 1,000 in-store money. That being said, almost everything costs 1,000, or you can only buy 1 or 2 items with it. I personally won't be buying anything on this game. Don't fall for that """"If I get this, I will be on par with everyone else"""" routine, at the end of the day, you only lost.I also think one of the bigger issues with the game is the community. It's nearly toxic, I say nearly, because most people in the game simply just ignore you. Anything you do, etc. Also on another note it is stalker-friendly as games go. It lists a player's entire account information: Character Name @ Account ID. That being said, if you know someone uses a particular ID, you could probably use Find Person to find them. Also from what a i learned from someone who had been playing for years """"Unless you're in a guild, or their guild, most people just ignore you."""" In the end, this con is pretty common as MMORPGs go these days. It's not a big loss, but there are a lot of games where the community is much more friendly, and interactive, hence why this game is nearly toxic. (Some people take the game far too seriously.)In closing, there are many ways to play this game, but few of them are as unique as any edition of Dungeons & Dragons. I guess the fruit falls off the tree, and rolls down the hill here, as it is far from any game I'd consider a true D&D game. Plus, the whole condtradiction/lie about it being 5th edition is completely false. Just the racial benefits alone are a big give away. (4th Edition used 2 sets of +2's for it's races, while 5th Edition had a +2, or a +1 to one, two, or all attributes, and rarely had, any only has to this day the Mountain Dwarf that gets a +2/+2 like the standard Dwarf in Neverwinter.) Also, the attribute system is broken, how can you 'roll' for dice if their going to be that broken about it? Use a point buy system or something, that's at least legit. Not to mention their """"Feat"""" system is basically just a renamed standard MMORPG skill tree with nothing """"Feat"""" like about it. Especially not 5th Edition if that is what they were intending to come off as.Play the game, see for yourself."",0"
11154,Neverwinter,2014.0,This game is amazing! I am so amazined I can play it on my outdated laptop and still enjoy the graphics and quests. I would recomend this to anyone that hesitated because they thought their computer couldn't run a good game. Let's get our game on!,1

"11156,Neverwinter,2013.0,""It's free-to-play, and definitely has some pay-to-win qualities. But if you're a casual player and don't care about being L33T, it's quite fun (and free). Lots of D&D lore, especially if you've played any of the recent D&D Encounters adventures. Rules are based on 4th Edition, which is my favorite edition so far. I've played dozens of hours before it came to Steam. Leveled a cleric to 60, and have a couple lower-level alts. I only paid once, to get the founder's pack deal when it first came out in beta. There's definitely dozens of hours of free entertainment here, no IAP necessary. Get a group of friends together and play it for fun PvE and it's totally free."",1"

When you think you've found a system to make money in this game they nerf it to the ground (mostly because of said push to BUY stuff) I would never recommend this game unless you can p2w, which you will be doing ALOT of just to keep up.

It's a shame they made it such a drag from 60-70 when level 1-60 was a breeze. Plus it is such a boring grind to get good gear now. I worked so hard to get the demonic gear I've got which back then was one of the best armors to have, but now when I play? I'm weak! I used to go into all areas and kill the monsters easily but now there is so many areas that are red because they are too difficult for me. I really can't be bothered spending many many hours grinding for good gear again.I still go back and play occasionally and I still like it but I can't play for the many hours at a time like I used to, I get bored much quicker."",1"
"11181,Neverwinter,2013.0,""I would say first, it is really an action game using RPG elements more than an actual RPG. While you do have the ability to customize your characters stats and abilities and you do take quests, there is really only one way to complete quests, which is to kill everything between you and the quest marker and then talk to whoever is waiting for you at the end. Further, even though this character is a rogue, I don't pick locks or pockets. I can disable traps, but in a group everyone runs through the dungeon so quickly there is no point in trying to disable anything.That said, the combat is pretty fun and action packed. I tried the PVP arena for the first time yesterday and had a blast. And then there is the Foundry. The Foundry allows players to create their own adventures that other people can then go through. I've tried a few and they seem to be pretty creative and fun (my earlier screenshots with the dancing skeletons and the upside down world were from two different foundry quests.)

Well, you never can grasp the whole Realms in just a couple of months - it takes years of ACTIVE roleplaying there to know what's going on and Neverwinter shows it just fine.

"11190,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Run of the mill Free to play experience.By this I mean.Money wasting mechanics designed to do nothing but expend your in game money and make buying said money more appealing. (a gem upgrade system with a MASSIVLY high fail rate even at 90% [hint its not really 90%] or companions that require WEEKS worth of currency farming to upgrade)Arbitrary time wasting mechanics that serve no purpose but to push the ability to sell speed ups and to make sure you consistantly log in and push those """"active sub numbers"""" up. Crafting timers and Diamond refinement limits are the two worst offenders.Paywalls for the most useful content. Best Race or Companions that dont die in a single shot cost real money (though you can buy companions thru the AH, its generally hundreds of thousands of diamonds to do so)Constant reminders to use the microtransaction store. Every time you log in the Store icon is illuminated until you click on it (minor gripe) and the most common drop in the game is a chest that requires a key that costs $1 USD. You'll amass hundreds of these stupid things and they will serve no purpose but to waste the limited bag space (another pay wall)For all its monetization faults its still a very fun game. The combat is fast and active, meaning you dont simply stand in place turn on your auto attack and cycle the same rotation over and over. You are forced to dodge attacks, and use positioning to ensure maximum efficency. This puts its combat right up there with GW2 or TERA.The maps are functional but its very clear your traversing a video game (if that makes sense to you). Its an open world, but a cell based one (think the first 2 S.T.A.L.K.E.R games or GW2). The questing system is like any other MMO, with a slight tweak where you get item rewards before you turn in in some cases. Pretty cool since you get that new item right away and dont have to run back to town for it. By far the best feature of this game is the Foundry system. Its basically a instance editior that gives any player over lv 15 access to the tools to make their very own maps/instances. If you are into modding or making maps, this will be a dream come true and possibly a way for you to never have to worry about money in game ( players who liked you maps can tip you in the games main currency). This alone is worth playing, I just wish they didnt nerf XP to the ground in foundry missions and instances. I understand why they did it, but you either chain quests or you simply dont level.Lots of faults, lots of things done right. But overall I dont feel like these monetization practices should be supported. Cosmetics I take no issue with, but when you start gimping your game to push microtransactions I have a serious problem, and this game does just that. It does not feel like it does at first, but by lv 40 you'll be pulling your hair out over the thousands of lost diamonds from upgrades, or the fact that nearly every single profession quest requires specific laborers that are either purchased outright or require farming profession bags you buy on the AH for tens of thousands of diamonds each."",0"
"11191,Neverwinter,2018.0,""If you miss playing MMORPG, this is the right game for you. It is not a P2W game because you can finish the storyline without spending money, and also you do not have to spend much if you know exactly what to spend and dominate the market.

"11193,Neverwinter,2016.0,""This is is just awesome. There are so many classes and races that allow you to create your ideal character so you have a lot of fun. This game has one of the best combat systems I've ever seen (right next to TERA) that makes combat fastpaced and makes you feel like a total boss when you kill an enemy and the ragdoll death physics kick in. Although one problem with the game is that it is one of the least open world mmos out there. There is also an awesome story line that makes you solve one problem in Neverwinter and move on to te next. The feealing of finding an awesome peice of loot in a dungeon is just great. This game is so much better when you play with a friend or two so recommend it to a friend. There is a TON of types of enemies so combat is never repetitive because you can be fighting a squishy minion and out of no where a hulking guy with a giant axe walks up to you and he takes a lot more dodging and abilitie using than the others.

"11199,Neverwinter,2018.0,""The younger and slightly undeveloped sibling of World Of Warcraft, that describes it perfectly.Neverwinter is a free RPG game which holds great adventures, a magnificent graphics quality, impressive voice acting and immersive story.Don't like paying for your games but expect years of effort put into a game just for you to play? Then you've come to the right place, young Jedi.This game holds a great community that (surprisingly) passes as the best community experience I've seen in the last few years. Even though this game is free, for some reason, it doesn't attract 12 year olds such as some other games do.. (cough)Of course, it is not a perfect masterpiece when it comes to PvP and inventory management, but come on, it's a free game that you'd probably still pay a considerable amount of money if it were priced.Everything in the game is obtainable by farming and spending time, there is no - Pay 2 Win - associated with this game. Of course, there is - Pay 2 Advance Faster -, but it's totally up to you if you like the game, therefore you decide if you'd like to support the developers or not, with a little buck.I rate this game 8/10, because it could have been better. Though, I believe that it's engine doesn't allow it... And it's a little repetitive once you've got the basis of it.Do not hesitate on playing this game! It is definitely worth a try. But, hear from me, it could bring addiction. Play safe."",1"

Theres been many games that ive bought for example """"Cod Ghosts"""" i only played like 20 hours on it for 60$ thats a rip off but since i have about 100+ hours here i wouldnt mind shelling out 20$ here and there once in a while.

If this game was made by Bioware this could have been an epic title worthy of the Neverwinter name...but sadly """"Perfect"""" World is a shoddy dev with pretty awkward free to play models. The story would have been enough alone to hold this game up there with the big titles at the moment if Bioware would have made it. I have no idea how/why people would rather play this over other free to play MMOs out there, it's just dreadfully dull. I give this a 4/10, only the presentation of zones and the fun combat system keep this game mildly worth playing...but I still wouldn't reccomend it. Could have been so much more if it wasn't made by a dev who's history of MMOs is sketchy at best."",0"

Going to contact them directly about this additional error, I'm told 'Your question hasn't been submitted'.So far I've played 15 minutes, but spent 30 trying to report a server failure to them, and having to navigate their pathetic website.In summation: enjoy the beautiful cinematics of Neverwinter, but be extremely cautious about giving this firm any money, as I doubt you'll be able to contact them if something inevitably goes wrong."",0"

PvE has a much more lax gear requirement to be competetive, though gear does help.The combat system is literally the best in any MMO out there (though some classes have some PvP balance issues, even still).

"11212,Neverwinter,2014.0,""A F2P game with some elements of nickle and diming but they're avoidable. It's totally playable without putting a cent into it but you're restricted to two characters. There's no restrictions on the gameplay itself and it's quick to level to 60.     Resetting your character's active skills costs """"Zen"""" which is real money, but you shouldn't have to unless you've been playing level 60 for a while. Resetting passive skills called """"Feats"""" cost ingame currency called """"Astral Diamonds"""" and it scales depending on how much points you put into it already. Astral diamonds can be traded for Zen and vise versa to help cover costs for an extra character or a skill reset if you're worried about spending real money, but it takes time to collect enough of.    Unfortunately, the economy is somewhat bloated with bot farmers selling ingame currency for real money, causing some items on the market to be ungodly amount of astral diamonds to buy. Finding a party to get into a dungeon is almost impossible unless you advertise yourself on the """"Looking For Group"""" chat or bring friends. One of the classes, The Devoted Cleric, has a high difficulty curve that can surprise new players and is not recommended to play during your first time unless you know what you're in for. There's also balance issues with enchantments and high level pvp which the developers said to be patched soon.     All in all, decent free MMO that if you don't have problems with gambling (see TF2 or CS:GO i.e crates), should really only cost you none to 15 USD. Surpisingly fun and the classes feel great and powerful to play. It's recommended, if it is your first time, to just play the game however you want without worrying what build you should spec into."",1"
"11213,Neverwinter,2016.0,""Updated review ( Everything after 420 hours playtime  is lvl 70/mod8 content)Neverwinter is an action  F2P MMORPG with faster lvling than wow , interesting combat and 8 modules (mini expansions all for free)IS the game P2W? Not really you can pay and get things faster but it should be more than possible to get full epic lvl 70 gear and ViP rank12 plus mounts all for free once you get to lvl 70 and do some grinding.PROS:-The game + modules are 100% free you can even get VIP without paying!-The combat is diffrent and interesting.-Clean and easy to use UI, no more 50 hotkeys to clog your screen.-You can earn a decent amount of ingame currency and buy the same stuff as wallet warriors.-Lvling from lvl1-60 is very fast.-Free Artefact weapon just by reaching lvl 70.-Free stuff from ingame store during hollidays (mounts,bags, refining stuff )-Ignore lists are account wide(take that gold spammers)-Most lvl 70 equipment is accountbound.-The mod 8 equipment is easy to get and very good.-Minc the character you quest with at lvl 60-70 is hillarious.-Do a  cool questline made by R.A Salvatore.-Fight alongside Drizzt Do'Urden.CONS:-Game can be laggy even on high end computers.-Disconnections happen at the most inconvenient times.-PVP is a bit unbalanced and you will find yourself with a crappy team vs premade.-If you have low itemlvl no good guild will take you in.-Lvling from lvl 60-70 takes way too long, wanted to shoot myself in the foot.-Some items on the AH is way overpriced.-If you are not in a guild you will have no more quests at lvl 68 ish.-The Devs removed ALOT of cool dungeons when lvl 70 came out, they might come back tho.-Gold is useless-Goldspammers are annoying and everywhere, just like wow.So after all this, do I still reccomend the game? yes, because I am having alot of fun and my guild is doing lvl 70 stuff My personal opinion is that the Pros outweight the cons even when you fight a wallet warrior in pvp haha.My score 8/10 (could be worse , a few bugfixes and some old dungeons back from the devs and I will bump it up to 9) "",1"
"11214,Neverwinter,2013.0,""This is a D&D MMO loosely based on 4.0 rules in Neverwinter's settings ( Forgotten Realms). I have been playing this since open beta and I am still playing it today. The art and graphics are nice, but I do not like the lack of noticable changes in character creation (most of the characters, of the same race, look very similar to eachother).  I would not say this is a complete game, there are plenty of things they need to add and things they are working on. There are plenty of races to choose from, all but two are free (but who wants to play a moon elf or a menzo renegade, when you have regular drows?!).There are 6 classes with more in the works. You play how you want to play, choose what skills and gear you want to use for your character.For me, it is hard to talk about class balances because of what the classes were made to do. Hunter Ranger had recently been released and I haven't read, or played, much of them. Though, when you look at the other characters, they have very specific roles (for most of them anyways). Wizards have a lot of AoEs and crowd controls, Guardian Fighters are tanks, Clerics are healers and can even off tank is spec/geared properly. Rogues are pure damage, but are very squishy, and the same thing with Great-Weapons Fighter (thought I feel they are lacking in damage, but mine is very low level).  I also don't PVP, so that is another reason why I can't really talk about the balances. I have done plenty of dungeons/skirmishes and have a varity of classes certainly helped out.It is a linear game, simply one quest/a group of quests after the next. You do get daily rewards, once you are level 10 or so, but can loose your weekly coins if you skipped a day (you get two coins a day: one type of coin you keep until you spend it, the other coin will stack up to 7 and is the one that will disappear if you skip a day).  I would say give the game a try to, at least, level 15. At that level the foundry will open up to you. You will be able to make your own dungeons, or play dungeons that other players have made. The foundry gives you all the tools you need to get in for something very simple and later something more complexed.I have never felt the -need- to buy anything, but I have put money into this game. I don't care to have a faster mount since this is not an open world game. I don't mind making a few more trips to the vendor to clear up bag space, it's not really that different from other MMOs.  There is one pack where you can buy gear (which I don't really approve of), but other than that the gear in the Zenn store (cash shop) has no stats and it's only there to make your character look pretty. I can't really say I like any of the companions in the Zenn store, I simply use the companion you get for free or one I got during an in-game event. I am not happy about only having two free character slots, but enjoyed the game enough and didn't mind spending the money for more character slots. Besides, anything that can be bought in the Zenn store could also be bought with the in-game astral diamonds. Saving up those diamonds can take awhile, even more so if you do not play that often, but it can be done.I would give this game a 8/10. There are plenty of things they need to work on: class balance, more content, playable classes, and so on. The graphics are nice and the game play is fun. I do not have a level capped character, but I am not really have a hard time leveling. I would say I have over 400 hours into the game, I stopped running raptr so I'm not sure how much I really spent playing this game. Am I pressured into buying anything? Sure, but it is only character slots or vanity gear. That wedding dress would be all kinds of cute on my wood elf! I am also addicted to making new characters, and what?!So, give it a try and see how you like/dislike it! Also, if you are experiencing glitches or lag I suggest going to the Neverwinter site and downloading it from there."",1"

People do not like spending real life money on MMOs, but the game is free is it not? So complaining is silly.

In game events also happen often, and every event gives you a chance to get a very unique item of some kind whether its so a very cool fast mount, a strong companion, or just a silly item like a portable throne! Now lets talk about the workers behind Neverwinter that are really a great group of people. They constantly work hard daily to keep Neverwinter running, adding new content very often, and keeping it bug free. The employees are also very easy to get ahold of and they are the most helpful bunch that will assist you with anything you need. Its very important for a game to have that. They also play Neverwinter, and they even take the time to play with players in-game and occasionally help out people in need. How cool is that? They also Stream on Twitch often and give away in game items and even phsyical items like T-Shirts. So overall, Neverwinter is one of the best free to play MMOs out right now.

I would reccommend this for 2 reasons one: you can run this off a potato and 2: its not a bad game i loved the customization except some of the features don't work like some of the body scaling tools. It's simplistic battle style and is a bit on the pricey side when you want to buy new features but in all i think its a good game i give it a 6/10.,1
"11221,Neverwinter,2013.0,""Neverwinter is a very fun, accessible MMORPG.  The combat utilizes the most fluid, action-oriented system I've ever seen for an MMO, and the customization options are much more advanced than most games in the genre.  I've been playing Neverwinter since it was in open beta, and I even did a video review about a month after it's official releaseâ€”in which I scored it a 9/10.

So no suprises there I guess.In conclusion Neverwinter deserves your attention. It's a good game with a bad publisher. Give the game a try and it might just suprise you but keep in mind that if this is a game you plan on sticking with, you'll probably end up emptying out your bank account just to keep up with the top players."",1"
"11223,Neverwinter,2013.0,""I have been playing neverwinter since beta, and I can say I enjoy the game. The story is interesting the gameplay is fun the graphics are smooth and the setting is just great. There are not many things I have found fault in with neverwinter but some of these are as follows, for an mmo neverwinter feels extremely linear with one quest linking to the next all the way to endgame. Another thing I dont like is endgame, I always get bored but this seems to just be the mmo way atm, there content creator helps somewhat in that user generated content can be pretty great, but it does not completely make up for some of the default content lacking that spark that makes it interesting. Even another thing that rubs me the wrong way is pvp, when the game was a newer release there seemed to be a more active pvp scene but now all the matches seem to me unbalanced and boring. Now dont think for a second I am going to end the recommendation on a sour note, I had a LOT of fun with the game on all my characters up until the point you start to feel that inevitable mmo fatigue. I recommend you try the game yourself to see if you like it or not, yea end game can be grindy, yea there are some ridiculous cash shop items but are these not things we have all come to expect from a free to play mmo? The game has a lot to offer and a lot of fun you can experience without paying a dime or grinding a second, so get out there and get playing!Update 7/30/14: Neverwinter fans rejoice, Neverwinter is coming to xbox and its getting a new expansion!Update 8/11/15: Neverwinter just keeps getting new content. I have not played in a while but this is good news. I hear its one of the most popular free to play games on Xbox now as well!"",1"
"11224,Neverwinter,2013.0,""It's Free to Play, what more do you want? I see a few bad reviews on the game as far as MMO Pay2Win which is utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t, you're not being forced to buy into the minor cosmetics, why not enjoy the game to it's fullest? I've put in two and a half hours with a friend which was well worth it, the combat system puts most other MMO's to shame in my honest opinion unless you're the type that likes quickbars and endless rows of abilities. You have a chance to dodge melee attacks as a Ranger ( Haven't played any other class.) which is nice, it brings a similar mechanic as Dark Souls into play which I find extremely well thought out. My advice: Try it out if you have free space on your computer, you're not losing money if you simply TRY. IT. OUT. Don't take the people's opinion that wouldn't reccomend this game, take it into your own judgement. In all honesty I give the game a 8/10 why not a perfect score? Simple, because it isn't perfect BUT it is fun if you have a few friends you can tag along with."",1"
"11225,Neverwinter,2014.0,""After 60 or so hours of playing this game, I find that if you don't play this game with friends or in a group, this will get rather boring, however, the core gameplay is pretty amazing. Seeing as it's a small install and free to play, I'd definitely reccomend this game."",1"
"11226,Neverwinter,2015.0,""One of the best MMO's on steam! I have a lot of fun playing this game put at least $20 into this game, if you were to ask me what MMO should I get, I would recomend this one not only does it have a descent story line (I don't listen to the story.) It also has great voice acting something a lot of MMO's lack.(Meaning the peson doing the voice is good at it. That doesn't mean it sounds good.)(COUGH* COUGH* DC UNIVERSE)(COUGH* COUGH* TERRIBLE VOICE ACTING)This game has a better overall story than DC Universe.HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"",1"
"11227,Neverwinter,2016.0,""The game is actually good. I spent more than 4000 hours on it since its release. However, Neverwinter is not only p2w but also operated by a chinese company, which is really awful. This game may be free to play but in fact, it is by far more expensive than any other game in the market. You absolutely cannot get BIS without money or exploits. I played since beta, spent a decent amount of money, and I am still far from being BIS. At the current state, I will never reach BIS because I can't generate enough in-game currency by legal means. The game is also extremely grindy. You have to grind forever make even the smallest changes to your character which makes it really hard for new players to actually become competitive. By the way, if you decide to pay to win through the in-game store, be aware that it may cost thousands of dollars to get decent.The company behind the game is also infamous for its bait-n-switch practices. They promise things on the forums, then break their promises a couple of months later without any consideration for their player base. Please understand this. You do not have active GM's online, bugs rarely get fixed, and there is no transparency in how the devs do business. One of the game's main feature which is the """"Foundry"""" gets disabled all the time, and it is currently unavailable to players. It has been down for nearly two months and devs do not even bother to explain why or when they plan to get it back on. In other words, bad customer service, bad dev team, bad business model, and lazy and rushed content,Players have absolutely no voice and censorship is extremely common in the forums. I have posted many times in response to the issues that negatively affect the game just to get my posts removed. The forum moderators lack preparation and it is not uncommon for some staff members to indirectly insult and mock players in response to their lack of satisfaction with the game. I loved Neverwinter since its pre-release. It is a game full of potential with amazing mechanics and possiblities of infinite content through the Foundry. I still play the game but I do not advise anyone to spend money in it. The money you spend is a waste as the economy is volatile and extremely unstable. If you are looking for a game to play for a while that will be fun and rewarding, then NW is not for you. However, if you are looking to just waste time playing a D&D themed game, then go ahead.Update: October 2017. The game is still p2w. Harder to obtain currency. Leadership profession nerfed to the ground. Refinement system is miserable, and the campaigns are WAY MORE grindy than they used to be.Update: June 2018. Cryptic has now nerfed the AD refinement system and the amount of currency one can obtain daily. Another major blow to players in order to stimulate more ZEN purchases. As usual, devs are hurting their player base through questionable business practices."",0"
"11228,Neverwinter,2013.0,""the only use i currently have for D&D 4.0.  simplified rules apply well to a video game.  truly a free game.  if one is willing to wait for the seasonal events one can acquire a full set of costume apparel, a mount, a companion and a weapon skin without pay a single zen (one pence US).  while waiting for an event one can acrue coins by invoking daily and maintaining professions (can be done with a browser or mobile).  busy, busy, busy."",1"
"11229,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Model (F2P): The biggest downside to the game is its Zen system which, I suppose is the only way for a free MMO to make money, as one would expect from a F2P model. Unlike in games like Path of Exile, the items purchased with Zen can definitely be game altering and offer advantages that free players would not have access to at a much earlier level. However, there is a way to convert in game currency (Astral Diamonds) into Zen at a conversion rate that changes depending on the market. Neverwinter sometimes pushes the player to use special currencies in order to open lockboxes containing level-appropriate equipment, but is otherwise not too intrusive. Unfortunately, the in-game currency of Zen-to-Dollar ratio uses an extremely expensive conversion when compared to other F2P games such as Rift. While most decent item sets cost somewhere between 1500-3000 zen, approximately 500 zen = $5, depending on how many Zen are purchased at once.Gameplay: Some of the most innovative and fun combat you'll find in the current MMO scene. The classes are very well fleshed-out, but definitely not balanced as of yet. Most classes require re-positioning, timing, and anticipation when reacting to enemies or even allies' actions. It's definitely not a click and spam blindly game. Unique mechanics are introduced depending on the class. A Guardian Fighter can hold up a shield to block attacks, while a Rogue can quickly close distance with a teleporting strike. Every class feels truly unique and full of flavor. The combat system is mostly based on a D&D-type of ruleset with skilltrees in the form of feats and eventual specialization. While questing is very linear and everything else is pretty much what you would expect in a standard MMO, the profession system is more of a que-and-wait.  Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who's awaiting WildStar and its combat system and wants something similar to satisfy their hunger for ARPG-type combat. Additionally, creative minds can use this game to create scenario-type quests and dungeons through a feature I personally have not used much called the Foundry.Multiplayer: Standard faire for the current MMO market. PVP scenarios of varying types pitting 5v5, co-op challenges that can quickly be completed with friends or random players, and dungeons. Lots of variety for all types of players and a guild system. Most players use the in-game chat to find groups or members. No innovation, but definitely satisfying for those who don't like soloing.7.5/10"",1"
"11230,Neverwinter,2014.0,""My review to Neverwinter -Neverwinter, it is a based on """"Neverwinter Nights"""" and """"Dungeons & Dragons"""".(No its not part of the series of NN according Wikipedia).Let's start with the gameplay - Neverwinter is not like the other MMORPG games out there like """"World of Warcraft"""" etc.it's bit different, we don't have numbers to attack in different ways, we have to press on the mouse,or press Q, E, R and this, to use abilities. (BTW, in NN and NN2 it's like WoW style and NN is not a MMORPG, just rpg).The movment system also different. In case that you don't need to press on the target to attack them only aim and press the ability or on the mouse.Leveling is like the other MMORPGs just do quests, killing enemies and this stuff but the leveling is kinda easy, you get quite enough from quests.Graphics and Physics -Graphics are important part in video games, its can be bad, it can be good.the game shows us what 'Cryptic Studios' can do with their game. graphics are nice, not awesome but nice.Physics are not that good at this game bit silly, like if you push a barrel you can push only that way that it cannot fall only if there something that can do that it will fall somehow.the enemies does not have ragdoll, (It is not so important but just saying).A.I. -Not that smart but decent. the bosses are smart attacking you when you can't attack or you have no ability to attack stronger.Snipers are silly too, like an A.I from a shooter game, when you are behind wall they shoot you, like everybody.the enemies are silly too, like the bosses but not that smart like the bosses.Ok, that is all, this is my review. you do not need to like it you can hate it how much you want this is my opinion, and YES THIS GAME IS PAY 2 WINThe good - Nice Gameplay Nice Graphics Character Customization that can take you at least 20 minutesThe bad -Silly A.IBad PhysicsStory is not that interestingPay to winScores Gameplay - 8.5Graphics - 9.0Physics - 6.0A.I. - 6.5Story- 7.0Final score - 8.5 / 10"",1"
"11231,Neverwinter,2013.0,""Neverwinter is a good game, people with some knowledge in D&D may not like it, but it has a great base of lore that some fans will love it.Is not as complete as other MMORPG's, the pvp system is kinda basic, and the variety of weapons and armors is a little poor, but at least is free.Pros:-Interesting dungeons-dynamic combat system-variety of races-character progressionCons:-Boring pvp-lack of utility of character classes in dungeons or pvp"",1"
"11232,Neverwinter,2014.0,""It's free-to-play, very full-featured, and a ton of fun if you like fantasy MMOs. Uses the Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition rules, which actually work a lot better as a computer game than they do in the pen & paper game. The combat is surprsingly robust, much more interactive than in a typical MMO - it uses reticule targeting rather than Tab targeting, and that's a LOT more interesting. The big bonus is the built-in Foundry editor which allows any user to create their own quests, so there's a huge amount of user generated content, some of it very good indeed.Overall, it's currently my go-to MMO, and I recommend it highly."",1"
11233,Neverwinter,2014.0,This game is pretty fun especially if you have a friend or two to group with.  I don't know what everyone is complaining about the pay to win.  There is nothing in this game that you have to spend real money on at all.  The Zen currency can be purchased with in game currency astral dimonds if your will to put the effort into gettting them... Even then Zen is mostly used for cosmetic items and a couple of companions.  Moving on from there I like the active combat system vs. the stand in one place spaming a button like some of the other mmo's out there.,1
"11234,Neverwinter,2014.0,""This surprised me, for a f2p its not bad.    Pros: PvE this is where the game shines.  There's different  queues for dungeons and skirmishes (team up with people to defeat an outdoor mini dungeon) for your level range.  There's also the foundry which has thousands of player made content which is always being updated and keeps things fresh.  You can of course create a foundry mission which the community can play and applies to the previous statement.  Cons: The classes have balancing issues in pvp and if people have better gear than  you then you'll get rolled but if you farm enough you can get the same gear but its mildly pay to win.  There's class issues in PvE as well for instance I played a tank (so  called) which would lead you to believe you would tank, hold aggro, and be a damage sponge.  This is not the case.  You spend most of your time  running out of the red spots as a tank, which means you aren't dps'ing, which means you're not generating enough threat to hold aggro.  If you stand  in the red and don't block you take huge damage...as a fully geared tank, and spec'ed full tank (I tried both the tank trees in full defensive gear 51% dmg reduction, 32% parry which is very high, and 15% aoe reduction, a large hp pool, among other things) you take massive damage.Your only hope is to use your aoe taunt which has a long cooldown, and spam your fighters recovery daily which unless you're tactician you wont have up when you  need it so thats the  only viable spec I've found.  The so called cookie cutter spec is to stack attack power and go down the tree  that gives you double attack power if you have full block (which means if you block your dps is lowered based on how much shield you have remaining).  This is great for threat, but you can't take much damage and the healing in  this game is pretty bad imo.  This saddens me as I only had an interest in tanking in NW and they've failed the class.  Tanks aren't taken most of the time end game, people would rather have ranged and cc ( ranger and control wizard) control means no healing and more aoe damage potential.Until they fix the tank class to be able to actually tank I wont be playing the game.  ============================================================I did create a foundry mission which was very time consuming (you can spend as much or as little time as you wish on a foundry mission) as I chose to build my own multi-story building (very limited tools made this a lot harder than  it needed to be, for example, if you could select more than one object to copy / paste, it  would have saved me days of work if not more).The community can rate your foundry mission in a 5 star system if they play it and for the most part the community in the foundry is good.  But since most people don't create foundry missions, they don't appreciate how long it takes to make them.  If you want an example do a search for my foundry mission """"Ghost - behind enemy lines"""" and play it.  That foundry took me over 3 weeks to make and I'm out of work so that means every day I was working on it (most of the time was building the last building).Its not all bad though, I went into the foundry  sort of knowing it would take a while and some people would be unappreciative but for the most  part the reviews were friendly and the comments some people had were very  satisfying and thoughtful.  People can donate astral diamonds to you if they wish and a lot of people do so that's nice.  If the community rates it high enough it can be hosted by the devs.   People play your content and enjoy it, that makes you feel like you wrote a novel (which you actually are an author in this case) and people like it, this makes it worth it."",1"
"11235,Neverwinter,2014.0,""This game lost all that made the Neverwinter Nights franchise great. Its just another arcadey WoW clone, there is none of the full immersion role play which I loved from the NWN games.If you like arcade MMO's its okay. But I was horribly disappointed in this game."",0"

"11237,Neverwinter,2014.0,""This game is SOOOOOOOO ADDICTING... Ive played so many mmorpgs but i usually end up quiting cuz of the long, boring and endless hours of grinding. However this game is always action packed with the large amount of bosses/dungeons. You level up quickly from following the main quests so it keeps gamers from getting bored of doing the same thing. Dungeons also get SUPER epic when you have a full party of 5 especially when you get later into the game. (level 45+)Graphics are amazing at full HD quality, character customization is awesome (get to choose races, jobs etc), combat system is great (similar to Tera Rising)-- dodge/block system, PVP is fun (kinda like capture the flag or Dominion in League of Legends), overall game can be competitive (mechanically skilled players can outplay other players with op stuff), and much more.I reached the max level 60, and during that experience it was HELLA FUN! And it gets way better cuz once you hit 60, you get bombarded with more crazy quests and you can customize your character even more with the access to boons (another skill tree). Overall I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME! It's just amazing bcuz you can have the same amount of fun by yourself or by grabbing some of your buddies to do the dungeons/quests with.10/10"",1"
"11238,Neverwinter,2013.0,""i have many hours into this game.  imo this game has something for everyone.  pvp, grind, crafting, auction house, zen/AD economy & questing to name most.  this is my suggestion: play the game for one month or to level 60 w/o spending _ANY_ money.  find what you like about it and play that.  then decide if its worth throwing money @ or worth raising another character (you get 2 characters for free account).  monthly and seasonal events reward companions, weapon skins and, rarely, mounts.  not to mention the role playing crowd (visit the Moonstone Mask).note this is perfect world entertainment so if you play STO or any of their other properties you already have an account.  combat is commanded and _not_ auto-combat like most mmos.  we must aim and target our spells lest we miss, and thus, perhaps, get to start over at the last campfire. i recommend:Play with your friends!  even w/o voice if you have a plan you _will_ win.  (even in grey wolf den)  ps if you dont have enough zen for something it will likely be on sale soon enough.  check weekly for deals.  EDIT: Level capacity expanded to 70.  New reason to play the game (again), endgame gear is no longer endgame.  4th increment of skills added.  Say hi to Minsc, really."",1"
"11239,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Fun game, They make it pretty easy to do the quest lines Without buying items from the zen market. It has a really cool browser app, So you can take care of some of your ingame responsibilities and mini games. It has a companion system which is cool. Makes it easier to solo.The only thing i hate is the queuing for dungeons, It's not like World of warcraft when you Que for one your in within a minute most times. It's not like that with this game you wait for some time or you search for players.I suggest buying one of the 59$ packs there's two of them. Don't bother buying the steam starter pack waist of a 20$. All and all its a fun game with its shoot and dodge mechanics. Your enjoy it!!"",1"
"11240,Neverwinter,2014.0,""First of all this is not a pay to win game. ZEN is a currency you can buy with real money. You can convert ZEN into Astral Diamonds or do the opposite - AD into ZEN. AD can be achieved by doing daily quests and is the trading currency used in the Auction House and several merchants. You can buy ZEN to quicken your progression or make the game more convenient(e.g. extra inventory slots, respec tokens, rare companions and more). ZEN converted into AD can get you rare and powerful items from the Auction House. Only difference a paying user could have, is if he bought a Starter pack or Guardian of Neverwinter pack and he would receive exclusive gear, mounts/companions, enchants. They barely affect gameplay and only have vanity value, rather than becoming stronger. All content is the same either you're a paying user or a free user, it depends on how much are you willing to grind. You can grind to get AD and then trade it for something you want. Or be a bit more patient and do daily quests and sell unwanted stuff in the Auction house.Proffessions are a grind fest and work based of timers. You need a certain leveled/valued worker, reagents and time. Most proffesions have task times of 10-60minutes. Leadership on the other hand has 2-12hours. You can access proffesions from your browser/mobile device so if you're really determined you can progress in proffesions nicely.Neverwinter is worth a try, for a free-to-play mmo this one is indeed special."",1"

"11243,Neverwinter,2014.0,""A very fun game, absolutely worth the time you'll spend playing it. To top that off, it's FREE. And though you'll begin very slowly, giving soldiers medkits and collecting broken arrows, the moment you expect a chore, you're fighting the Necromancer's chief in brute strength. From there, you can do anything you so choose, whether that be the plot line or discovering things you aren't supposed to yet.Every class and race feels individual, as some races change the loadout of your class. It runs off the familiar Stats from DnD, Strangth, Dexterity, Charisma, Constitution, & Wisdom. These stats will effect anything you do. This game requires skill rather than good equipment, unlike WoW, in that you can sidestep and teleport (depending on your class) to escape attacks. You have to have full situational awareness though, because if one enemy can sneak up on you, you're gonna have a bad time.You can quest with other people, which is fantastic and makes the game much more friendly than  other MMORPGs. There is even a mail system. And though some quests you do feel similar, you won't get bored of them. They never feel repetitive, although they sound like it.Bottom line is, if you have hard drive space, good internet, and NEED something to keep you occupied for the rest of the year, this game is definately for you."",1"

"11245,Neverwinter,2013.0,""This is a very enjoyable game! It reminds me of World of Warcraft, mixed with a bit of Lord of The Rings Online. The combat system is dynamic, movement based, so you move about and attack instead of standing-by and using skills sort of style. The quests are great, atmosphere is glorious, and the soundtrack is most excellent. This reminds me of all the time I spent as a child playing Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate.

The complexities of choosing the right moves(sorry infinite hotbar people) choosing the right stats, choosing the right gear, choosing the right abilities will keep you going in this game for a long time.Comabt is hands down some the best an MMORPG has seen, improving upon the Guild Wars dodge mechanics. PvP is about more than seeing who can run the best circles and press the moves in a better faster rotation, there is actually some skill involved.

"11256,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Looking for that good old Neverwinter Nights feel but in an MMO format? Then you'll be sorely disappointed.I concluded very quickly that this title is Neverwinter in name alone, where the long since established D&D rule system and mechanics are no where in sight. Hence I didn't play for very long out of blinding disappointment. Instead of the second coming we get this weird mix of """"modern"""" action orientated combat, apparently borrowing mechanics and ideas from a wide range of similar games and throwing them haphazardly into a boiling pot of lore loosely based on the beloved Neverwinter Nights games and D&D universe.Where this game has a chance to shine though, is through it's surprisingly complex and complete quest creation system. There is a metric tonne of player created quests here (for better or worse)! Some are really well written and thought out while others are painfully incomplete and outright boring.Would I recommend it?If you are familiar with the role of being a gamemaster or just love to create stories, this might just be the game for you.If you are looking for yet another F2P MMO in which to kill things, this might be the game for you.If you are looking for a solid Neverwinter Nights/D&D experience... keep looking.TL"
"11257,Neverwinter,2015.0,""I played it mainly before it was put out on Steam.Meehh, not too much customization on your classes, not very deep in terms of gameplay and crafting, but it killed about 20-25 houers before geting wayyy to tedious. Rating: Meh. If your into this kind of light hearted IMORPG (Instanced multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) then itÂ´s alright."",1"
"11258,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Completely recommend this game. Out of all free to play RPG games, this will always be a personal favorite. So many different options and classes to choose from.

Only cons are that you kind of need money for cool features (like every other online RPG game). Overall 10/10!"",1"

More downloads, only in patching. To clarify, anywhere from 600 MB to 2000 MBs of space needed. I don't have the time, nor memory available for such a large game. Unless you have a fast computer/laptop, my suggestion is to stay away from this game. Especially if it leaves FtP status."",0"
"11261,Neverwinter,2013.0,""Smells like Guild Wars 2 spirit. If you played that game you will get used to Neverwinter pretty quick - you can do similiar actions like dodging by rolling away from enemy, characters don't require mana to cast """"normal"""" spells, et caetera.I've been a little prejudiced to Neverwinter - I played Dungeons & Dragons Online and it was terrible experience. This game, however, is pretty good and fun to play, especially if you have a friend or two to create party with and explore the world together. Lore is quite interesting and both systems and interface are designed very well. If you ask me, the only cons of this game are: a bit """"blocky"""" animations and boredom which appears when you get on higher level and you are not fond of Foundry stories.This game is really worth to give it a chance."",1"
11262,Neverwinter,2014.0,really good game if you stick to one character and grind through it so its better to make a character that you will want to spend quite a few hours with. Game does have items that u have to pay for and would make the game alot easier and more enjoyable but I personally dont mind it for a free game what do you expect they need to make money somewhere as long as you stick to a main character that you like you shouldnt really need to buy anything its just when you reach higher levels it gets harder to stick as a free player espically in pvp.  At moment i am enjoying the game i did at the start mess around with the classes  and got bored really quickly but then i gave it another go and stuck to one character and found that it was a lot more enjoyable so my view might change as i play more but for now id give it a 8/10,1
"11263,Neverwinter,2014.0,""This game has excellent combat, rather the new style of MMO combat, It's a great plus to the gameplay.

"11272,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I've played this game for a while and I have to say, that many negative things in negative comments are true:- EndGame PvP is full of players who spend way too much money in a game and just destroy you (there are some guys out there who are stronger then your whole team)- You really need only 3 classes: Control Wizard, Great Weapon Fighter and only sometimes a Devoted Cleric- The game repeats over and over again in the EndGame because of """"campaigns"""" and the same Dungeons over and over again- You often end up exploiting bugs in some dungeons and run them over and over again -> grinding as f***Please notice that I'm NOT familiar with the Books etc. I just started it because a good friend told me about it. But there are some really good aspects in the game:+ it looks nice+ the gameplay is really nice and just makes fun+ the music is nice+ real fun with some friends+ nice map/dungeon design+ theoreticly you can reach everything without spending any money, but it would take waaaay too long+ PvE is not Pay2Win+/- the community: On one side, they throw you out of the group because you don't have a 15.000+ Gearscore (shows how good your equipment is) - on the other, they'll help you and share their experience+/- Updates: The game develops more and you get more and more content - but with every update there is at least one new way to exploit a dungeon+/- Boss fights: Many of them are unique and are really great ! - But after the 5. to 10. time you kill the same boss, you'll know how to kill him easily+/- The """"ZenShop"""": The ZenShop is a place where you can buy stuff with """"Zen"""", you get them for real money. In this shop you can't buy any equipment but Wards, and you'll need those wards for your enchantments.All in all i can say that I had fun playing this game and I will play it further because after every dungeon you finish, after every boss you kill and after every step you advance you make in the campaigns, you'll feel better and you can see how you develop your character.

"11274,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Welcome back to Neverwinter,â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥is about to hit the fan!This is a MMO-game set in the world of wizards of the coast's Dungeons and Dragons world in the area that they call Neverwinter. You start of in a standed ship and from there on you go into the capital of Neverwinter to follow your quest and get new ones. Even though this is just another MMO game set in a medieval era style, it is amazing. I had a lot of fun playing this MMO and I really got the Dungeons and Dragons feel just as I have while playing the normal D&D game. The atmosphere is really good and the controls are easy to understand, for new and for experienced players.The game has also other things that are better than most MMO's. For example in most MMO's you just do your quest and level your character. In D&D Neverwinter you really want to follow the story and you really try to understand what is going on and what you need to do.Another great thing about this game is that the combat is more action-orientated. You do not use a key to switch between your targets, you really have to aim for them before you do your attack. That is in my opinion much better.Next to that, it doesn't really matter if you play this game alone or with friends, one way or another you are going to like this game and you keep playing.This story short: It is amazing so just play this game!"",1"

"11276,Neverwinter,2015.0,""(Hours on Steam are incorrect as I used to play with Perfect Worlds launcher and have at least 300 hours+)I started playing Neverwinter back in open Beta and honestly would have recommended this game to anyone and everyone since I genuinely loved the game back then, I had endless hours of fun and took away a lot of good memories from people I met while playing. The game sadly went to the dogs though after mod 3 release, it became blatantly P2W (Pay to Win) and if you weren't willing to put your hand in your pocket to deck out your character then you better be damned willing to give up having any kind of life of sorts and 100% commit to playing with short breaks because you will need to grind like you've never ginded before and even then it will probably take you months just to get one item out of many that you require to progress through the game.Neverwinter is also very quick to permanently banned your account when you've done nothing wrong (Guild members of mine had to make new accounts and start from scratch) oh and that super rare item from that super rare drop that you apparently just got? Yeah, don't get too excited, it hasn't went into your bag.The customer services suck so don't expect them to help you with anything. So over all? Great game with lots of potential but yeno...

"11285,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Do you like grinding? How about repetitive actions? A cumbersome UI? An unengaging story? A prohibitively expensive in-game cash shop? If these things sound like fun, you'll love Neverwinter.Yes, the game is free to play, but so was Dungeons and Dragons: Eberron Unlimited, and that is a far superior D&D title. Neverwinter fails to reproduce the classic party-based gameplay that the original pen & paper games had, and instead elects to replace them with repetitive and formulaic MMO mechanics.The game looks nice visually, but that's pretty much all it has going for it. It still doesn't look as nice as, say, Guild Wars 2, another MMO that is superior to this game in every way. Granted, Guild Wasr 2 is not entirely free-to-play, but I'd still much rather pay a hefty one-time fee for a quality game than pay nothing for a game that is sub-par).Also, this game seems to favor those who have plenty of time - or are filthy rich - and nobody in between. I really wanted to try the Dragonborn race, for example, but shelling out the $75 USD (!) needed to unlock it was absolutely unreasonable. Yes, I know that there is a currency exchange that allows people to convert in-game currency into the money-bought currency, but no, I do not have the time or the willpower to grind that out.I'll be honest, I did not get anywhere close to the end-game content, nor did I try out the Foundry feature which seemed like an interesting idea, but unfortunately the game did not """"grab"""" me the way I hoped it would and I felt like I was simply wasting my time playing it. There are worse MMO's out there, but I can't understand why anyone would play this game over other, better choices out there, especially since Eberron: Unlimited already exists and is a superior D&D MMO title."",0"
"11286,Neverwinter,2014.0,""i have put 67 hours of my life into just one character and i dont plan on stopping there, the naysayers will call this game pay to win. i respectfully disagree with them. sure you can pay for keys to open lockboxes for a chance at a new mount new enchantments and whatnot, but it doesnt effect your effectiveness in battle. the system is great, i personally play as a rogue and this game makes you feel as though you arent useless. epic loot can be earned after lvl 60 in epic dungeons, and astral diamonds(real ingame cash) can be earned every day all it takes is some dedication. Most other MMO games made me feel like i had to grind to level up, but not so here, quests are the best way to level up and if you like PvP you can earn AD and a LOT of experience. it doesnt force the PvP on you making the noob characters feel more comfortable and less afraid to go out into the wilds. yes some areas are harder for noobs but thats not surprising for an MMO. you can use the auction house to make money or buy some awesome gear, i use it to earn astral diamonds. this game doesnt punish you for F2P and encourages group play as some areas are difficult even @ lvl. most of the things you can buy with Zen and AD (zen being a more expensive in game cash) are companions or special mounts, not gear. also the PvP matches you with players of your rank, making the game fair and up to who knows their class better. i fully reccomend this game to everyone, but more so to those who just want to quest casually and have fun."",1"
"11287,Neverwinter,2015.0,""This game is a lot of fun, but it has probably the most baffling cash shop of any """"f2p"""" mmo ive ever played.

"11291,Neverwinter,2014.0,""This game. Oh where to begin?Well lets start off with some requirements:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------AT LEAST 5 mb/s internet or you will be suffering.- Intel core i3 ddr3-nvidia 600 & Above-Competence-Friends (optional, but the game is much more fun with them)                       These are NOT REQUIRED to play the game                       Only to play it with decent FPS and somewhat decent graphics---------------------------------------------------------------------------------                  The first stages of this game are definately going to be the hardest, mostly due to the lack of tutorials. You have to find things out on your own, but I just cheated and went to the forums!  Once you get past level 15 (The mount level) You're pretty much requried to spend money on this game if you want a soemwhat decent mount. I love supporting games like this, but if it's f2p then it should atleast have some options. 7/10A good timewaster "",1"
"11292,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Some reviewers here have justifiably complained about the need to pay real money to compete in high level PvP play, and I am sure that's true, although I play pretty much entirely PvE.  I'll let you know what I've found in my first few weeks of playing:Almost nothing in the game cannot be gained with enough time and effort.  There are mechanics that allow you to earn """"zen"""" which is the in-game currency you directly get from cash infusions from your bank account.  Maximizing these mechanics will take a great deal of time in and of itself, and even once they are maximized, a player would need to manage a lot of gameplay to earn the zen needed to generate enough zen for an """"epic"""" mount or companion.  For disclosure's sake, I will admit I have put about $60US into the game, all in one primary character who is leveled all the way to 60 and has epic equipment.  I have 3 other characters who are currently leveling up who have received absolutely no financial help from the primary character, nor have they received any form of real-world financial infusion.   And this is the important part: those characters are doing absolutely fine in the PvE world.  Is a level 20 character with no money invested going to be as powerful as a same-level character with 20 or 50 dollars in it? No.  That does not mean the zero dollar character is unable to handle the foes he/she meets in the PvE game.Some hints if you want to play on the cheap: #1 - You can start using """"professions"""" at level 10 or 11.  Use them, in particular the """"leadership"""" profession.  The leadership profession allows you to generate Astral Diamonds (the in-game currency which can be converted to Zen) at a fairly good rate.  All the crafting professions have (at high levels) the ability to create items which can be auctioned for significant amounts of Astral diamonds as well.  Moreover, the professions can easily be managed even when you're not playing the game through a web-browser.  Check in a few times a day, and progress your professions and the levels should build relatively quickly.Hint #2: Lockboxes are for suckers.  Sure, they are one of the ways to get an epic mount/companion right now, but they cost more in Astral Diamonds than they generate on average.  Keys cost 125 or 112.5 (if you buy ten at a time) zen (1.25 or 1.13 usd) to open them, and usually only generate enough astral diamonds to buy back between 60-90% of that.Hint #3: Don't sink large quantities of AD into improving enchantments.  The cost/power ratio you get decreases with each level of enchantment.Hint #4: Epic mounts are not really necessary.  Nice? Sure.  Needed? Not for PvE.Hint #5: Sword Coast Adventures - you can get epic companions with this online function.Hint #6: The foundry- if you're creative, you can generate adventures which can earn you epic mounts/companions.And Hint #7: Try to get by with the best equipment you find in your adventures, and use the Auction House only when you really need something that isn't for sale for silver/gold. Every few levels, you will find equipment better than you could have possibly used before, so save the AD for upgrading your companions/mounts and to perhaps buy an epic set of equipment.For reference: you need 1,550,000 AD to go from a common (free) companion up to an epic one through promotion, or 1,250,000 to go from uncommon (also relatively easy to get with no cash) to epic.  If you haven't been hoarding them, you will find the upgrades very expensive, and you will also discover your companions decrease in usefulness when you don't upgrade them.  Upgrading a mount is even more expensive.If I'd known these hints, the 60usd character I have would have cost me maybe 30, and probably could have been done with a disciplined 20."",1"
"11293,Neverwinter,2014.0,""""""Neverwinter"""" is not really good. It's starts nice, but that's over pretty quickly. You'll see it for yourself if you try it.Oh, and, don't become a Healer. Just... no. You will feel worthless (because your spells do nothing) and uneeded (because everyone has healing AI companions)."",0"
"11294,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I will give this game credit. It's not what I expected.You hear MMORPG and you think of a game based around using huge hotbars full of skills, but that's not waht you get here. It handles more like a 3rd person action game with a small selection of hotkeyed skills that you pick from a larger list of skills (you need to progress to unlock them).The progression feels nicely handled, and combat is fluid. My only gripe with combat is that, at least on the Warlock I started with, you're rooted in place when you attack. This is bad because as a magic user, you're primarily a ranged class, so letting enemies get in close isn't a smart move. However this is somewhat typical of a lot of MMOs, and while it's a bugbear of mine and I'd prefer it to not happen, I've sort of grown used to it from when I played TERA. Enemies in some areas also respwan fairly quickly. I see this as both being good and bad"
"11295,Neverwinter,2013.0,""Note: The review has been updated to include the """"Campaigns"""" content.Neverwinter is an MMO by Perfect World Entertainment. This allows us to predict two things:1. The amount of cash required will be huge.2. The classes will be split into the usual healer\tank\damage-dealer arch-types.Starting out, you'll get to pick your race between all the usual D&D races, and have a choice of class. This confirms suspicion #2 in that there is the """"Devout Cleric"""" (healer) """"Guardian Fighter"""" (tank) and a bunch of other classes (damage-dealers).You'll have an option between the """"Control Wizard"""" which deals a lot of damage from a distance, has the ability to crowd-control multiple enemies, throw enemies off cliffs (which is invaluable at high-level dungeons, as it's an instant-kill) and is very very squishy. The main job of this class (apart from throwing enemies off ledges) is to keep the adds controlled while the tank kites and the rogue attacks the boss.The """"Great Weapons Fighter"""" which is a berserker with a two-handed weapon. Standard front-line damage-dealer. This class can either target the boss or the adds, depending on equipment and the specific boss in question.The """"Trickster Rogue"""" who relies on stealth for solo-play and does single-target damage in dungeons. This class's main job is to kill the bosses.The """"Hunter Ranger"""" who, frankly, has the most interesting combat as he has twice as many attacks. Appears to be a hybrid of the rogue and the wizard. The hunter ranger is able to switch between melee and ranged stance at any time, and each of his skills behaves differently depending on which stance he uses. The skills also have separate cooldowns for each of the stances.Combat is simple in this game: you have two """"At Will"""" attacks (much akin to auto-attacks) which are bound to the left and right mouse buttons by default. Those do not have cooldown, though they can have charges.You then have three """"Encounter"""" skills, which are basically active skills. Mapped to QER by default.Lastly, you have a """"Daily"""" power, which is a horrible name for it since you can use it pretty often"
"11296,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Read the most helpful reviews for better insight for this game. Played NW with a couple of great friends but had to bail out on the game after reaching the max level. Post-game content is pay-to-win, hands down. Loved the journey up until 60 but was no longer worth it after that."",0"
"11297,Neverwinter,2014.0,""just another pay2win game. and from all the terrible reviews, i don't know why i even downloaded the game. why can't steam just get the original neverwinter nights 1 & 2 games in there store so we can pay once and just enjoy like in the good old days?"",0"
11298,Neverwinter,2014.0,Really fun game until you reach max level (60). Then when you queue up for Dungeons your gearscore is too low. So the game forces you to spend money to buy better armor using REAL MONEY. This is a Pay to Win game.,0
"11299,Neverwinter,2014.0,""It works fine as a free to play. keep in mind there are some pay walls that although grindable, would take many months.- you will never have a fast mount (60% inc is the base)- you will never have the best item enhancements (yours will be half as good, approx.)- it's pay to win.. do not pvp unless you are paying or enjoy getting 1 shot.The game itself has a kind of consol feel about it with only 8 or so spells on your action bar, which are players choice, but it's not much and gets repetitive fast. It takes about 30 hours to get to max level, then due to the 'daily' system for the 4 high level zones (where you unlock better gear and harder dungeons) it will take a month or two to catch up to seasoned players.Character roles are a bit odd compared to other mmo's, if you are good you can do the first lvl 60 epic dungeons without a tank or healer, even at high level the healer is more for buffing the other players than actually keepin them alive, i.e. not a vital part of the team. the tank has the same issue with none tanks able to go off soloing in dungeons. It gives the game an easy feel, with little need for teamwork, just button mashing. You dont need allot of skill to play, just either allot of time, or more commonly, money.It's still good fun, it's just this game doesnt go anywhere, there is no sense of accomplishment. You will reach a point where you dont want to pay real money for next upgrade, and the time to get it by grinding dungeons/mobs/trading is just too great to be considered worthwhile or at the very least, enjoyable."",1"
"11300,Neverwinter,2013.0,""To be fair you can get through the vast majority of the game upto levl 60 without spending a penny in real money. I only started thinking I may need to buy items at a much later stage in the game as pvp at level 60 is pretty hard and its cleara lot of the guys have paid stuff which gives them a massive advantage. However I pvpd right upto to 60 on a competitive level with armour and weapons gained freely. Neverwinter is a enjoyable game if you are willing to put the time into it, its not one of them games you can dip into for 1 hour and expect to be drawn in Crafting your characer will take considerable time and effort and in some cases doing tedious quests over and over. Its a very in depth game with lots of angles too many infact but in a way that gives the game a long life span as there is always something new to do. Graphically the game is quite nice but can get laggy on even the best of pcs (most likely due to server congestion) overall I would recommend people try this game but be prepared to put more than a few hours into it to see its ful potential."",1"
"11301,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Neverwinter is a game that has me halting between to opinions. There are some really good parts about this game, but also some not so good or just plain bad. Let's start of on a positive note.The good!:It is a really fun MMORPG with a cool and dynamic combat system that makes you dodge, run around and use your abilities without them having very long cooldowns. This, in combination with the relatively easy and straigthforward quests, makes you feel like a god amongst men. Hacking and slashing your way through clearly inferior enemies with awesome attacks and skills that are animated beatifully gives a cool kick. I don't mind the easy quests either. They'll take you to a wide variety of area's and dungeons, really making you feel like a badass adventurer. The gear in the game is absolutely beautiful, which for me is very important. It does matter a bit if you are wearing a """"set"""" of armor that makes all the pieces look good together. But even when leveling up and wearing rags the gear looks very cool.The not so good:As a casual gamer myself and trying to do some endgame a few flaws in the game come to the surface. The endgame dungeons are buggy as hell. If you do not have a guild or a full party that you can run dungeons with you are bound to use the game's queuing system (which works quite well actually). More often than not you will find yourself on a long dragging dungeon attempt that is usually about trying to exploit the dungeon's bugs in order to skip as many enemies as possible with people that don't seem to care if you die or not. None of the enemies really have any cool game mechanics, they just hit harder or faster than the last guy. I havent really had any boss fights that I found intriguing. Some of them were hard, yes. But that was just due to the enemy having a ridiculous amount of hitpoint and/or hitting very hard. I have not really had any fun in endgame dungeons yet.The bad:The game is published by Perfect world which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. The game of course is Free To Play, which means that Perfect World will have you try to spend money on it at every turn you take (or atleast that is how I feel) because they have to make money somehow. The game has two main currencies : Astral diamonds and Zen. Both of these currencies can be traded for one another. Almost all the epic gear in the game is Bind on Equip, which means that you can buy all of this gear for enormous amounts of diamonds. For people playing this game full time it is not a problem getting this gear and selling it, but for the casual gamer it can be frustrating to get to these incredible amounts of diamonds without spending any money on it. I guess this all makes perfect sense for someone who is at peace with this system and will probably go """"yeah, so what?"""". For me it is really an uncool feeling. I feel that the best gear in the game should only be available for the ones who have completed certain content and have really earned it. For me this feels like Pay to Win. Combine this with the buggy endgame dungeons and the games endgame feels like a letdown.Besides that, the game makes you pay ridiculous amounts for what I call """"comfort items"""". Items you do not need to complete the game but make your life ingame so much more easy. Things like a big bag (8 euro's in Zen!!) and fasts mounths (40 euro's in Zen!!) are just incredibly overpriced. These are not microtransactions but you end up paying as much for a fast mount as you would for a legal copy of Guild wars 2 during it's release. Just plain robbery. Of course you can always farm the required diamonds ingame but for a casual gamer that isn't really an option.All in all it looks like Perfect World is trying to benefit from the casual gamer with a job that has no time to play the game full time but has plenty of money to spend on it. Since I am in that categoty I feel a bit exploited by the game.My advice!:Go play Neverwinter! The combat system and the cool area's will give you much fun leveling up. The game really feels complete with cool loot drops and giving you new gear almost every level you gain.Think twice about really endgaming Neverwinter. The endgame dungeon's are buggy and hard for casuals. The game feels really repetative after spending some time at the max level.Rating:+Cool Combat system+Feel like a god amongt men+Nice area, plenty to explore+Very cool skills/attacks and animations for all characters-Everything for sale-Hard for casuals to farm enough diamonds-Feels like pay to win sometimes-Comfort items really expensive-Buggy and repetative endgameAll in all I would score this MMORPG 7 out of 10.Give it a try!"",1"
"11302,Neverwinter,2013.0,""I'm a complete newbie to playing this sort of game and I absolutely love it! Customising your character, their history & powers at the start is  really cool, there's lots of scope to upgrade you're weapons & abilities as you play. For the newbie like myself the in-game voiceover help when it's time to upgrade a weapon or perform a new move/strike is really useful. The landscape design is amazing"
"11303,Neverwinter,2013.0,""Fun action-rpg. Outfit designs generally look pretty good, gameplay is smooth. My complaints are that being free-to-play, the company running the game go a bit overboard on putting things in the game that you feel obligated to spend real money to aquire zen to buy, such as workers to make professions somewhat useful.  Also, there are alot of exploits in dungeons, yet the company seems to ignore most of that and ban people for much more minor offenses. I was even banned for botting because i played the game for 14 hours straight, doing nothing wrong otherwise and it took days to get the account unbanned due to a very bad customer support system (if you are banned, you cannot login to the website to update support tickets, so you must send a totally new ticket and note that it regards an existing ticket, and hope they read it rather than marking it as duplicate).Moral of the story: love the game, hate the company behind it."",1"
"11304,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Just started this game today and to be honest I wasn't really impressed. So far it's not really a BAD game per say, it's just it seems so... Dull for me. The """"Action"""" combat isn't all that actiony. Not like other games such as Dragon Nest or TERA.For me one of the main aspects of a game is the fun gameplay. Neverwinter simply did not thrill me. I dislike how you cannot move while doing a skill or attack. What is the point of a action game if you cant be active while fighting? Combat seems very clunky. I stress that this is just my personal opinion, as numerous others love the combat in this game, It's just not for me.On top of which, as many others have posted previously, the game is heavily Pay2Win as levels progress. While I may not have witnessed this first hand, I have seen overpriced mounts, and the obvious gap between paying players and average ones. Boss mechanics consist of mostly Cone / AOE  then spawn Adds. Repeat process as difficulty """"increases."""" Really all it is doing is repeating the cycle, as there aren't much more mechanics than that. Check Youtube videos, it's obvious.Don't get me wrong, while I may be picking at these features, this is just what personally put ME off from the game. There are some players that play into endgame and never pay a dime. While it's obviously harder for them, If you truely like this game or the combat, then you really don't have to pay a cent. It's just annoying how much of an advantage paying DOES give you. Overall I think this is a decent game to pass the time as leveling is somewhat enjoyable if you enjoy the combat, but if you're looking for interesting endgame, an """"equal"""" F2P experience, and genre changing mechanics, then look somewhere else."",0"
"11305,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Although the game is still going through some changes by releasing more stuff for you to buy, but I find many faults.  The most used classes are anything BUT archers.  (Trust me, I'm using one, and it's terrible.)  Most of the skills you're using are good to use, however, they're the only the best after level 10, the skills afterwards, or points you use, is weak and useless, even in Melee, it's just as bad by not inflicting damage, no matter how great your runes or armor, even weapon is.  The thing is, and what is making the genre of MMO's fail, is instead of fixing these problems, they instead turn to releasing more stuff for you to purchase and getting those isn't cheap either, for a new class, it's around $60.  This is what I'm finding the hugest fault in MMO gaming, (and Maplestory does way better at fixing this by being told there's problems and they have over 15 classes already I think.)  I will give it some credit to gaming art, story and very unique worlds, however, there are so many problems, some of the dungeons are terribly crafted in terms of boss fights (Grast the Gutwhatever is the main issue..), the tracking system does go out of whack, no safe paths when you want to avoid enemies just to go back to the NPC without the pain and hassle of taking on more enemies, that YOU just killed three minutes ago.. and the level cappage is just.. *sigh* (And there are enemies that are above the cappage, when you're still 60.  How the hell does that make sense and way tougher than you, PW?!)It's good if you want some uniqueness, but really, PW, you were doing fine with Perfect World, what the hell happened here?!  Did you just not care anymore?  Did you just fart the idea and packed it up cutely just so we won't detect the smell?  If you really want us to have a good time here, don't just whaft out stingy and halfâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥junk just so you can suck it out of us.  If you are rich and time to spare, have at it, because somehow this is just not well thought out and properly done that literally puts D&D, Wizards of the Coast in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥box.  Back to the paper and dice I go if that were the case."",0"
"11306,Neverwinter,2014.0,""the story-line was alright, but not really that engaging, it's pwe game so its p2w. the character creation is basic, classes are basic, with very limited weapon and armor selection."",0"
"11307,Neverwinter,2013.0,""This game is alright and all, but it seriously lacks some major points in a MMORPG. The karaoke content is too low, and I can't even jam out to my favorite 80's songs while slaying orcs. Please improve this game accordingly."",1"
"11308,Neverwinter,2014.0,""If you like Dungeons and Dragons or fantasy RPG's and MMO's, you might want to give this a try for the first ten levels. It's kind of fun for about that long, until the payment scheme sets in and you realize how hard it's going to be to continue on improving your gear and such without spending actual money. I spent real money on Cryptic/PWE's Star Trek Online, and if you've played any of their games before this isn't anything much different in terms of paying for flash mostly. As a general rule, I don't spend much money on these games unless they really appeal to me in some way. Ironically, this game is much better than STO in all the ways you'd want and expect it to be, but in the end, I wasn't moved enough to want to spend any money on this world. The Neverwinter backdrop is there still, but it's so different from the Neverwinter I remember that it seems little more than an heir in name alone. This could be any fantasy world. I enjoyed my character's special abilities, but meh. Give it a try, you might feel differently. I can't say much about advanced game content or what you actually get after spending real cash--the difference it makes and all. No great surprises here, good or bad. Due to security concerns over PWE's failure to properly secure customer information and their failure to notice a major incursion and/or notify the public in a timely fashion, I wouldn't purchase anything from them directly. EVER. Will Steam fall? Not will, but when... but why spread your information around in more places than necessary? That's my two cents. Enjoy."",1"
"11309,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Pros - -Straightforward gameplay, follow the ground glitter and 95% of the time, you will find where you have to go for a quest.-Really fun quests and storyline.-Breathtaking sceanery, that bridge in the ice is what?-No new abilties every level, (unlike many other MMOs) pick what you like and improve what you like AND no full hotbar for every ability you only have 3 slots (4 for wizard). So how you play changes depending on which ability set you slot.-Most vetern players are friendly and willing to help new players learn content. (Some are elietist who kick you for being new, but most are more helpful.)-Foundry community makes some of the most fun adventures EVER! (Shoutout to [Tired of being the Hero].)Cons - -Pay To Win, If you want any chance at endgame, you gotta shell out money for Zen to buy weapon and armor enchantments, enchantment improvements, and stronger companions. Yes you can farm the Astral Diamonds and use that to buy Zen, but if nobody is selling Zen you are stuck waiting or struggling on content that is beyond your gear.-Game constantly advertises someone winning rare lockbox loot. """"Player:(LuckyDude) won a [Shiny Unicorn mount) from [IceCrystalGemMetal Lockbox]."""" as if it is always trying to get you to try your luck...~LIKE A CASINO~-End Game Content (Icewind Dale for me) was VERY long to reach, had to do daily quests for over a month to unlock it.-Account security is only as good as your ability to not use the same login/password elsewhere. (yes, I failed this and logged in to see my character emptied out.)-Admins / customer service type very good english but are not the brightest tools. (lost all equipment and entire inventory and 400,000 Astral Diamonds and ~200 Zen. Everything recovered but BUT AD and Zen. 3 more tries were made, but nothing else was returned.

I was a payign customer of Neverwinter, I put my own hard earned money into the game and I got banned for reasons that are completly unreasonable.The game is so repetative after level 70 that well it leaves you wonderign why, why do I even play this game.

As soon as I got into the actual world there was constant spamming in chat of deals to get ingame currency.

"11314,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Neverwinter was able to hold my interest to a lasting degree, something that no other MMO has. Between the rich lore and the dynamic, quick combat system, it is much more accessible and interesting than, say, WoW. The freemium status doesn't hurt either, and the classes are fun and varied, with regular updates.That said, it is more interesting to play when you have a buddy to watch your back and level up with you."",1"
"11315,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Downloaded the game 3 days ago, and now I have 30+ hours of playtime on Neverwinter. It's THAT addictive.The game is great!

Based on what I have found on my 30 hours of gameplay, let me show you my pros/cons.Important Notes:-This game is not P2W like many say, you can go along fine playing for free, just steer clear of the PvP arena, the P2W players will be there.-Game is in english...Pros:-Great questing system, and trackfinder.-Combat is great!-Lots of people always online, you'll probably never go into an instance and find that you're the only one there.-Lots of content-Amazing graphics for a free game, can lower/higher at will.-Engaging.-Can spend HOURS on this game and not get bored.-Many dungeons, can spend hours playing with friends in a dungeon and have a great time there.-There's a bit of secret bosses, places, etc you can find in a dungeon.Cons:-You can only get 1 basic mount, then you'd have to either wait till an event comes or buy it with zen.-Astral Diamonds --> Zen is at a very low exchange rate.-Lots of stuff in the game, the AD and Zen are overpriced.-Mods speak in a different language than english. (For all you englishmen)-The damn dropboxes get annoying, you get the same thingo over and over again, and you can't open it without zen.Summary:The game's great for first-time RPG players to try and get a taste of things, and you could really have fun in this game. But to achieve true potential of this game, you'd need to grab a few bucks out of your wallet to really make your character stand a chance in those PvP arenas.

"11317,Neverwinter,2015.0,""Its a fun run of the mill mmo, slash'em up game. If your a hardcore D&D fan then im sure you'll find lots to hate, considering lore, and gameplay. Otherwise its a HUGE pay-to-play. The gold you get ( wich has the copper, silver, gold system) will only buy you the low level items, and some potions. The astral diamonds are used to buy better items, decent mounts, and deccent companions, but can only be gained through special task, such as daily missions. These are pains to do and in the end its usually not worth the work. The zen, a.k.a. the money you but with real money, is used to get the advantage while going anything. That means buying good items, good mounts, and good companions. All of these things being pretty important. Its such a pay to play, that all of the steam DLC's cost $450.

"11320,Neverwinter,2014.0,""First off I need to say I am a huge Dungeons and Dragons fan. I have been since Baldur's gate and the original SSI Goldbox PC games. So, I jumped at the chance to play an MMO of my favorite setting and world. I have not been disappointed at all. If you are hardcore into Faerun lore and enjoy a good D&D themed setting and action MMO combat, then this is the place for you.I've been playing this game nonstop since early June of this year (review written at the end of August). Module 4 has just been released and I am enjoying it a lot. A lot of people say this game is """"pay to win"""" and I simply have to say that this is not true. yes, you can buy all the best gear from the in game auction house because most gear is """"bind on use"""" instead of """"bind on pickup,"""" so if you don't have use for a drop that you win you can sell it on the AH. This, being a free to play game, does have a cash shop, but except for some companions and the more expensive packs (dragonborn pack and hero of the north pack) you cannot buy """"power."""" Everything is either cosmetic or utility.One thing I will say is that this game is very solo friendly. Even if you put real money into buying things in this game it is still a grind heavy game. You'll be grinding for weeks (and in some cases months) to get what you want. I personally really enjoy it as it gives me something to always do. The grinds feel involving and fun to me. Each of the different campaigns offers you ways to permanently increase the power of your character over time. The daily areas also have solo dungeons that end in an epic boss fight, so each time you do them it still feels pretty epic, even if you already know what to expect.Leveling in Neverwinter feels more like a typical MMO setup than D&D, but the D&D flavor is still there in everything. The stories are involved and there are several solo dungeons that you'll do in each zone as you're leveling up. These provide an epic single player experience and some of them can be quite challenging (Rime Fang, I'm looking at you). The zones in Neverwinter are somewhat gated and not open world in the slightest. If you've ever played Neverwinter Nights 2 for PC they feel a lot like that. Leveling speed is relatively fast. I was able to reach max level (60) on my first character within 3 weeks. This is an MMO that I will be playing for a very long time. End game group content is a lot of fun and quite challenging. The largest group you'll ever need for anything is 5 people as raiding has not been added to this game yet. However I do have to say one thing bad about this game. DO NOT USE THE IN GAME GROUPFINDER OR LFR CHANNEL TO FIND END GAME GROUPS! The game is unfortunately full of exploiters and gear score elitists that are very very unfriendly towards new players. BUT, there is something you can do! Join the channel /NW_legit_community and form your end game groups in that channel. Sure it might take a while to form a group, but you'll be with the best Neverwinter has to offer. This channel welcomes new players and helps them learn. This channel doesn't care about your gearscore. As long as its high enough to queue for the dungeon that is good enough to get a group in this channel. Its basically the only place outside of my guild that I will form dungeon delves with. The community is entirely player moderated and has been very successful for me. I was lucky that I found that channel shortly after I started playing.My name is Sharastrix@zshikara in game. Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have."",1"

Of course it takes forever to get items you normally would pay for without real money, but you can if you try hard enough, and it's cool. Did I mention that it's free? :)"",1"
"11328,Neverwinter,2015.0,""Excellent gameplay and decent graphics, PvE can be a grind but party up with a friend and its fun as can be. The endgame was decent but it did feel like a lot of quest grinding but there were still dungeons, skirmishes, raids etc to spice up said grind. I hear that its a pay to win but i have to say that i disagree, you can run with stuff that you find in the campaigns and wind up decimating in PvP, there are only a few things that you can pay for to buff your toons and some of them you can get in-game with luck and a lot of patience. As you can see from my hours played, i've dedicated a lot of my time to this game but its not something that you HAAAVEEE to play all day everyday but once you get into it, its hard to stop. I definately reccomend this and aye if u wanna play with me, i just started a couple new toons on my @juiip account so add me"",1"

"11330,Neverwinter,2013.0,""Wow, umm, well I spent 10 minutes trying to create an account, or lookup my old Star Trek Online account info, or sign in to the old Cryptic account, and did several attempts to recover, send my password, etc, etc, blah, blah, and finally gave up. Signing up for a new game shouldn't be this much trial & error & annoyance so I gave up. might try again next week if I have absolutely *NOTHING* else to play. Gotta say, not impressed. After the huge epic fail that was Star Trek Online, I'm just not motivated to jump through their hoops to play Neverwinter."",0"
"11331,Neverwinter,2013.0,""I can't recommend this so far. It looks fun, but can't play it.I've tried to make three accounts with perfect world and each was instantly banned. I've never been banned from anything steam related. How does one get banned for just signing up? No confirmation email was ever received. No replies from the company support department. Further, on their website they have an option for reporting banned accounts, but you can't sign in if your account is banned. It is like they don't want anyone to play the game.I've had a lot of fun playing the more dated D&D online."",0"
"11332,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I picked up Neverwinter expecting to scratch the MMO itch with a mediocre example of the genre, and instead found an enduringly fun /game/.  It is fast-paced, with good character customizability once you get past the extreme specificity of the available six classes.  The integrated web-based gateway makes managing professions, companions, and even your inventory a breeze, and while it is a free-to-play, the in-game store is integrated in such a way that most of the ways it seems to interfere are ultimately optional.  The 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons branding is a bonus to fans of the tabletop RPG, but are not so prevalent as to harm the enjoyment of others.  Highly recommended!  Four out of five stars."",1"
"11333,Neverwinter,2017.0,""I have logged way too many hour into this in the last few days that it's probably not healthy. I love it. I'm addicted, and I haven't spent a penny. True, there's probably some things that would benefit from the actual buying of the in-game currency, but you can earn it from doing other stuff. It takes longer, of course, but not as long as other MMOs that I've tried. But you don't /need/ those things to play. You can have just as much fun without them. There's plenty of events, tons of guilds for any playing level, and I find the party system here much easier for people like me who are playing solo. Also, if you don't want to PVP, you don't have to, but there are also a ton of great rewards if you do. And dragons! Who doesn't love dragons?"",1"
"11334,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I played this alot before the game came to steam and some after.Levling is fun to a point. The quests, dungeons and various adventures to be had is quite entertaining really. Some of the quests are even unique and more innovative than other MMO's. Definitely some great ideas here.However, If you want to be somewhat serious/hardcore, be prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of real cash.If you look at the prices of DLC packages for this game, you will get a hint of what im talking about, and the costs for some things are insane.P2W factor is strong within this game, the amount of paywalls are an insult to the entire f2p genre.I do recommend this game for a quick party/LAN/Coop play, but definitely not for serious hardcore mmo gamers.I mean, who even pays 189,99â‚¬ for a DLC. 420,94â‚¬ if you want all the DLC's, thats insane.Would rather have a monthly fee..."",0"

11337,Neverwinter,2016.0,I freaking love this game. I wouldn't call myself a huge gamer but this is one of a few games I can sit and play for hours at a time. Being able to play this RPG solo and with friends is great. I love the story too.,1
"11338,Neverwinter,2013.0,""Incredible graphics. No FPS drops. Fun Gameplay. Innovative ideas. Very smooth combat. Having played many mmo's in the past, this has to be the best free one.

"11339,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Not the worst. I've played it before, and by far its not the worst mmo, but not the best. I personally cant recommend it because after a while of playing (non steam version) the launcher bugged, and made it impossible to play."",0"
"11340,Neverwinter,2013.0,""This review is long and indepth. Here is the short half in case you don't want to read: This game is  absolute TRASH. This game is absolute trash. Not like that wasn't to be expected though. This game was developed by Cryptic afterall... and I couldn't be sadder about it. Cryptic managed to purchase the rights to NWN from Obsidian. (Here's some food for thought: Whose worse? Cryptic for buying the rights to an damn good series, or Obsidian for actually selling it to these shmucks?).Where do I begin... I remember downloading this game for two reasons, and two reasons alone: One was so I could play with a friend (This didn't work out though), and two because I wanted the right to rip this game a new â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. So let's begin, shall we?Now I want to begin by game play... ever played Champions Online? What about DDO? If you played both you're probably nodding your head. Basically, cryptic took the play style from both games and smashed them together repeadtly. If you don't get what I'm talking about here's a good way to describe it: Hit M1 a lot and use WASD. That's about it, you spam the button and then your character does stuff... yup. You get some abilities and you can press buttons and there is some skill trees like they have in champs but it's mostly like DDO.Speaking of the Champions Online relationship... I must say Cryptic, you gave me quite a laugh. One of the first missions of them game was to help soldiers that have fallen. The hilarious part is that they reused the same """"Help! I'm a fallen soldier"""" animationf rom Champions online. You click a body the same type of """"Interacting"""" bar comes up just like in champions. Now I know it's not fair to compare this game to Bethesda games but let's take a look at Fallout and Elderscrolls. Notice how yes they are indeed very similar and they run on the same engines... but they still put an effort to make a very different game. The animations are not the same, the skills are entirely different from one another, even the textures and models for characters are quite different despite the fact that they use the same face slider. They went out of their way to make a difference. These guys? hardly. I laughed even harder when I saw NWN2 icons REUSED for this game. The word """"effort"""" is not in Cryptics vocabulary clearly. I haven't played too much of it but it wouldn't suprised me if they blatantly reapplied stuff from their other games to this current. Oh wait they already did. Some of the hairstyles used from NWN2 are altered/make a direct reappearnce in this game. Effort please?Moving on from Cryptics more than apparent lack of effort... the story is terrible and I hate all the characters. You will too. I don't have too much to say on them other than it's dumb, they sound dumb and I tried hard to ignore what they were saying after the first person spoke. Yeah it's bad. I'm actually horribly bothered that this game thinks it has the right to be considerded a sequel to NWN2, which was a mediocre game. Championswinter Nights: Online is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ game, to put it bluntly. You're better off not wasting your time with this. Instead you should see if you can get a copy of Neverwinter Nights: Diamond Edition. One of the last few good games that BIoware had ever made before Neverwinter Nights and Bioware both got molested by bad companies. This game is a symbol of so much bad I could almost cry.-2/10Someone please buy the rights to Neverwinter Nights from Perfectworld/Cryptic? You'd be doing a good series a much needed favor."",0"

11343,Neverwinter,2014.0,Neverwinter is like free copy of WoW with stats of Pathfinder. Levels are almost the same. Bosses are stronger strong mobs (except the final ones) but its fun to play. I like to play player-maded campaigns and like the companion and spell system. I'm currently playing Warlock and i hate that i have no AoE spells except the 3rd basic attack. If you have lot of freetime and dont want to pay for WoW this is the best thing you can do.,1
11344,Neverwinter,2014.0,This is just about the worst D&D product ever. I cannot think of a worse representation of the game and wish this never would have happened to the D&D franchise. WoTC should hang their heads in shame and I would think Mr. Gygax (God rest his soul) is turning in his grave.,0
11345,Neverwinter,2013.0,Well already having a account i thought i try but every time i ask for my password the page don't have a button to click so i cannot submit to get a new password..  Noticed their main pages have security holes too so be aware.So at this time i do not reconmend it.,0

"11347,Neverwinter,2016.0,""Alot of people on here saying this is a pay to win game, but i disagree. Ive played this game a long time and dont really feel the need to constantly spend money to get the best gear in the game, I play the game like many other people for the enjoymentand to help friends.Having the top gear in the game would be nice but it definately isnt needed to get enjoyment out this game.All the people saying it is pay to win obviously dont realise that the people putting alot of money into the game actually helps you if you dont want to put any money into the game. Its keeping the game alive, Its allowing you to trade ingame currency (AD) to the premium currency (zen).Just because you cant or wont put alot of time into the game doesnt mean its pay to win, and you cant expect everything to be handed to you on a plate you have to earn it.The main problem i have with the game is the constant requirement to grind out some of the content like with the new Sea of moving ice mod they added recently, having to fish constantly seems like they picked one of the most boring less liked tasks within the game, changed it so it was harder to catch the fish and made it so it was mandatory to do, i think that was a big mistake,"",1"
"11348,Neverwinter,2015.0,""NOTE:Pls Read about Elemental Evil more down in my Review as i can only recommend the Game until LVL 60!The Game itself is like WoW on many Terms as both are based on DnD Pan and Paper Game.However Neverwinter has (in my Opinion) the actual better Fighting System because it doesnt feel as Stiff as the WoW one because you get Feedback on Crits and the Characters actually do attack faster its hard to explain.On the F2P/P2W Aspect i can say it is like in many other Games.You CAN have everything free if you:1) Have no actual Life and play 16h per day.2)Accept that you will never have the Gear to be good at PVP (but you are gonna be good enough for Raids and Stuff)3)Have Sense for Economy and trade Stuff to make profit (its not really that easy but i read about it but i honestly never tried that.Also you can get the Premium Currency called """"ZEN"""" for free as Exchange for  """"Astral Diamonds"""".These Astral Diamonds are the Currency for the Ingame Market and Auction House,so basically everything besides the Premium Items.These Diamonds you can aquire by:1)Completing  Daily Quests.2)Trading Items to other Players for Astral Diamonds.3)Buying ZEN with real Money and exchange them for Astral Diamonds (Thats the way to speed up getting actual decent PVP Gear.4) Opening Chests with  Keys you can aquire from Premium Store for a little amount of ZEN(sometimes yields more Astral Diamonds if you sell these Items but its quite a gamble.Having these points said the Game is pretty similar to WoW but i prefer it due to the more responsive fighting System and the PVE Quests are more obvious when it comes to moving from one Area to another(in WoW i actually had to google to which area i had to go next cause there was no followip Quest)Also all the Expansions in Neverwinter are free so if you dont wanna play PVP ever you can enjoy this basically for free.~~~~~~UPDATE on LVL 60+ Content introduced in Elemental Evil Expansion~~~~~Sometime ago there was the Module(Module = Expansion in Neverwinter) 6 introduced to the Game called Elemental Evil.Many Players looked forward to this Expansion,but unfortunately i must say it isnt that good.That is mainly because Cryptic (the Game developer) added new Areas to the Game,which is always a nice thing, but these areas are recycled from the old ones and only contain the typical generic MMORPG Quests.Also to make things slower you have to complete 3 Times 16 Quests for each Area but you can only have 4 Quests at once.And these Quests are very boring so i dont recommend this Stuff.Also the Levelcap was raised with this Module from 60 to 70.Many players expected new Endgame Content to come because of that but Cryptic just recycled the old Areas to Level 70 and every Player has to grind his old Sets again which makes many Players leave the Game and i can honestly understand that.So overall i would give this module  a thumb down but as the game itself to lvl 60 is still very enjoyable i will leave it at that but i cant recommend trying to get through these Quests its not worth the effort."",1"

Those who have can solo a dungeon a few levels above their own, and those that haven't paid, can't even run fast enough to keep up with these powerhouses slaughtering everything as they blaze through the encounter.

"11363,Neverwinter,2014.0,""This company Discriminates against steam players.  They offer rewards to people that use their arc system or their own website despite offering their game on STEAM.  People on steam pay just as much money and shouldn't be discriminated against.  If this company doesn't want people to use steam then don't put the game on steam.  Frankly they should show more appreciation as I personally would have never installed this game if it was not on steam.   I have spent more money than I ever should have but the game was enjoyable until the discrimination became extremely apparent.  Contacting their customer service is a joke, as all they do is respond with something that looks pre-determined.  Even after being """"escalated"""" I still got no satisfactory resolution, which I either wanted the promo piece that everyone I know got or a refund of the money I transferred (in came zen that is NOT spent) to get the item.  So far they don't seem to want to help which officially makes these people disloyal to customers who do spend money.  In case someone reads this and thinks I am complaining for no reason, the people that got the reward are people who transferred money into zen and transferred it into neverwinter.  The fact that I use steam shouldn't matter since I have spent 200+ dollars since December on this game and others i'm sure have too and those of us who use steam didn't get it and are being effectively punished for being steam users.  I call for all steam players to boycott this game.  This company only used steam to get more players as no one would hardly be playing otherwise and yet they refuse to extend the same rewards to steam players that they give others."",0"

11365,Neverwinter,2016.0,If you're not looking to play hardcore this is a great game.

"11369,Neverwinter,2014.0,""In this review I'm mainly going to focus on the free2play/pay2win aspect of the game.I'm writing this as reaction to all the misinformation and outright bull**** spread around by clueless inviduals who gave up on the game the second someone with better gear made them feel inferior to the core, resulting in them calling Neverwinter PAY2WIN ever since.Let me state it right off the bat. There's nothing, and I mean nothing in this game that can't be obtained by just playing - and it doesn't even take crazy long to get your character into elite gear either.But you're not limited to just weapons and armor - all cosmetics, mounts, pets, literally everything is at your disposal without spending a penny.The game features a currency exchange system between Astral Diamonds (the game's primary currency, among others also used by Auction House, where you can get pretty much everything) and Zen (premium currency used in Zen store, aka cash shop).There's no limit to how much you can exchange and you can do it both ways, so once you start running epic dungeons or find any other way to earn AD, you can get yourself whatever your heart desires, leaving your wallet untouched.So it's all up to you. Sure, you can spend cash to speed up your progress in getting things if you want, but it's most definitely not a necessitty. I've never spent a cent myself, yet all my characters are in the ultimate gear, riding the fastest mounts, and it's not a rare sight that I get called a """"casher"""" by people who don't know their way around the game yet and blindly believe you can't get the best stuff without paying. Those are the same people who eventually ditch the game and end up writing ZOMG P2W reviews over here in their bliss ignorance.TL"
11370,Neverwinter,2014.0,An awesome MMORPG with lots of potential but can sadly be repetitive.  It updates all the time which means you have to wait ages for it to patch before you actually play it.Pros:Good GraphicsLots of questsLots of enemies to killFunCons:RepetitiveUpdates all the timeConstantly bugged to pay for stuffThe same stuff over and over againNothing like the trailer,1

"11372,Neverwinter,2017.0,""I love Dungeons & Dragons RPGs, this game uses the most edition i like from D&D, the 4ed, it have a great forgotten realm adventure focused on neverwinter city, and its PvP is also fun to play."",1"

"11374,Neverwinter,2014.0,""If you want a direct translation of D&D rules to an MMO, this definitely ain't it. But if you're looking for a fun story-based game that doesn't force partying and has a ton of content to offer, then you'll probably find a lot to like here.The only downside is it locks races like the Drow Elves and Dragonkin behind a pay wall, which admittedly sucks but wasn't a deal breaker for me."",1"

"11379,Neverwinter,2014.0,""It's rare to find an MMO that has unique combat system. However, Many times while you're playing, this game will ask you to spend real cash to progress certain traits (Companion level, Finish a task in 5 min, etc.). Thus, draining my interest at a constant rate. The customization is extremely limited. Your gears will look exactly the same as everyone around the same level unless you slide your credit card. The only thing that makes your character unique is your face. In the market, all horses are at the same state except the free one (you could always pay 2 million astral dimonds to upgrade its trait (around $40). The only outstanding horses are avalible at in-game shop (Real Cash only shop), and the lowest price I saw was around $20. I understand that the developer can't make money with freeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but $20 to make traveling 0.5 second faster is down right outrages. The mission is pretty much the same: """"kill something 10 times"""", """"Kill something else 20 more times"""",""""Do similar missions two more times and fight a boss, a boring boss fight with no strategy but to """"kill it until its health reaches zero"""". The missions made by players are the only thing that made a different in this game. Players themselves can do a better job than the developer to give us entertainment. Overall, avoid unless you want to donate some cash to """"Perfect World Entertainment"""" You'll probably get a free horse or â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing astral diamond for it. No matter what you do, you will never be a decent player if you're a free-player."",0"

The graphics are awesome, but my pc freezed up a couple of times because of all the players in one area, which was annoying. Don't call it a Dungeons & Dragons game if there is nothing D&D about it, other than setting up your character and dice rolls. That's it. It's another Runescape game, which was also really stupid. Also, I want a damn horse and I couldn't get that because the stupid quests they give didn't pay enough. Speaking of quests, those were dumb. Don't waste your time and memory for this game.

"11392,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I am never a great fan of the 4th edition mechanics in Dungeons and Dragons but, Neverwinter has managed to convience me that it works as an action RPG in a persistant MMO setting.Neverwinter is strongly based on the Neverwinter lore and it brings together a mixture of traditional fantasy MMORPG gameplay together with fresh tried and tested approach from Star Trek Online and Champions Online.While I am generally never a fan of cash shop economy games like Granado Espada and Maple Story, Cryptic's unique approach of Astral Diamonds economy tries to balance the in game wealth of paid and free players. However, I do question the motive and causality of making Astral Diaminds as the only currency on the exchange as it nullifies the purpose of the exchange in the first place.Another feature borrowed from Cryptic's other games, is the introduction of the Foundary. A virtual space where gamers are provided with tools to create their own adventure for other players to enjoy. There are some benefits for contributing which are determined by other players.This feature is powerful enough to recreate entire Dungeon and Dragon modules written for table top play to exist in Neverwinter.Like Star Trek Online, I am really cautious in approaching this game. At this stage, Neverwinter is likely not to score a lot of points in terms of content and mechanics. But Cryptic has demostrated that through time and positive feedback a game can mature and possibly redeem Dungeons and Drangons in the MMORPG market."",1"
"11393,Neverwinter,2013.0,""I've played Tera and the other Dungeons & Dragons MMORPG, but neither of those gets close to Neverwinter imo. The look of the game and the fluent control, make Neverwinter a great experience. It's easy to get used to and I've never ran out of things to do. However, i'm not so far in the game and I wasn't able to go through a dungeon yet, although I did watch some videos about it and it looked just as amazing.Long story short: I recommend the game, because its a well-thought and absolutely playable action MMORPG, with much much content."",1"
"11394,Neverwinter,2013.0,""Very fun gameplay! Really can find myself hooked into this :) Combat is enjyable and smooth. I love the challenge of it too. Graphics and visuals are absolutely stunning. Still a lot more for me to explore, but I'm really enjoying it so far!"",1"
"11395,Neverwinter,2016.0,""this game is 1 of the most addicting games ive ever played and isnt pay to win like most would think, most of the top quality gear can be bought through the auction house or by completing campaigns, my only complaint is how terribly unbalanced the pvp is but the pve is pretty fun and challenging"",1"
"11396,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I recently decided to give this game a shot, having not played an MMO since Guild Wars 2 shortly after its launch I wasn't going in with incredible expectations. I had heard quite a few complaints about Pay-2-Win trappings as well as balance issues within the game but was willing to go in with an open mind.The character creation was puzzling to say the least, I in part already knew I'd be rolling dice to create a character, but the question is why make the player sit there and reroll dice over and over to get their desired stat rolls when you could just let them choose instead? Rolling for stats makes sense in a in person Pen-N-Paper scenario where you get one shot at them. Otherwise there is absolutely no purpose except to waste the players time or to negatively impact new players who don't understand the mechanics.Then came the intro cinematic, it was jarring to say the least, I understand not every game gives you context in it's beginning cinematic, but this one goes out of its way to avoid any context whatsoever. On top of that the motions (and emotions) of the characters in the cinematic are jarring. I would say this isn't due to poor animation (the animation at the very least seems adequate) but instead seems to be due to a complete misunderstanding of how humanoid creatures interact with the World. Yes, it somehow looks that akward.I was willling to push through despite the previous reservations I had due to friends and reviewers alike giving it negative feedback as well as the poor first impression I had already received from just the intro cinematic and character creation, but then, upon entering the game World I was bombarded with """"Admin notifications"""" that flooded both my chat log and also popped up on the very middle of my character screen. What were these messages you may ask? They surely must be important for them to be so jarring as to completely remove me from experiencing the game and trying to gather my bearings, right? No, in fact, they weren't. They were messages spammed to me by the """"Admin"""" about people opening locked boxes/chests and receiving """"rare"""" items. These messages are not only on by default, but they cannot be turned off or disabled in any shape or form. Both the jarring text that pops up and completely breaks all immersion as well as the spam in your chat log. You can't even make a separate chat log for just specific forms of chat (Guild, Party, etc) that won't be spammed by this as it is on permanently in all chat logs you create.That's pretty bad, right? But they have to make a buck, right? Well, certainly, Okay, so then, if I spend money on some sort of subscription, open a few boxes or buy some sort of premium one time membership then you can disable these messages, right? No, you still can't. This, my friends, is how you do free to play wrong, the Pay-2-Win is strong enough in the game already, but then for them to shove unremovable messages all over your screen that are there whether you support them or not? This prompted me to immediately close the game and uninstall every shred of it I could find on my system. I wasted two hours downloading the game, registering an account and patching it, but hopefully I saved someone else some time and frustration. If you value immersion, fair F2P games, intuitive character creation and story I can tell you from the very brief time I spent with the game you will get none or very shoddy versions of all of these. For context, I didn't get into a single battle before I ended up uninstalling the game, but I had over 20 messages about """"Player XXX getting the Everlasting Hydra Mount of Smiting"""" flood my screen in that time."",0"
11397,Neverwinter,2013.0,This is possibly the most fun and best MMORPG I have ever played. This game has satisfied my interest better than any other MMORPG could. Some people don't consider this games D&D but once you start to play it longer and get the feel of it. You will see the D&D side of it. Don't have any doubts about this game because trust me. It's fun and entertaining. Especially if you have a friend you can have on a steam voice call and play this with,1

11399,Neverwinter,2016.0,I played Neverwinter for a long time. I go tot where I would buy vip every month because it made things easier like being able to pull up a map and go where you want no matter where you are. I did not have to pay to play... but the option was there if you want to. I played a long time. I have taken a long break and am back playing again. Its' a good online RPG and I made some friends when I played before. It's really good for a free game. I recommend it and the game can be played without buying anything.

Yes, you can pay ( with a ton of cash, it is not cheap) to obtain the end-game enchantnments and mounts quicker but nothing that you can not get with spending some time grinding out content. The best possible thing for any new player coming into the game would be to find a good guild. This will save you tons of time. Money can not buy you skill, i see 3.2 item players out dps and out play 4.3 players everyday. If you like Wow or mmo's , you will enjoy this game.

11401,Neverwinter,2014.0,it the worst rpg this game has no idea how a boss is made like exp [the game put a mini boss in a boss room and like 50 strong mobs in there to] And i had a healer npc she to heal me but she just stands there looks at me and then she die. The game is just badly made trust me,0
"11402,Neverwinter,2015.0,""Neverwinter is a pretty cool F2P MMO. So far (lvl. 26) I haven't noticed any paywalls preventing F2P players from advancing . The game has a nice farming/grinding system to give F2P players some cool stuff. Overall, the game seems fair and is pretty fun. The questline is focused and doesn't branch out a lot, but this is not necessarily a bad thing because the quest givers are fully voiced and the quests offer more than just the typical """"go there, collect/kill X of something"""", esspecialy towards the higher levels. I think the game is nicely catered to newbie MMORPG-ers, but it also offers veterans a good run for their money, or in this case for free!"",1"

Doing PvP gaining 'Glory' in order to buy PvP gear. Doing heroic dungeons to get Epic gear at max level. But it then has a diablo twist with the same style gear system and ability system where you have a limited number of spells and you have to choose the best builds. Loving the game so far and played 70+ hours. I would recommend to everybody."",1"
11407,Neverwinter,2014.0,I got this game around the same time I got Elder Scrolls Online. Admitedly. I play Neverwinter a lot more. It's engaging and for a free game the graphics are awesome.

Definitely worth the time!,1

11409,Neverwinter,2018.0,Constant disconnects. The game's servers are extremely picky and touchy and if your connection is ever shaky you will not even be able to login.  Be aware that no matter how fast your connection is the initial download will take you a while still as they throttle it to a crawl. I suppose to be cheap.,0
"11410,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Neverwinter is a pretty standard Cryptic MMO in that everything about the game is incredibly mediocre. The game isn't your typical """"hotkey MMO"""" - you instead have only a handful of abilities at any given time. Because of the lack of keys I found combat to be very boring and repetive, but for people that don't really like the """"bazillion and one things to remember"""" it may be a good thing. I personally wasn't a fan of it.A lot of assets are reused as well. For 30 levels I found myself fighting the same types of enemies in the same types of enviornments, and story wasn't compelling enough to keep me interested. Very little of the source material is actually important, the game is essentially a self-contained story and even simple things like the city of Neverwinter itself is built from the ground up to be unique, so people like myself that played Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights etc. really have nothing to look forward to in terms of revisiting these locations.Classes are very bare-bones right now, and while variety is well enough, it doesn't even begin to compare to the kinds of options Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate players are used to. The """"die rolling"""" character sheet on character creation exists, but it doesn't feel like actual dice rolling. It seems as though Cryptic made it so there are several chances you can get and the game just flips between them to simulate you're rolling your stats. I spent maybe ten minutes re-rolling to get an unoptimal roll and it simply never happened. My highest numbers were always on my classes two highest stats, with one or two points favoring one statistic over the other. I never managed to get really high Charisma on a Fighter, for example.The biggest comparison I can make to the combat system is Tera. The game has an """"active"""" style attack and offense system in place, but for the most part I experienced no challenge whatsoever in a solo enviornment. In groups all of the content I experienced was trivial (especially in raids etc.). Maybe this changes as you get higher into the game, but I spent my 30 levels bored out of my mind and completely uninterested in what was going on story-wise. If you're new to MMOs in general, I think you will have a lot of fun, however. It strays far enough from the """"WoW-clone"""" formula to be appealing in my opinion, but at the same time it doesn't take any huge liberties with gameplay mechanics or... anything else, for that matter, to really justify choosing to play this over the plethora of other MMOs that are available. Cryptic's use of the license is just pathetic, really. Apart from seeing """"Neverwinter"""" in dialogue or on the map I was convinced that this was just another generic D&D inspired gameworld. When it comes to """"is it ACTUALLY free to play?"""" I found the game to be pretty fair compared to other experiences I've had with this genre. At no time did I feel like paying for something would make the game easier, nor did I feel it was necessary to progress. With the research I did (I didn't spend dozens of hours on forums or Google so take this as a subjective opinion) the vast majority of things in the game that could be bought for real money were mostly convienence items. More bag space, faster mounts, armor/clothing cosmetics, that sort of thing. The game is using Cryptic's infamous """"lockbox"""" system, however. And the middle of my screen was essentially permafilled with """"SO-AND-SO OPENED A BOX AND GOT STEAMING PILE OF DUNG"""" so if you're not a fan of that type of marketing then beware that this game is very bad about that.In terms of content I found that the game was somewhat lacking. Crypic's """"mission creator"""" system I experienced from Star Trek Online is present here, and it seems as though it's essentially been copy & pasted. This I found to be both good and bad. Good in the sense that there are really creative players out there that are doing Cryptic's job for them, bad in the sense that when anybody complains there """"isn't enough content"""" most retorts will be """"then play community-made content"""". The missions I played by players were varied, and while I never tried to make any missions myself, if the mission variety is any indicator, then Cryptic's tool is very versatile and seems to get the job done well enough.With that being said, it brings me around to my least favorite aspect of this game: the dailies. At an incredibly early level (approx. level ten) you are introduced to daily quests. If you're not familiar with daily quests, they are essentially very basic, oftentimes simple (but time consuming) quests that can be done on a timer (typically 12 to 24 hour period cooldowns). In Neverwinter the dailies revolve around PvP and player-made content. Once the initial """"new"""" feeling wears off (just as any other MMO) the dailies become monotonous and tedius. The rewards are fairly bad as well, and never motivated me to invest a lot of time to complete them. Overall I was very disappointed in this game, and Cryptics consistency with creating average MMOs that adhere to a very strict formula. Being big into Neverwinter Nights I was continually let down with this game's lack of story and of license use, and in general the """"safe"""" way Cryptic approached yet another MMO. Even more so since it lacks the sort of exploratory freedom of Star Trek, and the creative freedom of character of Champions Online. This game is a middleground to both of those games and as a result I feel it suffers for it. For the reasons listed above I simply can't (and won't) recommend this game to anybody but those that are extremely tolerant and/or accepting of the """"standard MMO business"""" that has become so mainstream. And for those that are D&D enthusiasts, my advice, from one D&D fan to another, """"move along"
"11411,Neverwinter,2014.0,""I really wanted to like this game. I really did. The character creation was awesome. I had my little mage all set up and I was rfeady to invest hours into this game.Its unplayable. I never even got to start any quests. I take a few steps, and it boots you immediately from the server. If it doesnt boot you. The screen freezes, and gives a litte message stating that its trying to reconnect. After waiting for a few minutes, i take a few more steps, and the process starts over.Fix this and I may play it, but I highly recommend not wasting your time."",0"
"11412,Neverwinter,2016.0,""Let me put it simply.I've been playing off an on for a few years now, as I have not had time to play it like I want to. It's an MMO, when you look at MMO type RPGS, you get the same exact outcomes, Pay2win gear, for PVP, almost EVERY MMO has this, so no reason to frown at it becuase its pointless. If you like PvE games, this is a good game for it, however if your a PvP lover who refuses to pay money to win, go play an arcade style game. becuase there are very few MMOS that arent pay2win, and why do PvP games have pay2win? becuase how else are they going to pay for the game servers. It's got a pretty good story, and its pretty old so performance on newer GPUs kind of cuased problems, but the game was programmed to run on older equipment, not much they can do about this, so complaining isnt going to get us anywhere.Will I continue to play? YesDo I recommend this game? Same with all mmos, if you dont like pay-2-win, go play something like COD, or as a great NPC said - Go cry on the forums like the little ***** you are, where no one cares.How do I rate this game? - seeing as there hasnt been any word of a newer Neverwinter Nights, 8/10"",1"
"11413,Neverwinter,2013.0,""as i'm sitting here typing this i've loged in 31.7 gameplay hours. this game is fun. how is it fun? lets itemize a bit.lets start with the graphics. they clearly tell you what's going on, no problems. for those who place more importince on grahpics that i do: exelent specal effect displays that do not hamper the view of what's going on. easy to look at terrain and charcters, no eye sores here. what else do you peeps look for? dunno'game play, the combat (of wich there is plenty) is a bit more frantic than most mmo's i've played. you have to aim at your target, simply selecting it then pressing keyboard keys doesn't work, aim or you won't be able to hit with single target attacks, aoe attacks are easer to pull off, just make shure you are pointing in the correct direction. oh, and watch out for the big red areas, they show up when something hostile is about to land an attack there. about a dozen charcter races and (currently) 6 distinct classes. you get some tokens to rent a mount from a quest, let you know if you want to purchase one, or just keep walking. if you want to buy a mount there are an assortment of styles and speeds to choose from. and you can have a hierling, you get one of your choice free when you complete the tower zone, others can be purchased with ingame coin or (i assume) from the ingame store for real money.questing: the quests have decent varity and no confusion. read the quest discription, follow the provided waypoint. easy enough, as long as you can survive whatever gets thrown at you. if a new area is to hard, back up to your last zone and help peeps with there quests, another lvl or two makes a big difference and they will apreacate the help. or just run the dungeon a time or three more, this will also help peeps with their questing.sound? good. with 5.1 i have a good idea of everything going around me, on my comp screan or not. npc voiceovers are nicely done. combat noises are also nicely done. but this game is one of the very few i have problems with the voip, although i am apparently an exception here, as most i've talked to it works just fine for.crafting, what is an mmo without player crafted goods? at lvl 10 you can start crafting items from any of several professions. step one: hire a (free) assistant,the first one takes 5 sec, then have your assistant gather goods, refine gather goods, or make useable products. you can find crafting goods while out adventuring, this helps a bit. you start with one crafting work slot and get others by reaching various mile stones, wich you can read from the select a workslot space. you will probally will have the """"get a profession to lvl 3"""" milestone first, and it doesn't take to long to get. somewhere in here i need to mention that when you make an item you have your assistant(s) work on it in real time. most tasks are in the neighhborhood of 10 to 15 min, some will take longer, however. when your hierling is done with the work, just collect the resule and (if you want to) have one of them start working on something else.community. in my exprience frendly peeps are the name of the game. need help, somebody will have a useful and polite answer in no time. friendly conversation is one of two topics i regulary see, the other is putting together a group for a quest.  gold farmers exist here, but just right click on their name, choose  """"report spam"""" and they get put on your ignore list free of charge. no need to keep reading their spam. well, there was this one time i squelched somebody for rude coments to one of my toons, just right clicked and choose ignore for that person.i think this covers everything. oh ya, game is free to play, they appear to get their $ on optionals, other than needing to purchase everything indivudally. or paying for things that other games provide for free, i'm thinking about one you had to buy items with real world $ to speak in global. more charcter slots and keys for those lockboxes that get passed out like candy on hallowween are the only ones that i notice. 'course i don't brouse the real money shop, you might find usefull stuff there. thinking of, i may just get a couple of extra charcter slots to try out diff classes."",1"
"11414,Neverwinter,2013.0,""A great change in style for fans of the original NWN, and something different to the now standard Wow formula. This game brings together all the great things involved in an RPG (well constructed quests, loot & customisation) an encorporates it nicely into an MMORPG that is accessible, playable, and most importantly, fun!"",1"
"11415,Neverwinter,2013.0,""Absolutely try this game if you're looking a new and free to play game, especially if you're a D&D fan. The Foundry is also a great tool to experience new game content created by players every single day."",1"
"11416,Neverwinter,2013.0,""A very unexpected an suprisingly pleasant experience, Its hack and slash rather than the outdated point and clock mmo style, lots of polish, and in my opinion a non intrusive f2p system, give it a shot its free!"",1"
11417,Neverwinter,2018.0,Pros:- one of the best in this genre- D&D and lore (oh my love)- you can play without purchase- great communityCons:- you probably will spend on downloading 2 hours or so- quests resemble each other,1
"11418,Neverwinter,2013.0,""     While Neverwinter leaves a bad taste in some folks mouths, I found it be fun, fast, and creative.  Sure, every free-to-play game has to chase the paper a bit,  but the only things that aren't available to the average player are upgrades that make the playtime faster.  And honestly, you might be cheating yourself if you try to shorten the amount of time you put in for stuff.  For me, Neverwinter is about following traditional DND ideals in a new way, with a cohesive vision and storyline.  There isn't a large free-roam world, but I find it refreshing to actually know where to go and what to do.  There's plenty of surprises and secrets, there's plenty of tough battles, and there's a lot to do.  When you max out your levels you've only really played about half the game as it is.  The foundry (playermade quests) adds an ever expanding option as well, so it's tough to get bored with Neverwinter.       If you're in to competitive multiplayer however, that's where Neverwinter falls short.  The PVP is fun and fast paced, but at the higher levels there's a noticable advantage between folks that invest money and those who don't.  As stated before, you can get almost everything in the game through playing, but the amount of time you have to put in as opposed to the few dollars you can spend leaves you a bit discouraged.  The money system in the game is pretty weird too, as you have Zen coins, Astral Diamonds, and Gold/Silver/Copper.  The gold you get from killing monsters is nearly worthless as you progress, and most in-game trading is done through the Astral Diamonds.      I think that this game is an overall success, and If you're on the fence, I'd say go ahead and play it- It's free.  You level rather quickly anyway, so you can get the gist of classes and playstyle without delay.  Happy Adventuring!"",1"
"11419,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Outstandig adaptation for D&D 4th edition system! Excelent balance between fast paced fantasy action and deep world immersion and roleplaying stuff. Full of quests and lore, plus player developed adventures. "",1"
"11420,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Dungeons&DragonsIf you like to play REAL RPG than NOT without D&D or Advanced Dungeons&Dragons!!!I startet with D&D (AD&D) on the good old Amiga playing """"Eye of the Beholder""""!Waiting many Years for a REAL good AD&D Game WITH Editor and then """"Neverwinter Nights"""" was born! WOW!In the meantime I played Baldurs Gate, but Neverwinter Nights changed everything!!!Then I played Neverwinter Nights 2. But the first from BioWare is better!I really love the """"Forgotten Realms"""" with Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Luskan, Baldur's Gate and many, many more!Now I startet with Neverwinter Nights online and it's GREAT!!!I think the payable AddOns are much too expensive but if I would have the Money I think I would buy them!"",1"
"11421,Neverwinter,2014.0,""Personal Score: 8 out of 10Neverwinter, set in the """"Dungeons and Dragons"""" universe, is one of my few favorite MMOs. Most of the quests are not the typical """"kill 10 rats and come back and see me"""" type, sometimes you have to actually accomplish killing a boss as if you were a bounty hunter. Secondly the keys you use in combat differ from most MMOs out there, which makes you feel like you're drawn into the battles more. Instead of using 1 thru 9 as your hotkeys, it's done through the Q, E, and R keys, 1 and 2 serve as special attacks, while 3,4, and 5 allow you to add potions or whatnots on them. 7 controls your mount and Tab allows you to access a special ability. While combat is straight-forward, you can didge attacks in this game, unlike most MMOs where you keep clicking until you or your enemy is dead. The graphics seem a bit dated for being an MMO only opened a few years ago, and sometimes you may run into lag if there are too many users on the one and only server they have, but that's okay as far as I'm concerned, these are minor annoyances for me that can be easily overlooked. The other great feature is the Foundry. The Foundry is accessible after you reach Level 15(?) with your in-game character, and it allows you to actually design quests for others to play in-game. So if you're a D&D lover, you can use that love to create quests others can enjoy. The only real downside is that this is a free MMO. This means they make their money through the item shop where you spend real cash for in-game items not found anywhere else. This may be terrible to some, but you can get through the game without using it. You just may not be able to craft a certain enchantment for your weapon or have the flashiest mount to ride on, or open enchantment boxes, but that's okay, because there is lots of stuff to do and see. Grab a sword, cast a spell, and enjoy Neverwinter... an MMO I highly recommend."",1"

Could have been different but it doesn't work out sadly :( I was pumped for this game but in the end it was a disappointment and was hugely pay to win and the quests were bland.

"11428,Neverwinter,2017.0,""There's way too much game here to be able to write a comprehensive review, so I'm just going to go with a simple list of pros and cons:Cons:-Instanced, very instanced.-Character customization is """"eh.""""-World feels static, NPCs are forgettable.-Cash shop is a little steep, certain upgrades (IE companions) REQUIRE cash investment to advance beyond a certain point.-Bank / Inventory space is very small (though a couple dollars will remedy that).-Story is disjointed and bland.-Game doesn't explain it's systems very well, campaigns are cryptic (I actually still don't get exactly what they are).-Item upgrade system is positively dumpster.Pros:-Graphically the game looks good enough.-Combat is super fun, daily system / skills feel really good.-PVP is quite good, though there is f-all for balance.-The cash shop doesn't feel required for the most part. I invested $20 once, wound up with a fast mount, heirloom weapons, and bunch of cash shop currency (to buy bags etc). Also did premium for a month, that gives you a loot crate key and some silver bars (a special currency) daily, which is pretty good.-It's free to play (you won't feel the cash shop draw for at least 20-30 hours).All in all, if you're eyeballing it, give it a shot. Once you get to the point where the cash shop starts feeling necessary, either invest or don't EZPZ."",1"
"11429,Neverwinter,2017.0,""Haven't played much of it but from the little experience I have I would say that it is a great mmorpg to play with friends, and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy/medieval genre and anyone who likes DnD! And it's free!"",1"
"11430,Neverwinter,2017.0,""Very very good design i feel tho if they had charged something like 20 bux and had severely limited the pay to win aspect they would have done better at least reputation wise. However when it first came out i maxed out my level and came about 70% the max dps with just good grinding from there on its very steep pay to win or was, havent played in some time bc of that.

The game is not really that great for me i mean i choose the class  ----- Trickster Rogue -----  worst class ever i don't even know why there is a class like this i wanted to role play or feel like a rogue/assassin/ninja squish but massive damage that piles damage quick and is a fast class i was completely WAY WAY WAY WAY off the class is more of the squish looks like a ninja/assassin/rogue that does above average damage with 2 second stealth and is a very slow moving character the TANK class actually moves faster then the rogue class runs faster moves faster damages faster piles faster and isn't squishy the RANGER  class moves faster piles damage faster has aeo effs DOESN'T hit higher but is way way faster when attacking which is stupid because a rogue is suppose to again pile damage fast and hit fast and hit hard which he/she does not.So summary: The game has a good story line, Terrible just aweful can't emphasize this enough design of how the classes are so broken they make no sense TANKS are fast with high def and fast attack, RANGERS fast attack fast movement high def, MAGERS average movement average attack speed  HIGH damage output high def, ROGUE class low def average movement speed a little bit above attack speed a little bit above average damage ouput.

I diddnt understand the economy, and diddnt know how i was going to do endgame because i was new.but the day i picked it up again was the day i became engulfed with love for the game.I have not had as much fun in any other mmo as of yet. I have played terra, runescape, wow rift, path of exile, you name it. neverwinter blows them all awaydespite the bad reviews, despite the """"pay to win"""" nature inspite all of the negativeity surrounding this title, It is a true gem.when you start out, you will be on the road to the main town hub, on a newbie's quest if you will,finish that and you will be doing dungeons, pvp, and raids called skurmishes. that is if you do it vanilla only.dip into the foundry, you will be solving murders, exploring drug induced dreams and fighting the power rangers. hell, pick the right one and you can fight cathulu.insanity, hilarity and all out craziness will insue should you pick the game up. you will not have a dull moment and the game is worth at least a look.overall I give the game a 9/10 if for minor gripes with loading and dungeon queue times. other than that, if you overlook it, it is a 10/10.

"11454,Neverwinter,2013.0,""This review is based on approximately 3 hours of interupted game-play.  Considering it is free to play I'll be cautious about my reservations about this game, so here goes:Uber:-  Decent selection of character races & classes-  Has a glowing-sparkly trail of prettiness that you can choose to show which leads you to your next objective-  Fast sense of progression, your character obtains new skills and abilities regularly which keeps it interesting-  Some ability graphics look really goodMeh-  Physics graphics are cheesy - players run with an odd motion-  Interacting with objects or NPC's can be tedious as you need to 'interact' with F key which can be buggyJust....no-  Very linear when not in town - always a set path-  Early level game mechanics are highly favourable to the player (overpowered) and although that can be fun sometimes I found it made the beginning of the game bat-turd boring. Overall it seems to be trying to follow the game play mechanics of World of Warcraft but without the cartoon graphics.  As an avid Dungeons & Dragon's fan I was hoping for more with character creation but I appreciate how it can become daunting if over complicated.Overall it's a decent free to play game but I wouldn't spend money on it."",1"
11455,Neverwinter,2013.0,Great game. It got a lot better since beta. I like the fighting system. There is a way to target unlike what most people are saying. Free to play and you do not get ahead of others by paying for things in game. Mostly cosmetic micro transactions.,1
"11456,Neverwinter,2014.0,""This game is a great way to learn some lore, not all of it is accuret, and the combat is way better then any other DnD games. It's a great way to introduce yourself to the DnD univers and may even help you make your own DnD adventure for you and your freinds. But this has the traditional Perfect World aspects such as community quests built by other players that love the DnD world. I do however admit that once you've reached the max level it gets boring fast as well as when you make another characture it gets repedative with the story. However that doesn't mean that its a bad game everygame has flaws and this is a MMO so it updates and improves even a little every week and it's a great way to just mess around with your freinds. Here is a hint to level up fast do the community quests till level 30-35 then do the main story quest and you'll be level 40-45 before you even reach the quests that are around you level."",1"
