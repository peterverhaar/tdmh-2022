"24727,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThe graphics are very juicy - the forest is dense and colorful and I don't see any decreases below 60fps (r290x) anywhere in the game. The shooting mechanics are great and make you want to get good at using them. Each gun feels different and is unqiue for different situations. I think they sound great as well. Ammo is scare so you have to practice well placed shots, but it makes battles fun. They add in different items that act like perks like bunny boots that make you jump high and knee pads that make you run fast giviing it a different fun feel - the whole game has that feel however.A few things though - it's pretty glitchy like opening doors is really bad and can get frustrating. The cars are all but useless, and spawning is horrible. The battles should have more players with a better spawn method. I think you should try it out just for the guns alone - they are more realistic then your average shooter and fun to play around with"",1"
"24728,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAmazing game, absolutely loved it, hilarious even without jokes, when I first found the loot crates I nearly fell out of my chair, the only problem is the item spawn rate, they're as scarce as my dad.Also, anti-aliasing gets really buggy when you are in the water, while the camera is out of the water"",1"
24729,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewProbably the best Battle Royale game ive played.9/10 will play againPros-game loads quickly-matches are quick-humor(humour)-immediately want to jump into another game-fun-performs better than most battle royale games-hip firing is quite easy to useCons-clunky controls/movement take some getting used to-seems as if armor does nothing-recoil is high,1
24730,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewMy opinion on Cuisine Royale isPro's 1. Amazing graphic's 2. Sound quality is better then most triple A shooters around3.The heal system is funny and all around innovativeCon's1. Player movement in my opinion seems a bit rough at time's and could be better optimized. 2. Not enough keybind/graphic settings....3. Some days finding a match takes a while.,1
"24731,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewEveryone who says it has malware is a dumbass, and if seeding is a problem for you, not only can it be disabled with 1 click, youre a ♥♥♥♥♥.The game itself is wonderful and a blast to play, the gunplay is great and the mechanics are nice, it has vehicles and the bunny shoes are hilarious fun, i dont know at how anyone could not like this game.

"24732,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewDo you enjoy wearing various items from the kitchen when you go out in public, just to receive strange looks and laughing behind your back? Do you also enjoy the relaxation that is provided by murdering your adversaries with WW2 weaponry, just to be told """"Oh that's illegal"""" or """"You probably shouldn't do that""""? Is it your life long dream to wield a golden pan with the full capabilities of a functioning lightsaber? Well my friend, first of all, you are my kinda guy (or girl). But besides us sharing the same interests and hobbies, I must in fact say that you should fear not the problems that come with these exciting lifestyle choices any longer, as this game has provided the perfect solution, we now have to option of virtual indulgence! Though I have to admit, it's not quite the same exhilarating feeling as when done in the real world, it's still a good enough free work around until societies standards change in our favour. I tell you this dear reader, this game... is worth your time.    "",1"
24733,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access Reviewgame is amzing better then all other battle royale games.the graphics are amzing but still relativle easy to run.love thats its only ww2 gun i do recommed adding anti tanke rifles.the small amount of playyers in a battle make the game more fun as u dont run into people every 10 seconds.i highly recommend this game,1
24734,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewInsane for a free game to compete not only well but better than PUBG and other pay-for battleground games. A plethora of guns that not only look and sound great but are well rounded and all have their pros and cons.,1

"24736,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewNo micro transactions, runs well, fun as hell, shotguns win 9/10 times, vehicles are not op.The items have character and it is satisfying to hear your armor clink. 10/10 would run around in my undies looking for pots to wear again."",1"
24737,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is aamazing!! everything is pretty smooth and the graphics are also pretty good. The game is set in a WW2 time period and i love it. Im a hardcore fortnite player since like season 1 but i haven't been playing recently because of how amazing this game is 10/10 recomendation....the only problem i have seen is when aiming it can be difficult at first but it gets easier especially if you turn your sensitivity all the way up. Hope you enjoy this game as much as i have!,1
"24738,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewVery fantastic game.  I'm surprised at this too, but it actually plays better than the official PUBG game (as with most PUBG parody games lol).  Would recommend anyone to try this, it gets pretty intense at times but it's hilarious all at once and that's it's charm really."",1"
24739,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access Reviewi dont want to make a long review but i will say this. Cuisine royale is fun yes its in alpha Yes there will be bugs some funny others not so funny but its a game where you can wear pink bunny slippers and jump super high smoke a sig and get more max health (and lung cancer) but the best part is you wear a mother freaking bucket as a helmet Get this game its free theres nothing stopping you,1
"24740,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is a literal meme but it still manages to have better graphics AND run better than PUBG. As a game itself it's a mix of some of the more realistic elements of the aforementioned PUBG (namely in guns/gunplay and locale) and the more ridiculous elements of Fortnite (movement and items), while it's not a perfect balance it gets the job done well enough to be a solid reccomend. One of the more fun games in this tidal-wave of BR's."",1"
"24741,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewWhen I got this game, I figured it would be a breath of fresh air compared to all these hardcore battle royale games around right now, little did I know under it's wacky, quirky exterior, it's exactly the same as PUBG & co. This game is essentially PUBG but more buggy.- Still a walking simulator- Better gun always wins- Floaty movement as if gliding across the ground- Awful 3rd/1st person system- Found many glitches/exploits, some of which extremely helpful *Peaking through roofs to see enemies*- Takes like one shot to kill anyone regardless of their armour, some guns blatantly overpowered *m30 luftwaffe drilling*Being able to bind a waffle iron onto your leg for armour does not compensate for the fact that this is just more PUBG shovelware"",0"
"24742,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewLooks better than PUBG/H1Z1 (both at max settings), is much better optimised, has better netcode, combined with a sprinkling of characterful comedy for the icing on the cake. Superb, and not just for an April Fools' joke, it really is far better than PUBG/H1Z1 in every sense of the expression. 10/10, would highly recommend, even when it becomes paid to cover server costs."",1"
"24743,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is rather amusing.I mean, seriously! Sneaking around in your boxers, trying to outsmart the enemy and hopefully bash their heads in with the uber pan, which by the way sounds like a lightsaber!What's not to like!? :D"",1"
"24744,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewbest game i ever have played, it's just so fun jumping around. it's not like fortnite that you meet tryhards in every game you play, in this game can you just lie down and chill, and i'm actually serious you can lie down. drive around and go inside a house,  and go outside and find out that you left your fridge outside and find all kind of awsome stuff inside it."",1"
24745,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewVery good game with good graphics and amazing map. It is in early stage so a lot is missing like complete menu and HUD but that really isn't a trouble. Biggest flaw is it's client. It gets installed without your knowledge and will continue to run in background without you knowing until you manually close it. It automatically starts when windows boots up and update and there is no option to disable it. Great game but you can't force users to run and install your client in background without their knowledge. Fix it or remove it,0

"24748,Cuisine Royale,,""Access ReviewIt's a less trash battle royale than fortnite. The gameplay is great until you get uberpanned 2-3 matches in a row. PLZ fix the pan, it is way too OP.

24750,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewAAA BR's eat you f***ing hearts out. This game is already prettier and more fun than you could ever be...and it hasen't even fully released yet! 8/10 as it has yet to fully release. PLAY THIS GAME,1
"24751,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewHello, developer.I hope u can see my assessment.      I played your game after you experienced an update. I changed my mind.I think this is a very promising game.  I like your game quality and gamemode. So I hope you can make the simplified Chinese version as early as possible.If you do this, I think many players will be willing to pay."",1"
"24752,Cuisine Royale,,""Access ReviewThe graphics is incredible, even on with all settings on low.  Day looks like day, the sun reflects off slippery surfaces beautifully, trees and landscrape is nicely done, and the river stream makes me want to take a dip.Gameplay is strange. I'm getting killed from insane distances that when I try the same thing it seems like my guns have limited range, but certain other players' don't. Can't even readily tell when I make a kill - put player specific kill messages top center, it's much easier to see. Next, I can get killed by a melee attack with a ♥♥♥♥ing blunt force weapon and die instantly even with full armor, yet my weapons seem to have no effect up close - and no I'm not a lousy shot. I'm coming from games like Doom, Gears of War and the Unreal Tournament franchise. And why is there not a full list of players in server? Frames, but no ping readout?The lobby screen - why not show a list of gaming sessions players can join instead of having them wait on the slow poke search? Like multiplayer games traditionally do? I've waited up to 10 minutes to join - not nice in a game with no respawn and where if you die you must reconnect to the server.Lastly, Battle Royale is a lame and annoying genre.  I don't know why every damn game studio is getting on that bandwagon since PUBG released. It's not ground breaking and it gets old fast. It seems like the gaming industry is going the way of china, bootleg after bootleg knock off after knock off. The games all seem the same - you jump out of some plane parachute style (Cuisine Royale is an exception) and do nothing but run around collecting inventory items and guns (that you sometimes can't find in THIS game, so you die - kinda unfair so you end up bringing a knife to a gun fight but whatever), all while some ominous fog is trying to kill you or get shot outta no where. It's literally death match with the exception being the players invests more time doing stupid shiate and playing hide and seek while grinding for the most kills. It's more depressing than fun. I can't recommend this or any other BR games to be honest, paid or free."",0"
"24753,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is magnificint!Graphics are A+, looting is decent. Its sort of PUBG like, mixed in with elements of Arma.Unfortunately, the aiming and movement needs extreme work.It feels extremely choppy and it feelsl ike i'm playing on the Wii U.Aside from Aiming and movement, this game has A TON of potential! I really hope the develeopers take this seriously and build off the feedback from the community."",1"
"24754,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewLMAO THE GAME IS SOOO GAY YET SOOO MANLY HAHAHAHAHAHA WTFHonestly the graphics,gameplay and optimization are so good. Just add the customization option,killcam,landing system etc and the game will become GREATER.And please BAN THE CHEATERS BECAUSE I don't want to play another PUBG.Keep it up devs. Good luck."",1"
"24755,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewGoing back to the launcher, which is a separate program than the game, after each match is one of the weirdest things I've seen in a game. The jumping/vaulting mechanic is super janky. Why is kill trading with ballistic weapons a thing? Dropping into a match without warning, potentially in a field near no structures, is not a good way to start a match. The shooting mechanics feel ok. The cars are probably my favorite part. They drive well and running people down is hilarious. The bunny slippers and speed knee are OP.Overall not a bad game, but not worth a ton of time in this state."",0"
"24756,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewNot only did this game install some wierd app that cannot be removed, the game also somehow knew the first part of my email without me putting it in. Wouldn't recommend downloading this."",0"

"24758,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewCuisine Royale is an all-kitchen-warfare Battle Royale game with the most honest system for Loot Boxes ever. It's made by developers of squad based MMO shooter Enlisted and is completely free. In battles, you get ingredients that are used for """"cooking"""" new suites, masks, gestures and other cosmetic items that don't influence your combat effectiveness.Features:Dinnerware will finally be able to show off its true potential: Use a colander as head protection, equip a wok as a formidable breastplate, or strap on a massive waffle maker to be protected even against the largest calibers of weapons.Improve your characteristics in the battle significantly: Strapping on a medical dropper will provide you with accelerated health regeneration, a set of glasses will increase weapon accuracy and chewing on a cigar will turn you into a real Tough Guy!Stand out from the crowd! In battles, you get ingredients that are used for """"cooking"""" new suites, masks, gestures, tombstones and other cosmetic items that don't influence your combat effectiveness. You can also purchase optional """"kitchen pass"""" that increases rewards per battle and unlocks additional recipes.The most honest system for Loot Boxes: Those are scattered around the battlefield, and are free to open, their content is well labelled, and the drop chance of what is said to be inside is a 100% guarantee.Fair play: you can play Cuisine Royale in first and third person view. In order to mitigate advantage of the latter, every player has a minion with a camera that can uncover the position of a player who is peeking around a corner. So if you see a butterfly or a drone - you should know that you are being watched.Massive and intense battles: 34 players per session in total will head out from different parts of the map, starting only in their underwear and making their way to the center of a battlefield that is constantly shrinking in size.Amazing"",1"

"24760,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAwesome and Hilarious game with much sexual benefit and entertainment. Good for a laugh but not only is there a few glitches, (to be expected) but there is a privacy breach on their malware agent that installs in the background. Although pretty harmless, is frustrating and the cheapest way for the company to seed and install updates on your game. If this system changed, I'd leave a positive review because the game itself is pretty fun but otherwise, I'm leaving a Mixed response. Don't recommend currently, but if they change the system, I'd totally recommend it because it's fun as."",0"
"24761,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI followed a naked guy into a house. He had no pots and pans on him, no weapon on his back, ez kill.Apparently he knew I was following him so he got behind the door.

"24762,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI can't believe how fun this game is.It's nowhere near perfect, there are A TON of things to fix, a ladder system to implement, some sort of progression system, some map variety, a female model... perhaps? But man. This owns PUBG in every way possible.P.S. if you don't like the Gaijin agent in the background, just turn auto-updates off.And report the fake reviews telling you it's not possible to remove it.If you can't remove it with an uninstaller, just delete the folder and clean the registry if you really wanna be sure."",1"
"24763,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewHow ironic. Cuisine Royale, in the short amount of time it has been out, is the culmination of the ideal battle royale game that PUBG wants to be. Performance-wise, CR transcends PUBG, clocking in at buttery, triple-digit frames for ample mid-tier PC builds. My heart races as I hear clanking pots and pans, signifying imminent life-or-death scenarios"

"24767,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewGood proof of concept, and would be nice to see them bring this mode of Infantry Combat into War Thunder - however, the aiming feels slow and inaccurate aswell as doesnt have impact or punch making all guns feel like pea-shooters that do no damage.

"24769,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewNot bad for a free game, but it installs 3rd party software (Gaijin Agent) that by default automatically checks for updates.  It kicked me out of a different game when it unexpectedly launched on its own, and it doesn't get removed if you uninstall the game.  In fact, it doesn't even have an uninstaller, nor does it show up on the list of programs for windows to remove.  You have to manually search for the file location and delete it.

"24773,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI really like this game idea and how it plays out, a WW2 weapon selection with men in boxers running around using kitchen items as armor while trying to kill eachother for no god damn reason. Now you might be asking """"Bat y da negetiv revijew?""""⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Lemme tell ya... First of all, this game comes bundled with this bootleg NetAgent """"Gaijin"""", it's an app that i was 99% sure i did not install on my computer before. Now the big offender here is... It's useless, and this is actually the only reason this game made me give it a negative review. More about Gaijin now.This software does nothing in particular except say """"Hey i'm installed :D"""" it also creates this taskbar shortcut on the bottom right which you can turn off, but it will almost instantly reactivate itself, it also has no uninstall option. I went ahead to visit their website and appearently this is what the software is """"doing"""" Will immediately install itself as soon as you download a Gaijin supported game. Will automatically update the game even if the computer is turned off. (This is pointless, updating takes 20-40 seconds) Uplaod your game data to the devs for some reason. Share the game data to other computers to automatically update the game.Now i have a lot of questions for this, now let me get to the what i suppose to be the Frequently Asked Questions.1. What do you mean share my game data to the devs?- It takes your game data and transfers it to other computers for """"auto update"""".2. What's so bad about this?- This software without any permission uses your Bandwith, which is just pure malware.3. Why doesn't my antivirus say anything about it?- Because i don't really know, stop using Norton.All in all i would rate this game as nice in 7/10, but putting this into their game just turned into a spyware game, you get fun but you lose all your credit card information.  not really  If you have any questions, go to the  Review Discussion  ⠀⠀⠀-Rust"",0"

"24776,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI've been playing CS for almost 20 years. It's my number one game. In those 20 years I always looked for other fun games to play in between CS games.I played HL: Deathmatch, Day of Defeat, All COD's until MW2, MOH, Unreal Tournemant, Quake, ... I enjoyed all of them! More recently I tried and played several other games looking for something new! Destiny 2... Hated it... Fortnite... Absolutely terrible!!! The latest COD WW2 enjoyed the single player but multiplayer wasn't my thing. I got all hyped for Battalion 1944 but until now it dissapointed me. I will give it another chance though as they are still working on the game.The one game I tried and kept playing was PUBG. Although the game was not optimized well had all of its flaws, it was fun to play for a few rounds. What I don't understand is that people can play it for hours on end... It gets so ♥♥♥♥ing boring! The recent update with the smaller map and more loot was a change I liked but overall for me the game is broken... I ♥♥♥♥ing HATE the game! It got great potential but the developers are just milking the cow now in my opinion. Hence I deleted the game and searched for something new.Enter Cuisine Royale! Free! Early access! I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE THIS GAME! So early in development it looks better, feels better and is optimized better then PUBG.Spray patterns and hitboxes are already really good but can still be improved. I like the random spawn points. Loot is balanced pretty good. Sometimes you can be unlucky with loot but if you play it right you will always find something to get a kill and steal there loot. I personally like the funny gadgets and perks but even without them the game would be a lot of fun. It could be interesting in the future the have several game modes. One like it is now and one that is more realistic. A mode without the bunny slippers, actual backpacks instead of shopping bags, realistic armor and helmets, would probably attract a lot more players to the game.What should be improved at this time is to have the lobby actually in the game. Cause right now you need to enter a game to be able to change your settings. Key binds are also not working for me. I can't seem to change them. Also missing an option to bind every weapon on one key. Primary, Secondary. All I see is previous weapon which I don't like.In game the developers should just keep doing what there doing. I think there doing a great job!They keep bringing updates that fixes bugs and bring improvements to the game!As the game is free, there is no reason not to try it!Would I pay for this game? Absolutely yes!"",1"

Do not install.Edit: I was going to remove my review since they made Gaijin optional, then I saw a developer saying this:""""Gaijin net agent is completely harmless and useful software, and not using it can lead to delays in updates, if Steam updates are switched off/or not effecient.""""I fail to see why Steam updates would be switched off or would be inefficient. There are plenty of developers on Steam right now that don't use third party software to update their games. Whether you're referring to players disabling Steam auto update or you guys disabling Steam updates for the game yourselves, it really doesn't matter. Players that disable auto update do it for a reason, so you really can't call that inefficient. If you guys disable Steam updates for the game, then it better be for troubleshooting purposes. Other than that, the only reason I can see why you guys would do that is to encourage players to continue to use Gaijin by creating a problem that doesn't exist.One of the biggest issues with Gaijin is that some players have bandwidth limits, and when Gaijin is secretly seeding the game it uses up their bandwidth. It is literally stealing other people's data to save money. To these players who are spending money to update your game, it isn't harmless."",0"

"24783,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewSecretly installs the Gajin program to your computer. It also sets up your computer to auto seed the download to other users. Would not reccomend the game, especially since it secretly installs a client to run in the background and doesn't warn you or say anything when the game installs, unlike most other games that do this. Also the Gajin client stays on your computer even when you uninstall the game. I realize that other games install clients or launchers do this, but they have a popup when they do so and ask if you want to install their 3rd party client.The game itself runs bettter than most other BR games though and there is a bit of fun to be had for a few hours but the game only has 30 people per match"",0"

Why gaijin needs 2 applications (3 if we count in steam) for a simple update, I have no idea, but agent running in background like a malware (since task manager is the only place where you can see it running) after closing it and deleting the game is fishy.

Other games I will spawn in a decent location, and I'll end up looting 6 houses and leaving the area with a c96 pistol with 8 bullets and a pot on my head.

You get stuck constantly in invisible walls, the zone is changing and coming faster than ever, and since you cant determine your own spawn location, you most likely spend about 8/10th if the game running throught fields naked. The weapon balance is so ♥♥♥♥ed up, you get oneshot by an smg, but a butt-naked enemy needs atleast two hits  from a bolt-action sniper rifle to die.Not to mention that the spawnrate of weapons is ridiculously low. There were times when you loot a whole village, previously unvisited by any other player, and you are still lucky to find a pistol with a magazine or two.And the drop rate of any kind of loot is unchanged even in squads, so you have a good chance at finishing the game with two of your group members still not having a weapon.The developers really have to get themselves together to do anything, because atm it's comedic effects and originality are far overshadowed by TABG"",0"

"24842,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewConstant server lag and random framerate dips, each patch seems to make things only worse, errors don't help either.Random """"deviation"""" aka RNG with each shot (really?) , this is confirmed by the item """"eagle eye glasses"""" which remove -40% deviation.Horrible character movement, you'll have a feeling of sliding on ice.Nearly impossible to shoot over most cover due to the bullets seemingly exiting out of the character's relative height to the ground rather than leaving the barrel. Meaning that your barrel might be over cover to shoot, but if your character is too low compared to the cover, it'll hit the cover instead.Sometimes you hear footsteps, sometimes you don't.Lack of information how much damage weapons do and what's even your total hp among other things.Although the items """"knee pad of speed"""" and """"bunny slippers of bounce"""" are very fun (at first), they completely destroy any immersion you expect from an FPS.Bolt-action rifles are underpowered compared to other weapons, does not reward decent marksmanship, this is only made worse by """"knee pad of speed"""" and """"bunny slippers of bounce"""", effectively making bolt-action weapons even worse.A game that is based on WW2 somehow slips the AKM in the game, a weapon that has no downsides besides the ammo only being available from the """"Tactical"""" lootbox (that spawn in-game), but you usually don't need that much ammo anyways.Besides the usual annoying bugs that come with most Early Access games, there are some that are tied in with the genre of """"muh batul roial"""", namely, the ebola of first-person shooters where you have a choice to switch to third-person, it pretty much destroys the intensity of not knowing what's on the other side of the wall or who is on that wheat field while you lay there,  abusing that camera.  Some other issues, that can completely be attributed to the mantra of """"but it's just an Early Access game bruhhhh"""", although understandable, it does not improve the situation however, which is why i tend to steer clear of EA (and the company too). Lack of customization, maps, weaponry, for now, even for an EA.Since negative emotions tend to be stronger than positives, as seen previously, i'll list the positives.Decent graphics, good audio, gun gameplay would be ideal without the issues, framerates seemed to be okay earlier, introduction of some weapons that usually don't make the cut, it's free for now and for those that downloaded it (subject to change)"",0"

"24844,Cuisine Royale,,""Access ReviewCracking, ive played a few battle royal games, fortnite, pubg,bo4,ect, but this is by far the most fun, theres something oddly amusing about donking someone on the head with a pan. amazing game 10/10"",1"
"24845,Cuisine Royale,,""Access ReviewThis game may seem fun on the surface, and why wouldn't it? Great graphics, guns sound great, and who wouldn't want to run around while wearing a pot on your head? It all sounds great, until you realize the game controls feel like they were made for an Xbox controller, and climbing up ladders is absoutely abizmal. My friend and I came across a couple of bugs, the first bug we came across, I was on top of a car while my buddy was driving it, and he all of the sudden died, and it said it was ME who killed him. Another bug we came across was when me and him were crossing a bridge, and I just suddenly phased through the bridge. I couldn't move, I couldn't jump or prone or do anything to get out of it. The only reason why I was able to get out was because my friend drove up to me with a vehicle and I was able to get into it. If I was in a solo match, that match would have been done right then and there. On top of that, people are running around rampant with a golden pan that 1 shots people. In conjunction with them equipping boots of speed, which makes their movement speed 10x faster, virtually making them unkilliable. There are arguments on forums and threads saying """"git good"""" and that would be true, IF IT DIDNT 1 SHOT. Atleast the framerate was good, and the sounds were awesome. There is talks of hackers running around as well, however, I've never seen or caught anyone that was FOR SURE hacking. I mean there were some pretty fishy moments but nothing really solid. This game has a ton of kinks that need to be ironed out. TL:DRPro's: Good graphics and soundsCon's: 1 shot weapon in a battle royale game (seriously what were you thinking), game breaking bugs, and controls."",0"

Because of how inefficient guns are in this game, skill is not required, no matter how good your aim is, nothing matters, one minute you shoot someone several times with a browning auto 5, just to have your hopes of killing them perish when they survive because of how broken the healing system is, then you turn around to someone else and get one shot at full health by the exact same gun. And dont even get me started with pans. Now for the spawning system... I dont know if its just me, but every ♥♥♥♥ing time i spawn in (and keep in mind you dont have an option of where you spawn at so thats another con) I spawn at a tiny town, not even close to the playing area, with little to no guns/armor/food, and not a single form of transportation in sight.

"24853,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access Review Fantastic Cooking FunGameplayYou are dropped into a random part of the map after a loading screen of clouds, First thing you will notice is the game is actually really decent looking, With odd running animations, The game already has parkour and many many guns,and pots and pans to cover your a$$. Opening doors is very loud which is good and bad, It might be louder just on your own client. The game only has 30 people in it for the moment which seems to be great for the map size. The map is fantastic and looks alot like france/germany in ww2. Which is not surprising as this is a ww2 mod. The guns shot well but could do with some improvements. The end game is scary as hell, Wierd noises that sound like you're mothers bedroom on a sunday night. The starting screen leaves alot to be disered but its still early days. The best thing about the game I would say is it has its own spin on it. And no boring building! TL:DRI would give it a solid 7/10. Needs more work and all that but its great fun."",1"

The first person camera has your guy nearly the sight into his eyeball making it impossible to aim, and third person is no better with the reticle swinging all over the place.

"24893,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewPretty much like every other Battle Royale game. It has its good points. Graphics and environments are nice. Due to the armor mechanic being noisy kitchenware, the trade-off to being better armored is that people can hear you moving from a fair distance even if you're crawling.

"24928,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFun, a bit more laid-back BR game than the others.

There are only audio settings for now, movement can be pretty clunky sometimes, items you carry seem to 'glitch' all over the place making it harder to see in 1st person since there's a shopping bag in your face when you move.Fun game to play.

And getting into a game sucked because it either froze, or you just sat there waiting for ages. There's no settings for the game and no queue with friends.Also Gaijin.net is dodgy af.

However this last time I snuck up behind someone, shot him, he lived, of course. Then as hes hiding behind a tree, I shoot him, strafe right, he shoots me.. through the tree?

Spoiler alert: It sucks some serious magnum sized♥♥♥♥♥ Getting trapped behind the blue is basically death, but instead of being a tense way of keeping the game exciting it's basically just torturous attrition. You can't see past a certain distance and the amount a zone shrinks relative to the amount of stamina you have is stupid, so if you're behind that blue line you're basically getting pecked to death for 90 seconds. I wandered around for twenty minutes, then finally found another player, plugged him five times with a rifle and then got one shot.I can't wait for this genre to be dead. "",0"

"24967,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is a living testament that the PUBG devs are perhaps the most incompetent devs in history. Within months of developmnet, this game has more weapons, better graphics and more items than pubg. Sure, its rough and clunky but i was just amazed how much is actually in this game. PUBG devs just look useless compared to these other Battle Royale devs popping up. There is ZERO excuse for them not to be dropping bi-weekly content drops.

Cons-: Ladder Climbing,  Movemnt around corners/obsticalse,"",1"
24969,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is hilarious! It's like PUBG butr the movement is way more realistic. I feel like when this game was made it was made as a joke and someone developed it. Its right now a booming success so you need to try this! I would seriously consider buying this when its not free2play,1
24970,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Product received for freeEarly Access Reviewamazing game . For a game what was ment to make fun of the serious battle royal games . is quite fun and intense is some parts but really needs workshop added to the game so that we could re-skin or get new guns/vehicles in the game . and to add to all of what i just said its got way better graphics than PUBG,1

Hold on tight!Its great you should get it!!!3 game types so get your mates in on it too.This is now my top game to stream and I'm loving every second of it.The map is big and Im hoping for more players in the future but at the same time it flows nice!Get it, play it. Its FREEE!!!!"",1"
24972,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThe one and only complaint I have with this game right now is the friend play. Having to hit play at the exact same time as your buddy is pretty bogus haha. But other than that I really like how the game plays even at this early acess stage. Of course there's tweaking that needs to be done but it's still really fun.,1
"24973,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI lost an Overwatch comp game because the invasive updater closed my game window in the middle of a game, and wouldn't let me get back until I agreed to the update. This game installs a background updater that is pinned to the start-up. It was a pita to get rid of. Also the game play is buggy, and there aren't many options in the settings.  "",0"
"24974,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI'll continue to give the game a little more time to develop, but at the moment other than the scenery there isn't a whole lot to like about this game. The movement is clunky. You end up finding guns with no ammo anywhere near you which is great for getting murdered by someone who did find a gun and ammo. If you do manage to find a weapon and some ammo the fire fights don't aren't much fun.  Hopefully it keeps progressing and gives me some reason to really like it."",0"
"24975,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAlthough Battle Royale games are unskilled, boring and they're just becoming popular for some reason, this game is funnier than any BR games out there imo. It's got WWI and WWII simple weapons without any complicated attachments and scopes (just 2 or 3 so far). The only drawback is shooting, which is sometimes frustrating. Hope they'll keep updating it."",1"
"24976,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI like it but it needs improvement. First, a better way to spawn would be nice. Second, it needs a first person perspective option at least. I like the idea and the goofyness, but sometimes I die with one shot but people I kill take a whole magazine of a PPSH and then some. I feel like some ballancing is needed."",1"
"24977,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewGame seems to be in the very early stages of the game, after intalling a launcher client pops up, you click playthe only buttons you can really pick from is your server region, Music volume/master volume Mic On/Offand quick play. More options for graphics in-game but not that many choices.Game seems to be promising but I don't think it'll ever reach pubg. Game looks very good graphically though.6/10"",1"
24978,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewVery nice battle royale game. Would reccomend this spoof over PUBG and Fortnite. Very well made graphically although I would like to have access to graphics settings so i can run the game at a better FPS. Minor bugs. Overall very pleased.  :D,1
"24979,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is simply fun, a game that is not dominated by trihards, and a game that both looks and runs amazingly. You cna take your time learning and I found that even when you loose a match you will still of had a blast finding pots and pans and picking up appetizing buns."",1"
"24980,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewStupidest battle royale game ever,  i was in a fight with a guy, i shot 2 full magasines from a thompson or whatever at him and i saw like 50% of shots hitting the guy, red X pops up, and guy survived that, right after that he shot 3 shots on me and killed me with a similar weapon."",0"
"24981,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewCuisine Royale is a parody game of most battle royale games out there. Despite being a parody, it's actually one of the best battle royale games. I've played Fortnite, PUBG, and some other battle royale games. Despite that fact, I still think this is the best battle royale game out there.The art style is great. As a history lover, me and my friends all like the WWII setting and it's good to see what the game they're working on will become. The way the animations work is hilarious and goofy, purposefully, is great and it fits the design perfectly. The idea of protecting yourself with kitchen gear as a man in his underpants is comedic, and definately helps the game show it's a joke game.Even though it's a parody, it's better than PUBG. The gameplay is great, and is way faster than PUBG, and is less boring. A cuisine royale match takes 1/4 of the time that a PUBG match does, and you'll have more fun playing it. The game is fast-paced and gets your blood pumping, and it's realistic style helps it's surreal atmosphere. The gunplay is pretty solid except for some rather questionable times, and it remains to be fun even after multiple matches.In total, the game is great and I think it plays really well. With the ability to play squads and duos, it's really good to play with my friends and we love this quirky game. I would recommend getting it before it becomes paid."",1"
"24982,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewReal fun game. The first Battle Royale that motivates me to continue playing it. Not too much loot available, so gearing up can be challenging. But that's no problem as the map isn't filled with so many players. Also no cheaters met yet, seems like EAC and the matchmaking work pretty fine.Finding a game can sometimes take a moment, since there are not so many players yet, but hopefully it will get more popular in the future. Graphics are decent as well and it runs very very smoothly even on my old i7-2600k and a 390x at 2560x1080p.The kitchen and special items are a nice gimmick at least but don't affect gameplay too much. A real nice thing is, that while this game f2p, you can only buy cosmetic items that won't giye you any gameplay advantage over others.All in all a pretty fon game from the Battle Royale genre that is definitely worth a try."",1"
"24983,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewDoes some things better than PUBG but is not a better game than PUBG. The UX as a whole is atrocious and the p2p downloading without informing (you'll seed other downloads) is downright not acceptable. The game in it's current state is limited and it has time to grow but this, in the current state, feels like a clone of PUBG more than an actual Battle Royale game."",0"
"24984,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewi played for once match, i think i started out fairly good. a mosin nagant with a sniper. didnt had any tutorials or anything, but the keys for picking up stuff, walking, aiming n such wasnt that different from usual. i hear some fighting in the distance, i kept watching over my shoulder to make sure i wasnt being followed. then i spotted my first enemy. he didnt saw me and walked right past me. you'd think a naked body would stand out against a bunker wall. headshot. grabbed his walter pistol. then the zone became smaller. i ran along the river and saw the second person in the game. i line up my sight, shot him. shot him again, dead. nothing but empty weapons. as the zone became smaller and smaller, i ended up in a destroyed village.during this whole match, i seem to have lucked out. heard mostly only distant gunfire. the graphics are great and the map sure is big as hell. nothing the size you see call of duty ever make. and all this time, i felt happy, by the beauty of the map, by the placement of bushes and bunkers and even the destroyed town was a work of art to me. and then it struck me. this map is too good for just a battle royale game. ANOTHER. battle royale game. something that ruins the current gaming industry. how can such beauty, where an entire battlefield could rage, where tanks could further destroy the already destroyed town, why isnt the map allowed to be a feature of such a fight? instead, 32 players are wandering around in their underpants. looking for guns. and cooking equipment."",0"
"24985,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI understand that the game should be fun and silly seeing as what it is, but it's downright unplayable. The crosshair doesn't show where you're aiming, the knife is a one hit kill and it seems that no matter how much ammo you pour into someone, they won't die. I've only been killed by knives because nobody uses firearms. The movement is very bad and even though I have a low ping (roughly 30 ms) and high frames (120 frame locked) the game is very choppy. When I corrected the volume so the enviroment wasn't too loud, I noticed the gun fire was almost silent compared to footsteps, doors, ambient sounds, etc. I know I got it for free, but what about the people that pay for it? Had I paid for it, I would refund it almost immediately."",0"
"24986,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThey still have a long long way to go before I would consider this a playable game.  Everything seems to be held together with duct tape, it's very clunky, you cannot adjust ANY settings and the gunplay feels like more Fortnite than PUBG which is sad and awkward when it's graphically so similar to PUBG.  The biggest reason I'm uninstalling it right now however is because of the cancer known as Gaijin being installed on my PC without my permission.  Absolutely unacceptable.  Borderline criminal."",0"

Great responsive devs here to help even in the face of ignorance (me) and I'm grateful for the help. As for the game, it's fun, goofy, runs smoother than PUBG and with a WW2 theme backing it up, I'm sure any BR player can enjoy this. Can't wait for improvements!"",1"
24991,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewWould recommend this joke battle royale game if they didn't install some game agent I've never heard of and didn't add it to my startup programs.Game is okay. Tons of clipping issues and buggy gameplay. Have fun climbing that ladder.,0

"24993,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access Review+ Better Than H1Z1 + As graphics are forced people cant see you in grass / bushes from far away, so lowering graphics is not required. + Very Nice looking graphically,  With a surprisingly good WW2 southern france setting + Kind of slow movement and action , which is good, but a bit clunky like Rising Storm. + Runs great on midrange PC+ With more maps and a bit of refinement, it could be no1 battlegrounds game. + Really cool powerup items, like slippers that allow you to jump high, or medical drip that autoheals you.. - Only way I can see how to view options like controls or graphic are while in game- Sometimes visuals are bright and blurry in some areas, like indoors or due to time of day or maybe I just need 4k.- Only 1 map- No progession"",1"

24995,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewA complete Ripoff Of PUBG but made in a Way to bring the fun of the main game.By showing of those pans and bowls being striped to the body as an armour workaround it's gotta be fun!But some points right now bothers me are the engine stability and the Configuration made available to the Players.Which are near to Non. which gave me the power to unistall this game.

"24996,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewLong story short i would not recamend this game. Long story long, With my 19 hours of this game i have played roughtly 50-60 games and won a few but currently there is hackers terrible RNG for weapons and many stupid glitchs in the game i will describe 1 example of eatch. I have witnessed a person shooting throgh multiple walls in a differnt house into my house with a shot gun the Browning Auto 5 1 shotting me when i was not visable ontop of a house watching him (because there is third person which should not be in a FPS). Weapons in this game suffer terrrible RNG spikes and will do eaither massive amounts of damage for little to nothing i will give 2 cases for this, I myself have with the MG42 shot some one well over 7 times in the chest and head when in turn him shooting me once with an mp40 kills me, my other example is with shot guns i have shot people killing them with 1 shot i have even gotten a 12 kill game using nothing but a shot gun and i spent 15 shell casings the entire game in other games i have with the same shot gun loaded some one with 3-4 shots into their entire body including limbs chest and head  from what would be considerd point blank range and not killing them and in turn being killed with pistols, semi auto rifles, auto rifles and even a knife. for glichs i have driven my car under water acrost the little rivers to the other side and not die other times i have hit people with cars and they spin off into no were the same happening to me and when i had the slippers that make you jump i jumped up into the air and when i landed on the bunker i fell throgh the floor and under ground were it was modled under the bunker (excuse my poor spelling, i did fail spelling after all XD ) and after doing this i shot throg hthe wall killing multipl people that i could see on the other side of the wall. So over all i would not recamend this game is not worth your time your just going to get upset. (go play War Thunder ^_^)"",0"

I really wish that the devs could finish writing the code for this game before they deside to make cosmetics, being the soccer themed boxers. As you play, you will find yourself spawning in front of a pre-looted house, then you will go to an already looted village to try to find a pistol. You may find a car or truck, and if you do you will probably use the vehicle to try and get a kill to make an attempt to get a weapon. Then you will learn that the vehicle will not actually register hits on the foe you decide to pummel, and then you will attempt to kill him with your knife, and get sprayed down. But you manage to push through his rain of bullets. You now knife the enemy. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?!? You lunge through him, and do not register a hit. Then you start to smap LMB. you manage to kill him with your knife, but some how (don't ask me how, I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue.)

It shows a lot of promise, but there's just one problem.The launcher/updater is god awful. One of the worst things is that it automatically seeds after download by default. Which is pretty annoying to start, but you can still turn it off so it's forgivable right?No such luck. Whenever you turn off seed after download the launcher will automatically turn it on again every update.It's just too bad. and It's extremely annoying.

Unable to connect to the server also, keep saying connection lost no matter what I do. VPN or not. This game has potential but has the worse servers I've ever seen. They took PUGB and made it worse. currently, if the connectivity isn't fixed, I rate it 0/10 because of how un-playable it is.

"25053,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThe graphics are really dope and well optimized. The gameplay is clunky and the menu/settings are lacking but thats to be expected of EA. Strange, humorous theme of men in their underwear with cooking utensils for armor and WW2 guns. Kind of bizarre imo but okay.Why I disliked the game: game launches in a seperate application when the match starts--- so thats 3 apps, a launcher, a menu and the actual game running. Do the devs not know how to put together a game...? Next, the client runs in the background. It launches when you start up your PC so I assume it installed some unwanted registry key that I didn't give any consent to. Finally, my desktop completely froze up when I switched windows to start up a recording. The cursor was locked in place so I couldn't do anything and alt-tabbing caused the window switching menu to freeze in the middle of my screen forcing me to reboot. No thanks, don't want to deal with that again especially since I was in the middle of backing up data when it happened."",0"

25094,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is like playing a dude that is drunk and he got on pans and bags on his arms. When you go to try to aim its all slow and you have no control. 123FPS and it plays like 1.23 fps. That will be a no for me dawg.,0
25095,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access Reviewgreat stuff but once again it seems these games these days cant stay way from ♥♥♥♥ing RUNNING ZOMBIES. when the hell are people going to get that it makes these games inbalanced as ♥♥♥♥. they are just a bother. nothing more. no depth to an other wise decent game. diffently worth a cheap buy. shocked its for free.,0
25096,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access Reviewthis game is more unfair than csgo when i played i hit people many times in the head and squat diddly nothing happend then i get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing masecerd by a shot 1 shot,0
"25097,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewone of the most pointless, irritating two step verification thats shoved down your throat. I had to make a new accoount because i couldnt verify mine because i never got the email. and then on my second account i got the email but Gaijin wouldnt let me confirm it. Fun game just hate how i cant play because no matter what i cant 2 step authenticate any account so im giving the worse review possible. if you can someone could explain how to do this that would be great.

25098,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access Reviewawkward movement system and every move u make is so loud just play something else doesnt feel like that there is a skill cap either its really easy to get kills and get killed,0
"25099,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewok, try to look past the quircky name and cuisine itemization.it's a smaller scale ww2? battle royale, the map is smaller but fuller/denser/, buildings are furnished , wrecked and busted.the game looks good and runs ok on a 1060. "",1"
25100,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewIt's a bit too rushed not saying its bad but I can never get into a game and whenever I do It just shows me the list of players in the lobby whenever I launch the game it says failed to connect if I do get in somehow 50% of the time it freezes and crashes and also quick game never works I understand its in beta but these things are the first you should be worrying aboutit has great potential but somethings just dont work.,0

"25102,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewthis is basically malware, its fun yes but it behaves exactly like malware..: -installs some dodgy torrent♥♥♥♥♥♥it uses to update-seeds the torrent on its own-auto starts itself and updates-doesnt delete when its uninstalled. This game constantly updating in the background even when i've tried to disable it caused me to have latency issues beyond belief for any game i play on my system. not worth it bois. "",0"
25103,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access Reviewit wont ever uninstall! this game is decent but when you uninstall it because it gets boring like every other game. i try to and think i did just to turn my pc on to see that BS startup window for the ♥♥♥♥ing game.,0
"25104,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewReally fun to play in Geforce NOW, but still don't know why people are still butthurt about the """"malware"""".This is how you uninstall it: """"HOW TO REMOVE GAIJIN AGENT.The agent is NOT malware as some very uninformed individuals here claim with absolutely no evidence to support their case. It is nothing but disinformation. The agent acts very much like a number of software update programs. Even your Operating System and Anti Virus software does this. To Remove it.For Windows 7:Open a command line (press Win+R or click on the start button and use the seach line) Enter """"msconfig.exe"""" into the text box. In the System Configuration tool - go to the startup tab and disable / uncheck the gaijin.net agent.on Win8 / 10:Open the Task Manager, Select the startup tab and disable the gaijin.net agent.Shut down the gaijin.net agent in the system tray (right click to get the Exit option).if you want to completely remove the agent you need to go to the following folder and delete it:c:\users\<username>\AppData\Local\Gaijin\The AppData folder can be hidden in some installations.https://support.gaijin.net/hc/en-us/articles/115001876905-Gaijin-AgentHowever, if you remove it. Do not then moan and complain about long downloads etc when a major update of the game is released. This is one of the things the Agent minimizes!"""""",1"
"25105,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewEverytime you die, you basically need to reload the entire game. Horrible design. Load game, wait in queue, after about 1-2 minutes, then the actual session has to load, play, die, do that all over again. I've got better things to do with my time..."",0"
25106,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access Reviewdo not install this game its published by the same company who published war of thunder which comes with spyware automaitcally installed with the game on your computer lf you do install this game remove it and uninstall gaijen.net ,0
"25107,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewIt installs Gajin launcher and its literally impossible to unistall (Steam doesnt give a **** and its your problem).Also, the game is poorly optimized, laggy, 30 players lobby, no coop parties, buggy. Just terrible, no competition to other battleroyales. Terrible, Terrible."",0"
"25108,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewGame looks cool and has potential, however I have to give it a negative cause weapons do too much damage. You can oneshot or be oneshotted even if you have full armor and full health."",0"
25109,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewInstalls 3rd party software (gaijin) that prevents you from properly deleting the game from steam. The software also stays open in the backround and wants to automatically run with windows. Ocassionaly updates the game in the backround and causes performance issues on computer that annoying to detect if you do not know beforehand of this program. Lastly the program is staggeringly difficult to delete and should no be on your computer in the first place in my opinion.,0

"25113,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access Review★☆☆☆☆Current state of the gaming industry:A literal (April Fools') joke has more players than 100hour long RPGs which took actual time, effort, and talent to develop.  GG Gamers.  Cuisine Royale is a bare-bones scam clone.  Pro/Con Feature List:+ Decent sound design+ The graphics are pretty, and run well+ Equipment shows on your player, ridiculously+- Vaulting mostly works+- Grass flops over while you lay on it+- Custom launcher?  At least it uses Steam accounts- Stamina- FPS-view is buggy- Pickup inferior items- Long loading screens- No progression system- Insta-spawn at a random location- Clunky movement and interactions- Only one mode.  Solo vs 30 players- No character creation or customization- Can't access setting from the main menu- Menu made with 30 seconds worth of programmer art- Godawful shooting mechanics, possibly the worst of all time- The only weapon attachment seems to be a scope for sniper rifles- Installs 3rd party software that permanently runs in the background, even after you uninstall the game- """"Fair Play Loot Boxes"""", which I wouldn't even consider loot boxes, involve you spamming a button on them to spawn generic loot nearby- The theme of this game has absolutely no impact on the game.  """"Cuisine Royale"""".  You wear cook-wear as armor?  Wow?  Guns are still guns.  The world is still a normal world.  Literally the only change made, to fit the theme, is that helmets are colanders.* Installs 3rd party software that permanently runs in the background, even after you uninstall the game"",0"

25115,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis is a game made by Gaijin. A Russian company that is notorious for shady practices by consumers and partners alike. Do not trust Gaijin.

"25116,Cuisine Royale,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI think all the good reviews are fake here :/, the game doesnt feel smooth at all, I get less fps than in pubg, movement feels very weird, shooting feels very weird as well, graphics are okay but the game itself is not smooth at all."",0"
