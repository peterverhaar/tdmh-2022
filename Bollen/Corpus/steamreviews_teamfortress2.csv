"4068,Team Fortress 2,2018.0,""This game was recommended to me by my brother (aside from my soviet brothers), and I mained Heavy, one of the classes in the game.I remember talking to my siblings about their paranoia, my brother told us that he was paranoid of spiders, my sister then added that she's paranoid of the dark and I told them I was paranoid of spies. They laughed, I laughed, my sister's clone laughed, I shot the clone of my sister, then we all laughed. ......Honestly, this game gave me the """"sphas"""" paranoia.11 Heavies out of 10, would recommend this game.

"4069,Team Fortress 2,2012.0,""A game that will not only get you addicted to hats, but also hyped up about bread!The goal in this first-person shooter multiplayer video game is to choose a team (RED/BLU) and beat the other team in 8 different official game modes (king of the hill, capture-the-flag, push-little-cartâ€¦). Inside a team you can select one of nine classes with each class having its strength and weaknesses which guarantees thereâ€™ll be a game style that fits you. You can also play co-op where you team up with six other people to kill robots who came to attack the 'Mann.co Store'. Besides these official game types there are many others created by the community such as a medieval, prophunt,..If you ever get bored with playing, which is unlikely -but it can happen after more than 2.000 hours-, you can always start collecting hats by trading, reason why itâ€™s often referred to as the number one hat-simulator.Before this game I wouldnâ€™t even have considered playing any cartoon-like games. But Iâ€™m glad someone converted me. Itâ€™s a game that's filled with humor and will not get you bored easily. More importantly, itâ€™s free, why shouldnâ€™t you give it a try at least?But the biggest advantage of all is that this is a very social game which you can play with friends. And for the people who don't have any friends: with this game you'll sure get some!Even if this game has been out there for a while, itâ€™s still being updated on a regular basis. New game modes and hats created by the developers and community are regularly being pushed forward and major events are happening at Halloween, Christmas and Easter.There is only one downside I can think of: itâ€™s quite large in size. So make sure you have enough disk space."",1"
"4070,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,""This shooting game where cosmetics are more important than weapons introduces the player to a world where two teams of mercenaries fight each other in various modes like King of the Hill, Payload Race and Capture the Flag. There is also the Mann vs Machine mode where a small team fights giant hordes of robots.Play as the 9 different mercenaries, each with their own abilities and personality quirks. No matter your skill or playing style, there's a class that suits it!You'll surely enjoy this game that never gets old thanks to the frequent updates that bring new content such as hats, maps, weapons and gamemodes. And the best part is that it's NOT pay to win, since the game is well balanced and you can get weapons for free fairly easily. Your only concern will be getting more cosmetics!Team Fortress 2 is pure multiplayer fun, and one of the best games I've ever played."",1"
"4071,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""This game can be played both casually or competitively, as an ex-comp player, trader, coach for newer teams, and the all round pub stomper, I can say that this game has taken up a lot of my free time. Learning each class is a new experience and opens up another dimension to the game in which you have never seen before. A few examples are medic, which showed me how important heals were in a game"
"4072,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""Hat Simulator 2: Hat harder, what can I say about it that hasn't been said already? It's fun, it's free, it's got cool stuff that is seriously underplayed, and the classes and asthetic are nearly timeless. But, you've heard that a thousand times. What of the meat and bones? The mechanics that everything is built on? Gotta say, hella good. The interplay of a lot of slightly different weapons and the drastically different classes combines well with the objective focus, but more importantly it makes you ask yourself silly questions. Like, """"what if I ran a melee medic?"""" """"or a melee heavy?"""" """"What could make this more fun to play?"""" It is a great game, with great appeal, but most importantly the mechanics are fun. Plus who could argue with the price? Now if they would just do more with the magic spells, and medieval mode, and the bosses, then I would have no complaints."",1"
"4073,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""Im not great at writing reviews but here goes nothing. Team Fotress 2. Where do i begin. I won't go too deep into detail but this game can be a ton of fun. It has litterally 100's of ways to customize your classes and loadouts with the ability to name and describe them to boot. Another great thing is that this game is also free 2 play so you don't have to shell out money if your just looking for a fun online FPS game.If i had any crap i could say about this game is that it has  poor performence even though i do own a computer MORE than capable of playing this game at a nice stable frame rate of 60. Every update seems to kill the performence more and more lowering FPS for everyone. For those who have lower end computers with decent parts but nothing spectacular,approch this one with caution."",1"
"4074,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Team Fortress 2 is a very hard game for me to look at objectively, as my hours kind of attest to. In the 3000+ hours I've spent with this game running, I've come to know a handful of internationally based friends who I respect and value dearly, made $20,000 at the very least in the trading scene and made a name in (and run afoul) of multiple in-game communities. It's a game that's consistently evolved, from the gameplay centric days of old before hats worth more then a year in College were a common thing, to the particle and taunt based, mish-mash of an experiment that it is now. I was once a free-to-player. I played it for a good 9 months before deciding to finally try being a premium. That's how it got me. I first bought a unique 'Huntsman' from the in-game store. Then I found a Phlogistinator in a timed drop and going off what the in-game store was selling them for at the time, I tried selling it for $20 on TF2Outpost. Those were simpler times. From there I ended up investing $1000 (real world dollars) into virtual items, and ended up making a veritable goldmine out of the investment, in more ways then one. I could dedicate a long spiel to discussing how the trading community is a meta-game in itself, one where real tangible thousands of dollars can change hands in seconds in the form of a virtual hat or a golden pan, but I really just wanted to make this review to reflect my own experiences with the game. This is a very fun, very addictive game.It is held aloft after close to ten years since release by a very receptive community who care about the game and keep it going strong. At any given time, there's anywhere from 50,000-70,000 players online, so there's nothing to stop you jumping right into the thick of things with communities with depth and breadth beyond that of any other game I've played. You will be able to find a niche that fits, a casual or modified gamemode that appeals and you will have a hard time leaving. You'll make friends, you'll make enemies (especially if you try to get into trading seriously) and you won't forget the time you spend in this game.In light of recent divisive updates, there's a lot that can be respected by how the community bands together to tell Valve what they want and actually see a response. It's a testament to the strength of the community and their combined interest in seeing the game live for many years to come. For many people, such as myself, I'm sure they see a lot of experiences in this game have led them to friendships and communities in the real world, and I'll always be thankful for the time I've had in this game in allowing me to have experiences I would not have been able to otherwise.For the experience, and for knowing that it will continue to be a game that will stand the test of time, I give Team Fortress 2 a very warm recommendation. Just know when to put it down, remember, 3000 hours is close to 5 months playing 24/7."",1"

"4076,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""I can honestly say, this is one of the best games i have ever played, i have been playing for 3 years now, and i have yet to get bored, it seems there are always new things, not only does it have a great weapon system and diffrent uses fir diffrent weapons, it has a beutifal customization system, hats miscs, its amazing, and it has a personality for each class and i love it, not to mention it has that classic game sort of feel, it brings health packs into the game, a use for each class, i really recomend this game to people who are tired of call of duty, and battle field, not trying to say that those two are bad, i played them, but it reapeated, nothing much new, so if you are looking for a good game, i higly recommend this =)"",1"
"4077,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""Probably the worst FPS of all time, where your chance of winning is decided by the amount of headwear one can use. And as the heavy's head is the biggest, he is obviously the most op class. Scout is a manifestation of post-marxism homosexual propaganda masked with a Boston accent to calm the Italians. Soldier does not only suffer from heavy mental retardation he is also a extremely nationalistic American, basically male Sarah Palin. The Demoman is a anti-stereotypical to the point that it becomes offensive, trying to detract from his african american origin as much as possible. The pyro is the gimp from Pulp fiction with a flamethrower, not only is that copyright infringement but also damaging the image of latex fetishists all around the world. The sniper is the most incorrect character since 1. He is not a kangaroo and 2. He isn't upside down. The Medic is a nazi. The heavy is a false display of an incredibly overweight Putin with an insuffurable amount of brain cells. The spy is a meek attempt at poking at the french which fails by him not actually being offensive at all. 10/10 best game ever."",1"

"4079,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""Got this game in 2008 on """"The Orange Box"""". Sometimes, you will play for the entire week of how this game is/was awesome playing. Then you'll start to be bored of the current gamemodes/maps you have already played. You'll get that long break, after some months, you will start to play the game again.It's a fun FPS, still popular, gets good updates from Valve and be sure to always invite your friends to play with you"
"4080,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""I've split up this review into different fractions to make reading easier.IntroductionTeam Fortress 2 is a free to play, class-based multiplayer FPS.This means that the game has classes, which differ from each other with their skills, mobility, health and weapons.Team Fortress 2 is mainly based around team-based gameplay, introducing older and newer-styled game modes, mainly from classic FPS games like Quake and Unreal Tournament.Game ModesOver the years the game has been filled with lots of different game modes with different objectives. The current amount of Game modes is 19. I'm not going to list every one of them, but i've picked couple intriguing ones:Capture the Flag (CTF): A game mode where the objective is to Capture a Flag from the other team's base, and carry it to your own base.Control Points (CP): A game mode where other team is attacking, and the other is defending. The objective is either capture all the points (by standing on the point for few seconds) or defend them for being captured.King of the Hill (KOTH): A game mode where there is a capture point in the middle of the map. The team which stands on the point for the longest, wins.Classes and Their PersonalitiesThe game has 9 different classes divided into 3 categories (Offensive, Defensive & Support.)If you're a Lore Lover (like me), there's a lot of lore and backstories from the characters. They're not very visible through the game, but they can be found in the shape of comics and animated short films at Team Fortress 2's youtube and their official website.Offensive: Scout, a fast and eager boy from boston with an ability to double jump. Soldier, a crazed american patriot with an ability to Rocket Jump. Pyro, a flamethrower-wielding maniac with a mysterious past.Defensive: Demoman, drunk irishman specialized into explosives. Heavy(-weapons guy), a very slow but large russian man, who favors the use of minigun. Engineer, an intelligent texan who uses Turret to secure passages and areas.Support: Medic, a mad doctor specialized in healing. Sniper, an australian who takes out targets from a great distance. And last, but not least: Spy, a cunning frenchman using disguises to fool enemies and then backstab them.Mobility and MovementThe game brings back Rocket Jumping, a type of movement used in series of games like Quake & Unreal Tournament.Using a Rocket Launcher and shooting against your own feet, you can push yourself into great hights.Strafing, a type of movement where you move to right or left in-game, whilst horizontally moving your mouse.Combining Strafing and Rocket Jumping, you can travel large distances with incredible amounts of speed. However, this requires lots of training and precise timing.Cosmetic Items and TradingAt March 18th, 2010, the first few cosmetic items were added to the game. After many years few have turned into dozens, and dozens into hundreds. These items can also be painted, making them more customizable and fun to use.You can customize your character to your liking, and be almost anything you desire"
"4081,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""Amazing game, best game. Taunts, hilarity, hats, guns, robots, wizards, comics, lore, jumps, movement, rocket launchers, grenade launchers and swords! All this compressed into one single game for you to play, what more can you ask for? c:"",1"
"4082,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""TF2 has been ruined by this recent update, hopefully valve will bring back the old tf2 someday. TF2 was amazing already, newest update ruined it. I mean like seriously why do you need competitive for casual? Can't we have fun without the confusing update? The community wants the old tf2 back!"",0"
"4083,Team Fortress 2,,""2010Team Fortress 2 is a very decent racing game. First of, the vehicles in this game are somewhat strange. Instead of licensed vehicles we get stuff like Heavy, Soldier, and Scout. The vehicles are all different in their own rights, for example: the Heavy is the slowest, the Scout is the fastest, and the Medic is normal speed.Classes in this game seem to be slightly broken, however. The Medic class vehicle is near useless on its own, and only serves a purpose when teamed up with a second vehicle. This will either serve to slow him down immensely, such as when healing a heavy, or let the teammate he is healing get away from him because the teammate, such as the Solider, is faster than the medic.The level design is beautiful, but Take Two, in an attempt to create an immerse and beautiful world, forgot that these types of tracks aren't really suitable for racing, taking place in such areas as underwater, in long corridors, and intelligence rooms. But some of the levels seem to be made for racing, such as 2fort, but there is no finish line,The fun thing is that each vehicle has a weapon to take out the other players. Of course, you can only take players that aren't wearing your vehicle colors. For example, the Heavy has a weapon that literally takes out everything in sight except that it slows him down to a halt, the Pyro has a weapon that sets fire to anyone and anything, and so on and so fourth. It seems similar to Mario Kart, with the various courses and powerups. However, it fails to capture the fun of Mario Kart, and instead going in an ultra-realistic direction that often looks quite boring and blandThe major flaw in TF2 is that there really is no direction as to where you should be going. There are no checkpoints and no wrong way markers. Valve did include a """"map"""" that changes between tracks but it is very confusing and really, isn't beneficial. These maps are nearly identical anyways, so changing the maps seemingly randomly only serves to aggravate the players more.While the tracks and graphics are fun and creative, this racing game is lacking in many ways. I wouldn't recommend this game to game owners if they had access to a console, as this PC-only racer doesn't seem to try hard enough to stand out from the crowd."",1"
"4084,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Team Fortress 2 is a fun game, and for better or for worse, itâ€™s one thatâ€™s best experienced by putting a lot of time into it. There are hundreds of weapons that have different strengths, weaknesses, and special effects, which means that a dedicated player will find a lot of enjoyment in playing for a long time and trying to collect the best ones for their chosen classes. The colorful and humorous style of the game makes it a joy to watch and hear as you play, and the class-based system makes teamwork very important. All in all, it is a very well-made and enjoyable multiplayer shooter, and itâ€™s completely free, making it a great choice for someone who wants to enjoy a video game with their friends. That said, itâ€™s not the ideal game for someone who just wants to spend a few minutes every now and again"
"4085,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""I don't like giving such a great game a bad review. I am doing it because I have played for 2000 hours and it seems like the only way to communicate with Valve is via reviews. They communicate as well as a Tree.I played the Competitive beta. I did not like it. It seemed halfâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ rushed, and filled with problems. I don't like 6 man teams. I don't like the super competitive preassure. I  most of all don't like the changed rules that apply even on """"Casual""""  (i.e. using stopwatch, queueing after every match, no votes to extend/change map, no real choice in maps). Casual is just an unranked version of Competitive. It seems to me this is the height of arrogance, ramming down a mode that a majority or at least a large segment didn't want. I will reduce my play time and try to support community servers as I can, I am not happy.This review will stay negative until this is addressed, either by Valve readding pubs or the community adding a lot of vanilla servers (of the latter, I am skeptical)."",0"
"4086,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""The REAL Casual Mode is Quickplay. Everybody loves quickplay. Most people I see online have spent an accumulative half-year of their lives playing on quickplay.If Valve has a problem with people being THAT dedicated, then I don't reccommend it."",0"
"4087,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Before the Meet your Match update, this would be an extremely positive review. the gameplay is balanced, its fun, and best of all, it's free. but thanks to the meet your match update, this game is unplayable. and i dont mean its really bad, i mean you literally cannot play. I spent 20 minutes in the queue for a casual game. and for some reason there is a leavers penalty for a casual game. do not waste your time on this game like I have."",0"
"4088,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""TF2 is my favorite multiplayer game of all time, just look at my hours. However, the TF2 team has been tearing apart the things that kept me playing the game for thousands of hours, and with the release of the Meet your Match update, its basically the final nail in the coffin for TF2They removed all the Valve pubs in favor of one of the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest matchmaking services in any game I've ever seen. The """"Casual"""" mode has leaver penalties, inability to pick the map and gamemode you want to play, and takes an hour to get you into a game where the old system took ~30 secondsIn the face of Overwatch, the TF2 team has been tearing apart the game in the delusional hopes that it'll become a big eSport and stand up against their biggest competitor. In doing so, they've destroyed the thing thats made this game so appealing after almost 10 years. The original charm of the game is dead and gone.Until the TF2 team gets their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ together, and starts realizing what has made this game as undying and long lasting as it is, I wouldnt reccomend touching it."",0"
"4089,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""I doubt anybody really needs to be told why to try Team Fortress 2, especially with its reputation and lack of a price tag, but I suppose I should throw my 2 cents in anyway.Team Fortress 2 is a fun game that gives you fun options in how you want to play. You get 9 classes to toy with, each having an interesting personality and a unique playstyle. Then, as you play, you'll come across weapons that let you experiment within each class's playstyle. The more you play, the more stuff you amass, and the more options you'll have at your disposal. If you haven't already, take a dip into the world of Team Fortress 2. You're almost guaranteed to find something you like!"",1"
"4090,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""as of the 07/07/16 update, i can no longer recommend this game in good faiththe new 'casual' mode is about as far from casual as you could possibly get. hopefully valve realises the mistakes they've made regarding quickplay, and rectifies them sooncommunity servers were sent to their grave a long time ago, and i'm not about to start trawling the cemetery looking for an ad-free, watermark-free, bot-free, MoTD-free place to play stock tf2 on "",0"
"4091,Team Fortress 2,2012.0,""One of the best online multiplayer games I have ever played, both satisfying and thrilling. You would have to be a fool not to give this game a try. Valve, thanks for creating this spectacular game, You're the best! Even after 9k hours"",1"
"4092,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Good game, casual is not balanced, there is no auto balance, they disabled it, most games are one sided. one team dominating the other. check out community servers they are good. ga"",1"
"4093,Team Fortress 2,2011.0,""Highly competitive shooter for tryhards. Make no mistake on that. Valve markets it as something else but it doesn't change what it is. It's NOT easy to pick up. If you're new to quake-like shooters, you'd better have a friend already playing it explain the basics to you, or you might get frustrated by some things.Public pvp and pve (known as mvm in tf2) servers are suitable for casual players once the basics are learned. If you don't want to go comp you can stop there and have quite a bit of fun.Sweaty competitive tryhards will really see where this game shines though. Well balanced, competitive modes will bring your tactical sense and deathmatch ability to a real test. Despite Valve overlooking the competitive format, multiple leagues have arisen offering unforgettable experience for teams on any skill level. If You want to do team based esports, look no further than TF2, this game has more competitive spirit in it than LoL and DOTA combined.As for visual aesthetics the game looks well despite its age, thanks to its stylised look. Some items from content updates are very much out of the game's theme, though, which is very disappointing given how unique that theme is. The game is poorly optimised in some instances too, (especially mvm), but that can be solved by fps boosting configs.All in all:Iz good."",1"
"4094,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""This game has been a favourite of mine for 3 years, First time you play Team fortress 2 it may seem pay 2 win but trust me its not. This game has a large skill level and tons of content to keep you going, Now that being said this game is not without its down sides (meet your match) The meet your match update removed the quick play system in exchange for the casual and competitive scene, This maybe good for some people who play TF2 to win but for people like me who play tf2 to have fun then basically your playing on community servers. However if you like the sound of people raging and just arguing over who ever is using a weapon that is considered poor tast (black box,dead ringer and the reserve shooter) then go right ahead, How that being said i do enjoy this game as some times you can get into a server full of really nice and decent people who dont lose thereÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥over someone using the reserve shooter.

Start saying TF2 is Half Alive because the next update will be released simultaneously in relation to HL3."""" ~Scootie's Groupie Publicity Blurb =.=Okay, enough with the edgy jokes. This game is amazing, the community's strong resolve is amazing, the upcoming updates sound amazing (ie. Pyro, Jungle, New Contracts, etc), the friendliness of players in general is amazing for a top 5 Steam game compared to others *cough cough* CS:GO Dota 2 *cough* and most importantly it has, and always will be, regarded as an amazing game by the general gamer society. For me, TF2 was the first game I had played for longer than 10 hours. I still remember the thrill and excitement I got when I played my first game, completely oblivious to anything that was going on. I thought to myself """"Omg, game is awesome! Must play more!"""" and before long I bought my very first (of many...) Steam gift card and purchased a Huo Long Heater for 7 dollars from the Mann co. Store. Ouch. After a few months of playing, as well as obliviously killing Hightower friendlies, I started to """"get gud"""" with a positive K-D ratio. I mained Scout like the trash I am to this date, and began to play seriously. I had fun times, I had salt times (I quit TF2 twice for a few months because I was playing poorly). Then I realized. """"For me, TF2 is about having fun and meeting new people, not sweating and raging because I can't get a godlike killstreak on Tryhard Tuesday"""" and I changed my stigma towards the game completely. I thought about how TF2 had been a massive stepping stone for me, and how I had really kicked off my Steam profile by teaming up with some of my soon-to-be US friends to play Milk Scout in MvM. These people remain on my 510-strong friendslist to this very date, and I am extremely indebted to them. Without TF2, I would have still been an edgy Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥boi (I still am, but on a lesser scale) with a huge social life instead of a significant online one. So I ask myself the big question: """"Is TF2 dying?"""" """"Is TF2 dead?"""" """"Is Scout a girl?"""". To put it shortly- No. TF2 will never die as long as SOMEONE plays it, unless the game is completely abandoned and becomes incompatible with our Computers (unlikely). My advice to those sceptical about the current state of TF2 is to have patience. Just wait. Things are looking up, and hopefully the upcoming updates won't be Meet your Match 2.0.

"4099,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""For being a free to play game, Team Fortress 2 is the best one out there. Not only does it have a wonderful competitive aspect to it, but each class has its own unique role in securing the win for the team. Besides being a well thought out, and constantly updating (for free), the game has by far the most hilarity in an fps that I've ever played. There are moments where you are just dumbfounded by what just happened, or busting out laughing, or raging like crazy for coming so close to that incredible trickstab or market garden. The classes have their own playstyles which suit certain people the best. I enjoy the Spy the most, because it requires tact, quick thinking, and deception to get your kills and stay alive. You also annoy the crap out of the other team when you get good. And it is so rewarding... :DOverall, download this game because it's very fun to play alone, but especially with friends who can laugh/rage/cheer along with you."",1"
"4100,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""If I had to describe this game in a single word it would be FUN.Team Fortress 2 is a beautiful combination of sarcasm, weird humor, dynamic gameplay and comix-like graphics. And it works together just great. The game offers several gamemodes from standard ones like CTF and control points to some unique ones like Payload (a team has to push a cart from A to B)I've had so much fun with this game I couldn't even decribe it. It's amazing. This is the only game where you can hide as an invisible Spy under a box behind an enemy sniper while provoking him with shouting annoying things like that your knife will soon be in his back while he is trying hard to focus on aiming. This is the only game where you can start playing with a duck in a small pool in the middle of battlefield.

"4102,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""I got this game in the orange box back when the game still cost money, and I have never for a second of my life regretted that purchase. Over 4600 hours over a span of 5 years I've played this game and watched it grow, add new things. I was there from The Hatless update April 14, 2011 up to the 2016 Smissmas update. The game always kept me captivated even though it was running into slopes and making decissions I wasn't very fond of. If its something Valve are masters on it is to build a game that's all about the gameplay. Its by their flawless designs that their games like Left 4 dead, Counter-strike and Team Fortress have been played for and continues to be played to this day, despite some of them being decades old. Looking at Team Fortress 2 it is very easy to see it as simplistic and very lacking when compared to modern games, especially when 2016 saw a surge of other class-based arena shooters like Overwatch and Battleborne (haha) I will say I played Overwatch for about a year, it was the christmas of 2016 when I first got Overwatch and at the start, I enjoyed it. But over the year I played it the sessions when I played it grew further and further appart, until I only ever played on mondays when the arcade loot boxes reset and then didn't touch the game. It was then I really started to recognize the sheer detail of this game, how it had been polished to perfection. Something as simple as the loadouts, simple change of weapons could completely alter the playstyle of characters in this game, swap the Engineer's wrench out for a Gunslinger and you got a engineer who can be on the Offensive rather than Defensive. The medic's main weapon, syringe gun vs blutsauger changes whether he's a battle medic or not. The syringegun allows you a passive health regen of 4hp but blutsauger gives you health per projectile hit but decreases your health regen by 3 points, making your best way of gaining health to be on the offensive, and makes running and shooting back at a chaser a larger chance of survival than having to rely on passive health regen after escaping close encounters.That's only 2 examples of ways classes can change depending on their loadout. Every time you had to prepare for something new because each enemy could be playing differently depending on their loadout. In games like Overwatch your hero has counters, meaning you can't master a class to the point where you're unbeatable because he's been designed around a rock-paper-scissors design to where some hero can take you out. In this game it was just about picking a class, selecting a loadout that suits your playstyle and going to town. There was very little counters, each class could take out the other equaly so long as you played it right. (with 1 class exception..) The community also helped make this game great, by offering custom game modes, custom maps, custom servers. It was not only a well constructed game but a game that allowed you to mod it, allowed the community to create and take part in it. Something Overwatch doesn't allow past letting them design skins.. What has caused my decline of interest in the game has been that I feel it has lost its way. Many of the people I used to play with have moved on and the community isn't the same as it once was. The community has moved on and the only custom servers you see now days are Minecraft servers with ads out the a*s to try and cash in ad revenue on dumb kids wanting to play on a poorly designed map because it has the theme of their favorite game. That's not to say all of the problems lay in the hands of the community, the dev team has plenty to do in it as well. Trying to make the weapons balanced, the team went back and fourth with alot of the weapons in the game, improving some that were before worthless (like the quick fix) and but turning some before good weapons, bad. The problem is that when listening to a community, you need to take what you hear with a grain of salt. Keep in mind, its not the people Using the weapons that complain on them being overpowered or unbalanced, its the people getting Killed by them that's complaining. Much like how CoD nerfed its shotguns down to being useless, the game killed alot of good weapons and ruined some peoples' loadout. But it wasn't also loadout changes, adding things like """"Competitive play"""" to the game, I still feel was one of the worst decissions ever. The games """"Random crits"""" system, is there for a reason. Its there as a boost of luck, so that even if you're better than everyone else, you might have a critical rocket strike you, or a critical heavy or scout which you would've otherwise escaped from or defeated. Could you imagine if CS:GO had it so that now and again if you hit someone in the leg it'd count as a crit and kill the person? The community would be in an outrage and competitive would be an unbalanced mess since you give someone the chance of rolling a lucky number on a dice and insta-kill the person they were shooting at. I no longer play Team fortress 2, because the state its in is not one I like. I have played it a bit in recent times, but that was doing Tour of Duty with some friends, as Mann Vs Machine is a gamemode I still enjoy. But even if I no longer play it, I will never forget the friends I made through it, I won't forget the trading I did through it, I won't forget the fun times I had on it. 4600 hours, amounting to more than half a year. Some would call that a waste, but I wouldn't have traded those hours for anything. Thank you for the memories Team Fortress 2."",1"
"4103,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""So, TF2 eh? This amazing, idiotic, and genuinely crazy FPS is something set out from the crowd. I can almost 100% guarantee that you will NOT find a shooter game even perpetuously close to how insanic this game is. With 9 classes, and probably about 70 unique weapons (Feb 2016), you will never, and I mean NEVER become bored because of all the different class and weapon combinations, be them stupidly over powered, or just flat out derpy. Now you may say: """"Oh yea, CS:GO is better because it has skins!"""" WELL NO MORE! Because since the Gun Mettle and Tough Break updates came out, ALL the stock weapons have atleast 1 reskin (apart from a few things like the sapper and PDA's). With hundreds of community created content pieces, and regular updates, I'm sure Team Fortress 2 will stay popular for years to come!

"4106,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,""Absolutely awesome game! A great range of classes to choose from. Scout is a fast running class that is mostely used for doing the map objective (capture the flag, pushing cart) and just generally annoying people. Soldier is a slow moving class armed with a rocket launcer, a shotgun, and a entrenching tool (shovel) soldier is one of the main damage dealers in team fortress 2. The Pyro is a masked psycho armed with a flame thrower, a shotgun, and a fire axe. Pyro is again a main damage dealer but instead he/she uses his/hers flame thrower to burn enemies alive. The Demolitions Man (demo man) is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher (manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etc)and a bottle! The demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk! xD. The Heavy weapons guy is as you guess, a guy with bigâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥weapons! he carries a minigun, a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people! Heavy is the God of damage dealing, he can kill all the other classes quite easily, but be careful! Heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behind!The engineer. The engineer is a defence class that creates Sentry guns to defend, he can upgrade his sentry 3 times. level 1 being a normal sentry, level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the top!The medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help, the medic is the second fastest class in team fortress 2 he also has a thing called Uber charge, which is you and the person you're healing have a few seconds of invulnerability. The sniper is a long ranged Damage dealer he uses a powerful Sniper rifle, a SMG and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful, when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head! The spy is a very different class... The silent assassin, the spy carries a revolver, a knife and a electro-sapper the electro-sapper is used for destroying enemy engineer's sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesn't mean that you can't backstab him! an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them! That is all the classes in team fotress 2! I hope this review was helpful and i hope to see you on a server! Good bye-Jarhead"",1"
"4107,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""Product received for freeBefore Overwatch before Battleborn there was Team Fortress 2 before I dive into this game let me give you a little background.  Originally this game was a mod for Quake  another great game in the genre but sadly hasn't aged very well with time unlike Doom witch was made by the same company Id software but thats anothr story.  strangely the game was originally advertized as a gritty military shooter in 1998 but the game was delayed many times and finally in 2007  intead of a generic grim military shooter that has been done to death at that time we get a unique and humorous FPS with ridiculous weapons and a colorful cast of characters featuring a cartoony artstyle that still looks great even today. keep in mind this game came in a year when military shooters where growing stale and were taking themselves too seriously so when this game came out people felt it was a breath fresh air because this game tried something new with the genre now because TF2 did so well we have great cartoony FPS games like Overwatch and Splatoon. This game has very fast-paced and fun multiplayer gameplay that is chalk full of well designed maps. their are 9 classes to choose from The Scout, The Heavy, The Spy, The Soldier, The Medic , The Pyro The Engineer and the Demoman each of witch have there own special abilites and fighting styles The Medic can heal people The Engineer an make turrets Scout can club people and stun them Demoman blows things up and Heavy and turn invinsible for a short period of time after eating chocolate thats only the basic moves  Ok  Despite reinventing the genre  The biggest problem i have with this game is that it has microtransactions galore and anyone would agree that is bull also theirs no balance inbetween classes some of them feel weaker (The Scout  or the Medic) or just plan cheap like the Spy people aways pick the Spy because he can discise himself as other characters and take them out and that's why I hate him he is very unpredictable you walking and then all of a sudden BAM your dead. ok my haterad for the Spy class aside think this is a great game that is just as fun as it was 10 years ago My final rating is a 7/10 this goes down a point because the microtranactions are inexcusable and even though some people think Overwatch is the better game (I like Overwatch too don't get me wrong)  I still think that Team Fortress 2 a staple in it's genre and it's inpact on the gaming community and the FPS genre is legendary and people should really experiance it for themselves"",1"

"4110,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""Team Fortress 2 is a first-person shooter game from Valve.The gameplay is somewhat similar to Counter-Strike but with more variety of game modes, class based player, and unlike Counter-Strike, in terms of gameplay this game is more casual rather than competitive, at least for me. Everyone can play it, from kids, teens to parents, everyone can play. The game is very well balanced, each class has more than one unique abilities you can explore. You can get item drops as you play, and the more play, the more you can get. Items can be crafted for another better items too, or trade them for other items. And the best thing about his game is hats! Yes, hats. Most every damn people here on Steam loves them. You can show off your hats, craft it or even sell them! Many people make profit from it, many people collect it.Team Fortress 2 graphics is 3D but with cartoon style. Even though the graphics is cartoon, Team Fortress 2 still feature blood and gore effects.

4111,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,I do like competitive but I don't like valve's idea of it. I also don't like how they â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed over the majority of their playerbase with removing quickplay and introducing casual servers.,0
"4112,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""The game itself is still fairly solid, but the majority of its playerbase is just so offensively, horribly bad that it makes actually playing it completely and utterly unfun. Matchmaking was SUPPOSED to fix this, but it lacks any sort of placement matches. This has resulted in me, a player with over 3300 hours who has been playing since the Pyro update in 2008, consistently being matched with squeaker, 3rd-world, 6 year olds with toasters for computers who have been playing for 20 minutes. And there's no way I can escape them. I think, even if there is a future update that fixes this, this here whale is done with TF2 simply because it's just been more frustrating than fun, and it's burnt me out for good.Unless you are one of said 6 year olds (in which case, go for your life, you cancerous little cyst), I can not recommend this game anyone anymore."",0"
"4113,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""The most fun I've ever had in a game. 6 years playing and it's still not getting old.EDIT: I really should write a proper review of this game, it's about time.3 years later, here I am, still obsessed with my childhood obsession. This game is forever going to be my favorite FPS, and there's little chance I'll ever give it up for good.Whether it's from the art style, gameplay quirks, classes, lore, etc., this game always delivers for me. Sure, over the last few years there's been a slow down in the big updates and now they happen every once in a long while, the game's community servers always keep me entertained if I don't feel like playing a game of casual. There's always something to do, a server or map to explore and play on or sometimes even participate in community events that are supported by Valve with badges to show your participation.I still love to play this game, 9 years and 9,500+ hours later.EDIT 2: 10,000 hours later and there no end in sight for how fun this game is."",1"
"4114,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,""Radically different from the going FPS standard.A gem gameplay wise.It's free, there's no excuse not to give it a try.That was the short version.If that didn't convince you yet, move along.The mechanics the 9 playable classes are based on are remarkably creative and pretty unique:While one class is able to perform a Mario-style doublejump, another can literally blow back enemy missiles at their rightful owners' faces, and then there's a soldier whose playstyle revolves around surfing on exploding rockets' knockback - just to graze a third of the available characters.The variety in gameplay is still increased by unlockable gear for each of them. And believe me, whether you're going to fight your foes with a pistol or a glass of milk DOES make a difference.Talking about unlocks, a widespread disease of free to play games with unlockable content are those being """"pay to win"""" options - not in Team Fortress 2.Owning more items than yor foe will not ensure you an advantage"
"4115,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""I have played this game for a lot of years. During that time I have met a lot of great people, and also quite a bunch of people who I wish I'd never meet.Unfortunately, I've joined the scene quite late as I first started playing this in January 2011, a point where the game was still optimized and still fun. As years passed by I've seen the game go downhill more and more each update. The performance of the game was getting worse and the content Valve kept adding was not contributing to the game one single bit, if anything it just killed more and more frames on a lot of machines, no matter how powerful they are.The latest update """"Meet your Match"""" was the final straw for me. Them replacing pub servers with """"Casual"""" servers, which are basically pubs with a competitive setting really didn't do it for me. Competitive could've kept this game alive if they implemented this years ago. If you ask me, they are way too late with doing this and I personally do not see a future for this game anymore.If anyone would ask me, I would not recommend Team Fortress 2 to anyone. Even though I have never played Overwatch, I'd say that game holds a much greater future than TF2 would ever achieve.EDIT: Well then, to my surprise they're actually doing something about this whole issue. Way to go, I guess?EDIT 2: My opinion still stands. This game is nothing but a broken pile ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥EDIT 3: I moved over to Overwatch, much better game than TF2. Get it now, seriously."",0"
"4116,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""I'm updating this review:While I still don't recommend playing this game due to negligence on the developer's part, I believe it's still a good game in one way or another. The matchmaking is still putrid garbage and the idea that people who play in less active regions get 'auto sorted' into Virginia with a latency of 100+ ping is an absolute joke. There is no reason for this other than to shorten queue times, and I'd honestly prefer waiting a few minutes more for a good server because 5 minutes of waiting time don't kill my mood as much as lag.Outside of that, the same problems still persist that got me to downvote TF2 to begin with: Balance patches take far too long to hit and exclusively get shipped with major updates that take around 4 months to hit. (4 months if you're lucky. Pyro's rework almost took TWO years.)If the team gets their act together and Valve hires extra TF2 devs, the game can be a huge moneymaker and fun again at the same time, a win-win for everyone. With Overwatch on the decline and no other class-based shooter competing strongly, TF2 has an open field once again - and it's not being used because the following problems persist to turn players away:1. Premade players can pubstomp a 24 player server just by pocketing and spawncamping the enemy team. Massive demotivator for new players.2. Competitive matchmaking up to this day is still broken and for the most part a catastrophy. It's horrendous to charge people money for this.3. We still don't have official no-crit servers despite the massive division between crit-fans and nocrit-fans, which is not good. Random crits are toxic towards new players in almost every sense.Those are just a few examples of what's not going correctly, but they are massively impacting new players for the most part. ...And for the love of it, please rework the bottom tier weapons nobody has used in ages. Candy Cane, Sun on a Stick, Third Degree, Eviction Notice, Pain Train, Vitasaw, etc.Those are all potentially interesting weapons that weren't properly buffed or reworked in ages. Even worse, the Candy Cane got NERFED by making it so you can only get healthpacks from melee kills instead of general kills."",0"

"4123,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""Team Fortress 2, a great game transformed over the years into a shape that I no longer recognise nor love. Having quit the game for around a year whilst still following updates, what I say may seem harsh but I say it because TF2 may still have the potential to be a great game again. In my opinion, TF2 has been neglected, lopsided balance and long-existing bugs left unaddressed for years. Whilst in recent months they have attempted to address such problems, they ultimately left them too late. Visually the game has changed a lot, mainly due to horrendous looking outlandish cosmetic items being added that didn't even try to match the original art style. Not forgetting the various visual changes that may be intentional or not, that have also decreased the quality of how the game appears. For example on older maps lighting is screwed up, as are several decorative decals found on those maps that are now invisible or barely visual in comparison to their release. I don't want to list every issue like this as I understand they are likely this way due to either optimisation or updates to the Source engine over the years that have caused such parts of the game to break. The biggest nail in TF2's coffin for me was the removal of pubs in favour of an Overwatch-esque matchmaking system, completely changing how the majority would play. Drop in and drop out was one of the major appeals for me and it is one of the defining reasons I quit this game. The more casual atmosphere of pubs was enjoyable and the options for MvM and even competitive (TF2Center etc. not the terrible competitive they did add,) were there for those looking for a more coordinated experience. MvM was an enjoyable part of my playtime personally, however as mentioned earlier the lopsided balance of TF2 was only amplified here. Whenever they did change weapon stats they completely forgot to consider any effect they would have on MvM. Should Valve decide to allocate more staff to TF2, perhaps one day it'll return to a state where I can safely say I love this game again, however with the small handful that does work on TF2 this is rather unlikely."",0"

"4127,Team Fortress 2,,""finally gotten to review this game. Almost 4,000 hours of this game....holy crap. But I'mma drop the bomb here. I gave this a thumbs down for a reason. Its current stagnation. What I mean is, Valve has lost a bit of care with this game. It's a...very strange game when it comes to the design over the years. It is a completely different thing than what it was 10 years ago. Originally that was awesome, it was very unique and loaded with personality. But now it's a lost child, abandoned. In need of love and attention. It isn't as bankable as CSGO or Dota anymore, the updates have been awful, radio silence from the devs, it needs third party help and support BADLY. In order to keep it alive, Valve must give development to the community or another company. Smissmass 2018 was a horrible disappointment of an update, adding terrible hats and  doing nothing else. I love this game, still do, but as of now, the negative experiences in my near 4,000 hours playing has outweighed my positive ones."",0"
"4128,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""Team Fortress 2... first started as a team based shooter, now a heaven for hat trades.

"4130,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,""What can I say? Team Fortress 2... so many know it, so many love it. And now that it's been around for 10 years, it's still amazing that it's hanging on.This is one of those games that changed my outlook in many ways. As a follow-up to a game, to a mod, it's a wonderful experience that truly revolutionized gaming. From challenging play, to quirky characters, a great artstyle, and a unique universe and level design, TF2 has become a classic (in my mind) that will forever remain one of my favorite games.If it wasn't for TF2, hats would never have been as popular as they are today. Hats4Life."",1"
"4131,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""Best f2p I've ever played (and best I'm ever going to play probably). First of all it's very fun: great gameplay, funny characters, awesome community made items... perfect to play with friends.It's really skill-based and has also some good teamplay elements too.One of the best thing about it is also that it's a very balanced game (the classes are, the player distribution in teams never is, even after 84567 """"scrambling the teams""""): the class you select is always gonna have a lot of pros and cons, be effective against some classes and be an easy target for others. After some time you'll probably end up having favorite classes and some that you like... a bit less :D[i.imgur.com] (f**king spies !) There's an inner story to the game and it's characters, but as often with Valve is not really explicit, actually even less than Portal or L4D2. So take a look at the  comics[www.teamfortress.com] to know more about it ! After 9 years in development, it's been worth the wait !  "",1"
4132,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,This is a F2P game in which I've spent and I will spend lot of hours playing! Isn't a standard FPS game because of the amount of funny class available to pick! Worth the time downloading for sure!,1
"4133,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Currently the game is AWFUL. It lost everything that used to make it any level of good and has now been replaced with things that make it total garbage and not worth playing, at all. Quickplay is gone. It's been replaced with some god-awful replacement called Casual. It's boring and doesn't have the feeling of randomness and surprise that the old pubs used to have. Dosn't help that the Queue times are god awful as well. I managed to watch 3 entire """"SGBPlay Mario Party"""" videos, which are about 1:30 hours long each, before entering a single match of Badwater that lasted about 10 minutes. And in those 10 minutes, it wasn't fun because instead of having the old people on pubs like the mic spammers who would be entertaining if they did things like put music or do impressions of Morgan Freeman, or the team Hoovy/SpyCrab who you could walk up to, have a sandvich with and maybe even conga for a few minutes, now you get a team of tryharding idiots who can't take a joke for the life of them. Hell, even the LENNY/BIND spammers are gone. This simple move has taken all the character and charm TF2 had andâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥all over it.Next is the balancing. This game has HORRIBLE balancing. Especially since VALVe doesn't communicate with the community to tell them what was coming up, or take jokes people say too seriously or what they seem to enjoy doing. Only listening to the competitive players. People like B4nny and Mr.Slin, while awesome people, were the only ones who have their opinions heard by VALVe, and to what has that opinion led? Phlog Buff of Smissmass 2015 and Caber Nerf of Summer 2015. Two weapons that were perfectly fine, especially the caber which was basically a suicide weapon and after the initial explosion did a fragment of the bottles damage, and the Phlog became the """"Walk and Die"""" weapon of the century. This update has brought unwanted/unneeded changes. Come on, who was complaining about the Buffalo Steak Sandvich!? WHO COMPLAINED ENOUGH TO SAY IT NEEDED A NERF!? Next is the communication. VALVe communicating with the community, WHAT A PIPEDREAM. They never tell us what's coming up for incoming updates. At most we get the ocassional """"Neato"""" in the sub-reddit. And why you might ask? Because the TF team is 5 people who don't care/give aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥about their own game. Overwatch was released, one would expect VALVe to raise their guard, their standards and so on, no, all they do is give us a half baked update with """"Heavy VS Pyro"""", which feels like an excuse to not give us a full update from the getgo and stall about a month more out of us for the update. If VALVe simply asked what we wanted and said that the update was gonna take longer than expected, we would understand. Most of the TF community would be happy knowing that VALVe didn't abandon us, and is working on the game, meanwhile adding the voting system to the game to see which class people wanted to see more get the update. And finally, my biggest gripe with TF2 currently, it's more personal and I know I'll get ridicule over it, but the lack of MAC support. I run TF2 on MAC, which some might call â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, but at least I run TF2 at 230 FPS. Well WOULD run it. The game is in such a state where the MAC support died off about 3 months ago. The game constantly crashes with the error """"Out of memory"""" or because the game failed to load a single texture. Not to mention the game loads textures ONE AT A TIME. For MAC users, the first hour is a struggle seeing how long the computer takes through freeze frames, lag and so on while it painfully loads every graphic one at a time. So for the most time, you're in a server with all the graphics either blurry or missing while they load in, which has taken me upward to 3 hours on 2Fort alone. Also, the game freezes in the menu, in game or, most commonly, in the """"Retriving Server Info"""" part of the loading screen. I'm not sure if windows/Linux also have these issues, but every glitch causes the MAC to crash in some way or another. There's even been instances where my entire computer, not just TF2, but all of it crashed due to TF2 failing to load me in. The last true patch MAC ever got was about 1 year ago in gun mettle, where VALVe did some fixes to help with crashes caused by the update. Also, anybody on windows/linux mind telling me if the game also runs like that on their computers? This is a TF2 only issue, GMod runs fine, CS:GO runs fine, but TF2 doesn't. The game used to be great, but the currently influx of bad updates, bugs, glitches and crashes completly destroyed a game that used to be great. Doesn't even feel VALVe is the one making the game anymore. It feels like EA or god-fobid Ubisoft took the wheel with this game."",0"
"4134,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""Neuf classes distinctes vont vous fournir des possibilitÃ©s tactiques et des personnalitÃ©s diverses. Mises Ã  jour permanentes avec de nouveaux modes, Ã©quipements et surtout... des chapeaux."",1"
"4135,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""Team Fortress 2 aka TF2 is a """"Free to Play"""", Multiplayer, First Person Shooter (FPS), and a Hat (Cosmetic) Simulator. A very fun game. Especially, very addictive and good for relaxation, but it depends how good you are at the game or on your picked class.Classes & Teams: There're about 9 classes in the TF2: [Offensive Classes:] Scout, Soldier, Pyro, [Defensive Classes:] Demoman, Heavy (Weapons Guy), Engineer, [Support Classes:] Medic, Sniper and Spy.Each class has it's own strength and weakness. For example, Spy has a low health, but he can kill can instantly by backstabbing you.TF2 has 2 teams: BLU and RED. They hate each other, and they attack each other. Nothing interesting.Maps (Levels) & Gamemodes:Maps can be different (pretty obvious). But unfortunately, maps can affect the gameplay, because like I said before, each class has it's own weakness. For example, Sniper can kill you pretty easily in a very wide map, and you can get annoyed. Each map has it's own gamemode. Here is a list of all official gamemodes:Capture the Flag (ctf)Control Points (cp)Territorial Control (tc)Payload (pl)Payload Race (plr)King of the Hill (koth)Medieval ModeSpecial Delivery (sd)Mann vs Machine (mvm)Robot Destruction (rd)Arena (arena)MannpowerAnd here is a list of unofficial gamemodes:Highlander (TF2Center.com)6v6 (TF2Center.com)Saxton Hale Mode OR Freak Fortress (vsh)RandomizerSlender Fortress (sl)Prop Hunt (ph)Dodgeball Zombie Fortress Surfing (surf)Jail BreakFortWarsAnd many more.Hats/Cosmetics: You don't need them to play a game. Players usually care so much about cosmetics, because they want to look good and feel good, while they play a game. Most of them, spend about $500 on the game, only because of the hats. Players also care about the """"qualities"""" of the items. Some qualities can be very expensive, so I don't suggest to spend money on crap. However, hats are not the only ones. Players also waste money on weapons, due different qualities or reskins.IF you really want to get hats, then I suggest you to read this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=248435114&searchtext=Free+HatsIF you want more hats, then I suggest you to understand, and learn some basics about the TF2 Trading Community, and about trading itself. Here is a guide:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=158754458Major Updates: There are 2 different kinds of TF2 updates: Official Updates and Community Created Updates (they're official, too). What's the difference, you ask? Well, it's pretty simple:Official Updates - Are created by the main creator/company called VALVe. In their updates, you can find new gamemodes, new weapons (which are usually made in the summer or in the winter), new maps, bug fixes and especially there is a 90% chance that VALVe is going to add new hats, made by the community from the Steam's workshop.Community Created Updates - VALVe usually cares what community makes, but they don't allow community mess with the balance of the game, meaning VALVe doesn't allow us to create new weapons, which can have different stats, and especially add new maps. (However, VALVe added community maps only in the beginning, when TF2 was still new and fresh. But now everything is different, because in nowadays TF2 became as a very popular game.) So like I said before, VALVe actually cares what community creates. So VALVe likes to add new hats and new weapons (just models) created by some talented people from the community. But majority of the community hates to see, that every new update has a new hat. And to be honest: It's normal. If you didn't know, there was a big over hyped update called """"End of the Line"""", and it was actually the most useless update in the TF2. It had tons of cosmetics, a new taunt, a new weapon, which is a actually a reskin with no stats. Before an update arrived, the community really hoped to see a map called """"Snowplow"""" with the new gamemode, but when the update arrived, the map was canceled by VALVe. VALVe said, that the map is too confusing for new players. Later, that sentence became as a meme, because other maps made by VALVe are more confusing, than a """"Snowplow"""". Anyways, let's move on:Unbalanced Gameplay & Weapons: TF2 has 2 kinds of players: F2P (Free to Play) players (aka noobs) and P2P (Premium to Play) players (aka experienced players). Imagine BLU team full of noobs, and RED team full of experienced players. Is this a balanced match? Heck no. REDs would win every bloody match. However, in VALVe servers you may find a voting system, which allows any player to vote something. Here is a list current voting types:Kick PlayerRestart the MatchChange Level/Next LevelScramble TeamsDisable Team AutobalanceEternaween (Allow Halloween-restricted items for two hours. Player must have an item to enable this voting choice.) So imagine again those 2 teams again: Imagine, that you joined the BLU team, and you see that the teams are not balanced at all, and whenever you come out of your base - you always die. So you decide to vote to """"Scramble Teams"""". So what do you think what's going to happen? The voting will fail, because your enemies are having fun AND because your teammates (noobs) doesn't know how to vote at all, or just completely ignores the voting.Now let's talk about weapons, shall we? Nah, let's not, because VALVe finally fixed all those unbalanced weapons. I could mention them like a long time ago, but now it's not worth it. I will still save this title, just in case.The Story: Well there is a story in the TF2, but unfortunately you can't find it in-game. You can only find it in the official TF2 comics. You can find comics in the Official TF2 Website, right here.[www.teamfortress.com]The Community: The community was great, until TF2 became for free. Right now, if you go to any official VALVe server, then you may hear some screaming or crying children with microphones. I hope your ears doesn't explode. To be honest, TF2 community is still great. It depends where you live. Usually, I really love to play with Americans. I never loved to play with Europeans, because they love judge each other, and sometimes they're so speechless. How cruel!What is a Premium Account? Premium account means an Upgraded account. In the beginning you can only have 1 backpack slot. If you buy something from the Mann. Co Store (in-game store), then your account will be upgraded and you will have 6 slots in your backpack. It's very important to have a Premium account, because 1 backpack slot if not enough for you. I suggest you to buy a Mann Co. Supply Crate Key. Once you bought something from the Mann Co. Store - don't use it again. Use it only to buy keys. Once you understand all basics about trading - you will know what to do with your bought key(s). (Just trade your key for the metal, and then buy tons of hats and weapons, as much as you want!)Overall, my rating is 7 out of 10.Remember: Once you start to love this game, then there is a small chance, that you will leave it.Everything depends, what you like or love, or how (quickly) do you understand things.Also, I am very sorry if I was very rude or mad in this review. It's because sometimes, TF2 can make your feelings hurt, especially your sanity. If you don't want to risk your life, then simply don't play this god damm game.Have Fun! ^.^"",1"
"4136,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""This Game was really good till the latest """"Meet your Match"""" Update.Now it is just bad and sucks a lot. Why?1. You are randomly moved to a Server and a Team. You can't choose your Team, Map and the Location of the Server. I was moved to a Server far away many times so I had a high Ping and it was unplayable.Other Teammates/Enemies having a High ping too and this causes unfair kills.2. Search Times are still very long.It takes like Minutes to finally find a Server.3. You just play a few Round on ONE Map and then you have to disconnect and search for a new Server.4. The Game Coordinator and API are down so often so you can't play (still 4-5x per Day).5. Teams are still unbalanced like hell and you have to play with your Team the WHOLE Map. I tried to play a few Rounds but it was balanced only one time. Even if you're on the good Team, it is not fun.6. Casual needs a lot of fixes, like a Class limit, Ping Limit etc. I don't want to play against Heavys or Engineers.7. Ranks are just pure cosmetics.8. Removing Autobalance is much worse than having it. Autobalance was hated but needed, now you play 12 vs 7 or 8 till someone joins your running match, but this takes too long.Team Fortress wanted to be like CS Go with the Skins and now it want to be Overwatch but it doesn't work. It is over 9 Years old and now they change everything?After playing Team Fortress over 2.300 Hours I'll do a long break. I don't have fun anymore.NEVER Stop a running System.

"4142,Team Fortress 2,2012.0,""First it was guns. Then it was hats. Now it's...well...Well okay, it's not strictly dead - the playerbase is still quite strong - but after more than 8 years Valve just doesn't know what to do with its game anymore, and it's been hemorrhaging experienced players. It's increasingly an empty shell, in other words. The Meet Your Match update was the final straw: it introduced matchmaking, but only after more than a year of development and the release of Overwatch, the latest hugely popular cartoony multiplayer team FPS and a game with great matchmaking.TF2's matchmaking on the other hand came at the direct cost of Quickplay and the repurposing of Valve-hosted servers, which were the easiest and quickest way to get a guaranteed decent vanilla game anywhere in the world. It's also not very good.Matchmaking in either Casual or Competitive is slow to find you a game that often ends too fast in a curbstomp win by one of the teams, and there's no autobalance or team switching allowed. Competitive copies the 6v6 format that is popular in the game's competitive scene, but then fails to enforce the class limits and weapon bans that made competitive play viable to begin with. Meanwhile, Casual matchmaking is too structured to replace the drop-in drop-out play you had with the server browser, or the ease of Quickplay. While there are a couple of decent vanilla servers to be found - not to mention plenty of modded servers - in the server browser, there is essentially no quick go-to place for vanilla games anymore.The update also 'fixed' a 'bug' with the Righteous Bison secondary weapon that was actually one of its key features when the weapon was originally released. It was originally meant to penetrate and damage enemies multiple times[i.redditmedia.com], which punished them for running away since it would hurt them even more. It no longer does this.Also of note is that all of the Medic's mediguns now allow the Medic to match the speed of their healing targets, something that devalues the Quick-Fix medigun even more since that was once a property exclusive to it. These changes, along with the other constant major balance changes, indicate a team that doesn't really know their own game, or at least the grounding for its historical decisions. Change is one thing, but this is another.My theory for why these things have happened is that developer turnover within the development team over the years has resulted in a team that's almost completely comprised of new blood as opposed to the original developers, and their efforts to keep Team Fortress going have resulted in bloat and mismanagement. I know they try"

"4144,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""Team Fortress 2 is a game release by our favourite company, Volvo and as of today a successful and active game. I say active because unlike most games made by Volvo, TF2 gets patched frequently as well as some updates  such as the Gun ettle Update, Smissmas, Halloween and much more. Before 2011, TF2 was a purchasable game for $40 but they made the game free forever. The presentation of this game is cartoonish which for most people looks stupid but once u get used to the graphics. Even then i see the environment a bit messed up such as the rocks not being smooth. I personally feel like Volvo should fix this to make the environment smooth.The gameplay is the most interesting and is the reason thousands of people are playing the game right now. There are 9 classes to play as such as the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy. Each class holds a weapon specifically for them such as the Soldier using a Rocket Launcher and the Demoman using a grenade launcher. Every class has 3 weapon slots which is Primary,Secondary and Melee weapons. Many people rely on their Primary weapon however classes like the Spy and Scout are better with a melee Weapon. Another big thing with every class is that u can unlock other kinds of weapons as your playing the game and unlocking achivements. Some weapons are pretty much reskins of the default weapons but others have pros and cons such as the Heavy`s Brass Beast which does more damage but takes a while to deploy. TF2 also has cosmetics ranging from head to toe. There are MANY diffrent kinds of cosmetics for each class. You can either craft hats or unbox them from crates which are also dropped time to time. Speaking of crafting, you can craft weapons to make metal or another kind of weapon thats useful for you. Another thing about TF2 that makes it fun is the variety of modes. There are as of now 8 diffrent types of modes excluding Random. There are modes such as Capture the Flag, Attack/Defense, Payload and much more. There are even maps created by the community themselves such as Suijin, Mountain Lab, Turbine and much more. I give this game 10 out of 10 because despite this game coming out in 2007, it is still an enjoyable game to play with friends. This game has improvement by a lot ever since its launch If you have a mic and NOT a squeaking voice, u may actually make some new friends throughout Steam just watch out for scamers."",1"

"4152,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Its been over a year since my last review of this game, and as of late a lot has changed, so here goes revision 3 of my TF2 review.The last year or so has been rough for this game, between poorly executed changes to matchmaking, the implementation of a built in competitive mode, and the general lack of love from its own dev team, Team Fortress 2 was struggling quite a bit to maintain much of its player base. Team Fortress 2 was like someone with Borderline Personality Disorder, the more it changed hoping to keep from being abandoned, the more abandoned it became. But after a year without major updates and little word from the dev team, TF2 was given a new chance at life.I can't remember the last time I saw so many of my friends, many of which abandoned this game over a year ago, back online fragging likes it 2013 again. And its not just my own friends, its the community as a whole. This is what we were waiting for, this is the moment many of us lost hope would ever come. Sure there's problems with the update, like every major update before, but its clear to me that the TF2 team over at valve, what few that might remain, are still dedicated to making this experience better for all of us and honestly I can't thank them enough. Over a year's wait is a long time for a game update, I know, but from everything I've seen and experienced within the last 48 hours or so it's clear to me that the TF2 team still loves this game, and wants to make it great again, even a decade after its initial launch. Valve... Thank you. Thank you for refusing to let the game that brought me over two thousand hours of joy and happieness die. Thank you for still caring about this game after so long. Thank you. While many of the old community servers that I used to play on are either gone, or just a shell of their former self, at least I can still find ways to enjoy this game with the same people I befriended so many years ago and still enjoy every minute of it. And thats what matters most."",1"

What really stuck with me are the interactions with the different communities that have come and gone throughout the years, and the friendships I have gained along the way. I have met some of my closest friends while playing this game, and even had the chance to meet some of them IRL. None of this would've been possible for me without this game, and I direct all responsibility to it. I thank the TF2 development team for all the hard work that they have put over the years and continue to put in the game, and I also thank everyone in the community who continues to make this game the joyous and hilarious experience that it can be.

"4155,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""TF2: A Game Being Hurt by its DevelopersWhen you accumulate 2,700+ hours (at the time of writing this review, also I have no life :c ) in a game, I feel like a review is warranted. For a game that has lasted over 7+ years and still has a solid player base of around 50,000 players online at any given time, there has to be something special about Team Fortress 2, and there is. Personally, I believe it's the versatility Valve has created for the game. Players aren't limited to the vanilla TF2 that the developers originally created. There are many of third party servers filled with custom game modes made by the community such as Versus Saxton Hale, Jailbreak, and much more that have kept the game alive. It is the TF2 community's desire to expand on the what Valve laid the foundation for that has made the game as popular as it is today. When you get bored of regular TF2 that revolves around nine playable classes that duke it out to the death, there is so much more to play that keeps the game fresh.The core gameplay is also very enjoyable. With each of the nine classes bringing a unique mechanic to the table, ranging from projectile weapons to hit-scan weapons, there is a class that will speak to almost everyone. To supplement this, there are multiple game modes to play on such as Payload, Control Point, Attack/Defend, King of the Hill, and much more. Each one provides a fun experience that will keep you playing hours on end. The game revolves a lot around teamwork and coordination but has room for individuals to make big plays. TF2 brings special aspect to a first-person shooter that hasn't been found in many other FPS and makes it stand out. Now on to the more critical point(s) of the review:1) The Implementation of Competitive:In recent times, I feel like the developers of TF2 are really beginning to destroy the game. When you play the game for 1000+ hours, you begin to notice things that are starting to hinder the game. One the main issues that I have is the direction of how competitive Valve wants the game to be. What I mean by this is whether the game should be a competitive type of game like CSGO or a casual game which TF2 has been for years. As of now, it has been confusing, especially with the recent Meet Your Match update. Originally, the game was purely a casual type of game. Friendly heavies everywhere, random critical hits, players comparing hats, and players from both blue and red teams conga-ing in harmony. Overall, it was a very laid back game. While there has been always a competitive side birthed by the TF2 community since its release, Valve hasn't really acknowledged them until around the time period of this review. And that is sort of the problem. Only now is Valve beginning to make the game competitive. That isn't bad or anything, but the issue is that their attempt to create a competitive TF2 scene seems halfâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ My main example: Competitive mode in its beta form is almost no different than its so called """"final"""" form or the form on its release. There are so many issues that plagued this mode that were brought up by the community while it was in beta. Many of them still exist today that deter from the competitive experience such as the current competitive ranking system. I've played in a few third party competitive TF2 sites and compared to them, the TF2 version of matchmaking feels like a still-developing game mode that is competitive only in name. 2) The transition from a Casual to a Competitive Game:Another problem that is hurting the game is Valve's sloppy transition from casual to competitive. What used to be known as Quick Play, now has been transformed into a shell of its former self in Casual Mode. The simplicity of casual TF2 has been destroyed with the frustrating features/lack of features. One of my main (maybe petty) annoyances is the system in which players now join servers in CASUAL MODE. As it is now, the max amount of people you can have in a party is six. For the numerous Valve servers that can sport up to 12 players PER team, it is very upsetting that Valve prevents players from having parties up to the max players per team. Not only that, while before you could join a friend's game in progress manually, Valve has prevented that making only so you can join random games through the casual mode matchmaking system. This does have its perks though. For one, kicking the ever so increasing number of hackers has become easier (well if the vote passes). 3) Conclusion:Don't get me wrong, TF2 is a fun game. But in conclusion, with the recent updates, Valve seems to be on the line on making TF2 fully competitive. Why? While the UI of the game may seem competitive, the core gameplay isn't. Valve is trying to make TF2 something the core gameplay isn't matching which is competitive and it makes the game not flow together well. Having random critical hits in a competitive styled Casual Mode is a small sign of evidence of that. Along with this most of the interface is sloppily made and not user friendly as it could be. If you just want to play TF2 for fun, I think it's a hard time to be a TF2 player without encountering frustration at every end with Valve. Overall, I would give it a 6/10 as it is now.TLDR for New Players: I can't ensure that you will enjoy TF2 in the current state it is in. If you're a new player, I feel like it would be hard to enjoy TF2 to the fullest and would not recommend unless you're willing to brave the frustration or Valve fixes the game.TDLR for Older Players: Not much has really changed in the core mechanics of the game. If you're looking to get back into TF2 and played mostly in Valve servers, be prepared for the chance to become annoyed with the features/lack of. The community servers remained mostly the same with the only difference being that they gained a section dedicated solely for them."",1"
"4156,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""This is a Long review, if you want a short quick review, skip this review.....Year 4 of playing TF2.Where do i start this? Idfk, this game has made me speechless about making a review.I once make a review when i played it for 100+ Hours, and 350+ Hours, But this time i gonna make a really Serious Review about this.TF2 is Fun. Any game mode, any class, any server, It's a never ending Gameplay makes you feel like to play it more and more. Any weapons, any tactics, all exist, and they will keep growing.Community existed, and they are also keep growing too, and i am glad the community never dies even this game is lack of Consistent updates. Comnunity server is also fun if you want to play other than Valve's Official Game mode like VSH, Jailbreak, and theres many more you can explore.TF2 Competitive existed too (Community Competitive server, Valve's Version is a bit... bad.) And even Pro TF2 team & Competitive Match & Series existed too, but This game is more to Casual play, so you cant expect too much at comp, but hey, why not try it?I played this game for 1500+ Hours, and it will keep growing until i can't play this game anymore. I have played like CSGO, CoD MW2, BL2 and more FPS Stuff but i never stay in that game a very long time, and always go back to TF2.I still remember when my RL friends calling me â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ for playing this game. They say this game isâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥but they never tried it. They play more to AC, CoD, BF and more """"High Class"""" FPS, and i just play TF2. Now they stop playing those, meanwhile i still play this game even i have some hiatus by playing other game.Conclusion, i personally think this game is the best Game of the best game, and never makes me bored.

Not this â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ overwatch/any-other-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing-shooter lobby based queueing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. I don't give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ how low the queue times are it still takes up to two minutes between games just for server connection. I used to only have to do that after literal hours of fun on whatever map I chose. Good players, bad players, tryhards, friendlies. All together. All having fun on whatever map they wanted. In whatever region they wanted, for as long as they wanted without any queueing or connecting. This change is utter insanity. Everyone was excited about matchmaking but I doubt a single person was hoping they would replace the ENTIRE game with it. For YEARS pubbing has been my favorite activity. The only thing in my life that guaranteed fun and an escape from â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t. I pubbed when I was happy, sad, lonely or with friends laughing and having fun. This game is the most important activity is my life and has been since I started playing 5 years ago. Pubs have always been my place to just go and be free and have fun without a worry or care beyond that tryhard soldier I'm trying to stop from dominating me, or the free to play engie that crit me to death with his wrench. This game can be very competitive and I enjoy that aspect, but above all else it is fun. It has to stay fun. Please Valve. Please give us back the best part of this game."",0"
"4165,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""Ok so overall I think this game is very good. It has its main servers and stuff for those who just wanna casually play but not just sit around. It has trades servers so people can screw around and trade stuff. And the community servers have all the various modes that aren't commonly available or those that aren't available at all! Very strong community and very strong game with loads of variation, all for the low low price of FREE. Heavily reccomend it!"",1"

"4170,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Team Fortress 2 (TF2) is one the games that you really have to try, it is Free to Play (F2P) and has an outstanding unique first-person shooter (FPS) style. Unlike most FPS that is played competitively, it focuses more on fun and especially humor. TF2 has a various types of character classes and game modes, a bunch of maps and hats (yes you read it right, HATS!).GameplayTF2 is fun yet a challenging game, it has a rich gameplay and a huge community. It is composed of two opposing factions represented by the name of these companies, the Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU) which are mercenaries hired by two opposing brothers. Players can choose any classes, characters and the side they represent to compete against the opposing team through certain missions/objectives per game mode. Gamemodes:Unlike most FPS games, TF2 has a lot of good game modes, every game mode has a different and unique play style which makes the game interesting. Other game modes are still in beta stage thus small bugs might occur but overall  it has a decent maps, objectives and team play. Here's a list of game modes and its respective mission/objective:Capture the Flag - Each team has their own intelligence briefcases that they have to protect from the opposing team, the main objective is to capture enemy's intelligence until they reach the game's capture limit.Control Point - Game mode based on control points where you capture enemy points and protect each point from being captured.Territorial Control - Game mode based on """"point to point"""" where you must capture the enemy point and defend yours, points gets randomly selected in a different place to protect or to capture.Payload - A series of checkpoints where you have to get the cart to the final point while the enemies tries to stop you.Arena - A tactical mode whereas teams fight under pressure in a smaller maps for shorter matches. A control point is found at the center of the map, where you have to capture without being killed.King of the Hill - like the """"Arena"""", it focuses on a single control point where you have to capture till 3 minutes or defend the point before the enemy takes full control of the point. Payload Race - Each team will be given a cart for teams to push and compete and defend the point against the other team.Medieval Mode - There will be a number of points like the """"Control Point"""" but both teams can only choose from a set list of allowed weapons.Special Delivery - A unique game mode where both teams must capture a neutral briefcase, the team who takes it first must bring it to a specified area of the map while the opposing team must stop them defending the area. Once the briefcase drops, enemy team can't take it but rather defend the briefcase from being taken.Mann vs. Machine - Another unique game mode where a team of three or six player must defend the Mann Co's strongholds from a wave of raging robots that carries a bomb. Robot Destruction - A beta map where teams must destroy the opposing team's robots and collect the Power Cores to earn points. After gaining points, a Reactor Core appears that can be stolen by the opposing team.Mannpower - Teams must capture the enemy's intelligence briefcase while adding a twist in game with grappling hooks and 12 unique power-ups.PASS Time - Another beta map that has a football like game play. Team must take hold of the jack to throw it to the opposing team's goal.Player Destruction - A game mode created by the community where players must collect bottles of beer from killed enemies and jumping to the UFO after. Once a player gets killed they will drop their held beers that can be taken by both teams.The best map for beginners would be King of the Hill, its simple yet fun. Classes and Characters:Most FPS games focuses more on weapons and less on characters, in TF2 you can get to choose 9 different characters with unique roles and special abilities. The game is created to have fun thus expect a unique approach on certain abilities. Here's a list of classes and characters with their respective roles and characteristics:Offense (good for veterans)Scout - A fast and agile character that can capture and pushes cart faster than any characters, has a special ability that can jump twice in mid air. Equipped with scatter gun, pistol and a baseball bat.Soldier - Slower but durable character that uses a rocket launcher, shotgun and a shovel. He can use his rocket launcher to launch himself into the air (not into the outer space) with the cost of his health for a better aiming with style (seems ironic).Pyro - A pyromaniac that uses flamethrower, fire axe and a shotgun, they can blast it to an ally to extinguish fire or use it to an enemy to gain distance.Defense (good for advanced players)Demoman - A character that uses explosives to defend an area. Equipped with grenade, sticky bomb and a bottle.Heavy - Slow but can sustain and deal a huge amount of damage. Equipped with an enormous mini-gun, a shotgun and its own fist to strike.Engineer - A character that can build and destroy machines capable of defending with sentry gun, a teleport machine and a health and ammo dispenser. Equipped with a Shotgun, a pistol and a wrench. Support (good for beginners) Medic - A doctor that his main role is to heal his allies, healing allies can grant ÃœberCharge that can boost him and his healed ally. Equipped with Medi gun, syringe and a bonesaw.Sniper - A sniper that can kill enemies with one shot from afar. Equips with a sniper rifle (what would you expect, a laser beam?), a submachine gun and a kukri (a starter pack good for campers).Spy - A character that sneaks into the enemy's back and strikes with a knife, has a special ability that can turn himself invisible to the enemies eyes and can destroy machines easily. Equipped with a pistol, a watch that can make himself invisible, an elctronic sapper that can take down machines easily, a device hidden in a cigarette case that cloak himself into an enemy character, a revolver and a butterfly knife or balisong (originated from the Philippines) that can kill with one stab if used properly. (absolutely not for newbies) Classes, Characters and team can be changed while the game is in progress. This can be done by pressing """", (comma)"""" to change class and character and by pressing """". (period)"""" to change team.ControlsJust like most FPS games, TF2 uses the standard keyboard set-up which is the basic WASD (forward, move left, backward and move right) movement, R to reload, Q for last weapon used and etc. Mouse is used to aim (point), shoot (left-click), use every character's special skill (right-click) and to change weapon (mouse wheel up or down). The controls are smooth and comfortable, weapons can be changed through the keyboard with keys: 1, 2 and 3/4, 5 and 6 or through the mouse button by scrolling up or down. ProsArtistic Character DesignFree and easy to playUp to 3 different classes and 9 different characters to choose fromHumorous and fun without pressureGood reward systemConsNew players might find this game challengingYou might get bored after some timeConclusionThe game is good to have fun and to kill some time but with more FPS games coming around its hard to keep up. I recommend this game for non competitive ones and for those who just want to play a good F2P FPS game, it has smooth and comfortable controls with decent character model and animation. Overall, this game is unique and better than any other FPS games, it has a strong game play and outstanding maps but if you are into a more competitive side, this game is simply not for you but absolutely worth the try."",1"

"4176,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""I honestly cannot reccomend this game anymore, with the new modes implemented, I do not have the heart to even open this game anymore. Pub servers have been ruined, with RANKS implemented in CASUAL modes, meaning you have to fully commit to a game, you cannot even choose maps anymore, if you do, you'll have to rely on the private owned ones, which means people can decide on whichever rules they want. It is almost impossible to find a match, I looked for over 20 minutes, and it only said how many servers there are. There is now penalties for leaving a CASUAL match, ruining the sense of causal fun that team fortress 2 had. This is NOT CSGO, but valve has ruined it and made it so, they have successfully killed a game.EDIT: They fixed the mode selection, as well as the penalty for leaving, but with this. They ruined the pause menu, now only being a lobby for playing. As well as there being no map selsction still. The wait times are leagues longer than before, making it harder to find the patience in order to join the game, let alone play it. The worst part is, the hackers have gotten even worse, with them being more prominent and the report system doing absolutely nothing, I still cannot reccomend it."",0"

"4178,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""TF2 has been out for over 6 years and it still hasn't gotten old. You know why? Because Valve will never keep it the same thanks to frequent game changing updates.

The value of teamwork in this game can be beneficial for hundreds of other games too. With constant updates, gamemodes, buffs and nerfs, and mostly cosmetic items (And the occasional new weapon that isn't a reskin every fifth major update), the possibilities are endless, as well as the hours you regretfully put into this game.Learn the different types of players throughout the game, like Free to Play's who frequently play as Pyro and run towards you Flame Thrower blazing, the class mains who â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about other teammates not doing their job correctly, the friendly players who give you a Sandvich one moment, then unload their Minigun into your back the next, the random who accuses players of hacking but is just terrible, the players who actually do hack and are VAC banned within 30 minutes, and so much more!

"4184,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""THE GOODTeam Fortress 2 is not your ordinary game. Focusing on its cartoony graphics, offbeat humor and wide variety of game modes and player classes, but it will definitely put some people off. If you're a person who likes team-based multiplayer first-person-shooter video games, I think this game is for you. The sound in the game is exciting overall together with the visuals.  It's a perfect game. You are always updated with new incredible releases. Last but not very least, a very fun and unique shooter with cool mechanics and great teamplay is totally free to play.THE GREATThe game can be addictive and challenging if you let it. The game is very fun, with different characters and balanced. One of the best Games of all time for sure. People who call this game or boring don't know much about shooters to be honest. Each class is a really funny, cool and interesting character with an unique and awesome personality. You're not running around with an AK47 or M16, but with Syringe Guns and Sticky Bombs, it's quite hilarious. Not to mention its great item-drop system, an amazing fanbase and the community, they are the perks which keep the players from all over the world to play this game.THE UGLYThere is no serious gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted players to have a real serious gameplay, they would have made an in-game system where players get penalized for quitting the game before the match ends. Face the facts: You can disconnect the current game any time you like even in MVM matches. Perhaps for dynamic joining and disconnecting of players of the current match, but it can be frustrating when you spend the whole damn match without stable players.GameplayMost Team Fortress 2 game modes have 2 opposing teams, the Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and the Builders League United (BLU), that compete against each other in various maps to complete certain objectives. Some game modes include:Capture the Flag: Each team attempts to steal the opposing teamâ€™s intelligence briefcase from their headquarters and secure it back at their own base.King of the Hill: A central point must be captured and defended for a set amount of time to win the round.Payload: One team attempts to escort a rail cart filled with explosives to the enemies base.Team Deathmatch: A team is able to win a round by killing off the members of the opposing team.CharactersThe players on each team must choose a class to play, each with their own set of abilities and special weapons.Medic: Heals fellow teammates with a Medigun that can ÃœberCharged to make other players temporarily invincible.Scout: Runs very fast and is able to double jump. The Scout default weapons are a shotgun and baseball bat.Heavy Weapons Guy: Also known as just â€œHeavyâ€, this is the largest and slowest moving of the classes. He wields a minigun and boxing gloves, and can recover health by eating sandwiches.Pyro: Wears a gas mask and fireproof suit while wielding a flamethrower and fire axe and is best at killing enemies up close.Engineer: Can build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers that aid other teammates in battle.Sniper: Can kill enemies from far away with his sniper rifle. Enemies can be killed with one shot if they are hit in the head.Demoman: Wields a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher that can be used to kill enemies around corners, or lay traps for enemies to run into.Soldier: A rocket launcher equipped brute that is capable of reaching great height by jumping while firing a rocket at the ground.Spy: Can disguise themselves as members of the other team, and can kill enemies with one hit if they manage to sneak behind them and stab them in the back. Can â€œsapâ€ Engineerâ€™s buildings to quickly destroy them."",1"
4185,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,The arena shooter is one of my favorite genres. Always colorful with a wide selection of personality filled characters. This game is very fun but needs more attention from Valve.I just started playing this game again a couple weeks ago. And my experience has been amazing. I stopped playing when Overwatch came out but now I haven't played Overwatch in awhile.One thing I love about this games is the wide range of customization for weapons and cosmetics. I have spent almost 100 dollars (I think) on virtual hats and weapons. I need help.,1

"4190,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Positive review because even though the wall of text is 100% negative, we need you all to keep playing and voice your opinions loudly so that Valve will do something about the horrible mess they've created.The meet your match update was a mistake, the community has been in a constant state of outrage, outcry, and complete and total dismay, and all Valve has done about it is put on their fake god damn business smile and say, """"We're sorry. We'll band-aid some of the minor problems right away,"""" without even acknowledging the one, MAJOR f*ckup, removing Valve pubs and the Quickplay system in general.Quickplay was not only for Valve pubs. It was also used by many to find community servers. One of those networks that was highly affected by Quickplay lost 70% OF THEIR PLAYERBASE over the last few weeks. I'm talking about TF2 APP. They are shutting down this Saturday. Because Valve won't acknowledge the one major problem with this update. They won't even say """"We're sorry about pubs."""" They won't say anything. If you wanna know exactly how kill your own game, just grab some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in' popcorn and watch. The ABSOLUTE most frustrating thing a company can do is completely ignore the entire customer base's main complaint about a product/update. This is how you drive out old players, and discourage new ones from coming in. It isn't rocket science, Valve. This game is 9 years old, man. Up until last month, it STILL had a concurrent 60,000 players. We're loyal as hell. We are loud as hell, but that doesn't make us less loyal. Speak to us with your mouth words, Valve. Use phonetic syllables to make sounds that our human ears will recognize, ALTERNATIVELY, use your fingers to press the buttons on your keyboard that would make up those aforementioned phonetic syllables. It's literally that simple. Open your god damn mouths and stop being so silent. The age old excuse of """"we just dont wanna talk about stuff until we're sure it's ready to talk about"""" doesn't exactly apply here. It was cute when people were asking about HL3. Now we're talking about whether or not one of the top 10 games on Steam is going to die, by your own hands. Get off your asses."",1"
"4191,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""I don't really feel it is necessary to talk about what's good about TF2 on a wide basis, because we all know what is good about it. It's updated from time to time, it doesn't feel abandoned like most multiplayers and it has a large pool of creative fans. Plus custom game mods like Slender Fortress, Freak Fortress and Death Run make the game twice as better. So I'll just point out the negatives.Explosive spam. It is understood in a 30 player server that spam is existant and will forever stay that way. Kudos Short Circuit. It was fun while it lasted.Crutch weapons/shields and overall annoyance. Black Box/Concheror. Darwin's Shield. Reserve Shooter. Beggar's Bazooka. Vaccinator pairs. Degreaser combos. Despite naming these, I bet all of us use them anyway. So I guess you should all feel horrible about yourselves.Mini-sentries. It sets up in less than 3 seconds. The engineer has the ability to pick up his gear"
"4192,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,""First I time came across with TF2 was after I bought an Orange Box from the store, I was dying for HL2. Didn't know it was coming with this cartoon-like game called TF2, and interestingly I almost was going to ask Steam Support to remove this game from my game library after watching a clip on Youtube, seriously, I was like what the Â£â‚¬$$. But was too lazy for that. So time passes, looking to something new, I see this TF2 thingy again in my library, so whatever, let's download and give it a shot.Now, after a year, I wish I had submitted a ticket to Steam Support and got this thing removed from my account. Clocked 1000+ hours and I don't know where and how this will stop. There are two things you can't apparently clear, one is radioactive contamination the other one being addictive to TF2.Oh, and supposedly this game came free with Orange Box. Nice play, Valve, first fix is always free, isn't it? Team Fortress 2 Forever."",1"
"4193,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""The game itself: For the current new update of casual i am not mutch of a fan. The casual play system is not what I personally like due the level system and the waiting time to join in the fun. Back in the day you could just instant join a casual play and there was a more relaxed atmosphere.

This why i most prefer trade servers due you get to see a different side of the TF2 community. Its more relaxed and you can do almost whatever you want. Trading, Farming, Socialize, Duels you name it. This why I would be mostly found here of the relaxed atmosphere.Personally: I have played this game now for a few good years, and it will always be a great game. because of the people you meet here are interesting and the situations are always different. The game may be somewhat the same. But the people that play it are always different. And thatâ€™s what i like to socialize and meet new people. And to see how a story unfolds."",1"

I'm not saying the game is bad, they recently fixed a lot of bugs and when you play casual games it's still full of f2ps (which is a good sign). But right now the playerbase is decreasing.

"4196,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Valve, it is time for you to either hand over development of TF2 to Hidden Path Entertainment, or hire community developers to work on it.This game has been neglected, and needs more than the mere life support that the current development team is incentivized to give it.This should be such an easy solution, which totally syncs with valve's core beliefs and past policies, yet no change in development has been made.I am glad that valve employees work on what they love. It shows in every game that the employees actually love.It is time to hand the development of TF2 over to people who have the same passion, so the current dev team can spend more time on what they really want to.Edit: Also, it's absurd how bad the botting problem is.

There's nothing normal about this game, nearly every class has a counter, and some are harder to play than others. Sure, picking up a class and playing is really easy, but playing them right is where the challenge comes in. Watching the pros play is one of the greatest sights as they destroy servers and players with ease, and then being put head-to-head in tournaments is even better as you watch a non-stop highlight reel of fantastically displayed gameplay and style.

Let me tell you how this beautiful, amazing game was killed.Pros:New taunts (The Carlton is my favorite.)New guns for either the Pyro or Heavy.MinmodeCons:You get penalized for leaving Casual mid-game. Yes. CASUAL.

It's CASUAL. 2.) IT'S CASUAL. 3.) IT'S GODDAMN CASUAL. 4.) What if something happens to your internet? What if something abrupt and unexpected forces you to leave?Matchmaking. The reason smurfing in CS:GO isn't as bad as it could be is because of one thing. The price tag. Every single time you want to make a smurf account, you have to pay for another copy of the game. But with TF2, it's free. So all you need to do to make a smurf account is to make another account, download the game, and buy the cheapest thing off of the Mann Co. Store. Plus, the whole skill based matchmaking is a terrible concept. You could have played this game for over 5000 hours, and still be meh. You could then go into the game, and be matched with people who have played similar hours, but these people are amazing at the game. """"Oh, but to play competitive, you have to buy a ticket"""" No, you actually don't. All you have to do is link your phone number to Steam, and you're ready to go.I started playing shortly before the MannConomy update, and it breaks my heart to not recommend TF2.

Yes it is far from fully dying but Valve really doesn't care for this game as much anymore as they got CS:GO and DOTA 2 to work with. They did try to make TF2 like CS:GO by adding competitive mode to the game, but it works very bad and it doesn't fit the way TF2 should be played as TF2 is a game fully set on teamwork to win. Casual mode is also a downgrade from the original TF2 as it is just competitive without the leave bans. The game also never had a big update in almost a year now, and that is saying something. The game is just boring and dead and they really don't care for it as much as they did back then. I don't really recommend this game anymore unless you just want to play on community servers."",0"

"4210,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Reasons why TF2 is bad:Bugs: 9 years after release, the game has more bugs than ever. Taunt glitches, spazzing ragdolls, symbols over player's heads that will get you killed (mini crit vulnerability symbol staying over player's heads is an example), buildings that are infinitely sapped, sappers remaining on unsapped buildings, players glitching outside of the map, the list goes on and on.Performance: Got that expensive rig with i5 processor and GTX970? Well, too bad, because this game runs like the average modern console port (while looking bad). Framerates surf between 40 and 150 with a period of 1-2 seconds. An enemy player that's on fire? Good luck hitting him. He'll lag your game so hard that your damage output for weapons like the minigun is halved.Bad design: - Directx 8 was obsolete 5 years before the game was even released, but yet it's still included out of sheer laziness. -The server browser is equally lazy and is completely obnoxious to use. -Want to use the custom server browser? Good, you only see ping, mapname and the number of people on the server. Valve never figured out that they can put """"maptime left"""" on the list. -And of course the best part about the game: the hitboxes and the """"lag compensation"""". If you played sniper for a period of time, you'll notice that you don't LEAD the target, but shoot somewhere random behind it.-Want to play pyro? Good luck with that. They managed to Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ that up too. The phlog only hits the player from certain angles, even when he's engulfed in flames.-Want to play heavy? Pray that there's never an enemy hugging you. You literally can't hit him if he's inside of your minigun.-See that enemy running up the stairs? Don't shoot rockets at him, because they will be absorbed by random clutter, dealing no damage to enemies.-Want to play demoknight? Good luck with that. You can't damage enemies that are in each other and """"ghost hits"""" (hits where you get the sound of meat getting hit, but do no damage) are everywhere. I even get ghost hits on heavies that are standing perfectly still.-Communities are free to spam ads or even inject malicious code through people running the game and connecting to their servers.-The most recent fad: engineers going outside of the map and building sentries that can shoot people, while being protected by the invisible walls around the map. Jolly good fun and still not fixed after more than a month.-Want to call a vote on that cheater? Enjoy the coinflip, because your team clearly doesn't care enough to press F1 or F2. That is, if the vote window actually shows up of course! Want to know the result? Too bad, you only occasionally get the """"yes"""" or """"no"""" displayed, and you most certainly won't see the actual number of votes for each choice. Excellent design!-Is there a team that's clearly much worse than the other one? Too bad. Only the players with few points get """"funbalanced"""" to that team. The actual players causing the imbalance stay on the other team.Rampant cheaters: GET GOOD GET MEMEBOX (yes they censored the actual word, probably afraid of bad reviews) spam, coming from heavies hitting every bullet while jumping in the air. This is still a thing. A sniper doing 5 headshot kills in 5 seconds. This is also a thing. These are the obvious ones that VAC can't even detect. Then there's the pyros with auto deflect scripts, aim assist snipers, aim assist spies, etc. Of course these are way harder to spot, but they exist. Valve never figured out that they can check Heavy accuracy and flag suspicious players, or snipers by monitoring damage output.Bad management and support from Valve: The recent past has shown several weapon stat changes that are utterly dumb. The phlog user was made invincible, the babyface blaster was rendered worthless, afterburn immunity of the demoknight shields completely void, ... The priorities are clearly on minimum effort and maximum profit. While this is a noble corporate strategy, it is, again, utterly dumb on the long run. Want to make or edit a map? Too bad, only an ancient version of Hammer still """"works"""", the rest has been completely broken since the Steam Pipeline update from a couple years ago. This is particularly funny because Valve completely relies on community items and maps nowadays. Want to trade items? Too bad, you have to install bloatware on your phone, otherwise you get to wait 7 days.

"4217,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""I've decided to make a more serious reveiw for this game. If you have a few spare minuites I suggest you read this review.Let's take a time machine back to the end of 2013 I had just got into the PC gaming scene and decided to take a look at the most popular free-to-play games, sure enough Team Fortress 2 stuck out like a sore thumb and I immediately installed. My first match was completely outstanding and i'll always remember the rush I felt as me and my team mates pushed the objective on Dustbowl for the first time.Foolishly I thought i'd start with playing Sniper, but it was then I realised that each class was completely unique in their own way, they had both upsides and downsides. For example you have soldier who's capible of outputting massive ammounts of splash damage with his rocket launcher at the cost of only being able to have four rockets loaded at a time. And Engineer who's able to lock down entire control points with his sentry guns only to have them easilly destroyed by Spy or explosives. Don't even get me started on the amazing unwritten abilities that the classes have, for example you have Demo/Soldier who are able to utilize their sticky and rocket launchers to jump across the many vast and expansive maps. You also have scout who's able to use weapon combos like the Atomizer and the Force-O-Nature to practically fly across control points and avoid dangers below. In all Team Fortoress 2 will forever remain one of my favorite games of all time and has earned a place in the PC gaming hall of fame."",1"

"4220,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""Help, I've become addicted to this game. No joke. """"Why?"""" you ask? Let me sum up my experience so far. : )First and foremost, the game is quite original with it's colorful and quirky characters, which I've come to absolutely adore. Each character has their own (stereotypical but hilarious) personality, and it's really fun to watch them interact and talk. Being able to play as each is a blast.Community wise, I've met a handful of awesome and cooperative people who are great to play with. You never know who you'll run into in online games, but it's totally worth it when people are friendly and talk to one another. Once in a while, you'll come across players that are complete jerks, but I assure you that you'll find a server with a bunch of dorks you can party and have fun with. XDApparently I have been on TF2 for only 157.8 hours (total), but it feels like at least a year. I plan on continuing with this energetic and playful game for a long time to come.Aaaaaand I think that's all!Oh, and before I forget... Just a word of advice to you newcomers...

"4222,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""It is a beautifully designed game with a visual style reminiscent of old Warner Brothers cartoons, and battles that combine strategy with frenetic action.

"4228,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""Over the many years Iâ€™ve been playing TF2, Iâ€™ve yet to get bored of it. Yes it will become repetitive but thatâ€™s not the point. What really is the point is the countless games you can have before you even get bored of it. With over 80 maps to play in TF2, plus the countless maps that were made by the community itself, youâ€™re going to find it rather hard to get bored with. The countless options on each map and the unlimited options on both attack and defence, itâ€™s a never ending war of what you will do next. With nearly 2,000 hours in TF2, even I am still enjoying every map tf2 has to offer, from gully wash to even manhattan in mann vs machine. Iâ€™ve never gotten over the countless hours Iâ€™ve spent in the game, trying to better myself at every class there is to offer. Over the many hours Iâ€™ve spent in TF2, it was more than worth it. Spending it with both friends and by myself enjoying the game. Pushing ourselves to the limits or just relaxing while we mess around in casual or even the community server. Itâ€™s endless, a game that wonâ€™t leave you bored with the unlimited choices you can make while you play this."",1"

Over 4000 hours on this game and years of enjoyment have come from playing every bit of it. When I first got this game in 2008, I looked at the cover of the box and my exact thought was, """"this looks gay"""". After putting it in that disc drive and installing it, I am not playing it a decade later competitively and I will keep doing so until this game eventually (or not) dies in years. Though the game devs don't pay much attention to it and it lacks a few things which require their attention, It is still the game I come back to every day when I get home from school and work. I come to the community and friends that I love so much. I really don't think I can leave this classic gold mine of a video game."",1"
4232,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,The arena shooter is one of my favorite genres. Always colorful with a wide selection of personality filled characters.

I have spent almost 20 euro on virtual hats and weapons. I need help. :c,1
"4233,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""TF2, or Team Fortress 2, a fun class based shooter with hilarious characters, interesting weapons, and many memes. Avaliable for free, it allows anyone to join the chaos. It does comes with it's flaws however. A disfunctional training mode, rough learning curve for new players as things are not explained very clearly in game, and a few other things besides. As someone who has owned the game for a while now, I can say that TF2, even with it's flaws, is still a game worth playing. The game is overall, easy to pick up on how it works and there are people willing to teach new players the basics. Combat is chaotic and fun, the maps are varied and interesting, and there is a game mode for just about everyone. Also, a slew of creative maps and mods await for those who are curious. Are you in? Come join the fun if you like."",1"

The classes you can play as are Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy.Team Fortress 2 is the best game i have ever played, and the reason i think it's such a great game is becasue it's not like the typical FPS games like Battle Field and Call Og Duty. Instead of a realistic FPS game, valve made the Team fortress 2 graphics more cartoon-ish.Also a thing to mention is that you can customise your character's miscs, hats and outfit.So if you like FPS games, i highly recommend you to try Team Fortress 2."",1"

Used to be, you could join your friends with a single click, or hop into any server of your liking at the press of a button.Then Valve decided that """"having fun"""" was no longer what Team Fortress 2 was about, and forced everyone into a competitive format complete with ranks and statistics. Sure, you *can* still use the market gardener to give a meddling medic the surprise of his life, but you'll be dragging down your score and you know it. Since the Meet Your Match update, the fun has gone out of this game. Enough for me to stop playing. It was fun while it lasted I guess, and perhaps, maybe one day Valve will realize the enormity of their mistake. We can but hope."",0"
"4240,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""I find that Team Fortress 2 is the longest lasting first person shooters that have lasted the time factor of all games. It has stayed strong and an integural part of the gaming community for over 10 years, with many more years to come."",1"

"4242,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""Great game. There are quite a few glitches after big updates, but its still a good game. This game ruins people, these hats ruin people. I recommend any new person coming into tf2 to NOT focus on hats or the economy, most of you will and you WILL REGRET it. Just trust me, there is way to much price manipulation going on. And if you do get into hats DO NOT get into unusuals. They will make you question everything you've ever done. Just dont do it. Dont go to the hat side. Anyways, just based on the game (not hats) i'll give this game a 10/10 will swag again."",1"
"4243,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""The gameplay:It's a team-based game that uses different classes, and of course, like every FPS valve game, you have no iron sights (but can scope in with a sniper rifle). However, there are quite a few fun weapons and tactics you can use on this game, and every class is perfectly balanced. Neither class that you choose is nerfed or OP, so you can dominate the game with any of them. There's always going to be the pros who have 1000+ hours on this game that will destroy you with no effort, but no matter what happens, you will most likely have fun playing this even if you are losing.The community:Considering that I have only 100 hours on this, there's not much I can say about the community in detail. According to others, it's filled with strange, annoying people from different fandoms like MLP and Undertale. I haven't witnessed any yet (probably because I don't visit many community servers except the Skial ones), but I'm sure they're out there somewhere. However, from what I have seen, I can tell you that for the most part, the people here do tend to argue regularly like any other FPS community, but most people I have played with aren't the tempermental tryhards who get really emotional about winning. The general community is a balanced mix of polite players who help you, people who constantly use scripts to spam the chat, trolls, and a few hackers (keep in mind that compared to the silver ranks in CSGO, the hackers are very rare here, so don't worry about them too much). There's also a few mic spammers too. If there is one thing that does get a few people fired up (not everyone, but a few) on this game, it's the divide between F2P and P2P players. Basically, the F2P players are seen as stupid, ignorant, and disrespectul players who are terrible at the game by the P2Ps. Now, while I'm not sure about what the negative thoughts are about the P2P players, I would assume that they are stereotyped as materialistic morons who obsess over cosmetics (in other words, they spend lots of real money to buy fancy looking pixels that don't exist in the real world), but I could be wrong. So yeah, that's the community for you from what I have experienced.What I love about this game:-It's not like your typical run of the mill FPS shooter where the only type of character you play as is some random guy running around with a gun. You actually have to think here. You can use rocket launchers. You can use grenade launchers. The different classes make this game far more enjoyable than just playing a generic shooter. What I don't like:-From what I've seen, the in-game market is a scam. For example, I was bought three booster packs for three classes. These packs I bought contain all of the weapons and equipment for your class, and let me tell you something"
"4244,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""For a game thats been around for a while, it still keeps my interest. It is still one of my favorites and is really fun to play. With its different alternate classes and an encyclopedia of cosmetics, weapons, etc to choose from, I reccommend this game for any FPS enthusiast out there."",1"
"4245,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""The best recommendation I can give for this game is that I started playing it over 7 years ago, and still play it. Best advice I can give for playing it is find a welcoming server, preferably with good ping. That's all I have to say. Go, play and enjoy."",1"
"4246,Team Fortress 2,2018.0,""The simplicity of the game is what makes the game so fun and easy to learn but insanely difficult to master and I cannot tell you how much fun it is to learn how to play each class. When I first branced out into other classes for real was when MVM came out and I was practically forced to play other roles to support the team and at that point it's when I realized I had love for more than just the sniper and spy and I could learn to enjoy all the other classes too. There's always something of each class everybody can enjoy. (maybe not everybody)But why do I hate this game even though I gave it a good rating? The fact that this game is slowly dying and to me it seems like valve seems to care less and less about TF2 and just scrap up community maps for new updates and shove in â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ skins and try to squeeze as much money as they can. The last update wasn't terrible it had me playing for a couple more hours but it wasn't enough to bring me back to the good old days. Not only that but the prices of trading only increase and never seem to stabalize and constantly fluctuate which makes trading dead unless you have unsuals on you.But why bother leaving a good review you might ask? Because the only thing that TF2 seems to do right compared to every other game out there in the market, is that no matter how much I hate this game, get bored of it and realize how it's dying. Every month or so I will eventually come back to it anyway. The game is amazing and I can't deny it even if I wanted to. TL"
"4247,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""  After playing this game since 2014, I have to say that I love this game dearly. This game has alot to offer as an fps. Possibly the best fps for pc.

(Never wrote reviews before, so I'll just do some pros and cons and then my opinion).I think there is a lot of positives and negatives, so here are some of them!Pros-TF2 is for me a game of unlimited fun. I'm over 4000 hours now, and still find it just as enjoyable as first time I started up the game.-It's a good first person shooter for players who don't have a lot of experience with first person shooters. But it's also challenging for experienced gamers, because there is a lot of difrent classes, and even more difrent playstyles. -It's friendly for all ages. It's easy to pick up for smaller kids, but also holds an interest for ''older'' players.-Like in CS:GO there are also community servers, which bring even more playmodes, mods and almost difrent games to the table.Cons-The matchmaking is still not working 100% correctly. You still sometimes get in a game where it's 5 vs 10. And sometimes everybody from one team leaves, and it takes up to hours for new players to join, so in the meantime it's a really unbalanced match. -The updates are still dissapointing to me. When they come out, they are extremly poorly done, and it takes many months for the updates to get to a decent completion. Example"

No really, i did.The servers where unbalanced, and most games where desided by one person who excelled at the game, but it was fun to win and pubs where common and easy to connect to.And then I discovered community servers.The community is the most toxic gaming community I have ever seen on steam. You speak against someone with a offensive name? You getâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on. You speak up for yourself? You getâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on. You speak up for someone else? You getâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on.

"4263,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""Team Fortress 2, one of the most enjoyable FPS, it's a unique kind of FPS, always getting updates, making the gameplay being more fun and exciting. You can choose between 9 classes, all of them with their unique functions and abilities, you can always attack or defend, both are great in gameplay, you can attack and defend in thousands of ways, always surprising your opponents!You don't have money to buy weapons? No worries! You get them as long as you play the game, and even doing achivements.Recieved an weapon you didn't liked?  You can trade this weapon to get another one in public servers or even your friends, or maybe use it to craft a brand new weapon.Yes, that's right! If you never played it, Team Fortress allow you to combine weapons to create new ones, a big variety of weapons, there's going to be one that you will enjoy using it.So, if you're looking for a different and new FPS experience, i recommend Team Fortress 2, i'm sure you will have no regrets.

"4265,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"" PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE TAKING IN ALL OF THE OTHER NEGATIVE REVIEWS Here's the deal... everyone has grown to love TF2 over the years with it's amazing style and goofy gameplay. Nothing can replace TF2 and the many memories we've had over the years. When many people saw this new update, they were furious with how Valve seemed to have broken TF2. It was bad but not as bad as you might think because it was just the surface... hear me out and I will attempt to address many key concerns(This is information from an official Valve post)    1.  The casual only having few modes            -Valve stated that the small amount of modes was their way of trying to reduce Day-One update release server overflow. With only 2 modes, the players would be spread out among all servers and lag and wait time would be minimum. They did not say this however and the servers still died on a massive scale.            -you WILL be able to choose your MAP and GAMEMODE in the future as always    2.  Wait times being sluggish            -server issues are being worked out at the time this is being written and wait times are supposed to be obsolete when it is fixed    3. Ranking in casual             -ranks are intented to be purely cosmetic and only to give incentive to play more. they are not related to competitive AT ALL     4. Penalties for leaving             -these were intended to make you stay the whole game but ended up just making players angry so they are being removedThe bottom line is that this update had VERY GOOD INTENTIONS, but Valve executed it in a VERY POOR FASHION. They made changes but did not give the background information that the community needed to hear. This ultimately lead to a very bad release.  THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT TF2 IS DEAD  (though it nearly freaking killed it) VALVE IS STILL LISTENING TO THE COMMUNITY AND IS LOOKING TO FIX ANY AND ALL ISSUES WITH THE UPDATE In summary, TF2 is an amazing game that has a special place in the hearts of many including my own. It pains me to see it be injured by Valve itself and then have the community bash it so much. I wanted to put this out there so that people know that Valve is trying to help TF2 and not kill it, and I ask that you guys be open for the next few weeks as TF2 is modified. I'm still giving this a negative review because the state TF2 is currently in deserves a negative review. Once this is all resolved (I sincerely hope that is true), I will remove this review.Hopefully this helps some of you guys,Keep Teleporting BreadPeace out...~TEEJ44"",0"

My team is always full of Gibus-wearing pyrovision Scouts. I have 5 MvM vouchers, yet no Tour of Duty badges because my team always goes full Sniper. And Spy. And one Pyro. I can't enjoy the sounds of my character's pained screams because of the squeakers constantly violating my ears.

"4267,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""Team Fortress 2, where do I even begin...The trading?The gameplay?THE HATS?THE CLASSES----------------------------------------------------There's the Scout, the Soldier, the Pyro, the Demoman, the Heavy, the Engineer, the Medic, the Sniper, and the Spy. They all have a variety of ways to either kill you easily, nearly kill you, or just annoy you to death.The Scout is the fastest class, with his Scatterguns, Pistols, and his Bats, and he is also able to double-jump in the air.The Soldier wields a Rocket Launcher, a Shotgun, and a Shovel, and is the second-slowest class.The Pyro wields a Flamethrower, a Shotgun, and a Fire Axe, and is a mysterious person, whose gender is still unknown.The Demoman wields a Grenade Launcher, Stickybomb Launcher, and a Bottle, and is a man whose liver should have shriveled up and died years ago from his drinking.The Heavy wields a Minigun, a Shotgun, and since he is oh so manly, his bare Fists, and he is also the slowest class.The Engineer has a Shotgun, a Pistol, and a Wrench. He is able to build Sentry Guns, Dispensers, and Teleporters, to help attack the enemy team and support his team.The Medic wields a Syringe Gun, a Medigun, and a Bonesaw. He's a medical """"expert"""", and his Mediguns can heal the team and Ubercharge them, which can make them invulnerable for a short period of time.The Sniper wields a Sniper Rifle (no surprise there), an SMG (submachine gun), and a Kukri (a big knife thingy). He's Australian, he's got his sights on you, and you're his next target.Finally, we have The Spy. French. Elegant. Sneaky. A lady-killer metaphorically and a literal man-killer. He has his Revolver, his Knife, and his Sapper, which he can use to destroy the Engineer's buildings. His Knife can kill any enemy in the game with a Backstab (do I need to explain what a BACK-STAB is?), unless they are Ubercharged or if a Sniper is wearing the Razorback, which blocks backstabs.**NOTE: These are just stock weapons! There are tons of different weapons for you to try out! Mix and match, baby!**THE GAMEPLAY----------------------------------------------------Team Fortress 2 is often times a very fun, competitive game where you can snipe, stab, shoot, or stun, through different weapons and different classes (talked about above). There are often """"two groups"""" of TF2, the P2Ps (Pay to Plays) and F2Ps (Free to Plays). P2Ps are often known for having many cosmetics, valuable weapons, and skill, while F2Ps are often dismissed as terrible players who understand nothing and just happen to chase you around the map thinking you're a Spy. (My personal experience is that most F2Ps I meet are actually quite good players.) With many maps, many gamemodes, and many players, you're bound to have a good time. Why not try some cp_powerhouse, or maybe ctf_doublecross? Perhaps pl_bananabay?-What is Competitive Matchmaking?-Competitive Matchmaking means that you're put in a server with other players as good as you, like in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. This was much requested by the community as many players end up being the only good player in a server filled with terrible players, or players much much better than you. Prayers were answered in the Gun Mettle update with the introduction of matchmaking!UPDATES----------------------------------------------------Team Fortress 2 is sadly being slowly updated, but these new updates often come in with the big guns. Some of the more recent updates as of January 1st, 2018 are the Smissmas 2017 Update and Jungle Inferno Update. There are also other major game updates from the past, especially the Uber Update, Love and War update and the Mann vs. Machine update. Many of these updates often have a Source Filmmaker (SFM) video to introduce these updates and their features, such as the Meet the Medic video for the Uber Update, the Expiration Date video for the Love and War update, and the leaked Invasion video for the Invasion Update. Some updates instead get a comic, such as the Gun Mettle update. Some of these events only last for a period of time and aren't permanent.-What do these updates introduce?-Some of these updates, in particular ones like the Love & War and Uber updates, introduce bulk amounts of new items like cosmetics, weapons, and other items like paint for your hats and unusual effects to look good in! Up until the Jungle Inferno Update, no new weapons had been added since the Tough Break updated in *2015*!Thanks for reading my review :3"",1"

You can freakin' dance with the enemy team if you wanted to! It's like... It stands out from the rest of the First Person Shooters, and the best part is that you have to work as a team. Unlike COD, it's every man for himself. But in this, Teamwork makes the dream work. I've also met so many friends who love this game as much as I do. My number one favorite thing about this game is the updates. Although it did release in 2007, it's still getting updates for new game modes, hats, maps, weapons, etc. It even has updates by the community! How awesome is that?!

"4273,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""My Review used to be for this game, a very positive one, that talked about how this game can fit """"any type of gamer"""" and """"has just the right amount of weirdness for everyone"""". While I wish that was still as true as it was, TF2 now a days is just a old shell of its formel self. I can't even get into a party with all of my friends anymore, never the less find a game and have as much fun as we all used to. I just wish Valve cared as much as they used to. I have spent over $200 on this game, putting hundreds of hours into training to become better at the game, even making my own Australium Scattergun from the game. But it seems like all of this has been lost, from the loss of the community, loss of effort in recent updates, and loss of my positive review.

"4274,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""The game used to be fun. After the recent update, Valve has divided the game into competitive mode and casual mode. It ruined the overall gaming experience.

"4277,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""It feels almost sad to me to watch TF2 now, sure it's still more of the same but I can't help but feel that the love that was once there isn't there anymore. This game is what pulled me from Xbox to PC so why do I just feel pity for this game running on for so long when I used to want to watch it become an unstoppable titan on PC with no end in sight? I think it stems back to what I'd call the 'peak' of TF2 (In my time of being around) which I felt was Love & War because I remember how the game that was just becoming a little too stale got the biggest injection of life and fun with new taunts, weapons and all around great memories. However I noticed something off after a week or so, the community was becoming 2 factions and I had never seen this before, one side wanting to conga and party the other wanting a hardcore pub server every match. I kept on playing though. When a trailer named """"End of the Line"""" came out my hype was beyond containing and I thought up so many weapons I've seen that will possibly come to life on update day. I had so many thoughts of how this is the update to end the game, one last bang with everything and anything we could want or need. When Finally on December 8th we were hit with a crushing reality where this update that had so much hype for turned into a simple cosmetic update and I was crushed. I kept playing though. With a pit in my stomach the new update rolled out with quite a split, Gun Mettle. CS:GO skins in TF2 and people thought the world was ending and to top it off this update was a pay to play update to start the campaign. However I was loving every second of the new group tanut and the Snowplow map, not to mention I was in love with some skins. Like all good things though I was quickly brought back down to sadness when Invasion hit. It had sounded like there would be new weapons and a new game mode from all the hype. The game mode was average at most and the reskins turned my love for the game to anger and I left for Payday for quite a while. I returned midway in the Tough Break update when I saw a similar but different game. The magic was just gone for me at this point and soon enough other games caught my eye, mainly Overwatch. Where TF2 grew stale with me other people kept going. I full departure from TF2 was Meet Your Match when I felt as if TF2 changed so drastically to just compete with Overwatch's rapid growth in competitive play. Sure I've been reading and it looks like TF2 is back to how it's been for 9 years just with a different hat stacked on it's head again. I'm not saying you should quit TF2 because Overwatch is just better or anything. I just want to explain about how I broke away from this game and things I felt after 4 years on this game and many disappointments. So if you enjoy TF2 still then more power to you and if you hate TF2 with a burning passion then I donâ€™t care about that either. All this review is for is to say my peace about TF2 before Iâ€™m done with it for good."",0"
"4278,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""I made my Steam account specifically for TF2 back in the day, and there was a long time I'd just play this game for 8 hours every day of the week. I loved TF2 to death, I can still remember how happy I was when I first found a hat or when I uncrated something good. The best part, though, was the frequent and amazing updates this game brought out. It seemed every month we got new weapons or maps. Halloween used to be absolutely fantastic, every year you'd have some amazing new map and gamemode with a horde of halloween items to earn. Christmas usually added new weapons, summer added all sorts of stuff, plus just general huge updates and events. It was great.Those days are completely gone though. This year we didn't get a halloween update, we didn't get a christmas update and the team has been making some really weird choices for the game lately. Competetive was basically dead on arrival, it was broken for months after release too, and casual games have been changed to be a lot less casual. I feel like the team has no idea what they're doing, if they're even doing anything at all. The last fun thing they attemped was a class war between pyro and heavy, in which the winner would get new content, but even that was utterly lackluster. The war itself was just a meter filling up, until pyro won, and that's that. What about the new content for pyro? Pretty sure they forgot about it, and even when it comes it'll likely be completely broken. Team Fortress 2 just feels dead. In the haydays it was incredibly lively, something was happening every day, there was so much I hadn't even tried yet. Now nothing ever changes, if it does it's for the worse and every seasonal event is utter disappointment.I have no idea how this game can have almost the biggest playerbase on steam, bring in one of the highest revenues on steam and be so captivating that everyone I know has over a thousand hours clocked, yet still have such a tiny and unqualified dev team. I know it must be disheartening for the people who work on this to see die-hard fans like myself berating them like this, but they must know that they're failing the fanbase. I know of a modded server run by two people that push out ten times the content the official developers do, and it's better quality too. Step up your game."",0"
"4279,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,""Team Fortress 2 is the best free-to-play first person shooter in the world today. It's pure free-to-play, which means that everything is available at the beginning. You don't have to spend money on this game, except when you want to trade or buy cosmetic items.Â So what is this game all about? Well, you play in team of 1 to 12 (or even more) players and you try to beat the other team. TF2 features several gamemodes, Capture Point and Payload for example, and 9 'classes'. Each class has it's own pros and cons, and can be used for specific tasks. For example, the Engineer is a great defender and the Scout is very effective in capture-based gamemodes.TF2 is very n00b-friendly, since the game features Offline Training against bots and tutorials, as well as the coÃ¶p tower-defense gamemode Mann vs. Machine. TF2 is a relatively simple game, you don't require a lot of knowledge to be good at it. The game also has a large economy of items, which you get by playing or trading. These are pure cosmetic, except most weapons, and don't give you an advantage towards other players.Verdict--------This game is very enjoyable and funny, it's very different compared to other FPS games. It features several awesome gamemodes and funny classes. Some of the cosmetics are really funny, you can hit people with a mackerel and candy for example. An awesome free-to-play shooter you should play today.Your friends will not see you outside for at least 100 hours.

Your chessboard is old and warped, and some of the pieces are starting to lose their paint, but who cares? You two have great fun. Suddenly, one day, someone comes up to your board, slaps away all the pieces, and throws down a whole bunch of checker pieces. It just so happens that neither you nor your friend very much care for checkers. Sure, you'd play it from time to time, but you'd much rather just play chess.However, your friend suggests that perhaps you should both just give checkers a chance. """"Alright,"""" you say to yourself, """"This isn't so different than how it was before. I can deal with this."""" However, upon closer inspection, there aren't enough checker pieces to even play the game properly, and some of them don't even seem to belong to the same set as the rest. You are about to open your mouth to complain, but before you can, the person who destroyed your wonderful chess set pulls down their pants and just craps all over your board. Neither you nor your friend are pleased with this turn of events. You let the strange fellow who interrupted your game know that you don't appreciate it when someone violently destroys your games for no good reason, and they seem to listen. For a moment, you have hope. The stranger leaves, promising to fix what they broke. Soon enough, they return with a shovel. They then diligently scoop away maybe a third of the fecal matter that plagues what used to be a chess board. Afterwards, they wipe the sweat from their forehead, put down their shovel, and clap their hands together.

Some players insist on not fighting and just squatting or dancing around the map, calling themselves """"friendlies"""" and getting mad if you kill them. They disadvantage their team by taking up player slots that could be filled with contributing players, and are a general nuisance.Also, on a particular map, Hightower, players will sometimes tell you not to complete the map objective, desiring instead to run around aimlessly and kill people without end. If you try to complete the objective anyway, you will either receive little help, get cussed at, or kicked fro mthe lobby.Thankfully, these types of plyers are the exception, and while they do subtract from the fun, they are not in great enough numbers to ruin it. I've met many nice people playing this game, and made some good friends along the way.Competitive mode is fun, but suffers from hackers, because you cannot kick players from the lobbies. Ocassionally, they will be banned but thsi does take time.What is worse is, since few players play competitive, it can take a very long time to get into a game. It has taken me over 40 minutes, and sometiems I can't even get into a match. And what is worse is these are not isolated incidents, they occur consistently.Man Vs. Machine mode is very fun. It is enjoyable to play and fight waves of invading robots, but can get a little tedious with time if you don't take a breakfrom it after awhile.Community servers vary, but are often fun for a little whileHere is a checklist of stuff you should try:-Complete all the achievements (520 of them!)-Get to Rank 150 in Casual mode-Get to Rank 13 in Competitive mode (if you can't get into a game)-Do one Tour of Duty each for all available tours-Explore all the different community servers.I hope this review helps!

"4287,Team Fortress 2,2018.0,""Gaben has singlehandedly sucked my social life and my bank savings out of me with this one """"free to play"""" game. Well played, Valve. But, still, there are plenty of good things to say about this game. It's certainly one of the few with the more pleasant communities that I've run into, and for every script kiddie or unpleasant player, there are plenty more humourous and amusing ones just here to have some lighthearted fun. With an audience that seems to be made of older teens up to early twenties, with some younger kids sprinkled in, the community still manages to be friendly and open. Mostly, anyway. You'll meet an aimbot or a more hostile player in a few here and there, but what community doesn't have those. TF2 is considerably nicer than some gaming communities I've been around.The competitive scene is lacking, and while the TF2 team is making an effort to put some emphasis on comp, pubs remain the larger attraction for many new and old players alike, leaving TF2 players who are interested in playing competitively, unfortunately, high and dry. These players have to go to third-party sources for opportunities to play in competitive modes such as 6s and Highlander. Valve desperately needs to provide a competitive mode similar to these two forms of competitive TF2, or perhaps a non-competitive option that allows players to practise 6s / Highlander. Their comp mode is much improved now compared to what it was a few months ago, but it certainly is still lacking.Though there are only nine playable classes, there is always something new to touch upon or some skill to learn and master. TF2 provides an abundance of weapons that are obtainable through crafting, trading, drops, or purchases. The large range of weapons definitely give classes more options, more opportunity to vary playstyle, and endless creativity when it comes to how they take on a game or counter an enemy team.Some classes can definitely be fixed/improved upon, such as the pyro (many of whom seem to know only one playstyle: the W+M1 'meta'), and there can definitely be changes made. However, I understand the delay in doing so, as balancing/changing a single class can have profound impact on the rest of the classes and the game.Overall, a very fine product that remains fun to play and always leaves room for learning despite only having nine classes, and one that has a relatively welcoming and fun community. It's not a surprise to see that TF2 is a game that's thriving after more than 10 years. I have made a great amount of (online) friends in this game, both by interacting with the communities within dedicated to Tf2 YouTubers as well as in-game. Glad to see a product so community-focused (even if at times I wish it were a little less so). Fine job on this one, Gaben, and godspeed to the TF2 team.( Also note: there are hats. lots of hats. You'll never see as many hats in your life as you'll see in this game. )"",1"
"4288,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""Team Fortress 2 is one of the most classic shooting games ever. It isn't simply a game where you just run around and kill stuff, but instead work as a team to complete the objective. You can also buy special cosmetics (HATS!!!) and taunts (best waste of money), or join another person's taunt. Because TF2 isn't super serious, sometimes you'll find friendlies who don't fight you and would rather just do random stuff.I remember when I started the game"
"4289,Team Fortress 2,2018.0,""Having almost 2,400 some hours on this  game, I would say that it is pretty fun to play. It is also a very interesting game to network in, plenty of options to make friends as well! Content for this game, however, takes a long time to be implumented. I sound like a broken record mentioning this, but Staff needs more communication among themselves and the  community. Perhaps higher new fresh minds? :) As for choosing your class, do not be afraid to use any main. It takes practice and motivation to do so. You will experience burnouts if played constantly, however. Stay away from toxicities and do not allow these scums to ruin the community you choose to be in, enjoy yourself as any class and be proud to represent yourself and the community. Do not allow stigmas of the toxic parts of the community ruin your overall experience.  Competative seems to be dead, perhaps incorporate new game modes or even bring back the quickplay option?

"4291,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""TF2 used to be my favourite game. I clocked thousands of hours on it. I bought hats, crafted, and fragged. With the matchmaking update, it often:- Takes 5-30 minutes to play a map of your choice despite an ample amount of """"compatible players"""" searching for it. I wrote this entire review while waiting for a game to start with 34 compatible players in my country, which according to the map selection screen, was green, meaning many players were available to play with.- Matches you against teams with less players than yours, making it no challenge at all, or impossible if you're on the other side of that equation. This is because they removed autobalance, which wasn't the best system, but at least worked """"well enough"""".- Makes it very difficult to play with and/or invite friends to your game. In order to invite and play with a friend, neither of you can actively be in a game. Invites don't pop up like messages do, so you can easily miss such an invite, because it won't show up in a game. If you're in a game and invited to another game, tough luck for you. No more hopping into your friend's game partway through, even if there are 4 more players on red than blue.It also makes it impossible to play against a friend (on opposite teams). No more grudge matches with your peers. The update destroyed the world of """"community servers"""" that made TF2 so casual and fun. We're 6 months into this update, and subsequent updates, and it's still broken.They could have left TF2 as it was for years. It was an awesome game for years and years. New games with better graphics and features came out, but TF2 survived with a healthy community of players. Valve ignored a huge user outcry against the update, and unfortunately TF2 will be one of those games we """"used to play"""" and """"used to be so much fun"""". We could have just gotten some more useless crates, hats, or weapons, but instead they broke it. They could have left it exactly as it was, and people would have kept buying $2 crate keys, spending thousands of dollars on hats, and donating to community servers, but instead they tried to make it """"better"""" to compete with Overwatch. It's awful. Now I only login occasionally, at the insistence of my steam friends. What a shame,RIP TF2 2016."",0"

TF2 is a pyramid scheme with a fat guy on top.  It has fantastic art style which has both aged gracefully and been completely ruined by endless idiotic cosmetics.  It has a sputtering mess of an engine that can barely keep up with all the features and functions stuffed into it over the last decade.  It has a dedicated and long suffering player base that have grown accustomed to accepting the table scraps Valve offers (now at a rate of barely once a year.)TF2 is as much a social platform as it is a video game.  It's an first person dress up chatroom where users attempt to extract profit from virtual hats and other cosmetics.  There's also an FPS minigame which I hear is occasionally populated.  Unfortunately, with the Meet Your Match update in the summer of 2016, Valve removed the QuickPlay function from TF2, killing off all community servers not named Skial.  Now the landscape consists of 24/7 2Fort, Harvest, Hightower and Turbine.  It's more or less impossible to keep a community server populated for any length of time without running one of those maps.With MyM Valve did introduce an official competitive mode, which is both stillborn and a haven for hackers.  The casual mode they released at the same time is the opposite of what it seeks to be.  It's more difficult to join a game, much harder to find a specific map (especially if it's not one of the maps mentioned above) and the entire process takes far longer because of a mandatory 60 second pre-round and forced map reload at the end of game.  Player churn is huge in casual mode, and for good reason.  TF2 still has huge balance issues.  Sniper, a poor fit for the game in 2007, is insanely un-fun to fight against 11 years later. There are completely legit snipers that are harder to deal with than hackers. The class needs a fundamental rework to remove the """"insta-kill all classes from any range"""" mechanic.  Scout is right behind, becoming almost unfair to fight against at the highest skill levels.   Since 2016, Medic runs at Scout speed with any medi-gun, making Scout completely dominant in 6s competitive.  Heavy, the only tank class, remains a butterball, nerfed into oblivion.  Core game changes (global faster weapon switch speeds, spy movement speed increase, etc.) all make him easier to kill but don't benefit him at all.  Since 2014, Heavy's minigun starts at 50% of its base damage.  Spy is both UP and OP at the same time.  Baguette now runs at Medic speed, and faster than Scout when he pops the Dead Ringer. Valve nerfed the Ambassador into the dirt (it needed a nerf for years, but in classic fashion, Valve overdid it by a factor of 2). They have left the Diamondback (lets a class that can cloak and disguise store critical hits) untouched.As of this writing, the big 3 TF2 cheats (the """"L"""" word, the """"N"""" word, and the """"C"""" word) are all undetected.

"4302,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""I have been playing this game since 2012.I have, on two accounts, sunk around 1700 hours.This used to be an amazing game, and at times, it stil can be. But so far it is mired in so so many issues that Valve simply refuses to fix. Solutions that are relativley simple to introduce but never are, and the end result is an absolutely horrendous gaming experience.They added a leveling system for no purpose other than cosmetic. The servers are either barely populated, or populated by new players being destroyed by more experienced players, because matchmaking just haphazardly shoves in people of all skill levels. There's no system in place to pit people of an equal or similar skill level in the same server, to make for a balanced, fun and fair experience. Which you'd think they'd've thought to implement, but, nah, the Level system is just there for show. It makes for an extremely unsatisfying gaming experience. I cannot count how many times i've been on a team made up of new players, most of them Snipers and Spies, fighting against a team that just curbstoms them before they even know what's going on. This is not good, it's frustrating and it's killing the gaming experience for everyone.New players don't get better and simply get frustrated that they're being shitwhipped and stomped left and right by stronger players. Veteran players stuck on underpowered teams get frustrated at the lack of quality control on servers. And some veteran players, find the idea of just wrecking house in a minute and leaving to be a very underwhelming and boring gaming experience. And no, it being 'casual' does not excuse this. The majority of people play TF2 on casual and we deserve more quality control to make sure our gaming experiences are worth having.The servers are constantly full of Snipers and Spies because the game has no universial class limit.The game is also extremely unwelcoming to new players. The training system failsto cover most of the nuances of the game. It has an absurdly high learning curve. Unless you know it like the back of your hand before going in (as i did), you're going to have a hard time.And the hackers....In the past two weeks, i've encountered about, five hackers. Four times, i was kicked off of the server for reporting the hacker and trying to get my team to kick them. I don't know how, but there seriously need to be better ways to combat hackers on the servers. Because this is unacceptable.This game is at this point, a rotting, shambling corpse. Fun at times, yeah, but severely frustrating, in a way it has no right to be, given how easy the solutions to it's myriad of issues would be. My gaming experiences recently have been nothing short of frustrating. It's making ME frustrated and i start acting like an Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥, and at that point, i think it's just not worth it. And at the same time i want to enjoy this game because i love it. I've loved this game even before i played it. I was in love with it's comedy, it's world. I read the Wiki, devouring everything i could until the day i could play it. I've been playing it since 2012. I don't want to give up on it, but i have for a period and only recently decided to come back to it.But honestly, i can't reccomend it at this point."",0"
"4303,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes.At the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.Player versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, """"Mann Up"""", gives rewards upon completing a """"tour"""".In addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale"

I tried it again this year, because I read the reviews and everyone seemed so fascinated, claiming the game ruined your life because it completely consumed you, some people going as far as saying that something as simple as the whole hats deal was addictive. I'd laugh it off, thinking """"It can't be that bad"""".After almost two months of playing, I can confirm"
"4308,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Team Fortress 2 used to be a good game in like older times, well I stopped playing the game nearly 3 years ago but now it seems to gotten much worse since I stopped. Here's what I don't like about the game:THE COMMUNITYThis has been a problem since the beginning, and making it free to play (even when I started as a free to play) made it even worse. They expect you to be 100% perfect at the game and if you don't stay up to par with your team, they will blame most things on you, even when you didn't seem to do anything. They also have a chance to make fun of you if you have no hats or taunts or anything, which according to them, if you have no items in the game, you're obviously a bad player, and if you have a backpack filled with rare items and is worth like thousands of dollars, you're automatically considered a pro at the game.There's the players who are way too good at the game, which ruin the fun by taking all of the kills and making the opposing team scared and, of course, making them rage. Most of the time, someone calls a vote to scramble the teams, or they go into spectate mode and wait 3 hours just so they can join the other team. I honestly think that people are easily enraged by this simple game.MICROTRANSACTIONSAnother way of slaying people's wallets and life savings. This has become a common thing in many games today, which does include PAYDAY 2 and Killing Floor 2, but I honestly think this game has the most microtransactions. They seem to be almost like getting addicted to a drug, your brain just wants more and more of it, and if you don't get enough, you suffer withdrawl and end up wasting your money on something virtual instead of something better you could buy in real life. I think there's even, for example, a skin for a knife for the Spy costs more than a knife in real life.GAMEPLAYI guess the gameplay is what keeps many players involved. The gameplay is not actually that bad, but it's mostly ruined simply by the community. The game is also considered very unbalanced from what I have heard with the new update. Competitive and Casual appear to be very unbalanced, commonly from the opposing team class-stacking (having multiple players play as the same class as one another). The XP system is also dumb, because the only way to get XP from games is by winning, nothing but winning. You get a kill? Nope, no XP for you.The gameplay may apply with what I said earlier in the community, with how some players are so skilled at the game that they take the fun out of it and make the enemy team scatter. There's no separate servers that are for skilled players only, and there aren't too many assets that indicate a skilled player.2/10 - Definitely do not recommend playing this game for thousands of hours ... or even hundreds."",0"
"4309,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""I have playd years of Avp1, avp2 and Counterstrike. before i tryed this out. At first i left the game after about 30h, but when i started playing this again, i noticed how amazing game it is.The humor in this game is best ive seen in ANY fps multiplayer, and once you have played for a while, you can notice communications while playing whitout anyone even using any words. (people use voice communications/gestures to really complex lengths) (+you can start massive sandvich eating fests whit pootis heavies, and throw freakkingâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥at people before killing and taunting at them xD)But it isnt just about the humor, when trying to become good in this game, youll notice how there are skills in this game that other games of the same gengre dont have as much. Learning these skills, (rocket jumping, spys mindtricks, building placements etc. is extremely hard but rewarding) Also the character responsibilty in competetive game is quite massive.And then there is the humongously large itemworld, you can create character sets from so many items, that its extremely rare to find someone whit exact same set. You can earn items by random drops by just playing, and crafting them to better ones later on. Or you can play MvM tours to get quite rare ones, or open boxes.And the best part is that the items do not give you better stats, instead they give you option to play differently.Summary: Youll get grazy action like no other, skills hilarious comedy, the community is the best ive seen in a game this popular, and free updates that have been distributed for many years.Best of all, its Fun to play and competetive at the same time.Cheers GabeN"",1"

I remember going out with... friends? They aren't shooting at each other and why no one is wearing a hat? Poor guys, maybe I should give some gifts around... But, wait. What is this strange triangular sandvich here on my hand? Oh, I remember, it's called pazza, pazzi, pazzia, piazza, pizza! Yes, pizza!  And look at that beautiful sunset. That's some serious modding going on here! I need to save this moment forever. Wait! Where is F5? Oh no! Where is the keypad?! And the mouse?! Ctrl+Alt+Supr!!! NO! NO!!! What kind of hellish game is this?! I don't like this character, I wanna change! Where is Esc? Shift+Tab? Alt+Tab? Anything? Please let me out! I'll buy more keys! I'll do whatever you want!

"4313,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""I used to love this game wholeheartedly and it pains me immensely how Valve basically destroyed this game piece by piece.Playing PvP is frustrating as hell as the server decides to switch you to the other team during rounds! I have absolutely no problem with team balancing between rounds, but balancing between rounds completely demotivates me to give my it my all!The game mode that made me play a ton of TF2 was MvM. This is a really fun gamemode that reminds me a lot of Tower Defense games. But you don't place towers around the map, rather you as a team are the towers mowing down enemy waves. But this mode is unplayable! Trying to join servers via matchmaking is an impossible task as you will always be greeted by a prompt """"round is already running"""". You either have the choice to re enter or leave the server. Re entering will only result in this prompt being displayed to you again and again! But hey, you can always use the server browser to join servers! No you really can't for MvM since majority of them don't allow you to join in any other way than via Valve's crappy matchmaking. I don't get how a game that ran so smooth and perfect can be made so broken in just a few messy updates! TF2 is not going to die off because its competitors are vastly superior but rather because Valve itself does a well good job of letting TF2 die."",0"

It has a really high skill ceiling. One of my favorite parts of the game itself is that it's a first person shooter. Dude, there's a mode that's based around medieval times with no guns. To be honest, that's probably the most realistic part of this game. No, I'm kidding, but seriously though, there's so much variety that really any type of gamer can enjoy this with practice or just messing around. If you like to play competitively, go ahead. You wanna play the game to win, but you don't want the pressure of """"being good,"""" play casual.

A note for everyone first getting this game. Don't quit early if you're not doing so well. This game has a strict learning curve, with no guide (barely), no assistance in terms of skill placement, coaching is dead. You're basically free to go floating around where you'd like. I'd reccommend starting with Soldier, your general Jack of all Trades. Learn to rocket jump and get around the map.

"4322,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Alright, I've played an absurd amount of this game, I love it. But Valve is entirely sending a middle finger to anyone who previously enjoyed the amount of customizability, for no good reason. For a long time I played completely stock settings and was completely happy, but then I saw all the FOV options and UI changes, stuff that enhanced my enjoyment of the game. Although I never actually got into UGC or anything like that I would play on fairly competitive servers and would try my hardest. Just a hop in and play kind of thing. Eventually I started to lose interest. But I was excited at the announcement of competitive because I thought it would bring me back in. I tried the start of the stress test beta and enjoyed it. Then they decided to kill the customizability of the game, why you ask? So when streamers played it, it all looked the same. This meant locking viewmodel_fov locked to 58 where previously it was unlimited cover a quarter of the screen because of this (they added some stupid setting to put it down and in the middle but thats garbage). Made it so you couldn't turn the viewmodel off (even for the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing gigantic viewmodel for the minigun). The removed custom UIs for competitive (I'm not sure if they made it so you can use them now). AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, they charge you 13$ CAD... TO PLAY COMPETITIVE? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SERIOUSLY? DO YOU NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY VALVE? ARE YOU KIDDING?

Prefered would be a """"Medium Update every 2-3 months"""" to keep matters fresh.NEGATIVE- The game isnt exactly the most polished. Bugs are found in several corners, and while most of them arent gameplay impacting to the level that youll find yourself blaming a bug for a death, its just ugly.- 10 Years of Updates on the Source Engine can do a number on ya, making the game somewhat unstable and unoptimized.- The Death of Community Servers.==================================================================This game is something special alright, not only was it with me for 7~ years now, but it's also something life changing.

"4336,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""This a very entertaining game that allows you to battle with friends, or just anyone, by choosing one of nine classes that each has their own pros and cons.

There are a variety of game modes to choose from where you must beat the other team. You can trade items, and there is even a whole currency for this game that is used in trading, or when identifying the price of your specified item. Overall I think this game is great. I highly recommend it for people who love action filled games, and who love to learn new skills. I recommend helping your team out if you would like to win, and don't leave them behind.

TF2 isn't your average FPS, and that's what makes it unique! It's quite balanced, with tons of different and unique weapons, not to mention LOADS of hats/cosmtics and taunts(Which is a thing I've never seen in any other game and are pretty awesome). What attracted me to the game were the trailers made by Valve and how they brought so much character into each class and after that they grew on me. I really enjoy the crafting and trading, but what I really enjoy is how much more the game is besides playing the main game modes(Control Point, Payload, MvM, and King of the Hill)and that the community has managed to make it's own(Prop Hunt, Slender, Death Run, Randomizer, Versus Saxton Hale, ect.)! There isn't much I dislike about the game besides the frequant confrontation with immature and roudy people under the age of 15.

It's not everyday you see the both silly brothers being killed by their lost brother and then starting a war for get the company. It's not everyday you find out a game where you have to kill a lot of hordes of robots made by the crazy lost brother....Seriously, TF2 has even story behind the mercenaries protecting briefcases, pushing giant bombs and capturing points. Also fighting not-so-smart robots. It's not only about the hats (actualy), it's the gameplay! It's not the same thing in comparison with others FPS's.Entering even more inside the game, you can discover more random stuff, like the in-game fads. That's what attract more players, in my opinion.And for being a F2P game, everyone can enjoy the randomness of Teufort!

"4350,Team Fortress 2,2011.0,""I have one very specific complaint now.The new concept for matchmaking absolutely destroyed my TF2 experience. Introducing the forced BO3 format for casual games with an obligatory map voting afterwards drastically shortened the average game span. And most of the people leave after their map finishes because usually something else is chosen in the idiotic voting.Games are short, and people rotate like strangers in public transport.Now why do I hate this? The old TF2 was unique to me in that when I went into a game, probably on a server I knew and had in favourites, I could meet or make some friends or rivals. And the rivalry has been the key concept of TF2 since its 2007 beginning -- might I remind you the nemesis system and how well all the cosmetics and taunts fit into it by making one's appearance memorable and intentional.In the current environment it's near impossible to get personal, because the games are simply too short for any love to be able to bloom on the battlefield.Everybody feels anonymous, there is no reason to try build a team spirit if I'm going to be playing with different people 3 minutes from now.

"4353,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Honestly, this game was really fun. I had a blast and I've clocked over 1k hours on two accounts. But this recent update has completely ruined the game. I waited for 20 minutes with 2 friends to get into a pub, which ended being a bust due to a hacker on the other team. You can't """"pub"""" anymore and screw around. This game has taken a turn for the worst and I won't be playing it until TF2 returns to how it once was. Not only is the wait time completely inconvienient, but many custom huds won't work with the menu either.Many people are quitting, Valve, take note of that. If you don't return TF2 to what it once was (And nerf wm1 of course) then you'll be losing more players every day."",0"

Heck, you even get penalised for leaving a match! I think this is outragous to have such a sudden and drastic change to this game.

Staying relevant for nearly 10 years and still going, Team Fortess 2 is a breath of fresh air for the shooting genre, offering so many unique and completely different game modes that keep you vibing throughout. Not counting the huge, creative (and sometimes rabbid) community constantly contributing to the game, perhaps even doing Valve's job for them. Creating art, custom game modes, custom maps, custom cosmetics and so much more, it very much revolutionized the shooting genre. Leading way for games such as Overwatch.  This game pretty much has it all, an economy, a competitive community (albiet small), and endless ways to play. All of which may keep you playing for hours, days or even months, and NO DLC. All of this experience completely free. Love it or hate it, this is Team Fortress 2, and the world just wouldn't be the same without it."",1"

Nice maps and game modes. You can play this for fun or take it seriously. There is a lot of things to try out. You can try making your own content too.    Things I like about TF2:- art style and humour- funny characters- playing as blue medic on long payload maps- surf and rocket jumping- playing with friends- the moment when you find team work- nice maps and taunts- trying to make a map with hammerThings I don't like so much:- trading, trade window not working properly, dealing with annoying traders- when autobalance/scramble makes teams even more unbalanced - 7 scouts on our team / 7 spies on our team / 7 snipers on our team- when i would like to play scout for once and team has already 7 scouts- when the round is close to an end and everyone on team gives up and goes scoutI recommend this game, it is free and humorous.Hat."",1"

"4389,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Been playing this game since 2010, i've met some interesting and awsome people on this FPS game on some community servers. The 9 classes are psychotic mercs but in a good way and have some interesting stories to them from SFM videos and the TF2 comics. The many different weapons makes for good changes in pace and strats, and, of course, cosmetics. It gives you many different loadouts and play styles. You could even add mods for more playability. There are micro transactions but you only need to buy from the mann co store if you need to be premium otherwise you can save up metal and stock refined metal to trade or buy items at a cheaper price on the Steam Community market.But I enjoy the community servers and different game modes Payload, Payload Race, SD Doomsday, Pass time, Versus Saxton hale, Randomizer, x10, CTF, koth, Control Point, mann vs machine, surf, trade servers, mann power, Halloween mode maps, and much more. And don't forget now there is competitive and casual play as well, if your interested.There is a skill ceiling in this game that keeps you practicing on specific classes you play as and has a steep learning curb with teqniques like stair stabs, surfing, and rocket/sticky/sentry jumping.Although many people say this game is dead or down right terrible I disagree. Sure it has some problems but it has a very good Community with big events like Tip of the Hats.

I bought TF2 in the orangebox when it wasnt free to play, however, there are also many COD kids now and, its just funny to hear them rage because TF2 is much much harder to play.

Even EA of all people has this down. TF2 was on an equillibrium with the rest of Valve's titles, CSGO and DOTA 2 for a long time, but then somehow the teams got so lopsided that you have 5 people working on TF2 and so now you're irrelevant and unless you reboot this game with consistent updates, it's on a downwards slope towards imitating CSGO.Nobody gives aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥about VR, I can't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing justify 1000 bucks or even 500 or 200 or 100 for a VR headset with no games.

"4420,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,""Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingRe-reviewing. :)Overall GameTF2 is fantastic.  There are a horde of game modes to play that can keep you coming back to this old game for a while.  While I prefer MVM these days, I do often play community servers for a good CTF or payload round.AccessibilityGameplayLike most FPS games, TF2 uses WASD, space, and control.  For mobility-related issues, keys can be easily rebound to whatever suit your capabilities.  I rebound cruch to space and jump to a side mouse key, for example.As for sound, with the exception of spies and spy-related events (such as sapping of your equipment), there are visual cues to accompany the audio.  For some weapons that you can hear being fired, you may not be able to see that you're being shot at (such as some sniper rifles).  This is something to watch out for.For gameplay accessibility, I give it 10/10.  You can realistically play and succeed at all of the normal (non-mod) game modes available, with or without sound.Subtitles & CaptionsFor deaf/hoh gamers, TF2 offers subtitles and captions - something Valve has a solid history of providing.  I've found the default captions lacking in MvM, however.  Fortunately, there is a way to use external captions, and I have turned to clovervidia for that: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=167785751As a deaf gamer, I use captions over subtitles whenever I have the choice, as the distinction tends to be between important information in captions and flavor text in subtitles.  That said, I have not used the subtitles option for TF2.For captions, I give it 6/10 normally, 9/10 with external captions (such as from clovervidia).Chatting/CommunicatingTF2 supports in-game voice communication, but the pacing of the game does not make it essential.  Gameplay can tolerate typing, so many other players in servers tend to have no problem accommodating having to type.  Even so, many game modes don't require much communication for casual play.For MvM, typing can be made difficult at times, and this problem can be exacerbated by queuing random teams each time you play and having to explain things repeatedly, which can be a gamble.  I've written a guide to try to standardize voicebind calls in MvM until Valve changes voicebinds to be more inclusive, if ever.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358478951Overall AccessibilityTF2 incorporates visual signals for almost everything that happens in game.  It's ability to rebind keys and add custom captions make it pretty accessible for most deficits in the gaming population.Overall, 9/10!"",1"

"4422,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""(Before reading this review, download the damn game. Trust me, it's ebic) Being a must-have for any PC Gamer, Team Fortress 2 offers gameplay and content superior to any other free game in the market (including that damned one).  This masterpiece released in 2007 offers endless content and a very dedicated community, willing to assist any new player that asks for help.  Each class is distinctive and take thousands of hours to master. There are also hundreds of hats, war paints, miscs, taunts, and action items to collect and trade.  The game is completely free and you can get all weapons by playing the game. If you wish to pimp up your character, you can buy two keys in the Mann Co. Store, trade them for refined metal via some really good TF2 trading websites like Scrap.tf or Backpack.tf, and trade said refined metal for hats and basically all weapons in the game.  Despite the poor optimization and small and silent development team, TF2 is a blast to play. It's silly, funny, easy to learn and hard to master, and overall a great game. The community keeps things fresh and awesome and there's always something you can do in this game. If you haven't downloaded this thing already, GO DO IT, DAMNIT!9.8/10"",1"
"4423,Team Fortress 2,2018.0,""Woo boy, this is gonna be a fun review. TLDR at the end.This is a good game. It really is. There's so much I want to say about it, so I'll get started.Graphically, this game is amazing. Not because it's hyper-realistic, but because the art-style is unique to a point where it's almost impossible for it to look aged. This game is ten years old and still looks great. Gameplay-wise, it's fun. You run around, you shoot people on the opposite team. It's not always shooting bullets though. There are 9 classes, each with their own unique weapons. There are rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and flamethrowers. There are a variety of unique secondary weapons to be had as well. Even the classes that use guns have unique guns to use. The different classes are played in a variety of different ways, so there's probably a favorite class for everyone. And then there's character design. I could probably gush about this for hours, but I won't. Each character is recognizable simply by their silhouette. They are all very unique, to the point that each character model has its own unique teeth and ears. Then each character has their own unique set of weapons that usually follow a theme. The Scout's main weapons are all scatterguns, the Heavy's main weapons are all miniguns, etc. These characters not only have unique designs, but unique personalities and unique backgrounds too. Just listening to the voice lines they say as you play the game will give you an idea of their personalities. It's so cool to see a game like this give its characters so much personality, and the characters are even expanded on in comics that you can view online for free. The characters could probably be described as extreme and even ridiculous, but this somehow makes them feel more real and more enjoyable. There is probably something to be said about diversity here, especially because of its competitor, Overwatch. There's no dancing around it"

"4431,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Let me start by saying I used to frequent this location often. The service is normally great and on any other day of the week I could expect to enjoy myself and feel happy about leaving a sizable tip.However, since the new change in management, the once delightful and competent staff has disappeared. I can only suspect this is because the new owners are as unbearable as the people they hired to replace the old staff.To say the new waiters and """"chefs"""" are unbearable is an understatement. The new managers must have hired their own kids and the brainless friends of their children. When my family and I went in this evening for dinner, no one moved to greet or seat us until about 15 minutes after we arrived. I spotted the hostess chatting away with some man at the bar. I eventually cleared my throat and asked """"Is it seat yourself, today?"""" Then this horrid expression developed across her face as she turned around and said """"Actually no, it's not."""" She proceeded to talk for another minute before waltzing over to us. After scratching herâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in front of me, my wife, and our three children, she picked up only two menus and brought us to one of the dirtiest tables in the house. Looking at the menu, I could see her greasy handprint remaining.Twenty minutes later, a waitress approached us, did not say a word, started writing on her pad, and then just walked away. She came back 5 minutes later with five glasses of water, none of which had ice. She blankly threw down almost every straw she had and then walked away again.Five minutes after that, another waitress came out. This time, she actually greeted with a cheerful smile and asked us how we were doing this evening. When we inquired about the hostess and the first waitress, she apologized profusely and said that they are in the middle of training a lot of new staff. She assured us next time we come back we can expect better service. She got us more menus, wiped down the table, and got us a pitcher of ice water for the table. Things finally seemed to start turning around.After we placed our order, we sat and noticed the renovations they made to the restaurant. The carpets were new, there was music playing, and the tables, when clean, were quite comfortable. For a moment, we thought were in the clear.Just as quickly as our opinion of the change started to improve, it was ruined again. We heard shouting from the kitchen area among the staff. Several people (who sounded quite young) were shouting """"Do it, do it!"""" Immediately I was alarmed. There were not many people seated at the restaurant. I could only assume they were doing something horrible to our food.Our food came out as soon as the shouting stopped. The first and second waitress and the hostess came out to deliver our food, all of them hiding a grin.My wife looked alarmed. My children were oblivious. I said """"Thank you,"""" but they didn't walk away. My wife was about to bite into her tuna salad sandwich, but I stopped her. I picked up it and opened it. The three standing beside our table started looking nervous.""""Something wrong, sir?"""" The second waitress asked.""""I suppose we're going to find out,"""" I responded. I opened my mouth and took a bite of the sandwich. Most languages don't have the words to concisely describe the taste, but it tasted like rot with an overwhelming amount of salt.I spat up the food immediately. I stood up, pushed the three aside, grabbed my family and left. The manager heard the commotion and made his way to us. I can't believe myself, but I simply gave him the middle finger, right in front of my children, and proceeded out of the restaurant. In the car ride home, I kept wincing at the aftertaste. It was strangely familiar"
"4432,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""Back then it was the coolest game ever, with fantastic character design and art direction, fun and balanced gameplay. I had so, SO MUCH FUN!Cool server mods, awesome community, lots of depth, and a lot of servers actually tolerated micspamming music and dank maymays!Now it's age and evolution have destroyed every bit of enjoyment you can get out of it.Cheaters are all over the place, grouping up with alt accounts manned by bots, using spinbots, clearing server chat at every frame and namespoofing other players in order to get them unjustly kicked or banned.The matchmaking system put community servers in a chokehold. Now all there is left are 12v12 """"matchmade"""" casuals ridden with cheaters, premium community servers with pay2win plugins that give actual cheats to whale players, servers filled with cancerous mods and plugins and manned by power-hungry moderators/admins (a surprisingly high amount of them being kids) who ban randoms for whimsical reasons and have a tendency to abuse their powers.The art direction got completely ruined by cosmetics. What used to be an insane, warmongering, badass soldier now wears pink, flaming rabbit ears, a pink santa beard, a spartan hat and a golden rocket launcher with christmas lights around it... And can also ride a magical broom... Oh dear.The crazy amount of unoptimized meshes added by playermodel cosmetics gave a lot of weight to the game files and made tf2 run no more on older machines which used to run it flawlessly.Even after so many years the game's overall gameplay hasn't changed that much. Random crits are still there (unless competitive play, for which you have either to authenticate yourself with a phone (no thanks), or pay (even if you have bought the game when it wasn't f2p ...â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥move.) Also note that this was done in order to prevent an influx of cheaters and smurf accounts. Needless to say it didn't help at all).The game is still oriented towards zoning, making explosives so powerful that the only mechanic that manages to really shake a game is the medic's Ã¼bercharge. It now mostly boils down to """"spam a choke point, wait for medic uber, attack, rinse and repeat"""". Casuals are a blind spamfest (12v12 in rather small maps, which is way too many players) where tf2's long respawn times kill your enjoyment. Competitive is much better though.MvM is tons of fun for a while, then quickly gets boring.And let's just not talk about class balance.TF2 was the best damn game I had played for a long time. It's first big updates were steps in the good direction, but valve suddenly caved in to greed and added a cash shop and trading, which started the game's downfall..."",0"

4434,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,Before this update I would rate the game 9/10. After this update I give it 2/10. The main problem is not what they added but what they removed. If they only would of kept the valve quick play pub servers a ton of players would not have had a problem with the update. But by removing these servers they forced players to use the new casual system. And let me tell you it is not casual. Some of the things we lost I will list below.1. You can not just look for a valve pub server to join quick any more. You have to join a que to play on the valve servers.2. This que can take up to 4 to 10 minutes to get in (for me)3. If you want just one map expect to wait even longer4. They removed some maps that were in the rotation before this update5. After one side wins you get to go through it all again because you just can't keep playing without queing up again.Yes people will say go play the community servers but 90% of them are trash. The rest usually have 24/7 of the same map or don't have players on the maps you want to play. So until valve corrects this I can't bring myself to give this a thumbs up.,0
4435,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,2014-2016 Review: This game started out as a beautiful creation. This game was an absolutely unique style with its own cartoony graphics followed behind the most BEST ways of presenting the entire 9 man team and their personalitys. However sense the Gunmettle update this game has slowly started to slip from its former glory. This game started to try and copy CS:GO which ruins what was once so Unique about it.This game used to be a game that was a different experience all on its own. It was a team experience that  honeslty brought a smile to anyones face from joining their first pub server to leaving their last this game used to be so Unique it would pull different players in from everywhere. Now its trying its best to stay afloat when everyone can clearly see the game is Dwindling from its former glory. Dont get me wrong. I LOVE team fortress 2. However this game has run out of update Ideas. It hurts to see that the updates are pay to join and have become pay to get a crate to just pay for a key for that crate. Unboxing used to be a optional thing and it still is but its being pressured to unbox more and more by valve with every single update. I have had my fair share of the whole experience in this game and this review is coming from someone who has seen it all.I have seen the trader experience and the player experience this game offers. I have crossed the battlefield of mvm. I have run across the pubs. I have joined every update and I can conclude that this game is losing its spunk.http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreyZarcovski/inventory/#440_2_4625059949I have had a couple Ideas For updates (IE maybe medic makes some sort of mistake and one of the characters get to become female.) I know many of you agree most likely FEMALE characters would be a HUGE change in this game that would make both an interesing sfm AND an interesting update. It would be one that is completely free for the team fortress 2 community and it would be one that allows a female player to become a female character.Regardless. This is MY opinion on it. I have watched friend after friend cash out on this game and slowly walk away from the memories they made with every step. It is your choice to play or not to play. What role you take is all your own decision. Here are a couple videos of MY playthroughs to see if you still want to play or not to play.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRzCVGt_EwQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9naZAxpJJCY ,1

You go out to your 100 mission with your hat and a lighter. Then you set the hat on fire. Instead of taking your gun out you run to the enemy's base with the flaming hat and say """"I will trade you this hat for your car keys."""" Then you are shot and die. And that's the game."",1"

"4439,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""The Best multiplayer FPS of all time. No other FPS I have played has tested my reactions and aim so much then this game, the movement is amazing, characters and weapons are balanced and the hitboxes are not as bad as everyone thinks. After 9 years it is still one of the best multi player games made, no other game has topped it yet. Another year another add to this review, it impossible to fully describe how much this games means to me and so many other people you start feeling emotional about it. This game is art and ifeel sorry for people who can't see it for the  landmark title it is and how much its influenced video games"",1"

"4442,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely...Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're sprayingÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped. On the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door. The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions.The BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds...110/10"",1"
4443,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,Great F2P game.I have had alot of fun playing this game over the years. I believe I first played on xbox when The Orange Box came out. That was stolen before I could really enjoy much since I was moving and someone broke into my storage. I started playing on Steam once I got back into playing PC games and saw it was f2p. I did end up getting a copy of The Orange Box on here which made trading in-game items available as well as selling the market for some things.I really enjoy the big events like Halloween and how they have special maps and items every year. The last few years new event items have not been tradable which kind of sucks since they were lots of fun for trading and selling to get cooler things or things you couldn't seem to get no matter how much you played.I definitely recommend playing and buying something cheap in-game to unlock trading and selling items.The game is like a cartoonish Counter-Strike and so much fun is to be had especially with friends and good strangers.,1

"4446,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,"" The meet your match update.      I met my match alright, because I can't stand this horrible update.          I've been a long time player, been here since the Replay Update back in may of 2011, and this is my absolute favorite game of all time, but this update might finally be the nail in the coffin for me.      The biggest glaring issue here is the removal of valve servers. Say you want to play a match of sawmill or maybe a map that isn't so popular such as lumberyard, you would normally just bring up the browser, narrow the search to the map you want, find the valve server with a healthy amount of players and good ping, boom! You're done!  Nope, with the newest EPIC CONTENT UPDATE, these servers have since been removed, and replaced with 'casual mode'    Casual mode      Now casual mode is its own can of worms. During the launch of this update, you couldn't even CHOOSE THE MAP YOU WANTED TO PLAY ON. You picked your game mode, pressed a button, and now you're shoved in a que for an extrememly long waiting time. Some things have been fixed since then, though the experience is hardly any better. It goes something like this:1. Choose the map and mode you wish to play2. Enter the que and wait up to 5 minutes to get into a game3. Join a server that is often a one sided stomp that ends faster than the time it took to join the server4. The map ends, everyone disconnects5. Repeat steps 1-4 until you die of old age     You might be thinking """"just go play on community servers!"""" If by """"community servers"""" you mean """"only 2fort/dustbowl"""" then sure, you can play that to your hearts content. But for a game with 92 different maps spanning across 15 game modes, I think I'm right in wanting a little bit of diversity here and there.      There are other servers of course, many in fact, so why don't I play on some of them? Mainly because, most of them are garbage custom servers or AMAZING trade servers. I hope you like custom maps/modes (especially minecraft ones), because there are about 9 billion of them to choose from!      I live on the east coast of America and mainly play at night. I can hardly ever find a match with 20 players+, good ping, and stock maps that aren't dustbowl/2fort. This is unnacceptable. Where the hell are all the 50k players at?   Competitive Mode      I don't play competitive, and frankly never ever will. Personally I believe this game isn't competitive and should have never had had this mode added. This is the main point of this update, so it must be amazing right?      Wrong.      As far as I know, this mode has been in beta for half a year, maybe less/more. Plenty of time to polish some of its features up. But yet again, Valve somehow managed to screw it up.      No class restrictions, telephone number REQUIRED or else you have to spend money, no weapon restrictions, no real rewards.      No class restricitions is self explanatory. You can have about 6 engineers/snipers/spies on your team if you wanted. Now this isn't always a bad thing per se, but If you plan on playing competitive solo, half a team full of gibus spies might be an issue.      The telephone number restriction helps combat against trolls and griefers, but then again, what about the people that don't have a telephone number or don't want to give away their personal contact information to Valve?      Cough up that $10 buddy because that's the toll of admission if you want to join the competitive club.      Now to me, the no weapon restrictions would honestly kill the mode for me. Banning some of the more broken weapons would really level the playing field. Instead, you get full access to the mini-crits-on-demand cola and the reserve 130-damage-for-blowbacking-a-target-shooter (which by the way, valve planned on buffing for this update).      Last but not least, no real rewards. Valve should be aware that the vast majority of the playerbase isn't going to play competitive just to win and rank up that badge that no one outside of competitive mode will see. They could have added some fancy new weapon skins or exclusive cosmetics to compensate that gut wrenching grind to level 10 or even level 18. But instead, you get nothing. You upgrade your badge to a different picture and that's your lot.    In conclusion       tldr this update sucks and I advise everyone to stay away from the game until they update casual to feel more like valve servers again       This is my first long review that isn't just a meme sentence, and this game has a special place in my heart, so it deserves something that comes from it."",0"
"4447,Team Fortress 2,2012.0,""Team Fortress 2 is a fantastic multi-player online first person shooter with 9 classes that all have unique personalities. Each class uses a primary, secondary and melee weapon.The Heavy has the most health, takes a while to fire, but can do the most damage per second with no reloading, but he moves slowly. The soldier shoots rockets, has the 2nd most health and and is the 2nd slowest, but experienced players can rocket jump. The demoman is a defender, using stickybombs to lay traps and grenades to roll forward, he can sticky jump with some practice and can also be a proficient melee class. The Pyro is a defender, lighting enemies on fire, causing damage for an amount of time, air blasting projectiles away and bringing good cheer and derpiness to any team. Engineers build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers to defend the team and keep them healthy and supplied with ammo. The spy is elusive and backstabs people while invisible cloaking or disguising himself. His sapper can also disable and destroy the engineer's buildings. The scout runs fast with a double jump and shotguns people, he also captures at twice the speed of anyone else. Snipers snipe from far away. Medics heal and make people invincible at times. As for the modes, there are traditional capture the flag, king of the hill and less traditional payload, where blue team will push a moving cart, while red team defends it. The more blue players next to the cart, the faster it will go. If a red player is next to the cart, it stops moving. It is a great dynamic that makes the game really stand out above the rest. There is also payload race, where two teams push their carts, and control points where the goal is to capture all of the points (3 or 5 points instead of just 1 like King of the Hill). Teams for both modes are mostly 12 vs 12. Each mode has quite a few maps and maps are continually added over time.The newest mode is Mann vs Machine, where six players take on wave after wave of robots. There is a free version of Mann vs Machine called Boot Camp and a non free version called Mann Up that costs a Tour of Duty Ticket ($1 in the store). The ticket gets used if you complete a MVM mission. If you don't complete a mission, or if you complete a mission you've already completed, then you keep the ticket. A Mann vs Machine tour is composed of several missions across a few maps. What do you get for completing a tour? A random strange weapon and a notch in your belt!The maps in Team Fortress 2 stand out for their paths, there isn't just one path through each map, but there are usually several routes to get around a herd of foes.  There is a lot of joy and satisfaction flanking opponents and killing an entire team from behind.Sure this game is free to play, but there are a lot of things to buy for real money! Hats for $5, keys for $2.50. Keys are like legalized gambling, you buy a key to open a crate, if you don't get what you want, you can always use Steam trade to trade the item for something you do want or just use another key! There is a whole micro economy in the game with trading. The game will drop you weapons as you play, then you can craft two weapons together to make metal. 18 weapons will make you a refined metal. That's the basic free currency of the game. When you have three refine, you can craft them together for a random hat. Most people prefer to trade their refined for keys, but well refined metal will always generate from dropped weapons, keys will always cost $2.50. You can also buy and sell keys in the Steam market for Steam wallet money to buy Steam games.The items you pay for are cosmetic if not strange weapons that count your kills. So it is not pay to win, even though you can buy in game weapons, but every weapon is a side-grade, not an upgrade, with pros and cons to each weapon. Since this is a multi-player game, nothing will overpower you. It is all rock-paper-scissors. Heavy can kill anything, but a spy or sniper can take out a heavy. A pyro can easily take out a spy. Stuff like that.Team Fortress 2 is updated regularly and has implemented a lot of community created items, maps and Halloween events. The Halloween events feel pretty special, but for the most part, they're just Halloween versions of normal maps. The community items, while cool, seem to be mostly cosmetic items with a few new weapons. There have been community maps made and maps are always free to play on.It is an exceptional game. Diverse weapons, maps and it is buckets of fun and free to play!!!! FREE!!! You get weapons dropped to you over time or you can trade them. It is such a good game even if you're like me and hate multiplayer this is fun multiplayer! Or single player against bots! It is a must play for any fan of first person shooters. The game is smooth, the 9 characters and weapons are very balanced and very different. There is a diverse array of modes."",1"
"4448,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""This game is free and yet it is one of the most popular games on Steam. That says something.I definitely recommend playing TF2 or at least trying it out. However, I believe that to fully enjoy this game, you cannot play for a short period of time. My reason for this belief is that when I first started playing TF2, I played for around an hour and didn't really like it. However, I decided to try playing again around a month after my first try, and I slowly began to enjoy it. Over time, I began to understand how to play as each of the characters, and unlocked many game-changing items. TF2 is fairly easy to play once you get used to it, but when you first start playing, it's like entering a whole new world. TF2 is unlike any other game and it will take a bit of time to fully understand it, but once you do, it becomes one amazingly fun multiplayer game."",1"
4449,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH BUT THIS NEW UPDATE OF 7/8/2016 IS BAD.

ANYWAYS: TF2 is quite simply an amazing game, with 9 different classes, each with their own unique roles in a successful match.1. scout: he runs fast, capping intel, capping control points, and pushing the bomb cart with the power of 2 people! warning, since he runs so fast and has a double jump, allowing for high evasiveness, hes also pretty squishy, having a measly 125 base health. 2. soldier: soldier is a powerhouse, holding 200 base health and a rocket launcher that deals splash damage to multiple enemies. his rocket jumping ability (though this takes a LOT of practice to fully master) can get him to the point even faster than a scout! 3. pyro: the most controversial class, having 175 base health, medium-paced walking speed, and a short-ranged based primary (the flamethrower), pyro can be seen as the weakest class. while most newbies would complain to him being an overpowered fire demon here to eat your babies, they really just don't know how easy it is to counter her. (ONE SECOND THOUGH: PYRO CAN AIRBLAST PROJECTILES AND EXTINGUISH BURNING TEAMMATES BY USING M2, OR MOUSE 2).4. demoman: arguably the most powerful class in the game, demoman is here to bring diversity to the game. (y'know, because hes scottish). anyways, demoman, while having the same 175 health as pyro, has one distinct advantage: the stickybomb launcher. this bad boy does 60 damage per sticky, meaning that spamming it on a public game makes you a bad player that should go back to playing minecraft and the hundredth jumpscare game pewdiepie just played. 5. heavy: also considered one of the weakest in the game (especially without a medic latched onto him 24/7) heavy is the mascot for TF2. this bald, bear wrestling, russian giant shows none of his ruthlessness in the game, but rather the comics (which even then he realy kind of doesn't). heavy has 300 health! """"wow!"""" you must think, until you learn his disadvantages. he is the slowest and has the largest hitbox in the game, making him easy to pick off from afar. 6. medic: oh boy. medic is the second fastest class in the game, just after scout. he also has 150 base health.your CoD-washed mind might think """"hey wheres his souper smg ding?"""" well thats because TF2's medic is actually here for healing. sure, he has a syringe gun (which is basically a flamethrower without afterburn) but no sane medic would rush into a fight like that, as he'd die near instantly. (each class has their own way of dealing 100+ damage in one shot, though this is mostly up to crits/ actual skill). instead, medic uses his medigun, a long, black, healing device that can patch up your teammate's wounds in seconds! plus, when you have full """"ubercharge"""" you can either have increased healing, full invincibility, 100% chance of everything your teammate does being a critical hit, or a tiny uber that increases your resistance to a certain type of attack, and gives you health for the damage the person you're healing recieves. 7. engineer: engineer builds sentries, dispencers, and teleporters. sentries will guard an area, sitting in place waiting for some unsuspecting scout to run in and get blasted away by tons of bullets (and rockets when your sentry reaches max level). dispencers health and provide ammo for you and your teammates. teleporters are capable of sending your teammates from one side of the map to the other, however, all these buildings require a lot of care, as they are susceptable to many attacks, and will do no damage to stock ubers (the kind that grants full invincibility). and since you'll probably be taking care of your buildings and aimbot, engineer only has 125 health.8. sniper: sniper, if played right, can outdamage demoman! even though sniper only has 125 health, he has the longest range out of every class, what with a sniper rifle and all. sniper is the one of the only classes that can kill a fully overhealed heavy in less than 3 seconds. the sniper rifle isn't like most sniper rifles in other games. having good aim is essential to playing sniper, as his main source of damage is getting headshots, otherwise he'll normally do only 50 damage. 9. spy: spy is a real sneaky rat. he can diguise as any class, sap buildings (turning them off and eventually destroying them unless the engineer hits and breaks the sapper), his main """"deal"""" is that he can """"backstab"""" enemies. backstabbing someone is always an instant kill, with only for a few exceptions. TF2 is a great game, and I suggest you look into it."",1"
"4459,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""I like Team Fortress 2 very much, It's little bit hard at begining, but if you got even 1 friend, it's gonna be way more fun. As known as Hat Fortress, hats are funny and good too. And those random weapon drops wont get you bored."",1"
"4460,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Overall, Team Fortress 2 is by far my most favorite game on Steam (or was, until 770 hours had been sunk into this game). It's somewhat enjoyable still, and there's alot to accomplish in the game. There's 9 classes to chose from (I can probably main Soldier) and the trading part has me somewhat hooked as well. I recommend the game to anyone who likes a variety of modes, classes, weapons, and everything else Team Fortress 2 has to offer. You don't really have to strive to be the best. Just have fun playing. Thats what video games are meant for aren't they?"",1"
"4461,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,""You can't go wrong with this title. Not only is it fun, but it is ridiculously varied. Valve has worked on this game with additions and fixes since its launch, so it has undergone a lot of changes, and it barely resembles what it was when it first launched.If you get into it now, sadly you're probably going to have a hard time understanding what's going on under all that clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of weapons, hats and whatnot, but even though it became such a chaotic mess, Team Fortress 2 remains my favorite Team-based FPS of all time.You have lots of options with every class thanks to the sheer number of weapons available to them. Each one is balanced and focused on a specific role, so you're bound to find one that fits your gameplay preferences like a glove.Don't like being an useless sniper who stands way back, away from the action? Fine, get up close and go with a bow.Your team needs a strong offense in order to fend off enemy attacks, and you're playing as a Medic? Switch from the normal Medigun which confers limited invincibility to a Kritzkrieg for guaranteed crits, no problem.Are you so pro with your aim that you feel disgusted using the stock Rocket Launcher as a Soldier or Grenade Launcher as a Demoman? No problemo, use the Direct Hit or Loch'n'Load to show off your mad skillz and deal more damage as a result of your prowess.Do you love being a soldier, but feel a glorious desire to help your team with temporary buffs? Okay, give up your shotgun and go with a Buff Banner, Concheror or Battalion's Backup so you can help everyone push with increased damage, increased speed or increased defense, depending on your equipment of choice.There are a lot of options available to you. It's simply amazing what this game offers. Plus, since it became F2P, there is no reason not to try it. Get it now!"",1"
"4462,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,""BEST GAME ON STEAM! First off, tf2 has many gamemodes, so they're lots of choices to choose from! It's origanality is amazing, saying that it has trading weapons, have killstreaks and kill counters, hats and miscs, It's endless! Plus, it is one of the most played games on steam, and has a huge amount of recomendations, so go â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing buy this game, and ask friends about why they enjoy it!!!"",1"
4463,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,Don't quit just when you start because you dislike the game at first I made that mistake. Just slowly learn the mechanics and you'll be fine. Also don't let your friends make you waste your money on the Mann co store(I also made that mistake). It is a great game.  ,1
"4464,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""so for some reason i decided to delete my old review and make a new one, so, here we goAh Team Fortress 2, a relic of time, yet it still stands strong even todayCurse it all you want, it'll stick around, no matter the oddsI've been playing this game since mid 2013, and frankly, i quickly fell in love with it when i first startedIt's fun, it's fast paced, and to be honest, it's challenging as wellYou have this massive learning curve between players, which is both fun and not fun. Not fun because you can get yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥kicked by a much skilled player, but also fun because through all thatâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥kicking, you start to learn a thing or two, before you eventually get as good as themDespite what many people believe, no, this game is completely free-to-play. Well besided the premium thing which is highly recommended, but that's optionalYou can get all the unlocks via drops, or by trading for them for a very cheap priceTF2 has undergone massive changes over the year, the recent casual / competitive matchmaking is one of the biggest in my books, simply because it completely change how """"pubs"""" are normally playedI myself wasn't too fond of the change in the beginning, but soon after i enjoyed it, ans actually liked itOne of the sad thing about this game, is the optimization. But tbh that's almost expected for a game that's over a decade in age. The fact that it's actually still enjoyable and playable by many by itself is a miracleWell, that was my sorta semi-serious review for y'all. Cheers, and have a good day "",1"
"4465,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""A long time ago, this was possibly the best game I had ever played.It had a friendly community full of traders, clans, fun servers or competitive games with a sense of humour.The updates were exciting to the whole community, and everyone loved them.It's not the same anymore. Valve has tried so hard to compete with games that have recently come out over the years, and it's torn apart what made it great.I'm not saying it'sâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I'm just saying there was a better time."",0"
"4466,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""I liked the game a huge ton, I played it before when my old account didn't get lost, but ever since they decided to add competitive, I'm starting to think that's a huge knee to the balls, with nearly all guns players used/mained they nerfed itI'm not saying I'm not gonna play this anymore, just giving my thought out"",0"
"4467,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""Team Fortress 2 is one of the most fun games I have ever owned. It's face-paced comedic FPS that has a very addicting way of making one want to play more. The nine classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper, and Spy) have their own traits and balances that make the game fun, such as backstabbing (Spy), running faster than the other classes (Scout), and being able to rocket jump (Soldier). With tons of different weapons and a random number of classes of the other team, each round is never the same, so it never gets boring (unless one is playing Deathrun).Team Fortress 2 is also been known as a """"Hat Simulator"""", which it basically is, considering the amount of cosmetics that each class can wear one the battlefield. Their are many different kinds of combinations of hats and miscellanious cosmetics that you never know which kind of combination you can obtain. The game has it's own humor that the characters create and sometime the game itself will cause something that will make one laugh.If one is Free to Play, then one has the choice of being Free to Play forever, or buying something from the TF2 Store and becoming Premium. The game does not force the player to buy something from the store, although the downfall to being Free to Play is that one can not trade with other people and some servers make """"[F2P]"""" appear at the front of your name. But these are just minor things that a player can bypass if all the player wants to do is play the game without the hats and such.I fully recomend this game to anyone who wants a fast-paced FPS that likes to laugh at the often switch between comedy and intense battle. I recommend it even more if you like cosmetics that make your classes look awesome in your own way and the different varieties and stats of weapons that can change one classes health or vulnerability or even strength in damage. To me, Team Fortress 2 is my favorite game I have bought on Steam today."",1"
"4468,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""So far this is the best econmics simulator to I could find online. I have seen or been able to simulate door to door selling, monopolies, pawn shops, and one of artwork masterpiece selling. It's all in the game, and you can trade on websites or on a server dedicated to it. I can't believe someone could duplicate the feeling so well. Also, a bunch of people on my friends list insist that I just have to try the first person shooter mode of the game, maybe I'll get to that someday."",1"
"4469,Team Fortress 2,2012.0,""Ah, classic ol' Team Fortress 2. There really just is nothing like it. It has team-based combat, unlockable weapons, and most important of all... HATS! But forget about that for just a second, what makes this game so good? The humour of this game is just amazing. Every class has something nasty to say about each other, and you would know what I'm talking about if you played the game or watched the """"Meet The ..."""" trailer/teaser series. It just makes me smile when I hear a line I've never heard before. Secondly, the team-based combat. As with most modern day FPS's (With the exclusion of the Battlefield series, somewhat.), you don't see a lot of team oriented gameplay. Take for example, Call of Duty. It's really just a run and gun experience, and that's not what teamwork really is about. In TF2 though, it really requires a good deck of cards for you to win. You need to work together to capture the control point, get the intelligence, push the cart, and etc. It can get rather intense, with either your team or the other team trying to do a push. That is one aspect that I love about TF2. Next, the unlock/drop system.With games such as Call of Duty, you need to level up in order to gain new weapons and attachments for your current weapons. But with TF2... No need. They drop randomly. Every weapon has its advantages and disadvantages, making them virtually balanced either way. But do note that these are only SIDE-GRADES, not overall upgrades from your stock weapons. Your stock weapons are just as effective as your new weapons, but droppable weapons do have stat bonuses and stat drops that your stock weapons do not have. Every unlockable weapon is suituational to some degree. So it is important to plot out which weapon you will use.The thing you've been waiting for...HATS! While not all that important, hats do add some flair to the game. They give you customization options to your class, which can often result in a rather spectacular looking player to not only look at, but play as. But, how do you get hats? It's somewhat complicated, really. Standard """"Unique"""" quality hats drop rather rarely, but you can get them from unlocking crates or trading. You can get """"Genuine"""" hats by ordering a game that has a special compaign that gives you the hat for free if you buy that game. Then there's the real meat of this whole """"hat"""" thing... The holy unusual hat... Yes, they're rare and expensive to obtain. But they give you a feeling of satisfaction and achievement once you do get one for the first time. ESPECIALLY IF you unbox one, that is rather hard to do on the first try. But hats don't add anything special to the game, really. Same with stranges and killstreak weapons, they only track your kills. (Obvious difference is that Stranges track your lifetime kills, while killstreak weapons count how many kills you got in one life.)But yes, I do recommend this game. It is a nice game to play for a few hours and hopefully find something new to do that you never did before."",1"

"4476,Team Fortress 2,2014.0,""Team Fortress 2Two opposing camps and try to conquer territory or those of others to steal documents. This is not a big map, while the action is concentrated on a fairly small area and never on its own base line of the war you do not have to far. So little could be described as a system deathmatchovÃ¡ turmoil with very rigid constraints that determine the characteristics of the characters.Each of the nine occupations is completely different and presents a specific approach to playing. They pick all - born attacker reaches for ultra fast Scout, Soldier balanced with a rocket launcher or a flamethrower armed Pyro. Defenders choose your favorite HeavyGuy with oversized gun, a rogue Demoman with a grenade launcher, and on the walls fireable-holding mines. The third option is astute Engineer who can build a teleport station complementary health and ammo (Dispenser) or fatal loophole after the third upgrade capable of firing missiles.The last group of occupations will appeal especially calmer nature that play for the team and not rushing to the front line. They have a choice of Medic with its inexhaustible source of health and the occasional immortal effect. Of course not miss Sniper, whose professional look me after every execution can inflame red. And finally, virtually invisible Spy, who are attacking from a backup in disguise.MapsThe basic package includes six maps, which is quite a few. On the other hand, all radically different and shortly after the release occurred fan creations. The classic is the already mentioned 2fort, which will again become the most played of all - you know it from the trailers. There's no guaranteed recipe for victory and hardly anyone will be surprised by the unusual strategy. Dustbowl is a map of conquest points. One team defends, the other attacks. When you have some place you can not lose him and immediately move forward to conquer the next space. Thus, working through progressively up to six stations. The map is definitely interesting and the best part is the determination with which resists defending team at the last point. Has never happened to me that I would not much help the team conquered.Any negatives?It is very difficult to me to Team Fortress 2 find any bug. Aside sobs veterans who lack the ability grenades or enemy Medic poison injection. To them and to all who come simple concept, is intended as modifications to Fortress Forever Half-Life 2.

It's probably my favorite game of all time with over 2000 hours logged on it.Even though people may not like the hats and new items, personally I think that's what keeps this game alive. Every time the game feels like it's getting boring or repetitive, they add something new that makes the game feel fresh and fun. This is the only game I think I'd ever give a perfect 10/10, because the game's always expanding. The community on the other hand, is quite a lot like the Sonic fanbase, and I'll just leave it at that.In conclusion, if you haven't played this game before, DO IT"

"4479,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""I've played this game for a couple years now, and have stuck by it's side through thick and thin. I've seen multiple update rages, many update praises, and so much more. That doesn't even begin to explain the time I've had playing the game though. TF2 has so many amazing things you can do and even specialize in. You can pick from 9 classes, and several different weapon combinations within those classes to perfect your own playstyle. Technically speaking, the game isn't limited to 9 classes either. Slap a sword and shield on your Demoman and you get a Demoknight, a completely different playstyle from the bomb lobbing drunk scottish man. Slap a gunslinger and a few good weapons on the Engineer and you get the Combat Engineer, a more aggressive member of the team who (when played right) can actually help more than you think. There's so much more to the game than just a simple shooter, with community servers running custom gamemodes that you wouldn't even expect to be in a game like this. While not all are fun, give them a try, you may like them. The community has its ups and downs, but most communities have those. Occasionally you will find a really toxic player, which can ruin the moods of many people, or someone really salty, or a troll, but don't let them get to you. Try to be the good in the community, and maybe things will change. Me? I'll admit, I can be quite toxic and salty A LOT of the time, but I try to be good where it counts. You've got hundreds, even thousands of game groups all specializing in certain things in TF2, whether it be your favorite gamemode or a group dedicated to Rocket Jumping, there's almost everything you could want from it.Updates: a very controversial subject (especially recently with the Meet Your Match update) I will admit when MYM first came out, I was part of the angry torch toting crowd bent on destroying Valve, but they very quickly noticed that the community was not taking too kindly to the update, and made some announcements and changes. Valve doesn't always listen, but when they do, they do a good job of it. They've tried at least a LITTLE to fix the problem, atleast give them credit for that. Give them time, I'm sure we'll all come back to it eventually, and Valve will get stuff fixed up.There's A LOT and I really do mean A LOT of things I haven't explained here in TF2, you just gotta play it and find them for yourself. Whether or not you enjoy the game isn't up to me, and I wouldn't feel any different if you hated it, I'm not going to shove it down your throat (Okay... Maybe a little.)Edit : The Pyro Update/Jungle Inferno changed the game up quite a bit, which unsurprisingly sparked quite a bit of anger from people in the community. I was angry with the update at first but as things started to calm down a bit it started to feel like normal again. Even if an update is good or bad, give it some time and think rationally about the changes that are happening. Change is something people dislike so it comes as no surprise that when change happened people got mad. Give the game some time and focus more on the core of it all and I'm sure it will stay enjoyable.Edit 2 : Updates are few and far between, so don't expect many to happen. They DO happen, just not often. The community (Atleast most of it I think) has come to terms with the lack of updates and is kind of use to it at this point. An update is more a nice surprise than it is a cool new feature or something at this point.TL"
"4480,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Ever since the last Halloween event the game is becoming less and less enjoyable. The worst part was the Meet Your Match update. You can no longer just join steam friends, unless asking them and waiting for them to finish game. Matches last like 5-10 minutes and your team either gets destroyed or you are destroying the other team. Very rarely there's a balanced match. Whoever enjoys competitive gameplay will enjoy this, but whoever just wants to spend like 30 minutes of spare time, it wouldn't be such a good experience.Valve became too lazy to update anything, or should I say the number of people working on anything related to the game (bug fixes, updates...) decreased dramatically. That definitely decreased the quality of the updates. They're even too lazy to modify the last major update we had on the store page (which stays Tough Break now, released almost a year ago). Events like Scream Fortress were really enjoyable in past years, because Valve always added something new. For the past 2 years they rely only on the community to create a few maps and that's everything new about the event.For the time being I cannot recommend this game to newcomers."",0"

Now the game is pretty much screwed, new update completely overhauled quickplay mechanic that brought me deeper into the game. Before that it was awesome, i played with pretty much same people every night on my favorite maps and it was really great. Now the game is so broken there is no point in discussing it.

Team Fortress 2 combines the teamwork and the individual skill perfectly, making you feel useful even if the only thing you have done in the match is killing a random person.Nine means nine ways of playing, which actually translates in nine different games. At least at first. As soon as you start unlocking weapons, you will discover that you can play with a class in a whole different way, refreshing your interest for the game.If that weren't enough to keep you playing this game forever, Valve releases updates every few months, weeks, or even days, with tons of fixes and, more importantly, additions to the game, making you want to play more and more.But that is not the best part. Everything important in this game is 100% free.

Youtubers leaving, and hell. Shibby is basically a freaking battlefield 4 youtuber now! Like, seriously! What did we do to force him to play the generic military shooter that has been rehashed? Tf2 was great. It still is. Its, one of the most unique and innovative games, and well, its dying. Nothing lasts forever. Tf2 has been around for 19 -ish years and theres only a certain point to something. You start with a sketch. You expand on it, draw lines all over the paper, fill in the gaps.But eventually......Your run out of space..I hate to see a wonderful game die. But more and more actual servers empty, and more and more people go to trade, idle and VSH servers, the game slowly kills itself. Is tf2 still the 3rd most played game? Hell yeah! But so many of those people are congaing, or bartering over unusuals, and not playing the game. Is it the communities fault? No. A poor reflection of valves contribution and what just soldified the joke that """"Valve used to make games, now they make money"""" Is the end of the line update, a poor excuse that could have introduced something that hasnt been seen in so long- a FINISHED map. Not â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing operation hole bound beta, or tile texture RD, but a real, somewhat new gamemode. But valve took it out because it was """"Too confusing"""" They dont add weapons, only cosmetics and a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cheap attempt to suck up money through bonus ducks. I would hate to see tf2 die, because so many people are invested. If tf2 dies, so does the market. the 10,000 dollar spender who bought the burning KE. Smissmass was okay. New weapons. Yay.

"4496,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Meet Your Match is a Mess of an update, but I believe that TF2 will pull through, like time and time before, again.Many balances have been for the better, and for the not as well thought out ones, underlying them lies a recognition of the true problem which a great step forward.TO all the minor class and weapon rebalances,I appreciated Spy and pyro buffs, Valve recognized that pyro and spy were underpowered.A Health buff for pyro (185) instead of or in addition to its DPS buff would be better suited to its current role in TF2 I believe however.Natascha and Huo Long were nerfed and buffed nicely.Sun On a Stick might actually see some use now (maybe).Other good rebalances include Widowmaker, Short Circuit, Disciplinary action, Eureka Effect, Overdose (As a Medic main, I get and like what Valve is trying to do here).The point I'm trying to make, is that from all the rebalances, one can see that Valve really is taking the time to understand how this game is played.With that in mind, here are some of the major problems I see and how Valve can fix them.Casual: It's a good idea, the only problem being it is no longer """"casual"""".You cant join friends in the middle of a game anymore.And the servers they assign you to have terrible pings where I am.All the good players who like to mess around stopped playing and all the terrible players started tryharding.An easy way to fix this is bringing back the option to let you join casual in the middle of the game by looking through server list or the """"join game"""" button and voting systems to extend current map/match-up.Comp: should be available for all players who have played above a certain amount of hours instead of just for those who paid for the game.If one or two hour farmers get through it wont matter because Valve could easily use their ranking system to pair people with similar skill levels together. If you arent good, doesnt matter how much you game the system, you're stuck at bottom.Comp needs class limits.Maybe 2 for each Assault class and one for each defense class and they could explain it as """"to keep the game dynamic"""".(Read up on the metagame and watch some matches before you ask why)Medic speed buff is stupid. Increases survivability of medic, encouraging stalemates in comp (Medics feel safer, less urgency to push from winning team).Reduces the fun in playing Medic because you get to be sloppier in your positioning, less good at dodging which is basically all Medic is about.Scout did -not- need another buff (or whatever this was to scout)It sounds like it makes sense """"travel at the same rate of the player you are healing"""" but it's actually really gimmicky, basically boiling down to """"heal scouts to go fast"""" because they are only class faster than Medic.Despite the above, potential players, dont be put off. TF2 is still a miracle of a game: the chemistry between all the classes work so well, it is incredibly fun to play and getting good is really satisfying.Besides, there's always community servers to tide this over (cp_orange, jump maps, mge, 24/7 dustbowl hightower)"",1"

"4501,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""As things stand on day one of this update I cannot recommend this game.If I could get a refund on the money I've spent in the store I would do.I know I'm a late comer to the game so I got it for free but between my account and my son's I've spent ~Â£100 on this game.  To me that means this game was not free, I chose to support Valve by spending money in the store, I bought a stamp (was considering buying more) and I spent money in the community market.My number one gripe is the locked first person camera mode while you are dead, this causes me motion sickness - this is a showstopper for me.Number two gripe, the insane waiting time to get into a match.  Does it help much to know there are over 800 players near by that are """"compatible"""" and over 3500 empty servers?  No, that's just enfuriating.Choosing all core game modes to theoretically maximise my """"compatibility"""" still resulted in a 30 minute wait time.  I ended up in a game mode I have never played which meant a map I didn't know so (even if you discount the motion sickness) I had a really poor game experience.  I know which game types I like (CTF and occasionally Payload) so I had a 66% chance of a crappy game.Compatibility?  Damn game sounds like a dating app.Number three gripe, I can no longer just sit and play on one server for a few hours with a bunch of people who """"just want to play"""".  I agree that can end up with some pretty poor teams but even they were better than having a 50% chance of ending up in a game type I don't want to play and being force to play it or be penalised with a """"leaver"""" debuff.Even if the wait times were down to sub three minutes I still want to be able to choose my game type, I like CTF, I want to play CTF.   I want to sit on a server and play until I'm bored, get voted off or get hungry / tired and leave.I can see how the casual / matching / leaver debuff system could enhance teamwork, not in itself a bad idea but as it stands I just want to load TF2, find a CTF server and play for as long as I feel like playing (and not be made to feel sick).This review is posted on day one of a major overhaul of the lobby and as such the wait times could be inordinately long due to heavens knows what."",0"
"4502,Team Fortress 2,2016.0,""Team fortress 2I would say after spending at least 1k hours on this game, it has an interesting and well desgined set up towards competeive team fights. As well as creating a goofy and entertaining enviorment that is customizable to a certain degree.The game demands a heavy amount of teamwork towards objectives on maps. However at the same time, value has assesed the true interest of the game. Killing enemy players. This has been provided through arena modes, team competions, and a decent amount of maps that allow the player the simply enjoy themself within the enviroment given. The game itself provides an exellent way of assisting new players, such as coaching which has an experienced player go out of their way in order to help new players. In doing so, experienced players are rewarded. However, this is what value has done in order to assist new players.The community can be extremely harsh when it comes to new players. New players are easily identifed via not having any hats, having a hat that is easily accessaible via achievement, or simply inexperience. These players are looked down upon within the community due to their lack of understand towards certain events where players may be trying to do something outside of the common norm within the game and a new player disturbing it. It is also laid out that new players do not understand how to assist a team greatly, even sometimes ruining a game.In my opinion, I believe that it would be benefical to most of the community that new players were to take some time to figure out classes, look up online tutorials towards how you should play your class, even take some time to face agianst hard bots. An easy way to not be quickly looked down upon, targeted for pranks, is to simply buy a universal hat. This will give players the idea that you may not be 'free to play' so to speak. Though other than being targeted because of inexperience, the community can be quite...interesting. It all depends towarsd how you go about putting yourself out into the community.Though this game provides a large variety of assests that protain towards the entiertainment needs of the vast majority of gamers through third party resources such as custom modders, map designers and much more.In conclusion, I would find that this game is extremely fun, only if you can put together how you can do it well. Where exactly you may fit in with the community itself. If you find the right place to be, you can find yourself playing this game for a long time."",1"

The acquisition of items is a rather entertaining little meta-game in itself.   Essentially, it is a shooter that can allow players on opposing teams to strategize and adapt their play as they see fit, with some players preferring Scout, Sniper, Medic, or Engineer roles (among others).

"4523,Team Fortress 2,2013.0,""Of all the 300 odd games I have, I've played this one more than all the others combined (as of 7/2013), which says a lot about this game's quality and replayability. In my opinion it's one of the best tycoon games ever, as you work your way up the ladder of hats and unusuals, but instead of earning money proportional to the quality and quantity of your hats, you have to play a cute FPS minigame to earn basic items, that you can use to trade your way up to more hats. This is an interesting take on the tycoon formula, but puts more focus on economy and trading, and obviously works well for this game.10/10, would wear hats again."",1"

"4526,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""As a payer with over 2000 hours in this game, I think it's fair to say I like it. Why?Pros:1. The cartoonish style of the game allows for all sorts of cool and interesting game mechanics, such as teleporters.2. The game is still recieving new weapons, cosmetics, maps, and bug fixes, even though it was relesed in 2007.3. There's an enormous ammount of customization, and I'm not just talking about your player. You can change the hud and many other aspects of the game.4. There are a million ways to play the game. Using different weapons in your loadout can drastically alter the game itself if you know how to use them.5. There is a whole trading economy. Trading and selling items can literally be a game itself, and many people play the game for that reason.6. The community surrounding this game is large and vibrant. Tired of the same old maps? There are plenty of community hosted servers that play on fun and unique maps. There have even been official updates to the game that have comepletely made of community made items and maps. There really is no other developer that works and listens to it's community quite like Valve.7. There really aren't many hackers. You'll see one if you play the game long enough, but you can go months without seeing one.8. It's free.Cons:1. No real singleplayer mode. There is an offline mode with bots, and it's good for practice, but that's it. There's no campaign, and the only story is in comics from the official web site (which are a good read).2. There is a HUGE learning curve. It will take you a long time to learn about all the different weapons and how to use them, or where to place your buildings as an engineer, or how that spy killed you after you killed him.3. New players and/or players that aren't really familliar with the game are hated with a passion, and since it can take a while to learn the game, you can expect some hate for quite some time.4. It's not a good game for casual gamers because of cons 2 & 3.5. The few hackers that play the game (and there really aren't any at all) are extremely hard to get rid of. They change their name to avoid vote kicks/bans, spam the chat, and are very annoying to play against, but as I said in the pros, hackers are few and far between, and you can always join another server."",1"

"4529,Team Fortress 2,2017.0,""This is a very fun game that I would recommend to anyone!I used to not play this game very often, it just didn't seem interesting to me, not one bit. But then, I slowly began to start playing it more and more, and now I'm hooked, and I just love it! The characters (the playable classes), the maps, the game modes, it's nothing but hours of endless fun! Sure, you'll come across hackers every once in a while, and being put on a team with TERRIBLE Teammates isn't exactly uncommon, but all the negative stuff aside, this game is amazing!Even if you don't like shooter games, give this game a chance! It originally wasn't my thing, but now it's my favorite game!There are a lot of things you can do in it, inculding taunts, with the playable classes, and along with that they're all different, which distinct cosmetics, hats, and so on (they also have their own personalites as shown in the """"meet the team"""" videos on YouTube, but if you're interested in the actual game rather than the characters, just don't search them up). I've played each class at least once, and yet it's STILL really fun to experiment with them, because there are plenty of things I've never done before with each of them!As for gamemodes, well, there's a ton of them, meaning that if you dislike one, there will be one you'll like! Gamemodes inculde payload, control points, MVM, etc...There are only a couple of problems with this game that I think are worth putting into this review, the first one being matchmaking, the weird way that servers are done. I hope for this to undone in the future. The second problem isn't with the game itself, but with the playerbase, but I understand that there's no way to control people, and people are going to be rude no matter what online game you're playing. The main reason I put the second one is because it's common to come across twelve year old kids (that are too young to even be playing this game) screaming swear words into their micrphones, but just mute them and all is good.Overall, get this game, but as I said earlier, it's NOTHING but hours of endless fun!"",1"

"4542,Team Fortress 2,2015.0,""Team Fortress 2 is one of the best games you can play here on Steam. It is Free to Play with micro-transactions. That means it is up to you how much money you spend on the game. You can try it for free, stay if you like it or go if you don't. It's up to you and you won't regret downloading it.The game itself offers nine classes. Each of them fills a different role in the team. By the time you play, you will also get unlocks for each character. That basically means that there are multiple ways of playing the game. You can even put yourself a goofy loadout together if you prefer to play less serious.At the same time, the game shines because it is really unique in a way. It is full of gimmicks and the playstyle is very different from most shooter games. There is no Team Deathmatch and no normal Assault Rifle gun etc but exactly that is the reason why the game is so good. It offers way more than from what you get from all these repetitive shooter games that essentially play the same nowadays.Many different weapons, customizeable characters, taunts, unique gamemodes and gameplay, mods, a trading system... what else do you need? I do belive that is the reason why the game already survived so long and it still gets updated.In a nutshell, I suggest you to jump right into it if you haven't already. It's free. And if you like it, why not stay? "

Also, community servers provide different gamemodes/mods allowing you to choose your preference (such as rocket jump maps, versus saxton hale, surf, etc.).  The most enjoyable aspect of this game is that you aren't strictly abided to just do the objective of the game.
