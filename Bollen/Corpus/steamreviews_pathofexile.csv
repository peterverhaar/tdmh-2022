"2471,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Woops, I didn't write a review on this one?Thus I, too, am to blame this gem didn't/doesn't get the audience it deserves.Yes, I also don't trust Free-to-Play games. I don't like the business model and I don't like the way their gameplay mechanics  function.This, however, is one of the few games which are TRUELY free-to-play. This game is so fair you almost feel bad if you don't pay anything (maybe that's how they get you to spend your money... bastards!). The things you can buy are purely decorative except for cheap extra space in your item chest (but it's already so big you don't even need it if you just play through the game once or twice).So yeah, what you get absolutely for free here is a full game and there's nothing that feels cheap about it. It does have a rather classical feel, though. Actually, this is the only other game which gave me that Diablo II feeling. It's not the same and Path of Exile has a lot of good gameplay ideas and a whole fantasy world of its own, so don't expect a clone.It's been a while now that I've played through it and I cannot really point out any details about what I liked especially and what bothered me, but I do remember I had a good time with this and if you liked Diablo II you should really give this one a try. Because it has had some big updates and new content since I've stopped playing I might pick it up again soon. Maybe playing alongside you guys because co-op playing works quite well also :)"",1"

2475,Path of Exile,2013.0,its awesome..it is even better than diablo 3...and its even for free !!! and defenetily the first freegame i really like..cant believe theyr making a game like this for free..but u can buy ingame items and stuff with real money if you want to,1
"2476,Path of Exile,2018.0,""So currently I only have around 24 hours and I am in the third out of four acts, this is entirely a beginners perspective so keep that in mind.Path of Exile is fantastic. EVERY steam owner should at one point or another try this game. However, it might take a bit to get to actually liking the game because it takes around 7 hours to get there (for me at least). This game is basically the paladins to diablo. Personally I think these games are about equal with diablo scoring a bit higher in my book because of just nostalgia and a couple of minor points.Art StyleIn act one im sorry but this game just looked like garbage. I personally couldnt stand looking at my character going through uninspired, nasty, depressing backgrounds. Thankfully it progressively looks better throughout play and just continues to get better with act 3 being the nicest looking act thusfar. Diablo I think should be a keymark for this. Just compare any gameplay from diablo with that of path of exile. Diablos backgrounds always seem to be nice and polished and the character animations along side particle adn spell effects just make the game look stunning and a treat to play. PoE is very boring and quite honestly depressing to look at. ProgressionOk this is PURELY opinion based but I will try to be as objective as possible. Diablo takes an approach that is very standard in the rpg industry and that is of obtaining skills through level ups and you upgrade them from there. In this system there are very tight rules that players can learn and abuse to create the most effective builds. In PoE it takes an approach that is being rappidly popularized with games such as albion online. That being skills are merely """"items"""" that you equip. This system allows for MUCH more creativity BUT can make the build scene very messy and can lead to pure confussion with new players. In MY personal opinion I think that the traditional way is better but that is only my opinion. HOWEVERPoE wins in the costumazation department PURELY because of the passive skill tree. Holy crap. This skill tree. No barriers locked behind class walls. All classes can have any passive. That is SO. REFRESHING. Rarely ever do I see games do this and I still have no Idea why. GameplayThis is an Action RPG. Meaning prepare  yourself for anime levels of carnage along side absolute eye candy spells and combat. Not really much to say other then that its very fast paced. Overall This is a must play. I intend to progress farther and play for engame content."",1"
"2477,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Path of Exile is an online economy simulator set in the web-based fantasy world of poe.trade. It is designed around an unregulated online item economy, character customisation littered with noob traps with only a few endgame-viable builds, trade-based PvP and races to be 'First!' and annoy everyone else just trying to play the damn game in peace and quiet."",0"
2478,Path of Exile,2018.0,So as a ARPG this game is pretty good way better then Diablo 3. The game plays more like Diablo 2 mixed with a bit of the original Diablo. My issue with the game is the unintresting story line this game has. I love ARPG games but I really need a good story to go along with it. This game is good for mindless killing of tons of trash mods an grinding for better gear which some people really like doing and really I don't mind doing either but on my way to that point I would like a story that I can get into an really feel connected with the character I am playing.For me I just can't connect with the character I am playing. Your character barely even speaks. If you are looking for a good ARPG with story at least in my opinion I would look for something else. For me I wouldn't recommend this game.,0

"2482,Path of Exile,2018.0,""I want to love Path of Exile. I really do. The developers are amazing and they've created an action RPG that far surpasses the scope of Diablo 3. They keep pumping regular updates and the new season ladders keep content fresh. The story is...there...if you want to get into it, but you aren't going to play this game for the story. The gameplay is absolutely amazing. IF you have a good build.And that's where the game falls short for me. Building your character is brutal and unforgiving in Path of Exile. A couple of mistakes ensure that your build becomes low tier garbage and you have to either spend hours grinding for Regret orbs which let you reskill ONE point each, or you have to build a new character from scratch. Some people enjoy this kind of rigidity. I do not. I can't honestly enjoy playing the game when half my time is spent alt tabbed into the build maker and character build guides online, just so I don't mess my character and turn it into an unplayable dung heap."",0"
"2483,Path of Exile,2018.0,""The game Diablo 3 should have been... When you look at Path of Exiles, with its small team of developers, and at least when they started the limited amount of cash, they must have had and then you look at Blizzard with their war chest and you compare Diablo 3 and PoE and you can clearly see how much better game this one is.The only microtransactions are for cosmetics... you sometimes wonder how this people even eat...

"2485,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Stunning visuals, addictive mechanics, and neat functions. Path of Exile, at first, is a solid experience, especially since the game doesn't cost a dime, and sports ethical microtransactions. No pay to win here, which is a big plus in my book. Path of Exile was meant to be the Diablo 2 successor that I've always dreamed of... but is it?The first playthrough, as previously stated, was solid. The character progression tree is intimidating at first, but can be mastered over time. Skill gems offer a neat twist to the tried and true """"Diablo"""" formula. There's plenty of strategy to implement here. I thoroughly enjoyed the standard difficulty.But where did it all go wrong?The second you beat the first playthrough, it all goes downhill. """"Cruel"""" difficulty is terribly unbalanced. You will breeze through regular enemies, but once a rare or unique enemy appears, you are promptly one-shot-killed. Heck, even a select few normal enemies can one or two shot kill you. Regardless of how you die, you will lose 5% of your experience on this difficulty. This function is archaic, and fundamentally flawed, completely and totally. Diablo 2 did this, except the game is 15 years old, and 15 years is enough time for game developers to realize """"yes, players hate this, and it kills progression, and thus, the entire gameplay experience"""". Grinding Gear Games didn't get the memo, it seems. Regardless, once this penalty kicks in, the game becomes a sluggish, boring grindfest where you struggle to level up in the face of unbalanced enemies and """"cruel"""" penalties. My desire to play was crushed once I was met with this awful formula. As an insult to injury, your elemental resistances are reduced by 20%, which makes one-shot deaths even easier.Due to this massive difficulty boost, you REQUIRE a build to survive. There is no free reign to design your character anymore"

"2487,Path of Exile,2015.0,""It's very difficult for me to write reviews without going into too much detail, but if I could describe this in once sentence, it'd be this:It's a very rewarding, fun, challenging action RPG that is based more around technical knowledge. One last thing, it's also free! No pay to win either. So here's a more detailed explanation about this game:1) The game's concept:Path of Exile is an RPG that emphasizes on one thing: combat. As far as the game's style and aesthetics are concerned, I guess you could say it operates a bit like the Diablo series. Keep in mind I haven't played Diablo, but I just thought that'd be the easiest explanation for you guys to understand. You're using your mouse for movement, combat, and your keyboard buttons for additional combat skills in this game. It's also fast paced as well. And of course, this game also gives you a wide variety of characters to choose from. The characters you play as are based on different methods of combat. As far as combat is concerned, you have your choices of melee, magic, or archery. Keep in mind that the combat is much, much more complex, but I'd hate to make this review a complete novel, so I'll keep the explanation simple.2) While the concept is easy to understand, the extra details are where things get very, very confusing.I haven't played this game enough to know everything. In fact, I have barely scratched the surface. That being said, Path of Exile is a game that DEMANDS you to know your stuff! Here's what I mean:-So basically, there is this thing called the Passive Skill Tree. Every character from the game has their own special place on this skill tree. As your level up, you are given what is called a 'passive,' but I'll just call it a skill point.The skill points you earn on this game are meant to be spent on certain skills on the tree. These skills can range from anything to stat boosts, critical hit damage multipliers, elemental damage increases, and a whole load of others that you'll have to find out for yourself. So the way you spend skill points on the tree works like this:-You don't spend your points on any skill you want. You have to spend these points from the beginning. It is a step by step process.-What you do have control over is how you will carve out your path on this tree, which is dependent on the skills you need.Therefore, what this means is that when you play this game, you NEED to know what your character's build on the tree will be. Are they going to make heavy use of critical hits? Will they emphasize on elemental damage? Those are the types of questions you need to ask yourself when making the build. The skills you choose on this game relate to this. So if you try to 'wing it,' and just think """"meh, I don't really care what skills I pick"""" then your character is destined for failure. You come up with an idea for that build and stick to it. Always.With that being said, you can undo your mistakes on the tree. Just remember that there are very few instances where you get them for free, and you will have to use some uncommon items. So you can redeem those points and then put them in areas where you know you'll need them.Making your own build is considered difficult as well, but you can use guides online made by other players. PoE has a large community of players, so you can always look up builds and follow guides to help you.So that's the skill tree in a nutshell for you. But if you thought that was over, wait until you try to understand combat skills.Path of Exile uses these things called gems. Gems either grant you a combat skill, or you use support gems, which support the combat skill gems (not going into detail over that). Armor and weapons have these things called 'sockets.' Sockets are spaces in these items that you put the gems in. In order for support gems to work along with the combat skill gems, they require links between the sockets. So basically, making effective use of these combat skills (which come from gems) means that you MUST find only a few combat skills that your character's build will focus on. The general rule on this game (for the most part) is that you use one combat skill for your main attack, one movement-related skill that you can use to escape dangerous situations, and another to be used as a single attack against tough opponents like bosses. The rest of your skills come from auras or curses (auras benefit you and your allies. Curses affect the enemy)So the takeaway from the complexity of this game is this:-To be effective at this game, your character's build on the skill tree AND the skills you choose to use for this game MUST correspond with each other. For example, if your character makes use of spells and cold damage primarily, those places on your tree should involve areas that upgrade cold and spell damage (among other factors that will influence it)Oh, and your gear must also correspond with this as well. So all I've explained in point number 2 is the most challenging concept to understand for players like me. Only now am I finally understand the concept, but slowly. 3) What about the plot?Path of Exile is a gritty, gory RPG with an edgy plot. Basically, regardless of the character you start with, you were someone who was exiled from your home island (which is run by an oppressive theocracy that takes slaves) for breaking the law. So now you've ended up on this hostile continet called 'Wraeclast."""" It's a continent that has been ravaged by wars, and all that's left are the remnants of what once was left of civilization. People are either fighting for survival, power, or both. You're just moving on through the chaos.There are a total of 10 acts on this game, complete with an endless supply of enemies to kill. Personally, I'm not that interested in the plot, but love the gameplay. Should be interesting enough for those of you who like to read a lot in video games, though. 4) Any cons?Sometimes, the game developers will try to maintain 'balance' on the game. This is because of the use of builds and abilities that would be considered to make the game too easy. So when they try to maintain balance in their updates, this will lead to all of your skill points completely reset. You will, of course, get to spend them all again. You just have to be considerate of where you place those skill points.Also, lately this game has been prone to disconnections. From what I've heard, this is because more people are crowding the game's servers, so be prepared to have some lagging here and there, and yes, disconnects. Don't worry though, because problems like these are fixed by the devs.Other than that, this game is tight.5) The Bottom Line:If you love a game that will give you a challenge, which also happens to reward you for knowing your stuff, all combined in an action RPG, you will love this game. Just expect to be looking up the PoE wiki, Youtube videos, and asking other players for help in order to better understand it. Sounds like a lot of work, but trust me, you will know it's worth it."",1"
"2488,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Great ARPG game. I came for some good ol' Diablo 2 flavour, I stayed for the talent tree (forest might be more accurate), build-enabling items, race seasons, 3-month leagues, challenge rewards and the pure joy of mastering the game's complexity.Worth a try."",1"
"2489,Path of Exile,2013.0,""Probably has the best, most extensive and elaborate character customisation of any game, a ridiculous passive skill tree, unique and varied active skill mechanic allowing you to truly make any sort of character you want as long as you're willing to put in the work to get there. Oh yeah, there's a ton of loot aswell."",1"
2490,Path of Exile,2013.0,Greatest ARPG ever made this is what diablo 3 should have been and its a f2p game without p2w options. only cosmetic microtransaction. must try !! just whipser me and i can invite you to my guild,1
"2491,Path of Exile,2015.0,""An excellent action RPG for all Diablo 2 fans out there. For me Diablo 3 was kind of a disappointment, long story short: the loot didn't feel exciting. In Path of Exile I actually expect to find useful items. I constantly find myself getting excited over a rare item dropping and even some basic white items for crafting.Another thing I disliked about Diablo 3 was the auction house, it just ruined the trading aspect for me since it completely removed any and all interaction with other people. Maybe I'm weird but I enjoy discussing prices with other people and actually doing the trading. Even with most people setting up a semi-automated shop via the use of """"Procurement"""", you still get to interact with other people and there's bartering to be done.PoE has a microtransaction shop where you can buy cosmetic effects (armor skins, effects for your weapons, pets etc.) and stash tabs. You could argue the stash tabs affect the game in a way that could be interpreted as pay-to-win but I disagree. You can play the game just fine with the free 4 tabs you get by default, you just have to pay inventory tetris a bit more and choose what items you wish to keep more carefully. The skins you buy for your armor/weapons are also transferrable between items and characters, so you don't have to buy another one to apply the effect to another item.The skill tree and skill gem systems allow for a wide variety of builds and I find it nicely flexible to fit whatever I want out of a build at the time. It's more than just unlocking a fireball"
"2492,Path of Exile,2014.0,""As a Beta backer, I'm very happy with what GGG have done with this game over the years, Well polished and a really great replacement for Diablo 2. When you start, it can be a bit daunting to look at that huge passive tree before you, but after a time it becomes easier and easier to travel around the tree. Look at guides online, it's completely fine too, see what you can do to tweek it, your first build will always be horrible if you do not get help, but when you do make that one magical build that destroys everything it's extremely rewarding.The Currency in this game is what made me play it for so long, it's so complex but at the same time simple. The haggle game is real and it's so ALIVE, always moving, don't believe that one guy with the fixed prices because this game is ALL about Supply and Demand.This game has no pants, does not matter, you still look like the dog's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ towards the endgame with full bodied armour huggin dem thighs tight.Need more Help?

"2493,Path of Exile,2015.0,""ForewordThis document is not a review as much as it is my individual perception and impression of the game. The singular goal of this writing is to allow an individual who is unfamiliar with Path of Exile to rapidly establish an understanding of what this game really is.To begin any discussion of this game, ask yourself: """"What do I value more, a good experience or a good reward? Am I more experience-oriented with my gaming, or more reward-oriented?"""" If you find yourself to be a reward-oriented gamer, you can stop reading now. This is an experience-oriented game. For most players in fact, Path of Exile is more likely to kill your character than to reward you.This is intended to be a light review, so I will compress this message into the following categories: game design and experience elements, gameplay and mechanical elements, RPG and technical elements. I have decided against including anything about the Path of Exile community as it is not directly related to the game itself.Game Design and Experience ElementsPath of Exile is Free-to-Play grind-to-grind Action-RPG that offers the one of greatest gaming sandboxes for building your own unique gameplay experience. It is intended that a player create, build, and tailor a character to then play the game in real-time. I offer a break-down of these labels below.StoryWe can start with the game context. The story of the game is as thin as the lore is impenetrable. I can explain the story: A demonic political figure has exiled you to a nightmare, so you set off to murder him. During your murderous expedition, you put-down legions of monsters, zombies, and mutants as you get wrapped up in the mystery of the nightmare. So that's all good. The lore is much, much harder to explain and piece together. Path is one of those games that has a simple story and a voluminous lore, one can draw comparisons to Dark Souls. The challenge of piecing the lore together is there for anyone who wants it.The GrindNow let's shift the discussion towards the grind, it's time for some raw perception about how this game implements the dungeon-crawler. There are a few things inherent to all ARPG's: cool skills, skill systems, zoned instances, mad loot, tiers of enemies, powerful boss mobs, and farming. Players will be farming in the later levels of this game so that they can survive moving up to higher levels. The game deserves the grind-to-grind label but it's not all bad. This game provides excellent enemy variety with its affix system and the developers continually introduce more new enemies to the game. The affixed monsters that the game generates provides a challenge to all builds as they expose different weaknesses in your characters. Make no mistake, you will be playing to kill monsters in this game, period"
"2494,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Diablo 2 + FF7 Materia system.Solid ARPG with a very fun early game full of experimentation and discovery, and a brilliant end game with great features. A lot of the space between can REALLY REALLY suck though, as you bottleneck your build at the gear level, needing very specific number, color, and connection schemes of slots, and needing those setups on items with decent stats as well.Highly recommended for the most hardcore, and the most casual. Normal players may find themselves bored and leaving in the mid game, or playing a large number of characters and fighting with stash space."",1"
"2495,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Path of Exile has been almost nonstop fun since I picked it up in closed beta at the end of 2011. I've put in hundreds of hours over many characters before this game hit Steam. If you like Diablo, you will likely enjoy PoE. This is the spiritual successor to Diablo 2.  Prepare yourself though - this isn't as simple as Diablo 3, and requires a lot more planning, thought, and testing to have an effective build.Math of Exile is a game where you afk in town while reading up on skill mechanics and planning out how you're going to set up your future passive skill points. The mechanics of combat, damage, and character resources (health, mana, energy shield, armor, etc) are very well thought out and make for strong ARPG combat, as a spiritual successor to the Diablo line should be. Early game (the first ~19 levels) has a little more variety than D3 per character, but after level 19 your character will be able to use a much wider variety of skills, provided you can get them from a Master or another player, or find them as drops. Gameplay is varied, but approaching late game becomes a grind not unlike running GRs over and over. I personally find PoE's grind more fun because there's more I can do while grinding, and there's a large, active community in each league, and I can chat and get responses and conversations at any time.Overall it's a modern Diablo 2 experience, with a more emphasis on grinding in the late game than D2, but in each respect is more rewarding than D3's """"more loot, less gameplay"""" twist on the Diablo recipe.You will be tested, and you will be found wanting. Just try to survive.Edit: How many expansions in are we now? Four? Four free expansions, three of which are more content rich than the D2 expansion, and all of which have more content than Diablo 3's xpac. Seriously, give this game a go. It's free, it's fun, it's awesome."",1"
"2496,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Simply the best D2 sequel ever made. The gem and skill system are unique and clever while the game play is sharp and fast. The player is presented with a constant series of interesting decisions that lead to real consequences in their character's progress. Don't be put off by the freemium thing - like so many other design decisions, Grind Gear Games does it right."",1"
"2497,Path of Exile,2014.0,""SUMMARY: this game is, IMO, the best of its kind.---The latest free mini-expansion for Path of Exile releases later today so it seems like a good time for me to recommend it. On the face of it this game is your standard Diablo-clone - but even though it's not as flashy as Diablo 3, its depth, customisation and replayability ultimately make it rise above the competition. The combat is fun and challenging. The game has a slow start (though that's one of the issues being addressed in today's expansion) but once the combination of skills and variety of environments becomes apparent it really comes into its own.The skill tree is huge (really, absolutely massive) and offers countless build customisation options, which is in complete contrast to (e.g.) Diablo 3. You can combine skill gems to give your skills different effects -- sort of like runes in D3, but much deeper. I enjoy the loot and itemisation much more than other games in the genre too because of the possibility of crafting and improving any 'trash' item that drops.The replayability is fantastic. New 'challenge leagues' are launched every few months which offer the option of an economy reset and always change the game in interesting ways. They also usually adjust the balance of the game (it can be a bit flavour-of-the-month-ish) regularly which means that different builds are enticing, and since builds play very differently this also helps replayability. Then there's 'races' - short and challenging events of between 12 mins and three hours which offer a unique challenge and a nice way to get into competitive online gaming in a non-PvP setting. Race seasons run for six weeks or so every few months, with several events per day and unique rewards.PoE is free-to-play but never pay-to-win. It has one of the best business models of any F2P game. Microtransactions are cosmetic or functional (e.g. visual skill effects, stash tabs) and the base offering is among the most generous I've seen in a F2P game. PoE's devs are responsive and down-to-earth, and regularly interact with players on reddit and the forums. Give them your money!There are also plenty of little things - e.g. the game's take on health/mana flasks - which are so obviously better than the implementation in other games in the genre that it's very hard to go back to the impoverished versions of those features in other games.There are still things that need improving - the trade system needs work, for instance, and desync can be a problem in certain circumstances. But these are only small negatives compared to the positives."",1"
"2498,Path of Exile,2015.0,""This is a great game with unbelievable replay value. I've only beaten the game with one class so far and I'm only halfway through beating it again with another class. It's extremely awesome for the price--and by the way, it's free!! It's a very easy to pick up game with an extensive skill-tree level-up system that allows you to customize your fighting style based on your class. Not a lot of strategy comes into playing this game so even those unfamiliar with RPG-type games can pick this up really well. I mean, just look at how long I've been playing it."",1"
"2499,Path of Exile,2015.0,""One of  (If not) the best F2P Arpg out there.Graphics is decent, And the feel of the game is 10/10.Oh and the first time I saw the talent tree, I nearly fell of my chair.Started playing 6 hours ago, not stoping now :)Hope End game Contents are awesome as well :) "",1"
"2500,Path of Exile,2016.0,""Path of Exile is definitely the highest point an ARPG can achieve , it has the build diversity, the difficulty that can make you go mad, the real end game that can be only achieved by really putting the time and hard work on your character, and so much more.GGG is a great company and a model to follow, the game has the best Free To Play model i have ever seen, with constant 3 month updates, nothing you can buy will make you better in the game which is a very important thing, no content needs to be bought which is an even more important thing in a game.The only bad thing i find that is important is, the game is hard to run on shity PC's (my PC is 10 years old  XD) but they have improved that aspect a lot recently and the other thing is the Microtransaction prices, i think for example instead of 50 points for 5$ it should be 80-100, but if they made it that way they must have their reasons.With all that said, the game is awesome and definitely the best ARPG and i'm not seeing anyone doing it better."",1"
"2501,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Path of Exile is the best ARPG you will play in yearsIf you are a fan on D2 and feel dissapointed with D3, give this game a tryIf you haven't, give it a try, it is pretty slow at first, but then it becomes the best game you've ever playedAND IT IS FREE"",1"
"2502,Path of Exile,2017.0,""I'll make my review short and sweet.  This game belongs to my favorite genre... fantasy iso arpg.  I've played nearly all of them over the years.  Others may bring nostalgia and pleasant memories, but Path of Exile is just a love letter from the developer's to that specific genre.  Personally, I think it's the best game in the genre, and it's constantly being updated and improved.  The story is great as you discover the tragic history of Wraeclast, through encountering relics during your playthrough.  The storytelling is uniqe, and it is mostly done through voiceovers so there is very little interference in actual gameplay.   The skill tree is massive and may be intimidating at first, so try going into your web browser to the skill tree calculater and mapping out a build and saving it to your favorites, then referring to it when you level up.  You gain skills through gems, as well as ways to improve those skills by linking your gems together on your armor and weapons.  The controls are responsive and intuitive and your skills/abilities make you feel powerful.  PoE is free but not pay to win but you can buy some nice cosmetic items and loot boxes.  I got me some glowy eyes."",1"
2503,Path of Exile,2013.0,This game has the best free to play system.Everything related to the gameplay and lore is free and you can buy ONLY cosmetic items with real money.If you really miss Diablo II this is your game! It is very a complex rpg with endless replayability! One might say its better than Diablo III.,1
"2504,Path of Exile,2017.0,""Best free 2 play i've played so far. Everything is so fun and balanced. Devs are active and they love their game as much as we do. Lot's of cosmetic to buy, but when you love this game so much and considering it's f2p and they need to found the developping, it's worth to give a penny. You should try it out if you like Diablo 2. Everything feels so good about this game."",1"
"2505,Path of Exile,2014.0,""If you enjoyed Diablo 2, you will enjoy this. If you loved Diablo 2, you will love this. I think Diablo 3 is fun, but a little less difficult than this game. Path of Exile really puts you on the spot every time you go somewhere. You make a mistake on this hostile island full of murderous creatures and evil beings, and boom. You die. GGG's alternative to """"end-game"""" content is pretty interesting too, even though I haven't reached that point yet, and they encourage people to try new things with their ever-changing Seasonal Events, and Races. Rewards just for playing them, no pay-to-win, and plenty of friendly people in-game makes for pretty happy players.UPDATE TO REVIEW: I have since reached endgame content and by all that is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing holy this game is amazing.Far better with friends, too. Since most people like to do so, here's a Pros and Cons setup:Pros:+ Gameplay: Like I described above, the game feels ultimately rather similar to Diablo in how it is played, until you get into the real meat and potatoes of it, somewhere usually around level 30-35 or so.+ Community: The community is amazing. Sure, we'll mess with people and provide peanut gallery level commentary on everything (hell, one of my characters is named """"Cactus_Chucker"""" for god's sakes) but we also help out players who are legitimately just asking questions, or learning aspects of the game for the first time. Everyone started somewhere, and not all of us have ~800 hours.+ NOT PAY TO WIN: Grinding Gear Games has absolutely nothing functional that you can pay for aside from storage space. Considering that storage space does not affect your characters in any way, shape, or form in how they are played, how their damage is calculated, or anything, the game cannot be classified as pay to win. Just pay to look dope as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and have all the shiny things stashed away where they'll never see the light of day.+ Co-Op: You can play with friends! It is free! Invite your friends and show them the glory of PUNCHING THINGS SO HARD THEY EXPLODE! (Infernal Blow Facebreakers)+ Hardware Limitations: I run this game on an 8 year old HP laptop. Obviously that means that it isn't super hardware intensive. Makes it easier to play with friends who aren't as up to date on their tech.Cons:- Connection Required: Yeah, this is kind of annoying. Being online at all times makes this kind of a hassle if there are things happening like inclement weather, or other things like repairs on hardware in your area. Not a huge con, but still worth mentioning.- Desync: This one is mostly a """"new player"""" problem, and is easily fixed. By changing your connection settings in the Main Menu (note: CANNOT BE DONE WHILE IN GAME, MUST BE DONE BEFORE SELECTING A CHARACTER) under Input from """"Predictive"""" to """"Lockstep"""". Basically changes from """"game assumes where you will be, reacts from there"""" to """"client tells game where you are, game reacts from there"""". Saves many deaths."",1"
"2506,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Path of Exile is a hack and slash game with one of the most unique customization system. Active skills are not required by leveling up, but as items dropped by enemies and acquired from completing quests that need to be put into an equipment socket to work. Different classes also share the same passive skill tree which means you can build your character however you like it-sorcerer barbarian and melee wizard? sure why not? (corresponding classes in the game are actually not called barbarian and wizard but you know what I mean)These unique settings truly makes combatting and looting really fun. As a F2P title Path of Exile is simply huge with its solid gameplay, great graphics (comparable to D3) and unique system. Anyone interested in hack and slash or rpg in general should check it out."",1"
"2507,Path of Exile,2013.0,""A spiritual successor to Diablo 2, though achieving its own level of unprecedented uniqueness to the aRPG genre. By far the best aRPG experience I've had, endlessly unique in it's character building, and the staff of Grind Gear Games is by far the most committed I've seen to game ever."",1"
"2508,Path of Exile,2013.0,""Fantastically done aRPG. Don't let the fact that it's free disuade you from playing it. The love and attention to detail GGG has put into this game clearly shines through. If you ever loved a diablo or torchlight game, do yourself a favor and start playing PoE!+3 years after first review:The devs have continued to improve upon and expand this game since release. Roughly 4 challenge leagues occur a year with game play mechanics from these leagues sometimes making their way into core game (Essences are the latest mechanic to be rolled into core) make for a fairly interesting shelf life for this aRPG. They just recently released their revamp of end-game content and are in the process of changing the entire game engine to reflect current day technology. GGG's community managers are highly active on reddit and PoE forums, their customer service is one of the easiest and honestly nicest group of people you could ever deal with, and as a company GGG continually listens to their playerbase and is rather transparent. In regards to gameplay: the one """"downfall"""" of this game is that there is almost no hand-holding and most of the mechanics are left for you to discover instead of explained in game. In my experience, it wasn't until I hit roughly 30 hours of playtime that I broke into the second difficulty level. However, it is a game that is rewarding and through wiki and chat help, it is very possible to uncover the innards of the game."",1"
"2509,Path of Exile,2015.0,""'loot-based' at its core.... all this game is about is loot. Loot... Sweet... precious... looot!  Having ups and downs as it fares.  Ups being, i was not having this much fun identifying stull I loot since Ultima Online.  No matter what item you pick, it can be utter crap or godly priceless piece of equip.  Downs obviously is, RNG is our god.  With thousands of combinations of properties of items, you are on the wrong side of chance drops will be what you need.  Or what you can sell :).  Crafting is another notable area, here the currency, orbs, is what you use for crafting too.  With few exceptions, crafting is same RNG (maybe even less forgiving one than the loot drop RNG).  That means, not everybody has same purple stuff on him/her, not everyone wants same purple stuff, and everyone must think carefully, whether to use currency for crafing, or actual buying from other players.Last interesting area is build variability.  Not going into details, skill tree is HUGE (read in font 24, bold and red).  Your creativity will get some food for thought here... Just be aware: inefficient builds are no exception and quite punishing end game.   Considering my playtime, I guess the number alone gives 10/10 :)."",1"
"2510,Path of Exile,2015.0,""A very good hack n slash game (or diablo-like if you want to name it that way) thats F2P but not Pay to win in any way. It becomes a little grindy in endgame but besides that, PoE is a fun game that offers a lot of content for literally nothing.It might become boring if you are not into creating new characters to try out builds or find exploring some areas over and over again boring. Worth at least a playthrough9/10 in my book"",1"
"2511,Path of Exile,2013.0,""Hands down, one of the best ARPG titles I've ever had the pleasure to play.  And I didn't have to pay a dime.  Didn't stop me from doing so, as the cosmetics are awesome, and often times come down in price during big holidays and season based sales.The game itself features one of the more robust skill creation systems I have ever had the pleasure of playing with, and likely is no where near done making new ways to let players battle foes.  The gear is solid, and the grind isn't too bad up to what is considered the end game.  There is always a stronger fight waiting for you around the corner as well.The music, I HAVE to talk about the music.  Some of the best stuff out there right now, with boss fights being wonderful, and several areas having the grim, dark, and creepy music you would expect from a game such as this.  But even the more sacred tracks, such as the crypt, aka Church Dungeon, sees love, even though its a side area, and man, I could sit there for hours listening."",1"
"2512,Path of Exile,2015.0,""PLAY THIS .....Just play itIts a free game you really have nothing to lose,  if you are a fan of action RPG....well if your a fan you have probably already played this game but if you havnt then you need to try it out.  It has a much darker feel and more hardcore than something like torchlight but the company behind it is great they have constant updates and the regular new 3 month leages help to keep everything fresh.This is an easy game to recomend I think anyone that enjoys action rpg's will love it and since its free its not a hard sell."",1"
"2513,Path of Exile,2017.0,""Path Of Exile is one of the best games I have played in awhile. It has a short, yet well-designed learning curve. It is a great game for both competitive and casual gamers. Just... look at the hours that people have put into it. It really is a game worth playing."",1"
"2514,Path of Exile,2013.0,""Like Diablo 2? Like Titan quest? Want something more dark and adult version of Torchlight? Hate Diablo-buy-to-win-3? Then i've got good news for you buddy!This game HAS IT ALL, and ITS FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"",1"
"2515,Path of Exile,2013.0,""Path of Exile successfully captures the spirit of older action RPGs and updates it for an experience that's as visually appealing as it's fun. The combat itself doesn't differ much from other examples in the genre, but Path of Exile distinguishes itself with a unique ability system based on gems and a labyrinthine passive skill system that permits the creation of almost any type of character. Leaderboards, PvP options, and lootable challenge maps spice up the higher level content, and an unusual bartering system staves off inflation in its multiplayer aspects. Best of all, it's free almost to a fault, revealing a compelling alternative path for free-to-play projects to come."",1"

"2519,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Hands down the greatest ARPG of all time. And now that desync is gone thanks to the great work of Johnathan and GGG I can say that confidently. I've been playing for over 3 year, clocked over 3000 house, and spent $200 on this glorious game and there's no stop in sight. There's quite a learning curve, but players are generally helpful and plenty of great guides online. Do yourself a favor and at least try it, it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING FREE. Don't blame me though when you forget to eat becuase you've been playing for 8 hours straight."",1"
"2520,Path of Exile,2015.0,""After 2,000 hours of playing this game, I still can't get enough. GGG has to be one of the best, if not the best game developers out there. They've done such a great job with this game. If you like grinding games for better loot, this is for you. If you're new to this genre, you're gonna have to take some time to fully understand the concepts of the game. It's definitely a lot to take in as a new player, but once you've figured it out it becomes so addicting. There's new leagaues implemeneted every 3-4 months, which allows for fresh economies/new aspects to the game. It's my favorite part. The devs are constantly updating/rebalancing the passive tree (which is freaking amazing), so you shouldn't get to in love with any given play style/skill/build. If you're new, definitely follow some of the big streamers so you can stay up to date on decent builds to use for new leagues. There's tons more I can say, but I'll leave it here. Download poe, and have fun grinding!"",1"
"2521,Path of Exile,2018.0,""This game is fun. If you like action RPGs, play this. If you liked Diablo 2, play this. If you like thinking about character progression and tactics, play this. If you like using your mouse wheel to change camera angle and zoom in from a bird's eye view to a 3rd person view of your character, then we can be friends! The gem system and """"sphere grid"""" was a nice change from standard RPGs and I wish more was done with the bartering system (make it more like Fallout 1 & 2 where you can barter item for item and not just for scroll scraps).This is not a pay to win game but if you want to set up a guild expect to drop $10 - $20 dollars. The only issue I experienced with this game was not from the game itself but from how I accessed it. Using Steam the game was laggy/choppy, using the external client from their website game play was smooth. Still this game is a blast and even more fun with friends. Cannot recommend this enough and also it is FREE.You can watch our First Impressions of Path of Exile here â–º https://youtu.be/8B9H-k_H7Zg "",1"
"2522,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Very exciting, addictive, fun, challenging RPG. The skill gems system is great, the passive skill system is just freaking awesome. The story is just epic and the opportunity to kill the one that exiled you makes it even better. Massive monster crowds, items with mad stats, endless combinations of skills, gear and passives. The fact that this game is absolutely not pay-to-win is something you will rarely see. The only things that cost real money are cosmetic items that don't affect your leveling, damage etc. It's a must try altough some people might find it too hard."",1"

"2526,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Path of Exile is the best game of it's type in my opinion. It's expansions add very enjoyable twists to the gameplay and the different gamemodes are all fun in different ways. This game gives limitless options in terms of builds and it makes the replayability factor insanely high. I do recommend playing this game through it's own client though, if you already play this through steam you don't have a need to switch but getting your account set up through the website is easier by playing it through the client you download from the website."",1"
"2527,Path of Exile,2013.0,""Highly recommended. Best Diablo-style ARPG out there right now and you can play it as much as you want free. I threw some cash at it during a sale on stash tabs, but all other microtransactions are cosmetic.Recommend starting when a new season is about to begin. Start with fresh trading economy, go until your character hits a wall or you get tired of the grind. The leveling up of a new character is my favorite part, so don't sweat having or wanting to reroll. It's normal.And that skill tree! Oh man, so good."",1"
"2528,Path of Exile,2018.0,""As of this writing I am downloanding Path of Exile for about the half-dozenth time. I habitually revisit this game after uninstalling it on account of its almost endless character customization possibilities and nearly infinite replay value. It is sufficiently challenging despite the absence of preset difficulty levels.  The array of available loot is overwhelming.  I like the aesthetics and graphical style, voice acting, isometric design and mechanics. In my view it is one of the most finely crafted and intensely creative free games ever developed, and it continues to evolve: every endgame battle is simply a gateway to the next expansion."",1"
"2529,Path of Exile,2016.0,""This is what d3 should've been. The best arpg out.. and it's free?! I'd say my 1k hours in this game and all the experiences with it are well worth it. If you are not familiar with arpgs, I will have to say this game appears very confusing with the sheer amount of content the game has to offer. However, this curse can also be a blessing because the amount of customization and diversity is absurd.Not only is there a ton of customization the game has to offer, but the amount of content that GGG produces is enough to keep you entertained like no other game. Path of exile comes out with a minor expansion every 3 months and along side the expansion, new leagues are introduced where you can start a new. The new leagues have a theme to them and introduce new challenging content that players must overcome. Every 6 months, path of exile comes out with a huge expansion.A concern for free to play games is that they are pay to win. Poe is FREE TO PLAY. You cannot purchase in-game currency with money and you cannot have advantages other other players simply because you invested more money in the game. I will admit the 4 stash tabs you are given are not near enough to sustain a storage system in the game, however you can spend $16 to triple your stash tabs, and hey, this game is kickass so why not support it so GGG can develop more content. This game is play to win, not pay. Please GGG, don't stop the development of this marvelous game, it's everything an arpg wants to be. THANK YOU"",1"
"2530,Path of Exile,2018.0,""I heard about the game, didn't realize it was free and was looking for something to play. I saw this pop up and saw it was free, remembering hearing pretty good things about it I decided to just play. I decided I was going to just try to play mindlessly and go with a necromancer since that would let me play at my own pace and get to know the system when I felt like it since when you have your own small army doing all the work you can take your time and do whatever. I have come to thoroughly enjoy the game and would say anyone starting out should try the same because you can still use magic if you want or not and you can use other weapons or not. I found that being a necromancer, of the 3 characters I have made thus far, is the least punishing because you don't have as much need for strong gear or proper skill order, it let's you ease into the game and try a lot of different things without having as much backlash for making what would be a mistake for another character type.

"2540,Path of Exile,2016.0,""In my opinion it's the best Action RPG that's on the market right now. It has a grim setting, and a story that's mostly told through environmental bits of lore, but most importantly it has a depth of gameplay that no other ARPG comes even close to. It's the best spiritual successor to Diablo II to date. The first time you open the passive skill tree you are likely to be overwhelmed. There is a web with hundreds of choices. Don't worry, eventually it will make sense. You can obtain respect points via quests and item drops, so you can not mess anything up permanently anyway.Your active skills are acquired by putting skill gems into sockets on your gear. The gems have one of three colours (red/blue/green), that match with the colour of the sockets on your gear. Sockets can be linked, allowing you to attach support gems to your active skill gems. This can do things such as splitting your Burning Arrow into 4 projectiles, or turning your Glacial Hammer attack into an AoE attack that hurts monsters all around you. Later in the game, you can even find support gems that can trigger active skill gems automatically once you take enough damage, or get stunned.Every three months the devs launch a major patch with a new challenge league, which adds new skills, new game mechanics and challenges which offers new loot rewards and cosmetics.The free to play model is truly free to play. You can play all the content in the game without paying a dime. The only way the game developers make money is by offering microtransactions in their store, for cosmetic upgrades that don't affect gameplay. Want your mismatched set of gear to have a unified look? Maybe shop for a set of cosmetic armor looks. Want your fireball to look like a dragon, there is a microtransaction for that! Want a lizard with a bell on it's back to follow you around like a puppy? There's a microtransaction for that!I have put hundreds of hours into the game (using their native client because I started playing before the game was on Steam) and found buying the microtransactions to be a good way to support the developers so they can continue to add more (and more and more and more) content to the game, while also making my characters look awesome via the cosmetic microtransactions.There are a few non-cosmetic microtransactions available, to upgrade your account with more character slots (I believe the default is 12, so that is enough to create at least one character of each of the 7 classes) and to get more shared stash tabs to hoard all the items you find and share them between your characters. The default you get is 4, which people are starting to argue was enough when the game launched in 2013, but is a little cramped for all the content we have now in 2016. There are also """"premium"""" stash tabs that allow you to rename the stash tabs and give their labels colours.The game is free, so why are you reading this review instead of playing the game?"",1"

Any one of the characters that you can choose from has their own unique and interesting ways in which you can choose to play.

I would say that my favorite at the moment is a combination of 'Wildstrike', 'Greater Multiple Projectiles', 'Volley Support', and 'Elemental Damage with Attacks Support' with the Unique weapon that I have that believe has the '80% chance to Cause Bleeding' buff (I don't remember what weapon it is honestly. I made a new build around the linked sockets.). I also use the 'Extra Blood' buff that I purchased from the store when I also bought the """"Money Organizer' tab...which I also highly recommend before you start losing hair over the stress you'll go through trying to figure out how to best organize your stuff.

"2545,Path of Exile,2017.0,""As a new player that felt quite overwhelmed at first with many elements of the game, I can most definitely say that this is one of the better free to play games that you can find and arguably one of the best of its genre. RPG games can be very repetitive but Path of Exile finds a way to make the game fun and fresh with its complex, varied and demanding skill systems, classes, items and bosses. Devs listen to the players and the community is great - little to no toxicity and you find helpful people to party with everywhere."",1"
"2546,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Path of Exile is the most faithful successor to Diablo 2 that you'll find, including Diablo 3. While D3 took the approach of World of Warcraft's evolution, focusing on becoming more streamlined and more accessible than its predecessor, Path of Exile leans in the opposite direction. It's difficult, it's technical, and it's awesome. Truly, if feels as if everything that Diablo 3 did wrong, Path of Exile does right.The one area that PoE really diverges from the classic Diablo formula is in the active skill system. Active skills are granted by gem items. Skill gems gain experience and level up independantly of your character, and by combining active skill gems with """"support gems"""" in equipment with appropriately-linked sockets, the combinations are vast.And that's what's really great about this game. The enormous scope of build variety and character customization. PoE's passive skill tree has hundreds and hundreds of nodes, and over the course of your character's career you'll have over 100 passive skill points to allocate in any direction and combination you see fit. Want to build a huge, muscle-bound Marauder that casts spells and holds wands? Want to create a Witch or Ranger that uses a Cyclone melee attack with a two-handed axe? Go for it. If you enjoy theorycrafting, you're bound to love this game.It's the most technical hack-and-slash ARPG out there, and likely the most unforgiving. The path to 100 is a long, long road, and once you're on the second and third difficulties you'll start losing experience with each death. It might get frustrating, but this is not a bad thing. The challenge and longevity this game presents is a breath of fresh air.And, somehow, the game is entirely free. There is -zero- """"pay to win"""" here. You can buy extra stash tabs (though it's not at all necessary, they start you with four for free), but all the rest of the offered microtransactions are for purely cosmetic items. There is no way to get any sort of in-game boost or mechanical advantage by spending money.As a huge fan of the genre, PoE really feels like the most compelling offering as of right now."",1"

"2551,Path of Exile,2017.0,""This is the reigning king of the hack-and-slash action RPG (aka Diablo clone). It is the best one ever made so far, and is the spiritual successor to Diablo 2. For fans of D2, Path of Exile is in the running for game of the decade.That's not an exaggeration. Even when the game came out in 2013, when it had zero polish and only three acts, players immediately recognized it as a rival to D3 because of its incomparably deep game systems. PoE revolutionizes many genre staples including the skill tree, the entire currency system, how potions work, and much more. Since then, GGG (the devs) added so many features that I cannot even name them all off the top of my head. They added an expanded class system, the ability to make a personal hideout, and overhauled the endgame. Whenever I put the game down for a few months, there was new content when I came back. Every single nitpick and quality-of-life complaint I ever had about the game has been fixed.

"2562,Path of Exile,2014.0,""what is path of exile?  its all the awesomeness you loved from diablo2, mixed with the materia system from final fantasy7, and then a sphere grid bigger than final fantasy 10.  in short dont play this game if you dont want to be at your pc for a long time."",1"
"2563,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Aparently the game was made by the same team that made Diablo2 (which isnt the one that made Diablo3). It really is D2's sucessor, the gameplay is pretty similar with the single big diference being the character customization. You can make literally anything you want, from a necromancer templar to a dual wielder dealing elemental damage. Since i was such a big fan of D2 back in the day, i had to try this game. If you dont want to read all of it, skip to the end.You have several classes to play, the one you pick basically sets where you start on the passive skill tree. At the end of chapter 3, you unlock the Scion class, which is the most versatile and can easy become whatever you want.When you level up you get points you can use on the passive skill tree to make your character stronger. The passive skill tree is truly gigantic, hence the huge variety of choices when building your char.You also get gems, that you slot into your  items. Each gem has a skill, and the gems level up as you do. You can connect gems for extra effects, as there are many """"support"""" gems, that dont do anything for themselves but enhance other gems, with damage, skill duration, blinding enemies, extra effects like making melee single target skills splash for targets around, etc. There are 3 types of gems and gem slots, red, green, and blue, red being typically the """"brute"""" ones and therefore require strength, the greens require dexterity, and the blues inteligence.This gem system is very versatile, just like the passive skill tree.The game currently has 4 chapters. While chapter 1 and 2 are kinda easy, chapter 3 gets harder, and final boss on chapter 4 is pretty damn hard.So lets sum it up:Pro's:-Easy to play.-Highly character customization. Want to shoot a cone of fireballs as wide as the screen, that also deal lighting and cold damage?  Want to have an army of zombies, spirits and totems? Miss your whirlwhind D2 barbarian and want it back, but now dealing elemental damage? Yes please madam.-Free to play.-Areas change, so each time you replay each area the map is different.Cons:-Visual perks like wings and stuff is paid, like guild chest, or extra chest tabs(but you start with 4 so that is hardly an issue).-Takes a while to learn and master the gem system, but once you get rolling you can make truly amazing things.-Gets kinda boring after a while. So just start another class lol."",1"
2564,Path of Exile,2018.0,Yes. What Diablo 4 could be if Blizzard got their act together. Basically plays like Diablo 2 with a modern day MTX system for cosmetic stuff. The layout is similiar to Guild Wars 1 in that you have MMO-style gathering hubs with instanced areas just for you and your group.,1
"2565,Path of Exile,2018.0,""New Zealand's biggest gem. Grinding Gear Games (GGG) are an amazing consistent company worthy of all the success they've attained. POE is truly a wonderful game you can sink plenty of hours into at any given time, I've always came back and easily gotten back into it with ease. A great ARPG game that holds a high standard."",1"
"2566,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Let me start of with the most important point: Path of Exile is the absolute best implementation of F2P I've experienced. I am not hesitant to try free-to-play games out, but I am very wary of pay-to-win orâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥game design caused by a game being F2P. Not once have I felt like any pay-cash-for-me items were being pushed in my face. I'm currently playing through the third and final difficulty, and the game being F2P hasn't gotten in the way of it a single time. While the game is not without its flaws, it is silly to avoid it trying since the financial barrier to entry is $0.With dungeon crawlers there are a few core components that come to mind, that seem to make or break a given game. 1) Replayability 2) Mechanics 3) Skill trees 4) Item dropping/randomization. I will try to briefly talk about each of these issues.In terms of replayability, Path of Exile is fantastic. I got bored of Titan Quest, Torchlight, and Diablo 3 much faster than I have in PoE. I actually hated Titan Quest by the time I finished it, I was just determined to beat it. Diablo 3 I quit during the final difficulty because they were still figuring out how to make the game suck less. Torchlight I just got disinterested in very quickly, although I plan to revisit it in the future.The mechanics are probably the biggest selling point of the game in my opinion. Rarely does casting skills in a game make you feel like as much of a badass as it does in Path of Exile. The punch you get from using some of the skills is quite rewarding. While the gameplay is hampered a bit by lag now and then, by and large the game is very fast paced, and quite challenging at times.The skill trees, gems, and leveling system really are a fantastic piece of game design. I won't try to explain how it works because it is worth exploring and learning yourself. While it isn't without its flaws, I really do love the adaptability the skill trees give you. My second character might not turn out as absolutely awesome as my first did, I feel like I kind of nailed it with my first build. Also, it's worth mentioning the currency system is downright clever.The item dropping and randomization is probably the weak point of the entire game imo. While it isn't completely terrible, I can almost completely ignore loot that drops at this point in the game (~Lvl 55). Most things have such a low chance of comparing to what I already have, that it isn't worth looking. I still do, but it is usually futile. The need to get items with both good stats, AND appropriate gem sockets, is really the core problem. It is hard to hold this weakness against it, as this is something almost every dungeon crawler that exists fails at, especially Diablo 3.The fact that this game is online-only hampers it in the same way it did for Diablo 3. There are definitely lag/sync issues that come up now and then. The ability to play in LAN mode, especially for something like hardcore mode (which I will never ever attempt), is almost essential. This is only a slight gripe, as I haven't even paid a cent for the game yet. I do plan on dumping some money into it at some point, primarily just to support the game/devs.Overall, if you like dungeon crawlers, or even just trying solid free-to-play games, this is one is definitely worth checking out."",1"
"2567,Path of Exile,2017.0,""Forced to change this to 'Thumbs Down.'  Just too many problems.-- First, the game now lags and stutters, and they refuse to acknowledge, much less fix it.  No, it's not my ISP, no other game I own does this, and regardless, countless other players have the same problem-- Also the game is worse than ever for having a bunch of boss fights that are just a bunch of 1-hit kills, while simultaneously spamming the screen with NPC trash and visual clutter.-- on the whole, the """"difficulty"""" is increased by the cheapest, cheeziest, low-brow methods possible in a video game"
"2568,Path of Exile,2015.0,""This game is one of the worst ARPGs out here.Non challenging and easy gameplay? Check.Massive and unreasonable difficulty spikes? Check.Being one shotted regardless of your build sometimes by single attacks or by literally aoes who take up entire maps? Check.Uninspired and meaningless quests? Check.Bland environments? Check.Outdated and primitive game systems? Check.As you can see this game has a lot of problems. From meaningless and useless loot which is so common that it will act as a hazzard in actual combat to never receiving anything good. In 30 hours of my gameplay as a Witch, I had received like 10 unique items at least and non were useful for me. Maps were the worst. They are like mazes filled with unchallenging enemies those only purpose is to delay you. System existing in this game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrible. Skills coming from items means that you have sea of gems to sort through and to collect even to build hero which you would like. Without literally getting to know every ability in a game, you cannot start your build in a first place. AI could be done better by university's students. Mobs can only attack in straight lines, they lock on the first target which often ends up in a fragile heroes being one shotted. If you play as necromancer, you are in a whole of pain when boss will lock up on you and you will be forced to dodge and run and your spectres and  zombies will run with you. Only skeletons were smart enough to fight reliably enemies. I also got corrupted skeleton summon and the whole game became """"if I can summon my army at the right time"""" I win kind of a game. Who could had guessed that summoning literally 40+ skeletons at the time would insta shot some bosses when combined with buffs and sacrifices. Then there are other bosses where you cannot raise corpses and their massive aoe will melt through your summons. Fights are not at all playtested and there isn't any class balance. Some classes are plainly unplayable.Game loves to permamently debuff you, no joke. Your reward for finishing the campaign is that you will be denied picking boss loot as you are instantly teleported out and your stats are forever reduced for your achievements. You are not given decent resist gear and are literally drown in special abilities who can instan shot you. The worst thing is that you take bonus damage from those abilities as negative values are simply immense and it requires overpowered end game gear to even be competitive. Veterans had long forgotten at how terrible this game is with their twink speed leveling.As for story, it is the worst one I had ever encountered. Developers think that simply creating a lot of made up stuff makes them good story tellers. So we no have Japanese level nonsense where main characters are names as: Piety, Sin, Innocence. Where empires are names as: Eternal Empire. This utter nonsense and disregard for the lore makes everything pointless. For example in chapter 2 I literraly on accident had stolen the light of a day. Literally. Then I fought an easy boss and brought back the light...The very next quest was to find lost lover of some worthless chick. Questing and story telling is nonsensical as that. At one hand you are murdering Gods, at other you are doing lowly errands for random fools. Characters are even worse, outside of their tendency to spout walls of meaningless text at you, some of them are so painfully generic and gamey. For example, there is a NPC who is all about the maps. So her voiced dialogue literally is like this: """"Keep your maps safe"""". """"Take care of your maps"""". Really, how I'm to believe it is a real world with its own story when every person in it is so damn artificial? Things just happen. Your enemies become your friends, because literally they decide they are now good guys. Bad guys impede and fight you just because. I never seen any other game where they would put so much effort into a story and it would emerge so painfully bad. Like every cliche and most horrible writting practices kind of bad. For being this bad you need a talent which is equally rare as being just better writer than anyone else.As for items, you will never get  any. They mostly look horrible and they never drop anything good. My core set was found at act 2 which I never really replaced since. You will look terrible, your will be bombarded with loot, but never ever you are going to get anything useful. Small inventory space, meaningless RNG grinding, massive time wastes. It is MMORPG for ARPG fans who enjoy mindlessly wasting their time and grinding nonsense, putting on with unintuitive and obscure character building systems and want to pretend being veterans and better than others just by sheer virtue of time sink and getting their heads around of poorly made and highly unintuitive systems."",0"
2569,Path of Exile,2018.0,Probably one of the best and worst aRPGs that I have played.  It is great in the aspect that it allows a lot of customization of your character's build and in-turn enables a lot of different playstyles.  The game fails in the aspect that it the playstyle you choose - you are effectively stuck with.  There is little tactical about the combat in this game outside of spamming what your build is good at and then hoping for the best.,1

"2571,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Path of Exile is a great game, i have been playing off and on since beta and its done nothing but improve since its beta, from awakening from a wreckage, to the end of your journey through Wraeclast, (i have not reached it yet i got to act 3, my witch is not as fun as she used to be so im starting a new character) the game is non stop fun.Pros: Huge skill tree, build your character however you want.Plenty of characters to choose from.Very interesting story in my opinion, the team is constantly updating the game, in fact the Forsaken Masters was just released.The game is very much alive.Friendly community.Great looking game.Its free.Cons:NoneRating: 10/10"",1"
2572,Path of Exile,2013.0,Well it was fun for 90 hours but then it dawned upon me. To truly master the game you have to pick a skill and make a perfect path for it and perfect gear and both of those take forever and a day,1
"2573,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Think of the elements that made Diablo II great, meddle it with Torchlight and add some new stuff: the result is Path of Exile, a game that is far too good to be a free to play game. You don't even need to play anything to become superior to the other players: the microtransactions are moslty cosmetics. There are paid games out there that don't have 10% of PoE's quality. Everything in this game is perfect"
"2574,Path of Exile,2016.0,""So far my experience with Path Of ExileFirst of all I am going to say that i love to play games by my self and this games be compleated by your self!When i started to play this game i was like """"What is this"""" """" what is that"""" """"what does it do?!"""" But the more you play this the more you will understand how everything works!But if you plan to play with your friend, this would mean that monsters HP grows making it harder and more challenging to do with your friends, but also much more fun!Lastly the only disadvantage that i have for this game is the map, the map dosent seem that big, but because i completed all """"ACT's"""" then i had to start over in """"Corrupt"""" world. Corrupt is the same map you play on the normal difficulty, but corrupt is much more harder than normal, and the loot is much more better than in normal world."",1"
"2575,Path of Exile,2013.0,""Not only is this the finest free to play game ever made, it is also one of the best Action RPGs of all time. Path of Exile easily stands alongside the greats of the genre and surpasses Diablo III in nearly all ways. There is really no reason why anyone should not give this game a try."",1"
"2576,Path of Exile,2016.0,""In my honest opinion, Path of Exile is the true spiritual successor to Diablo 2 | Lord of Destruction.When I originally found PoE in closed beta, I was immediately taken by the team at Grinding Gear Games dedication to their project. I could feel the passion seething from them as I watched videos featuring the Devs expressing their plans for the game and what they aimed to accomplish. As a seasoned PC Gamer who has spent thousands of hours enjoying the Diablo Franchise, as brought to us by Condor, AKA Blizzard North"
"2577,Path of Exile,2015.0,""One of the greatest concepts ever. The highly customizable builds makes this game sometimes a bit too much enjoyable actually, beside the fact the desync is a thing since release. Desync is really a thing you need to admit to at this game and if you can't you'll end up ragequitting anyways. Had the most fun I've ever had in a game with a build (Facebreaker Cyclone) which actually 'caused desync quite a bit and it didn't irritated me at all to be honest. The gem system is really worked out well and the replay value of endgame is amazingly high. Don't expect to see other mobs or other maps a lot, but expect to see dangerous and deadly combinations of these two a lot if you wan't to risk it! You need to make this game enjoyable yourself by asking help of others as well, the game is kind of hard to get into but once you're in it's hard to get out. This game is one of the definitions of addiction and dedication but it's totally worth it. I would highly recommend to start the game in a heroic league, the best way to learn is failing in this game!"",1"
"2578,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Lag die likeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥simulator .This may be the worst server I ever played.I thought that DS II server is the worst server in this world but this game is beyond that.Frankly it's just a poor programming.It's just a bug that move you to the center of mobs and you still don't even know that you were tranformed to that point.When you knew it,you have already dead.Even for new protocol name Lock step did not help you so much ,yeah you won't die because of lag and desyncronization but you would die because of slow respond scene.it has become delay instead of lag.Let's come up with the game mechanic.First the over size 1500+ passive skill may seems to be so impressive but actualy the mass passive skill tree did not do a damn thing it's just add up more and more attributes to your stats but they affect the playstyle very few.The most important thing is legacy gear which is really help you so much.You are really need to equip with legendary gear and all of things that you have done before is useless.The skill support gem building system is very impressive for me but in the end there is no need at all when you got all legacy gear.You just rush in and spam one skill with massive damage and you won't die so easily except lag.What's the point of great system which you don't need to use it anymore when your character has become OP.I do really want to support this game but I can not afford it with this lag."",0"
"2579,Path of Exile,2014.0,""The best thing you can say about this game is that its free and when I say free its 100% free in no way will not spending hold you back at all.That being said why play a free game if its no fun? The game as most of its type is grindy but thats fine if the story is good or the dungeons varied. In Path Of Exile the story as far as I got was well not a story rather just a few npcs who would make a funeral more depressing and you keep finding yourself skipping the text before you fall asleep.The Dungeons are no better, maybe the lead dungeon designer got bored after making three types (underground, forest, coast) and thought no-one would notice.The lvling up system is quite interesting using a final fantasy type spider system allowing millions of different combinations which would allow for hundreds of styles of play but in reality only a few will work for every character, so caution is required as making a mistake on your leveling pathway could mean you end up with a dud many hours later.Expect for that it really is just a standard ARPG with poor graphics that even free is not recommand over Van Helsing or Torchlight."",0"
"2580,Path of Exile,2018.0,""I really love a lot about this game, yet I find myself not returning to it. I canno't run through the campaign even one more time. Im burned out of the same tedious campain over and over. We need an option, say after one character completes the campaign the new characters also get it. I buy packs to support the company and love the business model, but can't play anymore. My friends and I look forward to end game, then are burnt out by the time we get there. The leveling is not bad, the quests are super tedious. Please help me return to this wonderful game."",0"
"2581,Path of Exile,2018.0,""I have over 400 hours into this game, and while I enjoy it... I hate it at the same time. Allow me to explain:The ARPG genre is about getting lots of loot, killing lots of bad guys and feeling like your character is progressing into a powerhouse. Path of Exile is the top of the line ARPG for customization... But it's a trick.You see, as you progress in the game you don't become stronger, but rather it seems weaker. Because as you progress the game takes your defenses away from you, forcing you to stack more and more, which results in the feeling that you're fighting the developers. The game has Fire, Lightning and Cold elemental resistances, all of which have a default cap of 75% (this cap can be raised by specific pieces of gear, and very few skill tree nodes.)Now, as you progress half-way through the story, you lose 30% resists - Yes, if you have no armor on at this point, you are -30% to all of your resistances, meaning you take 30% MORE elemental damage. As you beat the campaign and begin the real endgame, you lost another 30%. Elemental Resists in this game are immensely important, and rare to find on gear - Especially Unique (Legendary) items. So to even stand a chance of not being instantly killed against the weakest of end-game enemies (not bosses, I'm talking the stuff you should at this point be 1-shotting) you need a total of 135% resists to Fire, Cold and Lightning on your gear. That isn't to fight the final boss, that's to fight the mobs that you want to farm to get the gear to fight the final content... Thus fighting the developers.The game has a massive skill tree, which looks like insane customization, but there really isn't. If you try to take a creative path and build a unique character, you MUST follow certain paths to get the defenses you need (in the form of increased Life or Energy Shield (pseudo Life)) or you will die instantly in the end-game content. This immense defensive need greatly hinders the customization the skill tree would add.I love the game's potential, but at this point, fighting the devs to even survive is mundane and quite frankily, very frustrating. If you aren't willing to dump immense amounts of time, and stress into this game, don't bother playing past the first few acts, it becomes a job as opposed to a game. I've tried to enjoy this game because I love ARPGs, but the defensive battle is simply not fun."",0"
"2582,Path of Exile,2017.0,""I've absolutely been amazed at the progress this game has made since it was released. At that time I felt it was the Diablo 3 that should have been released by Blizzard. It has superb gameplay, decent graphics and was every bit as good as top tier action RPGs.Since that time, my love for the game has not waned. With every update, they add more content, new items and quests, NPCs, etc. For a free game, it is simply the best. One of the best aspects of the game is- NO PAY TO WIN!! Grinding Gear promised this would never be play to win, and it still is not four years later, yet the game continues to expand. All you can buy through microtransactions are cosmetics, pets that don't help you fight in any way, and supporter packs. I don't mind buying little enhancements to my character's looks just to support devs who have actually stuck by what they said, and continue to give fans a reason to keep coming back to play the game. Keeps  me working for that dank loot! The story line isn't bad either, with great voice acting. If you like Diablo, you'll also appreciate and enjoy POE. It's one of the best out there, and for a free to play game, you just can't ask for any more than that.Keep it up GG, you are making a legacy here that will be around for a long time I feel."",1"
"2583,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Overview: Path of ExileThis game is technically an MMO, but you will seldom encounter other players unless you choose to invite them to a squad with you. If it weren't for global chat, you may or may not realize that anyone else even owns the game while you're not in a major city. The gameplay is very dungeon-crawler(esque) with a good deal of lootfest and skill tree elements. Storyline: lol didn't read it, nobody has time for that (doubting anyone has time to read reviews either, but these devs deserve the time it took to give the review). Difficulty: initially there is only a normal difficulty, but a character can access a higher difficulty (cruel, the merciless) after beating the quest line on their current difficulty. Additionally, you can create normal or hardcore characters, the difference being that hardcore characters recieve better loot, but on death, they convert to standard characters, and all their gear becomes standard gear (and cannot be traded back to a hardcore character).Pros: 1) Microtransactions aren't needed for late game.. in fact, there is nothing you can buy with money that results in an in-game advantage beyond a larger storage chest. 2) Character Balance and Variety. There are nearly infinite amounts of viable character builds and skills, not just 2-3 """"use these or always lose"""" web builds for """"op classes"""" - from what I've seen, the classes are surprisingly well balanced.3) Community. There are usually a lot of people chatting in global, and many people are willing to provide help either in-game or just give advice on items if you're inclined to ask. As always on the internet, there's a healthy amount of salt, and a few trolls, but such is the price we pay for gaming with other people.4) Audio. The ambient sounds and the soundtracks for the game are both excellent, and the character attack sound effects manage to avoid being irritating although you end up hearing the same ones hundreds of times in the course of an hour.5) Details. The devs clearly spent enough time in other games to understand what's annoying in an mmo, and they did their best to remove those elements. Most notably, potions don't clutter your inventory - instead, you can carry up to 5 potions, which refill as you slay enemies. The game doesn't have currency, instead players trade with chaos/fusing orbs, materials which can actually be used to upgrade items, rather than exclusively be used for buying and selling.Cons:1) Repetition. Although the creatures and attacks change, but essentially every level plays out the same. It's quite grind-heavy in that even if you progress through new areas as soon as you finish the quests, the actual gameplay remains redundant.2) Actually.. being bored by the redundancy of combat is my only complaint. Although boredom is a death sentence in most games, I think I'll still keep playing this one... and even if you do quit if you become bored, there's easily 20 hours of early-game content which you'll probably complete before reaching that point."",1"

Incredibly enjoyable to play with your best friends. There is infinite replayability. The levels randomly regenerate when you revisit them and the graphics are incredibly detailed. So much enjoyment was felt whilst playing this game.Diablo III done right.... and did I mention that it's free?10/10 With the launch of this game just emerging on steam, the sky is the limit with how much potential this game has.Imagine Diablo 2 + Materia system from FFVII + Skill tree from Witcher 2 (20x bigger).Now add Ironman difficulty and no gold.

"2587,Path of Exile,2017.0,""The game is very hardcore. It's short description is """"Everything can one-shot you"""".

Welcome to the world of AFK / DO-NOT-DISTURB MODE / FAKE-OFFER / R3TARDED-TRADER / IGNORE trading system"""".Pros:- wide variety of builds (any class can use any skill)"
"2588,Path of Exile,2016.0,""This is my absolute favorite ARPG to play. I loved Diablo 2. This game is a much more complex, hard, rewarding, exciting and unique Diablo 2 / Titan Quest ARPG. The RNG is real, the challanges are fun. The content doesn't get dull. Progression is limitless. Knowledge is never ending. Mechanics are so well done. The skills in this game are interesting. The ability to MAKE ANY BUILD you want is just simply the greatest. My cons: Poor optimization, an SSD and good processor/video card/memory is required to play at a stable FPS.The highest of tier content, maps, at certain point become very hard to aquire and sustain without a mapping group. It's doable but likely expensive for solo players. Not so much of a big deal if you really want to work towrds it.There is still slight desynch in this game, but with the new Lockstep, the rubberbanding does not happen for the most part. The lag is very small when it does happen, it isn't  gamebreaking unless you have a bad PC.Overall, if you've never played an APRG like this before, it make come off as too hard. The hardest / least fun part of this game is first starting out and realizing you don't know what you're doing, and content is becoming harder and you have no idea what skills to use, what passives to take, what armor and weapons to use. What items to pick up to sell, what items are bad, what items are extremely rare. All of this stuff simply takes TIME to understand. I've played this game since closed beta, on and off. I learn somethng new all the time and people are still finding things out.This game is good for casuals for the leagues that are never wiped. This game is good for semi-compeitive people who like to have fresh starts / new economy with new leagues. This game is SUPER competitive if you want to reach the top of the ladder or if you want to become a good racer. Racing is awhole nother part of the game that adds an interesting break from the typical game play.The content updates are constant, the gaming company, Grinding Gear Games are simply the best of the best. On par with Valve and sorta kinda Blizzard-8-years-ago. There are bugs, there are issues, there is stuff that can be annoying or simply out dated (tetris inventory managment for example) but they are few and far and don't axe the game.If you want to pick up this game and just mindlessly play-- you can. But you will reach a point in the game where you'll aboslutely need to gear properly and link your skill gems and get good flasks. This is always the biggest issue I see with new players. This is a game that rewards you for doing research, watching streams and videos and simply trail and error.Don't expect this to play like an arcade game, similar to Diablo 3. It isn't noob friendly, but it isn't anti-noob. Make friends in this game, add people if you liked grouping with them, most people are friendly and are always welcoming to newplayers to help out.If you're my friend, hit me up, I will do everything I can to make you realize this game. It's fun, I love it. Oh and it's 100% free to play. There is no pay to win. Extra stash tabs don't make you rich, knowing how to use them does. That said, they do give a big benefit to people who buy the, but there isn't a single person who cannot do what 100 stash player can compared to a f2p 4 stash tab. But it does make life easier."",1"

"2591,Path of Exile,2016.0,""TL"
"2592,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Path of Legends is another great indie game to add to EA's records of acheivement. You start of with a selection from various characters, these include lulu the dark witch, taric the holy one, and lastly master yi the forgoten avanger. I myself played as yi and the story is great although it does have a few plot holes here and there. In any case you find yourself on a beach after the summer cruise ship you were on got assaulted by the deadswamp pirates. Yi was engaged to be married and had all of his family onboard the cruise at the time. unfortunately the pirates were ruthless and slayed every man woman and child. Yi tried to resist but was overpowerd by a surge of lightening on the stormy night that accompanied the deadswamp pirate assault. Amongst the wreckage of the ship he eventually floated to the island in which you start the game. Theres nothing much to it at first, you are lying face planted in the dirt. You learn to survive as you craft with various tools. Immersion breaks here because you cut down trees with your bare hands, but i suppose this could be attributed to Yi being a badass and so it can be justified.Eventually you can build yourself a nice hut, and after you do some rather grindy farming you can establish a good forward outpost. You get promted mid game to purchase station cash from the soney online entertainment website to speed things up, but i never was a fan of DLC so i dont support EA's decision to monetise indie games like this. After you build the foward outpost you get to fight the first boss, a giant enemy crab which is symbolic of Yi's personal struggles from his japanese heritage. the crab is symbolic of real historical battles in ancient china and for the little historian in all of us i found this quite compelling as a plot twist. beating the crab allows you to advance to the next section, where you meet rico from just cause 2.    Rico gives you the grappleing hook as he too was on the cruise ship but took a bullet to the hip and just cant do what he did in the previous game. Fortunately for us, Yi gets to swing around the area pretty quickly. the hook allows you to make it to the central island, where the plot thickens once Yi discovers theres an american military base centred in the area that has been testing equipment. Yi appraoches the base in a freindly manner, but is instantly gunned down and escapes within an inch of his life. The game turns toward gurrilla warfare fromt his point on. You need to take out key military instillations over the island (such as propaganda stations and fuel depots) to try and win over the local populus. Once youve garnered enough strength you can take the military hq head on to liberate panaoa from the terrorist organisation that has rooted itself in the heart of the island.THe final stages of the game involve strolling the halls of the HQ, which span deep underground. Yi uncovers the secrets this place holds. the organisation were responsible for the pirate attack on the ship, hired mercinaries trying to obtain a rare artifact being transported on the cruise that nobody knew about. This clearly explaines why rico was onboard and this was certainly no ordinary cruise. The artifact was being used to reanimate flesh to create necromongers to satisfy some weird cult called zoology established by Tom ultman. From this point on Yi knew what he had to do and where he needed to go... space... THe game ends with Yi having a choise to destroy the evil facility, or instead render it inert for future research by the alliance which hope to harness this power against the bretheren moons. Once you make your choice you can hitch  a ride on the ebon normandy, a test vehicle in the hanger which is fully developed and primed for space flight. YOu can take with you some local aquaintances you met on the island, or just go solo. In any case, you leave the island and make your way to eden prime, and this is the basis for the second installment of league of exiles which we here at indieholic ardently await to get our greasy little hands on.until next time, stay snazzy gamerz!"",1"
"2593,Path of Exile,2013.0,""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07B4SbJLPzk&list=PL0E56219EE956754EPath of Exile: An action RPG similar to style and feel of great titles like Diablo 2. Path of Exile is a true marvel in its approach and achievement. Everything in the game is solid and simple but with a lot of its own ideas to make it different from most other ARPGs. From the colossal sized skill tree and open ended character building to skill gems and support gems and to the land of Wraeclast itself, itâ€™s a unique enough experience that I havenâ€™t encountered anything quite like Path of Exile before. Its non-standard approach is a nice breather from typical tropes of ARPGs and the fact that it works so well is a great achievement.  The game not only looks great but its sound design and overall ambiance is dark and dreary and very fitting of the setting. The story and lore of Wraeclast is quite disturbing and is quite interesting to unravel although, like most ARPGs its story is more akin to a movie rather than a true role-playing experience, where you make hard decisions and live out consequences of those choices. The game also suffers a bit with regards to its own character system, in that each character can potentially be the same, it loses its replay-ability a bit when compared to other ARPGs where characters are a class unto themselves with their own unique skills and spells and the skill tree in general will take a lot of careful planning and getting used to. Overall the experience of Path of Exile is solid and fun with the most frustration coming from the fact that it is an online game and with that comes some technical issues such as lag and issues from other players themselves. Personally, I would have gladly had paid whatever the asking price for this game, for it to be single player and online as optional. As a free-to-play title it does come with its own store which thankfully I can report does not have any content within it that feels like it has to be purchased in order to enjoy the game. Items in the are generally either cosmetic items, purely for looks or things like stash or character expansions, but they give you so many to start out with that these wonâ€™t feel like immediate needs or purchases ever. Path of Exile is a great ARPG, everyone can enjoy this game and it is simple and easy to get into and play and it at least offers 20+ of content for a first time through the entire game and itâ€™s all completely free without any extra game content being behind a paywall. -Double Thumbs up from RoyialVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "",1"

"2595,Path of Exile,2015.0,""*Gets handed a Microphone*What...Path of Exile? Wh- NOW!?...Okay...Uhm...It's better than Diablo! 10/10....What more do you want from me at this short no- WE'LL DO IT LIVE! W-WE'LL DO IT LIVE DAMNIT!#I Want Malachais SpikeANYWAY, What's Path of Exile? It's Diablo, done right, pretty much. Yeah I know some of the fanboys are PROBABLY going to downvote me for this, but it's still true. The game is free, and is more dynamic and polished than Diablo ever was. That can be a bad as well as a good thing...With Diablo you don't get in-game stores cause you already paid for it a-...Wait you can buy stuff for it on battlenet?...Well...Uhm...okay!The game's pretty much you picking one of 7 different classes...From brute monster dudes to a creepy witch gal, and then you get pitted against four chapters of various horrifying and SUPER edgy monsters, while being forced to tackle the most INTIMIDATING SKILL TREE THAT YOU WILL EVER EVER SEE FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!!![i.imgur.com]. Seriously, it's flipping mind blowing! There are dozens of different paths to take and things to do and stuff and what have you! It's outrageous! And to add insult to injury: There's no tutorial what so ever! After getting to a certain point in the first playthrough, you unlock a jack of all, ace of none character, named Scion, who's pretty much a blank slate character. Do what you want with type of deal.The graphics are a-okay and it actually gives you a wide range of spec requirements...the recommended is nice and high and lets even the toughest rigs get to make the game into a gorey HD experience, while the minimum are so low that even the worst old crappy laptops(Like my own) can play it with little to no complications!Once you've completed the game on normal difficulty....you...GET TO PLAY THROUGH IT AGAIN!...This time on cruel difficulty, and then merciless!!! Yes, you have to backtrack the same stuff you just did if you want to level past 35-40 -.- Cause thats when you reach the last bit of chapter 4 and the game starts from scratch 1 difficulty level higher.But it's okay cause you'll NEED to know how this stuff works anyway! Normal difficulty is more like a 'let me show you how its done' stage, and cruel difficulty is actually the INTENDED difficulty of the game! Or that's the feeling I got from it, anyway.So now lets do some pros and cons...Pros:It's better than Sakura ClickerYou have the most freedom skill wise than in any other game that I've ever seen.Large assortment of classes to choose from, including one ace of none jack of all character to unlock.Very large community, which is commonly adultThe game is INSANELY gorey and kind of horror based. Lots of impaled corpses and body parts and literal RIVERS of blood. If you're a gorefest lover, you'll ADORE this game!Naked golden statue women with really nice golden asses...BIG plus for that one.PvP is a thing!Crazy difficulty curve...Easy at first, IMPOSSIBLE to solo at the end.A real e-peen fertilizer! You feel you have a boner that could lift your desk when you're wrecking parts of the game that shouldnt be soloable, by yourself!You can raise the dead to fight for you, then make them explode when they die, then raise the dead who just died to your zombie minions...It's AMAZING!!!Cons:The currency system is a complete mess...It's based on 'orbs' and there are literally 15+ different orbs to keep track of, each more valuable than another and WHAT value they exactly are switches from day to day and from person to person, so you might buy something for 10 regal orbs but can only seem to sell it for 5 etc.How good you are is RNG based. When you get a good piece of gear, it might not fit your needs exactly(You might do lightning dmg mainly and the piece has cold dmg!). So you use an orb of chance or whatever it is to change the attributes of it to fit your needs....And you might end up making it WORSE, like putting strength on some mage gloves or something stupid like that! Being good in this game relies a LOT!!! on luck of the draw.Repetitive as all hell.You play through the game...next difficulty...Play through the game...NEXT difficulty...OH there's an event! Make a new character, play through the game, event ends, new character again, new league to get better get...Play through the game, next difficulty, league ends, character gets put in hardcore league....If character died, character's bumped to standard league. Make new character etc. It's the same exact stuff over and over again.Bit of a random storyline.It's kinda hard to follow the lore of the game, as it's all kind of just thrown at you as you go along :\ Unless you sit and waste 30 seconds - 3 minutes reading dialogue from NPCs, you will have NO IDEA whats going on, or why Merveil has to die, or why Malachai is a grade A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, etc.Other than that, the game is, for its few, not super crippling flaws, a really good one, and I do indeed recommend it."",1"
"2596,Path of Exile,2014.0,""This game blows me away. How can this be free to play and yet be so good? I played the Diablo III demo, but I don't think I'll ever buy it. Instead, I'll happilly spend my time on PoE. The enormous skill tree, the fact that your attack skills and spells are gems instead of class abilities, the barter economy, the gritty style: this is what Diablo III should be. A game for people who aren't afraid to think and experiment."",1"
"2597,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Content, making new character, lots of builds. Every expansion add to the game. At first overwhelming with all the skills, loot, skilltree etc. Once you start dig into mechanics and playstiles you start to enjoy. Its the arpg game out there. Constantly evolving. Started to play a long time ago but could not get into it at first. Took a good look at it 1+ year ago again, liked what the game had become and really like where its going. While free to play there is a hoarder in all of us so you probably will end up paying for a bit more stash. Not a big deal i think, value for money - yes.

And it is still free to pay!!I play, I pay and I rejoice in this forsaken ghost land.p.s.

"2599,Path of Exile,2016.0,""Seems complicated, and it is. But give it a chance, it is much more rewarding than any other modern ARPGs. The variety of builds is astonishing. Highly recommend it, but it is a time sink. I spent over 900 hours in this game and still didn't see anything."",1"
"2600,Path of Exile,2013.0,""This free title is the best action rpg out there. The items, the gems and the currency system are all very interesting to play with and we're not even talking about the massive passive tree. You don't need to play the hardcore mode to enjoy it but for me it's a must."",1"
"2601,Path of Exile,2017.0,"" Single-handedly redefining a genre is an amazing feat. Especially as a F2P game I have played Path of Exile on and off since it first launched on steam. I always could see it's greatness, but there were things putting me off, like the horrible netcode and desyncs. After starting again with Patch 3.0, I could not resist recommending this game. To make it brief: It is epic. Imagine Diablo 2, but amplified in every way with dozens of systems and mechanics to keep you motivated, while the combat feels as responsive and impactful as diablo 3  Story Path of Exile takes place in a very unique fantasy setting. You as the player get stranded as an exile on the magical realm of wraeclast, which is kinda the game-worlds way of sentencing you to death. But you are no """"normal"""" exile and soon discover, that you are capable of great power by using mystical gemstones. I don't want to go into too much detail, but for an action RPG, especially a F2P-ARPG, the background is amazingly detailed. The story-telling is somewhat Souls-esque, with NPCs, item descriptions and randomly spawning audiologs giving information to the player which has to be puzzled together to get a comprehensive picture of the history of the world. Atmosphere & Setting Building on the mystical background-story the developers have created a dark and grim world for the players to explore. Objectively, there is a huge variation between zones and acts. While you start on the rough coast of Wraeclast, you soon move into muddy swamps, through dark caverns, fight through jungles, discover old overrun cities and fight in pompous palaces. The variety is excellent and some areas, which lead up to certain bosses, are very rich in atmosphere. On the Downside, I feel that the variation, which is definetely there, feels not as distinctive as it could since almost all areas are somewhat dark and gloomy. I get that this is an artistic choice to reenact the style of world that Diablo 2 was building, but sometimes I catch myself being bored with the sorroundings although they are, again objectively speaking, mastefully crafted. Gameplay On the surface, the Gameplay of Path of Exile is cookie-cutter ARPG: Run through areas, click monsters to death and get sucked into the addiction of finding better loot until you hit maximum level and grind the s*it out of randomly generated endgame-content. Below this surface, there is an unprecedented level of complex systems to keep you occupied. For starters: At the start of your journey, you choose between 7 different classes, but despite genre-convention, your class choice doesn't really lock you into skills and playstyles. Since the active skills aren't learnable on a skilltree, like most other ARPGs do, you could potentially use every skill the game has to offer with every class you choose at the start. Every active skill can be dropped in the form of Gems which then have to be socketed in your equipment to be used and also can be leveled to increase their power.So no skill tree you ask? Oh boy, there is one, and when it comes to skilltrees, it is the mother of all skilltrees. It is enormous, complex and challenges the player in ways, that no other ARPG has challenged you before. Mostly offering passive bonuses and playstyle defining key-abilities, you have to carefully think about investing your skillpoints. But there is always a way for you to switch passives, if you feel like you have missplaced some points, which I feel is an excellent compromise between forcing the player to make smart choices, but also giving you the opportunity to correct mistakes, you may have made.Currency is also a biiiig part of the game and works different to almost any other ARPG: Instead of gold, you can sell items for different Orbs, that you will need for crafting and improving your equipment. These orbs are not only currency between you and the NPCs but can also be used to trade with other players. Player-Trading is vital and the community is very active, so you can always spend your time trading with others to get the gear you desire.What has to be said though is this: Path of Exile is hard. Not only is it hard when it comes to the challenge of beating it's content (and believe me, that in itself is a tremendous challenge), but it also has a steep learning curve for new players. The tutorials they implemented work, but they're in form of texts  and the player has to actively read all of the tutorials to understand the mechanics and systems. Luckily the community is helpful and there are excellent video guides on youtube to get you started. Controls The controls feel tight & responsive in most cases, which is elementary for ARPGs. In the past, I always had my problems with POE since I felt that the netcode was bad, that the game had too many lags and desyncs to be thoroughly enjoyed. I am happy to report that things have improved a lot. Most of the time, the game feels as direct, impactful and responsive as Diablo 3, which is king in this regard. Sometimes, there are lags, but nothing to worry about in the long run. Presentation Technically, Path of Exile is good. Most Textures are crisp, detailed and the animations are fluid and well made. Some of the later areas can even be breathtakingly beautiful. But subjectively, I personally don't like the artstyle of the game. It feels to generic, sometimes it even seems to clean, while the envoirements are too static for my taste. I am bored by the constant darkness and the dim lighting. But all of this is subjective and I cannot critize the game for my personal taste. Afaik, most people really like the look of the game.When it comes to sound & music, I found Path of Exile to be surprisingly good. Most sound effects are distinct and impactful, while the music plays along nicely, especially in the NPC-Hubs. Replayability & Content To sum it up: The content is massive. You have 7 characters, each can be leveled up to 100, which takes weeks of time to reach. You also can play every character several times with different builds and those builds will have unique playstyles. There are tons and tons of loot, skill-gems, materials and other drops to look for. The Path of Exile team is also very busy, when it comes to seasons: Every new season features a new mechanic, which gets implemented into the game. Most new mechanics, that have been implemented in a season, stay in the game to expand the things you encounter. Right now, the Game offers 10 story-acts, split into two halves, while the second half revisits a lot of the older maps, while also changing a lot and offering up new boss fights. Aside from the story you have a S*itload of stuff you can do, so don't worry about content.When it comes to the F2P-Part of this game, don't worry: It is fair: You don't have to pay for anything. You can play any part of the game, for as much as you want for free. The only thing you can pay for are cosmetics and some improvements to your stash, making collecting and sortings items easier for you. While I find the prices for the skins, pets and stash improvements to be quite steep, I applaud the developers for this system, which is so fair, that I spent money on their shop just to show gratitude. TL"
"2602,Path of Exile,2018.0,""For all the people who are whining about the game not having an auction house, please stop. This is what makes the game different. It's not like you are just buying something for currency and instantly getting it, you actually have to interact with the traders. Now i know that this might cause some problems for people who have bad PCs, but trust me this is very healthy for the community. Today i wanted to buy an Atziri's disfavour for 5 exalted orbs, but i did not have the currency for it, and i kindly asked the guy to please not sell it, because i really need it but i dont have the currency yet, and you know what happened? He sold it to me for 4 exalted orbs! Now this may not sounds much, but having nice people like this helping you makes your day better. Also about the server issues..... PoE is free to play and Betrayal had double the players compared to last league's launch (which was really popular and it broke the records at that time), and they weren't expecting that many players. They also apologized for the issues and fixed it as soon as possible. PoE is all about trial and error, even if you have couple hundreds of hours and feel like you know everything, trust me you don't! Even if you feel like its all about the RNG, it really isn't , if you run blood aqueducts for 2 hours, you are garaunteed to atleast get about 10 chaos orbs."",1"

"2605,Path of Exile,2016.0,""I plan to write more reviews, but they will be short enough for all to read but just enough infoA 100% free to play game that has more depth, more content, and much to do than most games you would shell out money for. It's like Diablo 3 but darker and a more grittier feel. Story- You are exiled and left in a continent or place called Wraeclast. You venture out in dungeons, caves, ruins, jungle, and other locale in Wraeclast.Gameplay- You select various classes: Maurauder (melee/tank), Duelist (Hybrid of melee/range), Ranger (Archer), Witch (Mage), Templar (Hybrid), and a Scion (unlock after 1st act). So there is a character for just about any play-style. Destroy the many hordes of creatures in Wraeclast to gain experience and level up. You get nice loot based on the enemies you kill or quests you complete. You get to use special colored components to enhance your weapons and gear. And PoE boasts a massive skill tree that I have ever seen in games. The skill tree is like an extension to the colored components, but you can specifically add points to certain attributes. Online/Co-op- There is some co-op play, but keep in mind you have to be close in level with other players. There are guilds to join. You can trade some of your gear with other players. There's also PvP, and often times tournaments you can qualify for to make the game challenging. Cons- Minor gripe is for some not so good netcoding. You think your character is at one point on a level, but a split millisecond, his/her position was somewhere else, as if he teleported. It can get confusing, sometimes frustrating when dealing with a mob of enemies. But it's a minor gripe.Conclusion: If you like Diablo games, give this a try. Game has a bit of a learning curve to it, but there are plenty of guides, and helpful people that can get you started or keep you moving on. There's plenty to do. The game today is completely different from when it was first available. Most importantly, the game is FREE!! The only time money would be spent is for purely cosmetic enhancements to your character. This was the first game I ever put over 100 hours into on Steam, and it was worth it."",1"
"2606,Path of Exile,2014.0,""I've been playing Path of Exile since its Beta release, and i have pretty much nothing but positive reviews for this game. Infact, this game is so geniusly built i would actually be proud to say this is what Diablo III Should have been. (Sorry Blizzard, comming from a huge Blizzard game supporter in my past) The customization and variations of this game are so vast beyond anyones wildest dreams, I absolutely love it. Your currency system is GENIUS as well, its exactly what a game like Diablo lacked. Gold became really useless in late Diablo 2 gameplay, even in D3. It was really sad. Your currency system designed here keeps every currency in demand. No matter how far into the game you are.Ontop of this overwhelmingly amazingly positive review, you keep releasing more and more things that will keep this game alive for years to come and that truely takes talent.Leagues- BrilliantMore Skill gems!!! WOW EVEN MORE CUSTOMIZATION TO YOUR TALENT TREE BUILDS!!!!Reward incentives.And yet again, if you could put anymore cherries ontop of this wonderful cake that you already have, the game is FREE! Yet again, your genius plan works. Microtransaction is the way of the future! You keep huge respect for your games F2P Scene but yet if a player wants to spend a little money to customize their Character, they can by choice.MY ONLY COMPLAINTS about this game  (Which is extremely hard to fix) is your rubber banding system. I dont know if it is because of lack of servers around the world or not, but it has adressed me some serious problems when playing Hardcore mode in your game. And i know that is disheartening to any gamer. My other complaint, which really isnt even a complaint, is this games graphics. Its not a deal breaker by any means, but  feel like it could use some improvement.All in all I would rate Path of Exile a 9/10 since you seem to keep improving this game further and further.  You have my highest respects, one of the best RPGs to date."",1"
2607,Path of Exile,2017.0,Quite possibly the best free to play game out there.It definitely follows the core mechanics of Diablo but does them even better.Hours upon hours of fun with friends.. Highly recommend.,1
"2608,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Really want to like this game the constant rubber band lag makes it unplayable. Attacks can be delayed by 30 seconds when lag builds up. To prevent hacking (I assume) the game needs to verify every attack/move creating massive delays with large mobs on the screen. The result rubber banding while trying to move or actions taking 20-30 seconds to get processed.Not a game breaker: no unique loot drops when playing in parties going to have to share.Tried playing this game long time ago, uninstall for same problem. Gave it a second chance to see if the problems have been fixed and going to uninstall again.______The actual game mechanics are great the network/server problems are horrible."",0"

"2610,Path of Exile,2016.0,""This game has led to alot of moments for me, alot of them being hilarious, whether that was me being a noob or not in the situation is a different story.  I still love playing this game for the fact that there is still a ton of stuff I have yet to try.  Some of my freinds have asked me advice and to be quite honest, even with 1000+ hours, I still feel like a major noob.  The biggest thing I mention is, try out the silliest thing you can think of, getting rid of tradtional thoughts about character steriotypes is important I feel.  I also love how with 1000 hours, the crafting system atleast for me has been always a touch out of my reach, for the challange leagues I mean.  Would deffinetly reccomend to arpg fans.Update:The game is headed in a new direction currently.  Mechanics are getting reworked, new systems are getting implemented, and theyre doing away with replaying the game 3 times over and adding one single playthrough.  I still reccomend the game, just thought I'd post an update that changes seem to be on the way, for better or worse."",1"
"2611,Path of Exile,2016.0,""What to say about Path of Exile? Is it just another silly action RPG with mindless grinding on the market? Well, the game has a lot to offer and I'm not, by any means, the best person to tell you everything about it, but, I can tell for sure, that I've experience enough to assure you that this is an amazing action RPG, with an immense variety of builds, items and gameplay styles, besides the complex item economy. The fact that you've no restrictions (in terms of classes / characters) to use items and skills, as well as skill tree paths, creates an enormous variety of builds, making every character an unique experience. The game has beautiful graphics, with an exceptional dark theme to it"
"2612,Path of Exile,2016.0,""Very good, but beware! This game is not n00b-friendly at all (things could do with a lot more explanation).In PoE, you play an Exile who just landed on the coast of Wraeclast. From there, you will fight your way across the continent and find what's behind the corruption of the land. To do this, you use skill gems that you can socket into your equipment, different kinds of orbs that enchant your stuff and spend points in a massive passive skill tree. The skill tree in this game provides very few skills, because the majority is available as skill gems (that you can swap in/out at a moment's notice).I didn't try to use the global chat (too noisy), so can't really tell if the online aspect is good or not."",1"
"2613,Path of Exile,2016.0,""So i see it's not enough for a review to say the game is good, when it clearly is. But i will ellaborate my thought.So this game is my day to day grinding simulator for when i just wanna chill and listen to some sweet music. Since i'm not a big fan of diablo 3 and diablo has kinda outlived it's era and passed on, to the forgotten but not forgotens hall of fame.I'm not comparing this game to diablo in anyway, and thats why i think it's good, it is another game.It has a lot of interesting very well made lore, tons of spells attacks and different ways to defend yourself, using all kinds of gems, that can freely be socket in and out of it's colour matched socket in your armor or weapon.The game has a certain difficulty, it's not a beginner frendly game in itself, it has a good introduction to wreaclast. But it's the community that makes that part great, theres tons of guides and videos on how to play the game, i myself have watched the streamer and youtuber ziggyD to get a feeling for patches and new items.the above have been almost only positive. But Path of exile have some downsides, and not just two but a bunch.A few big to mention are:the constant unsteadyness in the server. You will never know when the server suddenly decides to spike out, and there have been period where the lag have been almost character destroying "

"2619,Path of Exile,2016.0,""Path of Exile might easily cause a bad first impression - the combat and movement at early levels feels slow and limited.

The way it deal with """"seasons"""" (called Leagues here) is nice, and the fact that Hardcore characters aren't instantly deleted on death, but instead transfered to the permanent softcore league, is an interesting change.Crafting might feel overly-complicated at first, but it's actually a pretty interesting system that allows you to have some fine control over your gear, instead of fully relying on random drops alone.Another strong point of Path of Exile is that it is truly free to play.

Because the labyrinth is not fun. It does not matter how many times they shorten it, the lab will never be fun. It is a chore to do the trials and the lab. The only thing it adds to the game is each characters ascendancy, which can be added in any number of different ways. Such as replacing the new almost worthless pantheon system. Another negative aspect of Path, is trading. Path of Exile relies on a third party website in order to trade. Many have said, if this website were to go down for whatever reason, they would quit Path. The game offers absolutely nothing in terms of trading other than a cancerous trade chat akin to Diablo 2, where scams are the commonplace. This website is not supported in anyway by GGG, but every single person who trades uses it. It should also be said that GGG protects scammers, and when if you try to call the scammer out you will get banned for """"name and shame"""".TL:DRAs it has been said a thousand times already, the true successor to Diablo 2. All the while not bringing in anything new except for better graphics, new skill system, and """"microtransactions"""". edited after 3.0 update"",0"
2624,Path of Exile,2018.0,I really enjoy the game it is a close design set up to Diablo. The Problem is the imbalance to elemental resistance is insane I am playing as a elementalist running to point to where I am doing almost no damage even with switching between elements. Or even using gems to penetrate the resistance it feels like the game is geared to much toward warriors or summoners. It punishes you for playing the way you enjoy to where it takes the enjoyment away. I love a chalenge and a hard game but I don't enjoy a game that trolls certain classes.,0
"2625,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Community is immediately toxic, and party support characters seem like an afterthought at best.Would need to get into the community to find a support role, and that does not sound even remotely inviting. Even free, I have no purpose for this game.It runs well, and is easy to get started in.Controls are good but lack polish. (Menus and sales interractions are a little clumsy compared to Diablo titles.)If you played diablo to be a grumpy pvp slumlord, then maybe check it out.If you want an RPG that you and your friends can 'care' more about party interactions, this is not it."",0"
"2626,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Worst FPS I've ever played. 10/10Edit: I noticed this review recieved a lot of attention for some reason. In all seriousness, Path of Exile is a fantastic ARPG with some of the best character custimization options in the entire gaming industry. With the removal of desync, I can proudly say this is easily the best ARPG on the market and given its extremely ethical business model and excellent game developers, there is no reason any fan of rpgs or arpgs alike shouldn't atleast give this game a try."",1"
"2627,Path of Exile,2017.0,""Pretty standard game of that genre.You can choose between the standard classes, the story is segmented in acts and there are leagues with new and (more or less) unique content every now and then. What i personally really liked about this game is that you get access to a small area called hideout that you can decorate as you want, whilst players within your friend list and members of your team and guild can visit it as long as you're online. You have access to the stash, vendors, dailies, pvp and the end game content in the hideout.Sure, the options of personalising your hideout are limited, especially since this is not a sims game, but it's still a nice feature.The (maybe) biggest downside of this game however are the microtransactions, the pricing in particular. Microtransactions doesn't have to be inherently bad and it's laudable the items in the store are solely cosmetic, with exception for the increase of stash tabs and guild member slots, but nothing that could change the performance of a character by any means. But pricings of around 40 bucks for an armour set, around 10 bucks for headgears or currently up to 80 bucks for a simple pet are more than just overpriced.Also, as far as i've noticed and from what i've heard from other players, this game seems to suffer from performance drops and disconnects from time to time.All in all, i would like to give this game a mostly neutral to slightly positive rating, despite all the negative points this game may (currently) have. It simply has not much outstanding to me, even though it was surely fun for a while. [Note: i've mostly played this game in the legacy league, version 2.6, so parts of this review may not necessarily be valid to future versions of this game]  "",1"
"2628,Path of Exile,2016.0,""Ive been playing this game since it was first conceived over 7 years ago. well over 2000 hours before steam, It is a beautiful game that blizzard wished they could have developed. Its got a splash of everything great, little issues and most of all the content updates are out of this world. I would glady pay 60$ for this game rather than D3, I want this game to have my babies. 11/10 would unplug granny for more support packs."",1"

You gotta focus what you do else you get lost :) This skilltree + the abillitys granted by gems were maybe the reason I met in my first PVP match a lightningbolt spamming warrior which was jumping with his big battle axe over the arena tearing me apart.

"2630,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Feels clunky, looks clunky. Has huge depth for hardcore min-max players but offers nothing for me that I cant get out of the other games in the genre. Cant argue on the price so go test it out yourself and see if its your cup of tea."",0"
"2631,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Itâ€™s not so much the gameplay that is challenging, but your knowledge of the game itself that challenges you. There are many nuances in the game that you have to learn. First the vocabulary. For example: """"5% increased damage"""" is very different from """"5% more damage"""". And because of this donâ€™t expect to make that perfect char your first go. Especially if you donâ€™t follow a guide. This isn't really a bad thing, but it is not friendly to new players.What is bad are the tags they put on skills. They basically mean nothing. For example """"rain of arrows"""" is a skill that has the projectile tag, but a projectile support skill will not affect this skill. Such as â€œGreater/lesser projectilesâ€ do absolutely nothing to this skill. It's like GGG wants it to be confusing just because they can make it confusing. I donâ€™t see any other reason for it. Itâ€™s why a totem skill can have the tag spell, but things that effect spells donâ€™t effect it. So they make the learning curve even more stupid. And if you go post this as a bug on the forums. You just get trolled and yelled at for being an idiot.The point of the game is to make the most OP character you can. I enjoy doing this, and is the reason I started to play the game. However"

I would play game the again despite stereotyping goatmen as bearded devils.4 out of 5 maaaaaaaaaaaahs"",1"
"2633,Path of Exile,2015.0,""At the time of the review I have about 700 hours logged on steam version. Path of Exile is  a hardcore action RPG with a lot of depth. It will most likely take a while to get in to and it is not suited for quite a lot of gamers. However, this game is absolutely fantastic. Pros and cons can be subjective, so I'll just point out main points.-Hardcore. Can be a heaven for hardcore gamers and a nightmare for casuals. Not recommended for your first ARPG.-Free-to-play but not pay-to-win. GGG's microtransaction system is very fair. Almost everything is cosmetics and nothing in microtransaction store gives anyone an advantage.-Realistic gritty graphics. I personally love the graphic and art style, but it is highly subjective.-Music varies from """"meh"""" to absolute blasts. From boring lullabies to beautiful symphonies. -Sound design is pretty solid. Good voice acting and realistic sounds.-Support is great and quick. I personally had great time using it.-Game has classes, however, the class only changes how your character looks and from where he/she starts from the skill tree.-Characters can use any skills or items if they have required stats. Skills are skill gems that can be socketed in to items.-Ridiculously flexible and huge skill tree. You can make thousands or possibly even millions of builds with the tree provided. Skill tree consists of little upgrades (For example, 0.3% life regeneration or 12% more physical damage.)Some people don't like this, but those small upgrades stack fast, I personally love the freedom of the skill tree.-Game is based on leagues, so there will be different leagues where you can create a new character and try new things.-Lot of equipment variance, you can find, buy or craft items perfect for your build or even multiple ones.-Trading is decent but should be worked on. You either need to yell to chat or use 3rd party websites to make trades. Game has no auction houses or player shops in-game.-Leveling can be quick or slow, depending on build and skill. Max level is 100 and you can reach level 70 in 10-15 hours.-The game has 3 difficulties, Normal, Cruel and Merciless. You will move to the next difficulty after completing storyline. Story currently is composed of 3 acts (4th one is coming soon) and you complete those acts in each difficulty. This can be very boring, since it can feel like the game is repeating.-The endgame is a map system. You can craft mods in to your maps to make them fit your build or your needs. I personally love this system, since it offers a lot of variance, varying difficulties and different experiences.-The D-sync (Should be fixed in the Awakening expansion). Basically, you will be off sync from the game and you might in a different position than your character seems to be on your screen. This can and probably will cause a lot of deaths and frustration, but should be getting fixed soon. (Only thing that has really caused me frustration in the game. Glad to see it going)I might have forgotten some main points...Overall, I think Path of Exile is a fantastic game by a fantastic company and I recommend it whole heartedly.Edit: Now at over 3k total and the Atlas of Worlds expansion is fantastic."",1"
"2634,Path of Exile,2016.0,""Basically this excellent game is a free to play Diablo 2 with a character improvement system that is QUITE REMINISCENT to the Sphere Grid  from Final Fantasy  X. Except that the grid itself is... ridiculously big. And if you are just playing casually, you can use it to develop your character in ways you want.But if you are fairly serious, you will need to find out  ways to actually build effective and efficient characters, having entire trees planned beforehand.And then you will need to get quite lucky or trade successfully, because skills are not bound to a character. That is both the game's greatest strength and greatest weakness, in my opinion. The skill system is  INCREDIBLY flexible, being more similar to FF7's materia system than anything else. Skills come in the form of """"virtue gems"""", which you get to slot into items with the appropriate colored slots.Said gems mostly come in rare, random drops. You either need to trade for them (easier now since there are vendors that do sell some useful gems now), win  many of them on quests, or trade with the community.Extremely flexible, and if diablo 2 gameplay mixed with FF7 skill systems and FFX sphere grid character growth sounds interesting, you will probably devote many many hours in this title.The ingame shop is only for cosmetic items, storage space and character slots, as far as I know, so there is no such thing as a pay to win scheme in this game.EXTREMELY recommended."",1"
"2635,Path of Exile,2014.0,""I truly consider this the great sequel to Diablo II . Being free-to-play is even greater ( but DO NOT compare this game with Diablo III, for they are different games. Diablo III is a game in its own right, it deserves the attention for it is very polished and well conceived ).Path of Exile has the exact style of Diablo II and although I don't agree with the spamming trade system, complicated class skill tree and inability to re-roll skill points easily, I do praise the developers for starting the game and continuing Diablo II's dark legacy in a different lore and graphic engine.Deserves a 10/10 from a Diablo fan like myself."",1"
2636,Path of Exile,2015.0,It's perfect game for every Hack and slash fans. In my opinion this game have everything what Diablo 3 doesn't have. Plot are a little bit short but for me it was exciting . There are a few drawbacks like graphic or music which becomes tiresome and game play is a little bit hard for new players  but we can expect everything from free too play game. I recommend this game only for advanced players. I really enjoy this title and i think a lot of people will agree with me.,1
"2637,Path of Exile,2017.0,""Having been playing diablo 3 for the last couple of years, i thought this game just looked boring and ugly. Boy how wrong i was, this game is so much more than it's contenders could ever hope to aspire to, the depths, the complexity and hugely satisfying gameplay, has me addicted."",1"
"2638,Path of Exile,2016.0,""My favourite Clicking-On-Monsters-Loot-Bingo pastime. After being out for about five-ish years and after about five-ish expansions it's got tons of content and it works well.Even if you're a diehard supporter of Other Brands of Carpal Tunnel Clicking, it's hard to argue with the price of COMPLETELY FREE. This game still hasn't gone pay-to-win, using eurobucks just gets you slightly more fashionable murderhoboes (and supports the developers).Downsides would be that the first act is still just boring caves and rocks and the first 20 levels of a character are limited in their skill variations. It gets a lot better after those.Oh, and some people probably hate the grimdark setting because everything is rusty and gory and vile. No cute high fantasy here. The story takes you through some pretty sinister and nasty places. I consider it a big bonus."",1"
"2639,Path of Exile,2014.0,""If you like gear based grinding games then this one is for you.  Let me start out by saying that I enjoy a hard challenge and have to play on hardcore, where you only die once and then you drop down to standard mode (softcore).  Any character that drops down like this is dead to me, never to be played again.   I wasn't sold on this game at first as I got sick of dying at lot :) .  Lately been playing it a lot and more and now I understand the boss mechanics accept that I will die at some point but it's just a matter of how long I can last.With a massive skill tree where you can spend 120 skill points from 1350 skill nodes there is a large amount of replayability.  Even though there is a lot of repetition in replaying the same maps over and over (until you beat Merciless difficulty and move into endgame randomised """"maps"""") it's the character customisation that keeps me coming back.  Give it a shot, I think it's worth it. "",1"

"2641,Path of Exile,2015.0,""This is a fun Diablo 2 type game, however, every 4-6 months Grinding Gear Games patches the game so utterly that three times in 1.5 years all of my character classes were botched or totally ruined. For those who have played games like these, leveling up is the easy part...buying gear for the class of character is not. So when my 5 characters hit level 90 finally, GGG actually came out with their new Act 4 expansion which completely ruined each one of my characters to such a high degree that I needed to redo their entire play style...which made all that gear I spent months buying obsolete. This is definitely a game to stay away from.

The only negative I can find is that the RNG can sometimes drive you a bit mad. Also if you're not smart with your currency you can end up feeling fairly frustrated. You need to study the player economy and builds as you play to have the most fun as I've experienced, and it's not really that hard. Also it's a free-to-play game with full access to all content on just clicking the install button, so the business model is great.

2651,Path of Exile,2018.0,Path of Exile is currently the best action RPG out there right now. I hate to call it a Diablo clone because Diablo 3 is pacman in comparison but that is the genre POE is. Gamer beware
"2652,Path of Exile,2015.0,""-Devs, although they seem to be great and connect to the community, only really interface thorugh reddit and don't seem to address problems properly imo,-As mentioned in other reviews, this game turns into an oligopoly simulator where most players farm  to try adn get enough currency to play whatever build they want or simply flip currency to get there several times faster. The fact that there is entirely no deterministic farming means that trading is almost necessary for a lot of players given their playtime and as such multiplayer interactions are necessary.-Since multiplayer interaction is required, a mention to the fact that trading relies entirely on an external 3rd party website seems relevant. GGG makes no effort in fxing this issue and the in-game trade chat is an aberration of scammers and bots.-Balance changes are made around mostly the top players, i.e streamers and nolifers, meaning that the for the vast majority of the playerbase, many things are not possible at all, which is perfectly reasonable given the ARPG genre of the game. However, said balance changes are often nonsensical and utterly brainless: for instance blatantly overpowered uniques introduced to the game, most of existing uniques being useless garbage, nerfing the FOTM build every league. An extreme case that shows how out of touch the balance team at GGG is is the state of melee in the game: they don't even have the basic understanding that what makes melee skills relatively unviable, which is the mechanics. instead, they give a few % more modifier on the damage as if that will change anything. Ranged and spellcasters deal both more damage/have more aoe and are safer to play due to several reasons such as being closer to CI and also not having to be in melee range of mobs but they don't seem to understand thsi at all.-There is a lot of false diversity in this game. Given how difficult it is to produce a truly original build that really works, it is basically recommended to follow some build guide. When you consider all these build guides, they all share may similarities within given archetyoes, CWDT IC, same skill tree give or take a few nodes with different active skill gems: even the support gems are usually  the same, especially for melee skills. Whilst many active skill gems exist, many of them either have the same mechanics or are simply not used.-Crafting is also equally falsely diverse (not considering the new essence league which is not part of the core game) givem that it consists of spamming orbs of fusings to get a 6-link or spamming chaos with the occasional exalt slam. -The fact that the game is still treated as a public beta and bugs, although they might be fixed reasonably quickly, are not accounted for in terms of previosu playerHC lost characters worries me given that the game has existed for such a long period of time. In addition, almost every recent league launch has been horrendous and problem-ridden, yet it is still described by the GGG team as """"having gone well"""" with no mention at all of the huge problems that happened, especially given the competitive nature of the game and the very staggered starts that different people encountered on the ladder to 100.-Many problems still exist in the game despite general engine improvements, e.g. lag from rain and ground effects, which have persisted since their introduction, and the game has only just come relatively close to other games of similar fame in terms of performance.In conclusion, I would not recommend this game given how slow the early game is for new players and how dire the current state of the game is.Addendum: After the passing of a few more """"leagues"""", repeated bad design and balance issues and a failulre to understand at it's basis what a game of this genre is meant to achieve, probably due to the void of other games in the arpg genre, I have reached the point where I no longer expect anything from Grinding Gear Games: the leagues become sloppier and sloppier with little to no end game content to even look forward to.There is no real skills rebalance and the devs obviously don't even playtest their own content for balance: this is evident from their delegation of the balancing to the reddit community, especially notable popular streamers of the game, and it is really unforgiveable for a company of their size to be so inept at anything except PR and occasionally art.The release of multiple """"loot boxes"""" for visual microtransactions is visibly becoming worse and worse, with the latest complete armour set requiring on average $210 with huge variance due to dupilcates. I would not recommend anyone purchase anything with money in this game unless they agree with most of GGG's design philosophies."",0"

"2657,Path of Exile,2017.0,""Takes the ARPG genre pioneered by Blizzard with their Diablo series, and improves on it. If you loved Diablo II, and were disappointed by the relative simplicity of Diablo III, Path of Exile offers endless opportunity to theorycraft diverse characters."",1"
"2658,Path of Exile,2018.0,""So good you'll feel like a thief for getting it for free. Far beyond what D3 even hoped to be. Complexity, challenge and constant updates keep the game vibrant. 10 Acts and endgame content make for countless hours of content. This game does not hold your hand and can be unforgiving. But still keeps you coming back for more because the sense of accomplishment out weighs the frusteration of defeat by a worthy adversary."",1"
"2659,Path of Exile,2014.0,""That skill tree is HUGE - but the actual amount of choices is limited.Some call this game path of life nodes, because if you don't pick a ton of life nodes, chances are you'll be a weak leaf unable to resist the slightest breeze by the time you get to the third difficulty.That said, the game's done a number of forced skill tree resets over the last year and it's a pain to have to restart such a huge build every time.Then again, it's nice to be given the freedom to do so, because like many others I completely messed up my build by not holding to the life node rule. Glass cannon comes to mind.All in all, it's a great game, many times better than Diablo 3 - and FREE to boot !And, best of all - unlike most F2P games, the devs of this game have a strict """"no pay to win ever"""" rule.Anything you can buy in this game, is decorative, extra inventory slots, cool special effects and pets.Totally worth it, because the game is fair to all players."",1"
"2660,Path of Exile,2018.0,""An excellent ARPG in the same vein as Diablo II. A surprisingly deep skill system that allows you to customize your characters' builds based on skill crystals and a skill tree that adds some abilities and passives. Skills can be swapped out via-gems on the fly. The characters are somewhat interesting, all having a story that lead them to be exiled to the island which adds a nice little touch of story and personality to the characters. The action is all pretty straight forward: kill everything. The game can get difficult when you really get into it.The game is completely accessible without spending a single penny for content or character boosts. The entirety of the game is completely free to play, and there are constant updates and different leagues (seasons) that add new touches to the gameplay to keep it fresh. There is a shop that you can buy cosmetic items with real money for your characters in, but it's completely optional and the game doesn't hound you about it. Basically it's something you can do to make your character look snazzy...or if you want to support the incredibly active developers."",1"
"2661,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Although I'm no huge fan of hack'n'slash RPGs, PoE was the first game of this genre since long ago (since D2 I bet) which managed to keep me playing for longer than just a few hours. Sure, I played D3 through but rather forcing myself than with relish, and I absolutely agree with the opinion that PoE is a way better match for the Diablo franchise than D3 itself. At least, it features the right look & feel, proper dark atmoshere, tons of customizable loot, much more interesting character development, and last but not least - appropriate size and length. And on top of all that it's completely free! """"Free to play"""" but not """"pay to win"""", so you can enjoy it to the full without spending a single cent.The downsides? Yeah, they exist too, but I'd describe them to be minor and inessential. Permanent connection to the server in a single-player game (but that's commonplace nowadays), somewhat bad placement of waypoints across locations which eventually forces you to replay certain (quite large) locations twice or even more times, rather sophisticated skill tree (not necessarily a bad thing). But the rich core gameplay pays it all off, I must say.In any case, I strongly recommend this brilliant game to all RPG fans and to anyone who loves good games no matter what genre they are. Despite some minor flaws, it is fully capable to carry you off the reality for some considerable time and give you bright and memorable experiences."",1"
"2662,Path of Exile,2013.0,""If you like Diablo-style games and sorting through massive piles of loot to see if there's anything worth equipping, you're gonna like this a lot.  Add in the fact that it's free (and the things in the cash shop are entirely cosmetic and optional), and you really can't go wrong."",1"
"2663,Path of Exile,2018.0,""I started playing recently PoE, about 10 days ago, it's really addictive, and fun.I'm not the best rpg player out there so it took me a while to understand the mecanics, people were willing to help me out and explain some things i didn't understand (community is great)Completely free to play, the only thing that the game gets money from is cosmetics. "",1"
"2664,Path of Exile,2013.0,""One of the best diablo style games I've played.  The skill tree is a breath of fresh air.  I particularly enjoyed the way they work their hardcore mode, where upon death you a moved to normal mode instead of losing everything."",1"
"2665,Path of Exile,2013.0,""Absolutely worth to give this game a try! Heavy in-depth theorycrafting with a passive skill tree with over a thousand passives to choose from. HOW DIABLO 3 SHOULD HAVE BEEN!If you enjoyed D1 and D2 then this game is a must-play for you.I've been playing far more than the couple hundred hours here on steam. I've been playing since the start of the open beta, when it wasn't on steam yet, so I have spent about 1000+ hours in this game.Races, PvP, Endgame-PvE Maps, new challenges every other month.Great developers, very active and open about the patches and on reddit.com/r/pathofexile "",1"
"2666,Path of Exile,2013.0,""If I had to describe this game in three words it, they would be, """"Suck it Diablo!"""" This game offers further strategic depth, as well as a world that feels more alive. Also, they are just giving it away for free. This game's drawback is that the skill gem system and passive skill trees are unfamiliar at first. However, with a bit of research, this game can easily turn into the best one you will play all year."",1"
"2667,Path of Exile,2015.0,""+ Art style fits """"dark"""" and """"realistic"""" theme perfectly.+ Graphics are also technically great without performance issues.+ Huge passive skill tree which leads to unlimited different playstyle.+ Gem based skill system allows you to try different setups anytime you want.+ Combat is not much different from other ARPG's but it works. Damage/HP/Mana balance is pretty good.+ Level design is OK. Game lenght is nice for players who seek a good campaign.+ And the best"
"2668,Path of Exile,2016.0,""After seeing this game in the popular section of FTP games, I decided to try it out. Apparently I had played it before even though I don't remember doing so. Logged in and had a level 6 Templar loaded and ready. Spent about two minutes fumbling about with an unfamiliar UI while walking down a sandy beach. Eventually came across the one spell I had. It summoned up to 3 zombies from nearby corpses to fight for me.Can honestly say I have never enjoyed killing crabs and resurrecting them into oddly human-shaped bodies to fight more crabs as much as I have now."",1"
"2669,Path of Exile,2016.0,""An amazing ARPG with great developers who are passionate about the game. At first the game will likely feel a bit overwhelming with the enormous skill tree and endless options for builds and skills to use. My advice for first time players is to just play and make up a build as you go, don't overthink it at first.If you like Diablo 2 then you owe it to yourself to give this a try, it's free to play. The game is monetized by players paying for cosmetics and extra storage space for items beyond the generous space you get for free, no devious methods of separating players from their money as you see in so many other free to play games."",1"
"2670,Path of Exile,2017.0,""Yep, still the best game ever made. Make a fantastic game with endless possibilities, make it free to play without pay-to-win and make money through transactions that make the game more convenient for people that actually stick with the game longer. I probably stuck about 50 euro's in transactions, haven't regretted a little bit. This should be any developers way to go when creating a game, pure love for the community. GGG the best!"",1"
"2671,Path of Exile,2018.0,""It's kind of like i wanted to play diablo 2, but it was less annoying, and had a vastly better leveling system. Tho the gems get a little annoying at times. Still worth it if you like this sort of thing."",1"
"2672,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Easily the best ARPG I've ever played... Only thing that's killing it are overexpensive microtransactions. I'd rather buy the game for AAA game price than this. Now people can argue how microtransactions are only cosmetics and that's fine. But I think it's not, when there is no other way to aquire it instead of buying it."",1"
2673,Path of Exile,2018.0,Super fun game with a good and pretty long story. I think I enjoy it more than D3. Skill tree takes some getting used to but in the end really contributes to what makes this game fun. Do I get my badge now,1
"2674,Path of Exile,2017.0,""A fantastic game! Completely fair free to play model,a company that actually treats their customers with respect and a game that has endless different types of builds for you to play with. 100% recommend!"",1"
"2675,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Well let me start of by saying that this is one of the most in depth rpg's ive ever played and offers a good story with tons of weapons and quests to keep that boredom level down.

"2676,Path of Exile,2014.0,""One of the best free games out there. It's a Point and click style online Action RPG right up there with Diablo - and unlike Diablo III it isn't a sell out: no pay to win.It has the largest (and yet very well balenced) skill tree you're likely to ever see and is generally quite flashed out.It takes many interesting new approaches to alot of things that are generally kept unchanged across the genre - like a deep barter system instead of the usual coin and flasks that refill as you kill mobs instead of having to craete new potions every few minutes.The makers are a """"small independent team of hardcore gamers based in New Zealand"""" and they """"created Path of Exile as the game that we'd want to play ourselves.""""And it really does play like that - a game a gamer would want to play, and not one that some AAA company decides that they should.I can only say: give it a try, you'll be hooked - it's free anyways.9.5/10"",1"
"2677,Path of Exile,2014.0,""This game is- simply put- awesome.The game is well designed, I've yet to come across a single bug, and is incredilby entertaining. The narrative throughout the game is extremely engaging and is insanely dark and above all, interesting."",1"
"2678,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Very good 'diablo clone', has an amazing hack and slash feel to it. Skill systems (gems and passives) are both very good. Currency system is a little odd but overall i think its a good thing. Has a gritty, dark theme to it."",1"
2679,Path of Exile,2017.0,Great game for those who want to be reminded of the Diablo II glorious days with possibly infinite customization to skill/talent/progression system and aside from the 10! acts(I mean what hack n slash game gives you a 10 act story mode and for free!) alongside with the pvp mode you get end game content that gives you countless hours of top tier raid maps for completion in a unique mode that can be played solo or with other players.Some minor bugs include server lag as it seems it became quite popular and servers cannot handle the player base and some memory leak loading issues that can be frustrating.Excellent !!! 9.5/10---------EDIT-------- ONE YEAR LATER------Their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing net code is total â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t . There are instances of playing through a big pack and you auto attack in a direction and their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing server doesn't understand that you just auto-attack and your player just decides to run inside the pack and you get one shotted.Imagine now trying to do a labyrinth where you have only one chance to complete it and the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game kills you even when you have avoided aoe on the ground or you die from completely nothing cause just like that . â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ YOU PATH OF HENTAI â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ THE DEVS â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ EVERYTHING THIS GAME STAND FOR.,1
"2680,Path of Exile,2018.0,""A quick note before reviewing this: I will be uninstalling PoE from Steam because there are so many issues trying to log in and stay logged in using Steam.

"2682,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Path of Exile might at first strike you as one of many other, similar, MMO/RPG's... but it isn't. First of all, the developers have done a great job with the microtransactions, which are almost all cosmetic or simply increase your storage. If you just wanna play and finish a game, you'll never need it. If you think of having 1000+hrs and tons of characters you might wanna think about that again, or you might just want to support the devs. The skill tree is huge. And by huge, I mean mastodontic, never before have I seen anything like it. Skills are obtained through Gems, which you'll find or be rewarded with. Vendors will trade items for the various in-game currencies, so no usual gold this time, so this might be weird for someone used to the classic currency system. Speaking of which, you'll find yourself troubled whether you should use the currency to upgrade your gear, or wait for better gear and purchase something else with the currency. The maps are randomized and quite large but it's pretty solid. Graphically speaking it is quite up to date and shouldn't lag. I turned off the chat, as it is quite useless for me since I don't think of playing the game so much, but you might wanna find a buddy to play with, as it is so much more fun to play together and you might have an easier time with bosses.>I'd rate it a 9/10>Pros: gameplay is solid and pretty polished, randomized instances, huge character customization, interesting currencies, isn't ruined by P2W microtransactions.>Cons: often found myself crashing and having to restart the game, loading screen takes forever, might come across a bug or two, also with some quests when doing them together.P.S: I have no idea what is up with random kiwis around the place from time to time, but I love it.

"2683,Path of Exile,2014.0,""- = Updated for 3.0 = -Update 3.0 has brought outstanding new changes to the game, performance is even better, and the amount of content continues to increase with the addition of a ten-act system instead of a """"three difficulty"""" system like Diablo and other similar games adopted. The new expansion is coming out soon and I'm going to keep playing the heck out of it.- = Original review = -A true action RPG like no other.I've played Path of Exile since closed beta. I never can seem to stay away from it for too long, I always come back to play again.The game has excellent support by the developers, and has innovative new ways of spicing up the creation of a character to take on the hordes of evil.While most games take you on a brief joyride of skills for your specific class, Path of Exile sends you on a journey with its gem-based skill system. This system allows you to essentially create your own skill that works the way you want it to. You can make one fireball that pierces enemies and burns them for more damage, or make a fireball that deals less damage, but forks/splits into many fireballs on being cast instead. The customization of skills is baffling and infinitely useful within the game. The amount of creativity that go into making builds in the game is astounding. If you like making interesting characters and trying new ideas in RPGs, you will go crazy with Path of Exile.One of the other main points of this game is the class fluidity. You can pretty much make any of the classes play how you want. Your """"ranger"""" can use heavy armor and a shield and be as tanky as any marauder or templar. The way you build your character is up to you and your creativity.The developers also support replayability of the game with """"race"""" events. These events let players test their skill at starting fresh by racing through special dungeons, or through the campaign itself, in order to win rare items or other prizes for your more permanent characters on your account. Some of these events have PVP elements, while others are simply just challenges in surviving and progressing in interestingly-challenging settings that you otherwise wouldn't encounter in the game.If you enjoy having lots of options in an RPG, then you should definitely try Path of Exile.With it being free, you really can't go wrong. I donated over 60 dollars to this game during development, and I don't regret a single cent spent. But you can play it for free and enjoy it just as much.My only complaint is the desync... So much desync. :(9/10, will be playing it again."",1"
"2684,Path of Exile,2015.0,""As a diablo series, and generally blizzard funboy, i can tell that these guys did a pretty good job on the game, concidering the game is actually free unlike diablo for exp.As far as i know there isnt anything you can get with real money, so there goes the pay-to-win aspect, a big variety of skills, abilities , and a massive talent tree gives you alot of choises on how to actually play your char.The only thing that could be a little bit confusing to new players would be the way that the minimap is working ( it looks like it is bugged, unless it is actually bugged on me :P ). Generally the game is actually fun to play and its worth your time!! 9/10"",1"
"2685,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Path of Exile is an ARPG, for those who aren't quite sure what that entails, it's basically a Diablo kind of game, if you haven't played that, it's sort of an RPG where you murder masses of enemies. If that interests you, you have no reason not to try this game, because it's free!Just because this game is free doesn't mean it's cheap feeling by any means though! This game offers loads of content, and TONS of depth if you really want to get into it. Not to mention, the developers provide plenty of free periodic updates offering even more new content. Path of Exile is a sort of standard ARPG fair in a sense, but the main things that seperates it from something like Diablo is first of all, the ability to freely customize and use skills regardless of class. Path of Exile offers several different class options, however, the classes don't really determine your skills, only your starting point on the class tree. The skills are actually determined by these skill gems, which can be slotted into your armor and weapons, and are vast in what they offer. PLUS, these gems are able to be augmented by weapons and other gems in order to further customize the skills and your own playstyle! Speaking of skills, the perk tree in this game is MASSIVE, potentially a bit overwhelmingly so to some people, but to others it's a glorious dream of customization! The skill tree can be one of the most intimidating parts of this game, so if you need some guidance just google search a build for your class, and atleast follow it a bit in order to give you a better idea of what to do. I will say that this game isn't easy, and building properly can be somewhat important, which can be a strength or a weakness depending on what you do. The first part of the game isn't too intimidating, but I will say one of the weaknesses perhaps for this game is that it can be a bit unfriendly to newcomers. All that said, it is a great game, and if you are a fan of Diablo or similar games, you are doing yourself a disservice not trying this out. This game offers one of the best, if not the best experiences of it's genre, especially for hardcore players and it's completely free! Microtransactions are also not plaguing this game making it Pay 2 Win or anything, there are things like bank space upgrades to be bought, but that's really it, and probably won't even bother you untill you're really invested in the game, and even then, it won't cost you more than a normal game would anyways!Tl"

"2687,Path of Exile,2016.0,""This is one of the best games ever made, and when played on hardcore it is one of the most difficult, challenging and rewarding games of the modern era, a triumph over most games of this generation, and a callback to times when every player had to learn the game they were playing in order to succeed, rather than being catered to and handheld. Except this time you have an interactive community to help you along the way, as the game features trading, partying, player housing, and an 'interesting' global chat. And what a journey it will be, the atmosphere of this game feels like a blend of Dark Souls meets Diablo. Despite the graphics being pretty simple there's a ton of heart and fantastic art direction+flavour paving every step of the way. There's literally thousands upon thousands of ways to build your character. (Despite this 90%* of the community just plays CoC builds) *hyperboleThe best part? The game is free, aside from some purely aesthetic microtransactions which look very nice. No pay2win here. (Until you need more stash tabs i.e storage space) The community is one of the most diverse (for better & for worse) communities I've ever encountered, and the depth of this game is greater than most MMORPG's, despite this genre being an online ARPG. The difficulty scales to an absurd extent, you can never truly """"Faceroll"""" every aspect of this game,(Unless you play CoC, in which case please uninstall--you're not a good player, stop uploading twinned boss map clear videos to Reddit, nobody cares--except for other CoC players) and there's just so much depth and replayable value to this game that I really can't recommend it enough. The endgame, on hardcore, is insanely fun and often times heartracing, with immense risk and reward being omnipresent throughout the experience. The more you play this game, the more you want to play it, and that is a surefire sign of both an addictive problem and a masterpiece. On the negative side of things, the early portion of this game is a total, unintuitive mess--if you're unfamiliar with the ARPG genre, or even if you're somewhat familiar with it, the game will likely feel far too overwhelming to bother with, it doesn't even bother trying to tutorialize you, and while the exploratory independence the game gives you is ultimately empowering, it's a little too vacuous for genuinely new players. Several of the game's mechanics & character features are amazingly in depth and customizable once you begin to grasp them, but unfortunately they also come off as very hard to understand initially, and even once you begin to understand them you'll likely fail to fully realize what you can do with them for quite some time. None of this is necessarily """"bad"""", but it could certainly be offputting to a large demographic. The pace of the game is also painfully slow early on, this is especially true if you have no gear and if you're new to the game-most new players and even several veteran players don't know how to level efficiently, and waste a lot of excess time doing certain pointless side quests, picking up every useless item, killing every mob, doing irrelevant side areas, etc. Bluntly put, combat will not feel satisfying for a while, but when your build starts to come together and the enemies start to possess actually significant mechanics, boy oh boy does the world ever turn upside down. On top of that, the """"true"""" game doesn't kick off until merciless difficulty, by which point you'll already have """"beaten the campaign"""" twice, and this is presently very unintuitive to newer players, so a significant portion of the """"playerbase"""" ends up """"beating"""" the game (in their eyes) on normal and then never returning, even though the real experience hasn't even begun yet (Although regardless, at least these people get to experience the boss fight """"Malachai"""", which is something you'll probably not soon forget). However, I'd still implore anyone who might turn away from the game because of these reasons to *just trudge through it* because, come merciless difficulty, come MAPS, it'll all prove to be deeply worth it. Once you get your first good unique item, once you 5 link or 6 link your first item, etc. etc., you'll have nowhere to go but up. That is, until your character dies and you angrily uninstall or reroll a CoC build. Screw CoC builds they're killing the game and trivializing the content, alright GGG you caught me this was all really an elaborate ruse with the actual intent of this review being nothing more than a rant about CoC builds. CoC builds are utterly faceroll and negate all strategic thought, difficulty, mechanics, and build variety involved in this game. Also nerf lightning coil and blade vortex. GOTY."",1"
"2688,Path of Exile,2017.0,""As an ARPG fan, if you haven't tried this game yet, please for the love of god do yourself a favor and try it out. It starts slow like any ARPG but once you start feeling your character get strong man does it feel good! The gameplay is very fast paced late game and with the sheer amount of content in endgame it's absurd this game is free. The devs clearly care about this game as if it were their child, I have nothing bad to say about the game other then that you always need to be connected to the internet.

Easily a must-play for everyone.Pros- FANTASTIC free to play model. You get the entire game right off the bat. There's really no 'except' or 'but' to this, you seriously just straight up get the entirety of the game. All the things you can spend $ on are things such as cosmetics for your character, pets, decorative set pieces for your hideout, and other petty stuff along those lines.- The game features perhaps the deepest way to create a character's build in video gaming history. You see, the game has a passives tree with over 1,000 nodes to invest in. The class you pick merely determines where in the tree you'll start. For example, The Duelist class starts on the bottom, where strength and dexterity meet.  Here is a picture [i.imgur.com] of the current passives tree. This massive tree combined with the strange way you mix skill gems with support gems to bend your spells to do exatecly what you want. For example, you can attach a fireball (skill gem) with Lesser Multiple Projectiles (a support gem). Now instead of 1 fireball, you now shoot 3. Or perhaps you want to summon a totem to shoot the fireballs for you? Or maybe your fireballs fork into two more fireballs when they hit an enemy. On top of that, """"unique"""" items in the game can bend the normal rules for your character, to allow for even more creativity and possibilites present. - Three month leagues with special rules or permanent leagues. A multitude of various races to start a character at level 1 and reach the furthest in the game in a certain time under certain rules running every day. Softcore or hardcore. There's a lot of variety present in the game which is sure to find your niche.- Amazing developers deliver content on the regular. I took a break from the game (after about 1,200 hours) for 3 months and when I came back there were 14 new support gems, 7 new skills, a new master system, personal hideouts, and more bugfixes/quality of life changes than I cared to read in one session. Cons- *...cough...- JK, there is a learning curve. It may take you a few hours to get a real feel for the game. For people like me, that's actually a Pro, but may be a bit off putting to some.I give the game 10/10, and award it 'Best Indie Game', 'Best Crowdfunded Game', and 'Best ARPG'go play it u doofus"",1"

However, I'm starting to get annoyed with constantly getting booted and losing all of my progress due to the saving method essentially being waypoints. I haven't been able to progress through the story much for the last two days because everytime I try, the server disconnects (and no, it's not my computer or internet connection). Another thing to keep in mind, you might as well play the windowed version and keep a browser up in the background because you will constantly be searching for vendor recipes, etc. It's interesting that it doesn't have one base currency like so many other games, but can be a pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥sometimes with such limited inventory space. I hope you like Tetris because you will be playing a lot of it in this game. It'd also be nice to have auras and certain summons not take up skill slots in order to be used. I know some people like the challenge, but I would rather have access to more skills. That being said, it is a fun game with A LOT of content and you don't have to pay to win...but you may have to invest in more stash tabs. Thankfully, they are not too expensive compared to the vanity items."",1"
"2692,Path of Exile,2015.0,""This game will try to kill your character every second, but at the same time, this game will try to make you OP as fast as possible. First few minutes of gameplay, my inventory was full of crap to sell, I was decked out on the best armor to be found, I was wielding a bow with flame arrows and I had akimbo swords with really sweet skill gems, and I was surrounded by cannibals, zombies, crab-like thingies and more. Also, best writing ever, and the voice acting is spot-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing-on. I have nothing more to say. Too bad my friend doesn't want to play this game, he's a LoL addict. He still doesn't realise that that game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing moldy pigeonâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on the roof of a car parked in the sunniest and hottest city on the world compared to Path Of Exile."",1"
"2693,Path of Exile,2013.0,""If Torchlight II is what Diablo 3 should have been, then Path of Exile is what Titan's Quest II would have been.

"2694,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Such a great game -- I cannot believe this is free! Better than D3 and Torchlight 2, this is a truly immersive action RPG. It combines talent customization from both FFVII and FFX which allows you to make any character that you want. The only content that does cost money is cosmetic items, which only add very little to the experience. Everyone should play this game. There is absolutley no reason to not give it a shot."",1"

"2697,Path of Exile,2016.0,""The game is fun, but be prepared to pay at least 100 Euros to be able to really enjoy it. Without the expanded stash, you will be crippled, and with it, the game is no longer free but twice the price of most full-price games. I really enjoy playing it though, and I certainly recommend it, but I think they should be more up-front about how much you have to spend to make the most of its potential."",1"
"2698,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Very well put together game. The passive tree is extremely diverse and theremore allows for many different types of gameplay. Also has a very good free to play model. There is no pay to win, only aesthetics and bank space can be bought."",1"
"2699,Path of Exile,2017.0,""You'll have a hard time finding a game with more possibilities. However, to reach those possibilities, it's a loooooong grind, especially on your first few playthroughs. Dissappointment can hit hard when you get to high levels and realize the character you poured 100 hours of your life into doesn't really work. That being said, it's a very fun game- love the graphics, the style, the whole item, skill, and passive system- and it's definitely worth checking out. It's a game in which there are almost always more things you can choose to do."",1"

It is starting to get dated, but new players will find so much to do that they won't even notice.The game has settled into two basic groups. 1) The 500+ hour player who is still struggles to make a character that is viable for end game content and 2) the 2000+ hour gamers who know every explot in the game and post videos on youtube about it.  Both groups still seem to have fun.The game has a steep learning curve for an AARPG, but can still be played with just basic understanding.  The most overwhelming thing is the skill tree. You will certainly mess up your first few characters, but that is part of the fun.It is the closest toa truly """"free-to-play"""" game I've ever seen of its quality. The only real $ transactions are for asthetics and extra storage.  As long as you're not a pack rat, you never have to spend a dime. However, if you find that you put in 100+ hours on the game, you won't feel too bad dropping a little cash for storage and the money sorting system.Get it, play it, hate it, love it. "",1"
"2701,Path of Exile,2013.0,""Best Action RPG I've ever played. The skill system is awesome, the passive skill tree has 1350 nodes on it, and the itemization and progression is perfect. Couple all those features with developers that actually care about their game, and put out new patches/updates at least every 2 weeks, and this game becomes one of the best hack 'n slash dungeon crawlers ever made. If you liked Diablo 2, but weren't a fan of Diablo 3 (because let's be honest, this game plays A LOT like those games) then this is the game for you. I definitely see it as the true spiritual successor to Diablo 2. One of my most recommended games ever, all at the price of free, with no pay to win bull crap. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME.UPDATE: 2/23/2018Still an amazing game, and still love it. My play time hasn't advanced at all on my Steam account because I switched back to the original client because I hated how long it took to update through the Steam client. The next league starting in a bout a week called Bestiary is looking very interesting, and is a big change from what you would expect in an ARPG. They are adding in ways to capture monsters so you can """"sacrifice"""" them to create rare items and gear to use. It sounds like a lot of fun, and if you haven't played the game before, Bestiary league is looking like it's going to be a ton of fun."",1"
"2702,Path of Exile,2014.0,""What I expected Diablo 3 to be.A fun action RPG that redefines many aspects of the genre in interesting ways. Class selection only determines where you start in the gigantic skill tree, and attacks and spells are your choice - skills come from gems that you socket in your items. Potions are permanent items like regular gear that refill as you kill monsters. There is no gold"

Skill Gems are an amazing way to customize skills to make them perfect.My only problem with the game is that the microtransactions are not so micro. Almost 50$ for a pack of armor skins. It's a little expensive, but hardcore (as in heavy, not single life) players would do it to support the company."",1"
"2704,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Path of Exile is one of the best games I've ever played. PoE is a free to play game, but unlilke most other f2p games out there, there is absolutely no way to gain any bonuses or anything by paying money. The only thing you get by paying money is cool skins for your gear. It doesn't have have any effect on the actual gameplay. The game is quite complicated, but that is what keeps me coming back for more, as there is a near-infinite amount of combinations of skills and character builds, most of them with significantly different playstyles. While the campaign does get a little old after a while, (on one character, you have to repeat the campaign 3 times on different difficulties), Grinding Gear Games has said that they have more content in the works that will eliminate this, with a new act scheduled for release in early 2015. Overall, I would rate PoE 10/10, a must-play."",1"
"2705,Path of Exile,2014.0,""very high knowledge cap required for """"mastery"""" of the game. you do not need to actively trade but it is highly advantagious and encouraged. no auction house but there are selling threads on the main site and spin-off sites that work decently well. the devs are very active in the game and produce a new """"expansion"""" that consists generally of new game mechanics/meta/difficulties that require you to learn how to rise above it. this happens on average every 4 months. the game is not overly grindy to level to where the majority of people are at (if you know what you are doing), but is EXTREMELY grindy to get to max level. the good part of that is it is not needed to be that high of a level by any stretch of the imagination. there is lag that WILL hit you frequently (more or less depending on your char/playstyle) and that is a fault of the client to server communication but you can   help to make it less frustrating by making a macro that types """"/oos"""" (out of sync). extremely fun to make new builds/characters and ACTUALLY encourages this behaviour. the game is very challenging   , however, it rewards you for overcoming it's difficulty. the only negatives i can really list is the lack of an """"auction house"""" system, the lag that sometimes happens, and it is VERY recommended to purchase bank space if you want to be an active succesfull merchant. but the prices on all the micro transactions are very reasonable and are not game altering ala """"pay-to-win"""". lot's of cosmetic micro transactions that are really cool if you like that kind of thing."",1"
2706,Path of Exile,2014.0,Man Path of Exile is only getting better! I have been playing this game since it was in beta its just insain how much they keep adding since then. I have't been addicted to a game like this since diablo 2.  Still can't believe this game is free every time I play it. It almost feels wrong :P anyways.. download this game you wont regret it :),1
"2707,Path of Exile,2016.0,""umm... recommended for players that never play diablo, to get a good impression of its typical genre itself: [Diablo] genre I guess...Rest assure it has its own unique feature in belonging in such genre, such as that its more involved in MMO system where you get trading, co-op runs, and something that other similar genre games does not have.for instance, it is more faster-paced, especially in skill utlity againts most situation, as most enemies in this game are much faster than the common. AND FLUID COMBAT SYSTEM, unless you have poor pc and internet.Game progression hardly involves grinding since most of your exploration around sandbox maps would take care of that.Its easy to get bored if you're playing alone while still getting involved with the online community, as variation are not that vast, only difference thats commonly seekable are difference traits amongst players' SP tree invested."",1"
"2708,Path of Exile,2017.0,""Basically THE BEST ARPG Hack n' slash that keeps refining the genre, you don't even need to play this game to know how important it is. But i personally don't find it fun to play, just my opinion. Still, if you have the patience of replaying the same thing over and over in order to progress then go for it, you also need to play it seriously, not just using everything you find, you can't do that, because this game forces you to learn theorycrafting (character building) in order to end every act and keep progressing in the game. This basically applies in every game of the same genre but PoE is more strict about it, so get ready once you start. Have fun."",1"

I played this for 1500 hours, and will most likely play it for another 1500 hours. Especially if GGG keeps releasing those awesome updates with new leagues, new items, new maps and perhaps new acts. The game might be a little difficult to understand for new players, but the tutorial the game offers explains the most basic mechanics and things you have to know to get started.

"2714,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Path of Exile has to be one of the most enjoyable RPG games ive played since Diablo 2. Lots of players will tell you, as will i, had you sunk countless hours into the diablo franchises and been ultimately disappointed by Diablo 3, this is the game for you. A player since open Beta, this game has come so far in terms of class expansion, level development, progression and the unique orb reward system which the games economy largely revolves around. The 3 month challenge leagues released by the developers keep this game new, exciting and fun, while simultaneously introducing new skill gems for awesome monster smashing, altering the passive tree to keep players builds dynamic and fresh (and to prevent face rolling, because lets face it, Path of Exile WILL kill you!) With 6 different classes to choose from and countless character builds, if you enjoy individualizing your character i strongly recommend this game! Overall, i rate Path of Exile 9/10Replay Value: -Countless HoursDifficulty: -Hardcore players beware !!! Casual players also be warned, you will lose 10% exp for every death! Economy: -With the introduction of customizable hideouts, trading is better, in need of a more dynamic and integrated trading system-Orbs are awesome! (double function as a mechanic to alter gear or trade up for better!) Cons-time investment is huge, i.e learning how the economy works, what can kill you (virtually everything if youre not paying attention 24/7)-mainstream builds do exist in both hardcore and standard leagues-limit to 'individualization,' but still doable! -Storyline is lacklustrePros-Itemization, monster synergy, skill effects, and passive tree designed in a unique and fresh way that challenges the way we think RPG's should be played! I could go on and on, but honestly, just download the game, look up a build online and give it a shot. You'll find that you can't stop playing.Take it easy guys and good luck, God of Warriors  "",1"
"2715,Path of Exile,2016.0,""Not for the faint of heart of patience, but if you enjoy Diablo-esque gear grinders, this will definitely scratch that itch. Be prepared to understand nothing and feel a bit overwhelmed by the passive tree. I'd recommend picking a build from a site like timstips and following it for your first character since there's no sort of tutorial and it's very difficult to undo large mistakes made during leveling. Once you've played a character through the first couple difficulties, you will likely understand what you do and don't like about it, and be able to better build a new one.Despite being a free to play, it is not a pay to win. All things in the premium shop are either consmetic or quality of life items, but nothing is required. If you're like me and waiting for Diablo 3 to do something meaningful, Path of Exile can help fill the void "

I can count the number of days that i haven't played PoE since then on my hands, its that good.Always new content, always more lore, always more optimization coming out. Think of it as a Diablo-esqe kinda feeling game, with more depth, steeper learning curve and more praying to the RNG gods for good loot.TL"
"2718,Path of Exile,2015.0,""POE is like no other dungeon crawler I've ever played. The passive tree and skill gems are such unique character building mechanics that they became my favorite part of the game. The currency system has been excellently designed too"

Most fun is at top level, however if you do not know what you are doing going in, it starts BRUTTALY slow and boring for the first few hours. Stick through it and you will be rewarded with one of the richest and most well thought out loot grinds to date. Years of fun."",1"
"2721,Path of Exile,2014.0,""There is something really enjoyable about jumping fists first into a group of enemies and punching them so hard they explode.Path of Exile is a really fun and addictive game, and the never ending hunt for better loot will have you come back again and again. Any person who likes rpg's will like this one, no doubt about that.BUT, this game is definitely not without its flaws, and some rather frustrating ones at that. If you do not have a decent internet connection (and sometimes even if you do), you will suffer from some very bad desyncs, witch will lead to some very frustrating deaths. Suddenly teleporting into the group of enemies you try to run away from and hitting on enemies that isn't there, is just something you have to get used to.Now, if you can live with all the flaws and keep yourself from ragequitting, there is a huge amount of fun to be had in this game.Hopefully the flaws will be sorted out in the future, and maybe a better trading system will be implemented?.. but even if not, this is still a must try for any rpg fan, and since it is absolutely free, there is no reason not to!.. You are basically getting a 50+ $ game for nothing. Also there is no aspect of pay to win/progress faster or anything like that. The only way to give GGG some money is through cosmetics for your characters.So I give it a big thumbs up despite the frustrations this game can give you, and I will recommend Path of Exile to anyone.EDIT:Since I first wrote this review I took a long brake from the game, but I came back, I always come back, and I have poured about another 1200 hours of my life in to it, so I thought I should update my review.So what have changed? ALOT.The lagging issues have been drastically improved. You can still experience them once in a while but alot less now.The game moved from dx9 to dx11. It did have its hickups at first but runs as smooth as melted butter on a bald guys head now. (Would have been really nice with dx12, but it is still a huge thing)Graphics improvements allaround and better voiceovers for many npc's.Content galore!.. there are so mutch MORE content to the game. - New acts. The game is no longer finnished and starts over on a higher difficulty, it is one continuous story line that takes you all the way to the endgame play, the maps. There are alot of new maps, and they all fit into the Atlas wich is also kind of a map of all the maps that are a route to the final boss map in the mapping system, the Atlas.MORE Content! Unique items, shaped items, elder items, skill gems, support gems, jewels, new leagues that all have something unique to them. New content never seems to stop comming.Trading has been greatly improved. You can now put items for sale directly from your item stash without leaving the game and it will magically appear on most trade sites. You still have to use those third party sites (or poe's own new trade site) to browse items you want to buy and meet face to face to trade, but it is a huge time saver for people who want to trade (and some ingame socializing can be fun sometimes. You meet new people, go for a stroll on the shore and decapitate some zombies together, fun times!). You can of course still go to the Sarn encampment's notice board or sit alone in your hideout and stare at the trade chat if you prefer that. It is still no auction house but still 100% increased better than what it used to be!So the updated review, about 3 years since I first wrote it is - 5 thumbs up.. - Is it perfect? No. - Will it ever be? most likely not. - Is it worth your time? YES!There is a constant flow of updates.I have never felt that this was a game that was done. Move to new dx, this could go on forever. (I mean that in a possitive way)5 years after Its release, this game feels more alive than ever. I give this a bigger thumbs up than when I wrote the first review.. Download and enjoy the glory of smashing thousands of bad guys in their heads with maces and fireballs!"",1"
"2722,Path of Exile,2013.0,""For a  F2P game, I've felt absolutely no barries in playing Path of Exile.  I've run through the game once and not dropped a cent, even though I've been tempted with all of the things they've been adding.  The story is there, for those who want to find it, and all of the classes are suitably distinct from each other.  The skill tree is huge and all-encompasing, fully rewarding any play-style you prefer.I strongly recommend at least trying this game, it can't hurt, being free and all."",1"
"2723,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Might just be the best F2P game I've ever played. Looks gorgeous, sounds pleasantly, runs smoothly, feels very good to play. There is certainly a cathartic """"oomph"""" to the combat and the killing. Also, the F2P model is possibly the most honorable. The only items sold are cosmetics and stash storage space -- they're not cheap, but they don't impact the game.There's a choice of 6 classes, which are presented to you much in the style of ol' Diablo 2: Templar, Shadow, Marauder, Ranger, Duelist and Witch. Unlike the old game, however, each class is very maleable and inter-changeable, in both passive skills and active abilities. The latter come in the form of gems, colour-code in regards to which attribute they adher to: green for Dexterity, red for Strength and blue for Intelligence.Each class has 2 initial direct paths of skills. A ranger, for instance, can choose to excel with bows, at range, or go the path of duel-wielding in melee combat. And at later stages, new, farther branches of passive skills are available to customize your character with, allowing you to mold your character's combat aptitude in detail.This might seem complex at first, but do not be drawn away, it's really quite simple and easy to map out.Lastly, I've noted nothing in the ways of bugs, glitches or significant imbalances.Heartily reccommended to any Diablo player!"",1"
"2724,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Now this is an incredible game. Challenging in further difficulties and very personalised to your specific build.Most free-to-play games are not worth 30 hours of your time, this will give you satisfaction for months at the least.Those of you who remember Diablo 2 will love it.

Honestly, Action RPG Combat that is the best of Torchlight and Diablo, awesome graphics, interesting NPCS, cool dungeons, many quests, Co-op action, lots of customization and a whole lot of content keeps the game fresh and nice. There is a micro store but it's only if you want cool skins or armor or a pet. I could care less about it but it's still a nice addition. Great Game Although it's light on MMO elements as most of the time you're by yourself unless you're at a town so if you like Diablo, Grim Dawn, Torchlight, Adventures of Van Hellsing, Victor Vran and Wolcen you're going to love this game like I do.

I've played since closed beta and every single patch seems to deliver something unique and fun to the game. Great item and build diversity, endless end-game content, and a very polished art-style makes this a game I'll be playing for years on end. Highly recommended to anyone who's ever played an ARPG."",1"
"2734,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Having an *ahem* history with Diablo 2 LoD, I was preparing very hard to be disappointed here. I'm very specific about what I enjoy in aRPG's, but this definitely delivers on all the fronts that I've come to like. The maps are repetitive but random (this is a good thing) and there is an obscene amount of loot to find. The currency system is different, but better (I remember vividly how useless gold was in D2 - no more). The passive tree isn't very intuitive (if you want a competitive character, that is), but it does offer a lot of potential for theorycrafting if that is what you enjoy. As far as I can tell the classic aRPG class niches have all been nicely filled. If you don't feel like theorycrafting, there's an active forum community (official forums, obviously - not the steam ones) that probably has a guide for the thing that you want to play somewhere. If you're looking for Diablo 2, but not Diablo 2 itself, you will like this."",1"

"2736,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Do you like action RPGS like Diablo 2, Torchlight, and Titan Quest? Yes? Then look no futher than Path of Exile.  This game is free to play in every sense of the word.  All money you can potentially spend is on cosmetics and stash (if you want more or a dedicated currency stash tab that holds much bigger stacks).  If you like it, it is worth supporting them as they have made an enjoyable game that never hounds you to spend money.  One playthrough will take around 20-25 hours (to get through the original 3 acts), but they have added up to chapter 10 now, so who knows how long it takes now.The biggest difference with this game as opposed to other action RPGS is that the skill you have are tied to gems that you pick up and then slot into armor/weapons.  These gems level up by you using them.  You can unslot them and then reslot other gems as you see fit (they maintain their levels).  This allows you to really experiment with builds while not being restricted to specific skills or armor.Just give it a go.

"2740,Path of Exile,2017.0,""After playing the Diablo Series, Titan Quest, Grim Dawn, and both Torchligh games, my friends suggested I play Path of Exile (aka PoE). So i did got 2 characters up to 24th level (this was before the 4th chapter exsisted) and just lost interest in it. However a few months ago I wanted to play a ARPG again, being bored of Diablo 3's grindy story retread end game I picked PoE back up on a whim. This time it hit the right spot, and I bull dozed through all 4 chapters on each difficulty and have done 2 of the 4 Lab runs. Now i just adore this game, from its Materia-like (Final Fantasy 7 refrence) ability system to its passive skill tree (like a much more refrined Final Fantasy 10) and now have a Necromancer (Ascendant Witch) up to level 71 (level cap is 100 i believe) and cant wait to make my next character. Now the end game of PoE is a bit grindy too (but also very challenging) doing maps and stuff, but its the level of customization, the trial an error of skills and abilities that makes it worth it. Also to not there are 6 NEW chapters coming soon with the free """"Fall of Oraith"""" expanson so making the main game 1 play through instead of 4 chapters on 3 different difficulties. I for one cannot wait, and would recomend this to any ARPG fan.Solid 8 out of 10And just for compare to other ARPGsDiablo 3 = 6.5/10Titan Quest = 6.25/10Grim Dawn = 7/10Both Torchlights 6.5/10"",1"

"2742,Path of Exile,2014.0,""When it comes to Arps it doesn't get much better than this.  I have tried many games since POE was first released on steam and I keep coming back to it.  It's fun, addictive, and the sheer amount of customization you can do to your character is impressive. (Not just visually, but in the way your character plays, abilities and such)  Honestly, it's better than alot of games I have spent 60 dollars on a piece over the years, and it is completely free.  If you can play through the whole game once without putting any money in (completely doable,  all monetary transactions are cosmetic) and not feel at least a little guilty, there's something wrong with you."",1"
"2743,Path of Exile,2014.0,""I've only played a little bit of this game, and it is extremely stressful for me. I love the Hardcore aspect of it! It causes me to pay more attention. I would suggest this game to someone who enjoys the Daiblo games, since the character trees are so large, it's a great game!"",1"
"2744,Path of Exile,2017.0,""Let me go ahead and say this, before you consider playing this game, if you aren't willing to sink time in learning the game through external means, you probably won't enjoy this game. It's very complex, and while some might be able to figure everything out themselves, most won't. Now, onto my review.Path of Exile is an ARPG, and a spiritual successor to Diablo 2. In my own opinion, it takes everything diablo 2 did well, and improved upon it in many way. Now this is not to say this game is perfect, there are flaw with it, as with every game, but we'll get to that later on.Pros:1. Very indepth: This game will never let you feel as though you know everything, there is so much to learn, that even with over 500 hours sunk into this game, always reading up on this game and watching videos, I'm still learning, for me, this is great. I don't like to feel like I've mastered a game within 10 hours of playing. Some might disagree with me here, but I'm listing this as a pro.2. The community: The community in Path of Exile is one of the most friendly I've ever seen in a game at this scale. Sure, you get one â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ every so often, but for the most part, everyone is very friendly. On top of that, player interaction is very frequent, with there not being an in-game auction house, players will use 3rd party website to see offers others make and message them to purchase it, rather than it just being a disconnect from others.3. The longevity & replay value: I feel like this game has a long time before closing, and there is so much replay value it's almost too much. The early levels do feel very boring, but that shouldn't be too much of an issue as most of the game is played at the end-game content. Now, even with early levels feeling boring, once you get past ~30, it picks up a bit and becomes more enjoyable, so it's not entirely bad. Overall, I would say the replay value is high and longevity insurmountable.4. Build diversity: Whenever I tell my friends about this game, I always tell them to find a build. However, this can be a little challenging, as there's so many options to choose from. Almost every build has it's own flair, it's own feel, and it's own strengths in certain situations. The best way I can describe this, is that there is a skill that will burn yourself for 90% of your maximum hp per second, and deal 50% of your maximum hp persecond to nearby enemies. It feels as though there's never a lack of builds for you to try, and that's very important for a game like this.Cons:1. New-player-un-friendly: This game seems like it's trying to be as hostile as possible to those who are trying this game for the first time, the passive skill tree can be overwheling, and the way skills work and be confusing. This can be overcome by just spending time learning about the game from outside sources, though.2. Early leveling: Early leveling feels like a choir. It's very boring and stale. It gets better as you level, but only really picks up once you've accquired the skill you want to use and some supports for it.Overall:Overall, Path of exile is an incredible game with some early game flaws. I highly recommend playing Path of Exile, I've spent 500 hours on it so far, and I don't plan on stopping any time soon. "",1"
2745,Path of Exile,2016.0,Unique type of gameplay unlike others I have seen so far. It escapes FPS and goes into depth with character development. I would reccommend this game to others due to their fun season leagues and races.,1
2746,Path of Exile,2016.0,This game is the best ARPG ever made and will probably continue to be for the next decade.  Grinding Gear Games have truly made a work of art over these past few years and I'm glad that PoE is getting the attention and popularity it deserves.,1

"2748,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Path of Exile is one of those games that makes you want to punch your screen, face to keyboard or just sit there in silence as you died to a bunch of fire BUT it is also one of those games that makes hardcore actually hardcore, carries a very smart way of dealing with currency. Do I want a new piece of gear? More Currency? MAYBE craft a new item all together? Lets try it all! The game is SO in depth with its vast array of passive nodes that says if I die let me try this build out see if its better... 5 hours later and you are level 40ish and you just died you say NEW BUILD and do it all over again, the replayable content is so amazing that it makes me come back to it all the time just to die to Hailrake because I have 0% Cold Resist. Curse you perma-frozen!!! On top of all this, the developers are always looking for ways to improve the game and have continued to do so. Im talking about races, new leagues, MORE ITEMS even more maps for end game playability. My review so far has been totally from my heart to this game so without further adou I say this game is allowed a 10/10. Tons of content, an insane passive tree and the heart-warming troll De-Syncs of the century :)."",1"
"2749,Path of Exile,2016.0,""If you like to sink in HOURS in an arpg and can endure a slow start,  because it takes time to grasp all the content and mechanics, this is the game for you!Also it's F2P with no P2W, so why not give it a try. The real fun starts in maps tho.Just start in a new League and see for yourself :)"",1"
"2750,Path of Exile,2016.0,""100 ways to do the same build, my favorite ARPG just for the customization of builds alone.

"2751,Path of Exile,2014.0,""It can get VERY repeatative at times, concidering once you completed the three acts you just do it all again on a harder difficulty, but it can be fun at times. I especialy like the passive talent system which allows your character to be whatever the heck you want. Some of the bosses have a large difficulty spike, including the new Vaal areas but you know what? I enjoyed a challenge now and then."",1"
"2752,Path of Exile,2013.0,""One of my favorite ARPGS I've played in a long, long time. Love the freedom they give you to make your own characters, and the aestetics are amazing! Its so dark and brutal that it feels very refreshing compared to alot of games out there."",1"
"2753,Path of Exile,2014.0,""One of the better F2P entries on the market for certain. The devs take such an anti-P2W stance that I'm actually really amazed and tempted to spend money since the game's not a black hole vortex for it like most F2P.ARPGs have really been done to death and most really aren't that different from one another but I feel Path of Exile really stands out due to a number of innovative approaches to old problems. Levelling and screwing yourself and worthless currencies in particular. I can genuinely say that I like character progression better than Diablo II. It's still doesn't capture the holy crap moments of Diablo II loot or have the presenation of the gold standard either, but it sure as hell does both of those better than the cancer that is Diablo 3.Only thing I hate is server lag. The fanboy crew irrationally blame people's internet but it's clearly the game's server. It only happens occasionally, but when it does it's at a level high enough to be quite frustrating."",1"
"2754,Path of Exile,2017.0,""PROS:+ FREE!+ no real Pay-2-Win elements+ constantly patched+ new content added continuously+ huge passive tree+ tons of skill gems and the ability to combine them+ cool & numerous boss fights+ massive ammount of endgame content+ various crafting options+ strong communityCONS:- trading only available by messaging other players- occassional server lag that can make the game unplayable (especially on HC)- inbalance between some skills and mechanics- inbalance between boss difficulty- extra stash tabs needed for serious endgame playthroughsComment:By the time you read this review it might be outdated. The devs add stuff so often that there is almost no point of complaining about some things as they might get patched soon or replaced entirely. So while I would like to say that this is a review about how the game will work and look like it is not true. In reality it will still get more stuff added and changed. The community in it is hit or miss. You can find awesome people but also salty and toxic ones. Luckily, unlike in MMOs, the interaction with them is totally optional. There is actually a self-found option where you do not even trade with people. There are walls of texts in standard chat so don't expect talking to anyone there. But trading is easier here. Non-league Hardcore trading is almost non-existent but you get to have conversations on chat and interact with people more. Leagues (either standard or HC) are the most alive content and have good trading but are limited to 3 months. So choose whatever mode you like the best. This game reminds me a lot about my Diablo 2 loot addiction. Just one more run...okay, one more...10 hours later! The newer expansion ditched the three difficulties in favour of a grand 10-act campaign and I love them for it. While the difficulties were interesting they became more and more annoying as you had better equipment or more currency. Then they just hindered you from reaching end game. This way you don't get bored by the same content (although they do recycle some stuff in Acts 6-10) and progress is fluid. End game currently is the Atlas, a vast map of interconnected levels and a mega-boss at the end. Here and in the campaign itself the bosses range from easy to WTF-just-killed-me-in-one-shot so it is always good to have a portal ready. This game is one of the best action RPGs and definitely the best free-to-play game on the market! I already spent some money on it but after 750+ hours it was just to support these awesome developers. Check it out for free yourself, the mechanics are best experienced in the game and a ton of info is explained in the PoE wiki. For me it is the most played game on Steam for a reason - I freaking love it!!!P.S.: A really good mod to have is NeverSink's item filter which you can find HERE[github.com]------------------------------------------------------------------If you liked this review you can find more on the Curator page or in my Review Corner.

"2755,Path of Exile,2013.0,""This is the action-RPG we were waiting for. A spiritual successor to Diablo II, Path of Exile takes the formula and puts its own spin on it, with their own classes, lore, atmosphere, and leveling system. I think this game takes most of the things that Diablo III did wrong and fixes them, as well as provides an item system that is, while familiar, totally different than any other game I've played -- and it works really well. So well, that I would dare say it's by far the best in its category.When I first tried this game, I was kind of disappointed that the class choices seemed limited. However, when I actually started playing I soon came to realize that you can play any of the classes in any way you want. Dual-wielding wand Marauder? Sure. Ranged Duelist? Yup. There is absolutely no restrictions on how you build your characters because of the near-infinite combinations of passive skill-points you receive each level.On top of that, the skills in this game is a lot like the Materia system from Final Fantasy VII, only with exponentially more variety. It's very in-depth and allows for crazy customization of your abilities by modifying them with certain support gems. I can not count the times when I discovered a brand new way to build my character just by picking up an interesting new gem.I can't fit everything I like about this game into a single review, but since it's completely free to play (another amazing feature), I recommend you get this game as soon as you can and see for yourself!"",1"
"2756,Path of Exile,2013.0,""This game, while still polishing itself, has great potential, and the passive skill tree alone makes up for any shortcomings it currently has. Diablo 3 as it should have been. Not to mention, the entire project was created by only 6 people, That, in itself, is quite a feat for a game that can compete and surpass in certain areas Diablo 3."",1"
"2757,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Really nice to see all the effort that goes into balancing what seems to be even a bit over the top for an almost open world concept.Mostly for absolute tryhards, awesomely complex but still offers casual gameplay if you just want to focus on PvE and the storyline. I'm very impressed about the skill tree, a lot of games could use features where your choices actually matter quite a lot in the long run!If you are a casual weekend rpg player, you are probably not looking for this but like i said, still offers a lot of value for a free game. Definitely recommend."",1"
"2758,Path of Exile,2016.0,""I was surprised that I did not have a review written for PoE, I have 2300+ hours played on the game. Let me preface this review by stating that if you know anything about the ARPG genre then you are probably already playing this game, but if you don't this review is for you. With all my experience I hope I can help you make the decision if this is the right game for you. So without further delay lets jump right in.The pros:- This game has a lot of content, more than most free to play games I have played. The developers actively and in a timely manner release new content, items and game mechanics on a 2~3 month cycle. They diligently pay attention to the continued existance of their game, I respect them for that.- The game is hard, especially for a new player. Don' listen to people who write in their reviews that the game has lost all challenge, these are usually people with thousands of hours played using the most expensive builds in the game to trivialize content like those builds are meant to. In this experience you can really fine tune how challenging the game is if you are after that.- The game has a very deep level of customization for builds, you can pick it up and play it no matter what you build, but don't expect your first build to carry you far. This game is most of all a learning experience, knowledge here really is power.- The visual design and music score are great, they really work to bring the world to life. There is plenty of lore hidden in item descriptions and places around the world. You can also build your own hideout from different items that the master NPCs in the game offer if you are into that like me.- This game is truly free, no content is held behind a pay wall. Crazyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥I know, but don't expect it to be given to you on a silver platter. However, no matter what you do every moment you sink into the game is worthwhile, everything you pick up no matter how incrementally leads to you reaching your goals. That is something that I can not say for most the experiences on the market.The cons:- The game is hard and unforgiving. You will die to random things while playing and have to piece back together what you did wrong if you don't want to die again. Do not get discouraged, it happens to literally everyone.- Trading is an essential skill you need to learn to get ahead in the game, but the trading community is very toxic. People trying to make a profit constantly prey on new players so learn how to use poe.trade and check it to make purchases and sales. Know what something is worth before you sell or buy.- The learning curve is steep, but there are plenty of resources to prepare you for it. You tube guides, the game forums and the amazing wiki have everything you could ever need to get started. Do not ask people in game to explain a nebulous concept to you, most of the game mechanics require several paragraphs to explain, use those other resources and feel free to ask specific questions about what you want to know.- The gap between the rich players and the poor players is truly vast, bridging it is impossible without a lot of effort. You can't pay to win and if you do to one of the illegal bots expect to get banned, the developers stay on top of that.In my opinion this is the best ARPG on the market and it keeps evolving to stay that way. I enjoy playing and supporting a game made by people who convey a level of professionalism one expects from people running a business and not just working on their game """"hobby""""."",1"
"2759,Path of Exile,2016.0,""This is the game I've invested more time in game and planning than in any other game ever. Amazingly good and HUGE game. Updates keep it interesting and somewhat balanced all the time and there is always something to do or atleast to try. There are not enough time to even try all the interesting builds because new ones pop up all the time. PoE community in-game and in reddit are the most awesome ever. If you have problem, you can ask for help or buy services (like hard boss kills) from other players. You can play with up to 5 friends through game or just some time mapping with your best friend or you can be the ultimate lone wolf and maybe play in SSF where you cannot even trade with anyone other than the in-game vendors and masters.Skilltree. Where to begin with that.. It is huge and complex. And huge. There is always something new to learn and it's good thing in these games. You can go different routes to same notable and decide to take hp instead of damage or change it later if you just wanted to try out something. There are million choices needed to be made considering only the skill tree. Options are almost limitless, tho some decicions are a bit more build enabling than the others. You can invest only few hours or couple thousands of hours and I promise that you won't be in the position where you can say that you know everything and/or you have tried everything. New challenges, skills, uniques and other mechanics which affect the game and how you can/ should play it keeps updating every once in a while. And new leagues start about in every 3 months.

There is some room to take back skill points and add them elsewhere. Gems and sockets are a nice touch on how they can be combined and work together. The game revolves partly around crafting, but its not clunky like many games make it."",1"
"2770,Path of Exile,2013.0,""A Diablo style game that seems to have made a ton of fun design decisions. I vote it best in class.

No matter which level you are playing, something great could drop at any moment. A TON of character build variety. You can find a basic item and turn it into an incredibly better item with innovative game currency (and relatively cheaply). Easy to group when you are in the mood. The game is frequently updated and the developers are active in the community. Truly Free to Play. Support is responsive.The in-game armor and weapon visual effects that you can buy are more expensive than I would like (30ish dollars US in some cases).update: I deleted the bit about lag being a problem.

Exploring these options is part of the fun.And it all comes as a Free to Play game, but I have to admit the (completely optional) microtransactions, like more stash space, can give you a slight edge.But then again if one sinks countless hours into the game, one could argue that buying some microtransactions to support the Devs is a fair thing to do.All in all - awsome game. 11/10Update 2018: Still f*in great. Content updates are frequent - be it new skills or maps or game mechanics."",1"
"2773,Path of Exile,2018.0,""It's a decent hack and slash type game with a complex skill tree and gem socketing. If you enjoyed your Diablo years then you would more than likely go for a game like this. I wish the characters were more customizable though. The graphics are up to par and the community can be decent, sometimes. Regardless, I'd recommend it for people who want action on the get go."",1"
2774,Path of Exile,2013.0,If you were disappointed with Diablo III launch and want something that feels like a true Diablo II successor you must try this game out. Don't be put off by the fact that it's free to play because it's dozen times better than most free to play games in the market and it actually doesn't have pay to win in it. Great and complex Hack 'n' Slash Action RPG that gets improved all the time.,1
"2775,Path of Exile,2018.0,""This game has one of the best free to play money models of all I have ever tried! There is no need what so ever to buy anything from the shop, IF you want to support the developers because you like the game are there some nice skins or quality of life stash tabs but nothing gamechanging/breaking! Despite being free to play are they managing to bring out a new seasson every 3rd month, a seasson is like a game mode/mini dlc that is the main topic."",1"
"2776,Path of Exile,2016.0,""Good game, old client so it may take a long time for most computers to load to the character screen. The game play is similar to Diablo. Free to play and hugely customizable skill/talent tree."",1"
"2777,Path of Exile,2018.0,"" It's alright, to be honest.  Not very noob friendly. Many mechanics are confusing or not properly explained and need a wiki search or two to understand. To piggyback on the previous point, some mechanics seem purposefully obscure.Can be difficult to know what your build needs to progress or get better, and may find yourself relying on the community for help.Art community is great, some people are helpful about builds on the Subreddit, the official forums are prettyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ build guides are often inaccurate or misleading, and are """"updated for current patch,"""" despite lacking promised content from leagues ago such as videos clearing bosses or else. Vouch threads are useless, as no negative comments can be made. Can't really trust anything especially considering the ToS, scammers usually get their way, and you don't. If you want to look good, be prepared to pay lots of money. Nearly all of the ingame items have terrible ingame art that doesn't adjust properly to character model and size, does not fit with any other armour and clips through most things. In fact, even the MTX that costs some 40-60 dollars will only fit with its own pieces, and no mind is paid about how it interacts with other MTX, or ingame items. Fashion is very hard, and very pricey. After 4 years, and still there is no ability to save a preset of your Hideout, so you may spend dozens of hours designing your 'home' and won't be able to carry it over to the new league. (read more about leagues, interesting game design)All things considered, the game plays pretty well. I would avoid Hardcore, even if you like to play games for a challenge. I like playing on hardest settings, but for this game... most deaths are out of your control, and will cost you hundreds of hours of gameplay, worst case scenario."",1"
"2778,Path of Exile,2017.0,""If you like Diablo-likes, this one is free, and really good, so you should probably play it.Don't worry too much about the free2play aspect.  It's all cosmetics, and additional tabs for your stash (the place in town where you store items, if you're unfamiliar) and those stash tabs are cheap, and you probably won't even need more than what they give you anytime soon.It does a few interesting, different things from your typical Diablo-like.. For the most part, you'll feel like you're playing Diablo or Grim Dawn (atmosphere and much of the gameplay), or Torchlight 2 (gameplay).  Some of those different, interesting things are as follows:- The active skill system, which is similar to how Materia works in Final Fantasy 7.. your equipment has sockets on it, and you fit your skill gems into those sockets.  If there are link sockets, you can place 'support' gems in there and give the main skill additional effects, such as added [element] damage, piercing, turning that skill into a trap that you throw on the ground instead of one that you actively cast, etc..  It's a very neat way to help people build a character's skill set to make it their own, loads of possibilities.- The passives system, similar to Final Fantasy 10's sphere grid (does anyone else get the feeling that the Devs have played a lot of PS1/2-era final fantasy?). Again, if you're unfamiliar, I'll try to explain.  Every character class starts out somewhere on this large kinda boardgame-like matrix on the passive skill window.  This screen is full of these little nodes, connected by paths.  When you level up, or complete certain quests and get a skill book, you get a point to unlock a node.Each node grants something like more strength, intelligence, dexterity, health, mana, mana regeneration, attack speed, etc... There are also big nodes that usually grant several benefits at once, and/or a passive skill. You have to follow the branching paths from node to node around the board toward ones that you want to get.  You can even choose to build your path toward other parts of the board if you want some of the benefits of another character class (one of the character classes that you don't have access to early on starts smack-dab in the middle of the board, allowing them to branch out toward anything they desire.)- The bartering system.. This one's a little weird, but it's a pretty neat idea.  Basically, there is no 'gold' in this game, but there are certain items in the world that both serve a practical purpose, AND are used as currency to trade with NPC vendors.  For example, a Scroll of Wisdom is used to identify your special items, but it's also a form of currency.  These items are found in their whole form, and in fragmented form (the fragments automatically become a whole when you have enough of them).  When you sell stuff, you get these currency items (or at least fragments of them) instead of money, when you buy stuff, you spend them.  Want that Frostbolt skill gem?  It'll cost you one full scroll of wisdom.Anyway, if you like this type of game, there's really no reason not to try it.  It's free2play done right, because you can have a full, fun experience without spending a dime of real money... or you can deck yourself out in purple flaming armor, fairy wings, and glowing footprints.  That's up to you."",1"
"2779,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Extremely fun game, addcting and quite challenging. The way you can build your character is so cool. i really really really like this gameby the way, i found multiplayer kinda unatractive, but that's because my friends are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s anyway (and they stole my stuff)"",1"
"2780,Path of Exile,2017.0,""freeform rant review ahead:i mean, I don't really know what to say. the game is completely free, there isn't a single thing you can spend money on that gives you an advantage over anyone else. no other free2play game in existence of this AAA-esque quality can say this. Grinding Gear Games is not out for your wallet, they're out to make a good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game. and PoE is a good â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game. people â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and complain about the tiniest things: """"oh the character animations are slightly janky"""", """"the passive tree is too big"""", """"the start of the game is too slow"""". just play the game. it's hundreds of hours long before you even start to scratch the surface, I'm over 600 hours in and I only now feel like I have any idea what I'm doing.while other games relentlessly nickle and dime you for every godamn penny they can get out of you, PoE just keeps on giving. PoE is always there. I've come back to it dozens of times, and it always gives me a solid 100hrs+ each time, grabbing my total attention for weeks at a time as I irresponsibly stay up until 2am when I have work at 8am. D3 charged $20 for a single class and some other miscâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PoE just added 6 new acts, greatly expanding and streamlining the """"tutorial"""" part of the game (pre-endgame), and they're not done yet, all for free. this game started out as a buggy, laggy, indie game basically, and now it's a godamn masterpiece. it's come so far.you're doing yourself a great disservice as a PC gamer if you skip this game. I could go into the specifics, but there's really no need to. just play it, there's no cost to try it. do yourself a favor and stick with it for a while, the start is slow and can be overwhelming, but once you find yourself in the end game, 100+hrs in, with your skill gems, passive nodes, and equipment all clicking and turning you into a loot-farming ball of death, your understanding of what video game development is about will change forever.Chris Wilson, you're my hero"",1"
"2781,Path of Exile,2013.0,""PoE > D3This is a throw back to the Diablo 2 days of gameplay. Quick and to the point, just with better graphics and a more complex spell system. Totally worth checking out if you miss the old D2 days. And yes, definately worth playing over Diablo 3 IMHO. If you haven't paid for Diablo 3 yet, then check out Path of Exile, it just might convince you to save your hard earned money on a title worth paying for. Did I mention that Path of Exile is Free to Play?*note* 5 years after reviewing this every point still stands. Not only do I keep coming back to this game, but the content updates are also neverending. Still free, still good, still better than D3"",1"
"2782,Path of Exile,2018.0,""A fantastic game. Truly a modern wonder. It really is completely free.

"2783,Path of Exile,2018.0,""On my experience with this game - I tried the game around 2 years ago I think. At first, I found it very overwhelming to understand the mechanics of the game such as skill gems, support gems, equipment sockets and links for the gems, currency, what to do with the currency (crafting, trading etc.) as this was one of the first games that I have ever played that was like this And so I didn't really try to understand it and just played it and 'tried' to beat the game - It was fun ofcourse! UNTIL..... I progressed further through the game. The game content got more and more difficult and because with the lack of knowledge that I had on the game, I sucked lol..... and yep, I gave up after a few days of playing. Thennn, after a year or two, I started to give it another try and actually take my time to understand the mecahnics, and I started researching about things that I don't really understand. After with some knowledge about the game mechanics and such, I actually got better and I got really into the game. And since then, it has been my favourite game and it's been the game that I played the most hehe...But yeah, overall - In the begining it was overwhelming because of the amount of information and mechanics of the game... BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE GAME NOICE!!! A lot of things to do  in the game.. a lot.For the newbies out there, if you sucked like me - researching character/class builds really helped me alot, and also trying to understand the game content really helps too. (It may take time tho - only if you suck)"",1"
"2784,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Very much like Diablo 2 gameplay and graphics-wise. Playing solo is kinda boring, so try to find some friends that you know. They can probably improve the game by allowing a larger FOV since I like to see what I'm going to face. If you eff up your skills, you can probably wait for a major update and they will re-spec all your characters."",1"
"2785,Path of Exile,2018.0,""A big mistake people make when they try this game is that they quit before the game even starts. If you are willing to put some time into grinding through the base story (assuming you don't enjoy the story 6-10 hours) and learning about the layers of mechanics you will find your home in this game and developer. The developers are super hard working, innovative, and they actually listen to their community. With major content patches being released approximately every 3 months for FREE it is hard to see how any other game in the genre is able to compete.

GGG shows they really care about their players and the effort they put in to assembling new mechanics every season is very commendable.It's system allows you to customize and tailor a character to your liking and their is a lot of flexibility to adapt to your own playstyle.

That said, the longer you play and the more time you invest into this game, the more likely you will buy microtransactions to expand your stash, fancy up your exiles' outfits and more pretty decor for your hideout. However, I think it's a fair trade considering, again, this game is FREE and none of the microtransactions you purchase have any significant bearing on actual game play...a balance that bigger """"AAA"""" publishers with much larger budgets don't seem to understand.My one gripe (at time of review) is that exile voice acting and  NPC dialogue unique to each of the exile classes is absent from the Fall of Oriath onwards.

"2800,Path of Exile,2017.0,""My personal favorite ARPG. The leveling system is expansive allowing for a range of builds, naturally varying from the obscene and the useless up to the content destroyers. Featuring a great community and a fantastic dev team who are constantly trying to fix issues and interacting with their playerbase with huge updates every year adding new content. Furthermore the """"Unique"""" items which are rare item drops that have special properties are actually interesting and can even define new builds. Some are better suited for leveling but others add new mechanics that beautifully combine with the other skills available in the game. And to top it all off: It is free to play. The game does feature microtransactions, mainly purely cosmetic however it is definitely worth putting in a small bit of money to purchase additional stash tabs to relief some of the constant inventory management, especially if you have a tendancy to hoard everything. Nothing can be bought which will  'improve' your character, so no pay to win elements."",1"
"2801,Path of Exile,2013.0,""If your not playing this your missing out!  This is the best free to play game I've ever played.

The combat is fluid and varies greatly based on builds, the skill tree is out of this world diverse and can seem overwhelming but is worth the pay off.  If your a loot â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game will make you feel like a 16 year old girl getting asked to the senior prom.  Not only is the item system well thought out the progression is as good as any game i've played and will keep you grinding out whatever you can to get your hands on that new unique item.  The pvp however is pretty much not there.  It is available but hasn't caught fire yet so don't expect to jump into anything player vs. player.  The end game is fantastic and offers a map system to keep you coming back as far as I've made it.

"2805,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Been playing this game since 2014, little less than 4 years now, took a break during breach and prophecy league as I was playing other games. I never once doubted that GGG would keep developing a great game and trying it back during Closed beta, I knew that they would bring us an ARPG bringing us the D1 and D2 vibes that D3 failed to bring. Now sitting in 2018 I was glad I stuck with this game and supported them through buying supporter packs and mtx from the cash shop. For new players I believe that the games learning curve has gotten easier with the ammount of guides from the community and GGG's own little tutorial at the beginning of a new character. Although the curve to get into the game has gotten easier the challenge of earning currency, building a great character, and the endgame hasn't gotten any easier infact even harder. True POE has builds that make the game's content look like a joke and there will always be a meta, but the fun the game brings through running maps at endgame or simply leveling through acts 1-10 hasn't changed. I haven't always played on Steam as there was client issues in multiple leagues so my hours haven't all been on record but I will say I have atleast 3k+ total hours and counting in this game and plan on many more.If people are doubting whether the game is truly free to play look at other reviews, go into the game yourself or even just watch videos. The game is truly free, it bring no advantage to those who support the cash shop is strictly cosmetic and convenience. What I do recommend for a player willing to spend money in this game is catch the sales they have weekly and always buy on sale, they run multiple stash tab sales and you should only really buy when they are on sale unless you are 1st starting out. I highly recommend buying 1 currency tab, 1 quad tab, 1 map tab, and 1 premium tab. Essence, Divination, and Fragment tabs are pure convenience and really are only for those who truly want a tab for all the small things. If you cant spend 20$ on a game you can enjoy for hours at a time and can put down and comeback later and still find new content or continue on standard then you shouldn't be playing a f2p game at all.To close this wall of text, I recommend any new player who enjoys ARPG, and the d1 and d2 to try this game, if you are simply wanting to cure your itch for Lost Ark or whatever other new ARPG coming out in the future POE is a great way to do so. If you just simple enjoy ARPG and want a fair cash shop, crazy build customization, and hours of fun then download and start playing."",1"

"2808,Path of Exile,2016.0,""Pretty complex hack and slash RPG. You need a lot of time to figure out how game mechanics works. Definitely recommend for hardcore players, but if you want to play it casual, just look at the official forum and find some build first or you will get rekt for sure."",1"
"2809,Path of Exile,2018.0,""This is an ARPG for people who like to experiment with a huge variety of skills and builds. There are so many possible combinations that the mind boggles. Some good, some great, others.... not so good.It's the """"not so good"""" skills and combinations, and the initially slow pace and limited options in the early stages of the game that might put off new players, as you may progress so far into the game with a self-made build and find that it just doesn't tie up well with your choices in the vast passive skill tree. I'd highly recommend new players look up guides on builds on the PoE forums, or it could become frustrating when you realise that it'll be faster to start a new character from level 1 than to try and fix your current build. For this reason, it's totally understandable that some players just may not have the patience for such things, and dislike the game, and that's ok. High armour and life-based melee builds are a pretty good, easy to gear, starter option to get you to that end game, Sunder builds, for example, can be quite tanky and has a bit of range and AoE so is safe and can level quickly.That said, the game doesn't really get started until you've completed the story acts and gain access to the map device. Maps are where the end game begins, the toughest bosses live and best loot can be found. It's here that you'll begin to finalise your build and gear with the right crafting enchantments and ascendancy class, a branch of your main class that adds additional benefits and utility depending on exactly what you want from your build. You'll choose this class while progressing through the story, before even making it to maps, so choose wisely.In terms of game performance, an SSD is highly recommended and a good CPU, although there has been constant improvements over the years to particle effects and engine optimization which has helped greatly with reducing desync and reduced framerates when lots of skill effects are going off, though this can still be a problem when playing in groups.As a F2P game it is top notch, there are no pay-to-win microtransactions, everything available in the shop are purely cosmetic items to give your characters weapons, armour and skills a new look.New leagues with new mechanics and content are released every few months so there's always something to come back to, even if it's not your cup of tea THIS time, next league might have something you enjoy.Overall, considering my number of hours played, I have to recommend you try it for yourself."",1"

I dig it.- Well balanced. Of course there are things that are still arguable.- Plenty of choise. I mean PLENTY. You can build really crazy character that still doesn't suck even on third difficulty.- REAL free-to-play. No p2w. At all. Completely. Even char slot count and stash size are quite fine by default.- Game evolves over time. New skills/uniques/balance tweaks every month. Act 4 in development. All of this free of charge, of course :)CONS:- Desync. On third difficulty with 10% exp. death penalty it can be pretty annoying, particularly for the melee chars/classes. I won't be explaining this problem a lot here, just google it, there's plenty info out there."",1"

"2826,Path of Exile,2016.0,""Path of Exile is an interesting concept. An isometric dungeon crawler reminicent of games such as Titan Quest or Diablo. If you expected an actual, detailed review of the game you came to the wrong textbox. Reviewer's note:One should take into account that I only spent a few hours playing the game, hardly even bothering to take the time of day to make one single playthrough. Though do not let that discourage you from trying it out.Here is a quick summary for those, who like me, have no cash and want to try out a couple of F2P games. You constantly rerun the the same levels on increasingly higher difficulties, all the while aiming towards getting certain items and skill points for your insanely complex, copyed off some Youtuber's, build and amassing an insane amount of loot (downside: you have a finite amount of loot space which is shared with all your ingame characters, which can be increased through microtansactions). This leads to something called Loot-lock where one must technically transcend the F2P barrier. But by that point you should be pretty much well invested in the game.The game in my opinion is unique in the way that it offers a daunting amount of possible builds and character specifications, which i suppose allows for an interesting replay value for those of you who dig that sort of thing. The Highlight of this game is its stellar community. Nowhere have i met a more helpful, friendly and relaxed bunch of nerds who are ready to help you get started and enjoy your new found path of exile (from society).All in all this game is well developed and by far one of most unique and grindable F2Ps on Steam. Just not my type of game :) "",1"
"2827,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Played it for a couple hours to give it a try even tho I kinda dislike mmos with """"builds"""" because you usually end up wasting time and getting a bad character on your first try and are forced to follow some sort of path to be a regular jack and I cant say this game isnt fun but after some research I eventually found out it's kinda not viable to get to the level cap because it takes like 1,7k hours .If you're in for the fun of just clicking and seeing a million of mobs exploding this is what you're looking for, give it a try. If you like to get to max level on your mmo's  to start upgrading your gear and pvping it's not worth the time/money investment."",1"
"2828,Path of Exile,2015.0,""I am old as dirt, have played this game 4k+ hrs. It still fells new with every new char, every new challenge league.

Play it with friends, new or old, preferably over Skype or Teamspeak.Join a guild if your old friends don't get it, or make your own guild and invite people you find nice in the game.  The community is mostly very nice. Immature (not young-age has nothing to do with it) or cocky players tend to quit, cause the learning treshold is quite high. Be nice ingame, and you will get all the help you need. Global chat can be a way to meet other players (or get trolled if you are unlucky), or just throw in some questions if you trade.To summarise: PoE is a game that never gets old. Frustrating as hell sometimes, for sure, but never boring."",1"
"2829,Path of Exile,2017.0,""To start on a positive note, Path of Exile takes the Diablo formula and expands on it in every single way possible. It has an incredibly complex crafting, leveling and gear progression system, which is growing and becoming more intricate with every single update and hasn't been matched by any other game in the genre to this date. The music is excellent, the environments are alluring and the lore is fascinating, but what brings the game down is a staggering amount of well documented technical issues that plague it, ranging from poor optimization to server stability. The servers simply cannot handle prime time, especially after the release of the new expansion. And since this is a free to play game, making server stability a priority is clearly not in the cards for the developers. It's completely understandable from a business standpoint"
"2830,Path of Exile,2014.0,""A great MMO with a dark atmosphere throughout. Similar to Diablo in many ways but the differences are there that set the two apart. The game's difficulty makes you want to keep playing and leaves you feeling rewarded. There are several different classes to choose from, however, any class can learn any of the game's skills and spells through a skill gem system. Although, certain classes are recommended to use certain skill types"
"2831,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Never got into ARPG like Diablo, haven't played a game like it. There's quite the learning barrier when you first start up.

I like it... remind me of Warframe when it's intense Defense 50 round no stop."",1"
"2832,Path of Exile,2018.0,""It can have some very frustrating downs over time, but this game continues to show growth and excellent gameplay that I've always wanted. It can be very intimidating with the learning curve, and the late part of the game will quickly punish any build not up to snuff. Because of such, I do recommend reading build guides that help explain how and why things work as they do. Going in completely blind doesn't always teach a person if they don't know what it is that they're doing wrong.Years in and it's still getting massive content updates for free to all of the players. Makes it worth supporting them with a supporter pack and using the points for stash tabs to make the gameplay a bit more for us hoarders. Also helps with keeping your valuable items and currency in check. Just make sure to wait for a stash tab sale that they always have at least once a month. Never buy an item that's not on sale with the MTX store. I love the game, but the MTX can be very pricey once you convert the price to point ratio and find out that a hat costs you ten dollars. Best to just buy supporter packs for what they offer to support leagues you want to promote, or sets you want to collect, and use the leftover points for stash tabs and stuff on sale when you think you have enough."",1"

Backed by a team of faithful indie developers in New Zealand, Path of Exile boasts bragging rights of being by far the best ARPG to give you full control of your character's custom skills, traits, and abilities through gear selection, the ridiculously massive passive skill tree, and wide array of skill selections. The endgame is addicting as hell, always motivating you to push you character farther and farther with improved gear. You make your own goals, and quickly find yourself grinding hours at a time hooked on just how far you can push you character into the endless possibilities.

This game is pretty awesome in it's own right, but while they come from a similar mold, the two games are as different as night and day. I think both are good, personally, but what makes this game really amazing, is the outstanding value. This game gives everything you would expect from a triple A developer. Literally. Just gives it to you. Nothing that is sold in the stores is in any way going to help you win the game, unlock content that is needed, or give you a special edge in the game. It's a full on retail value game, literally, for free. Play it all you like. Make up to 24 characters. Have a huge shared stash by default. I'm going to end up supporting this game eventually when I get the money. Not because I have to, but because I want to. This game makes you WANT to pay for it, because it's freaking awesome.

GGG offer AAA content for FREE. That's just insane. Playing this game and not supporting the developers is a sin. As far as action RPG's go, this is a 9.5/10"
"2846,Path of Exile,2016.0,""PoE is the perfect example of RNG done very wrong, even for an ARPG.I still play for a little while after each expansion, but I always quit for months at a time waiting for the next, because they never fix the biggest problems with the core game.I only recommend it if you enjoy mindlessly grinding the same stale content for hundreds of hours to brute-force abysmal RNG while making no meaningful progress.This game has the potential to be amazing, but GGG's stubbornness about insane RNG-gated design coupled with the mentally ill community crying when somebody has too much fun will not let that potential be met.Progression is a chore. A ton of builds are not viable as the game continues to be balanced around the top 0.01% that have absolutely no life with min-maxed everything. Crafting gear you want is borderline impossible. Level 100 items can still get level 1 roll tiers. Countless build-enabling unique items are very inaccessible. Respeccing your passive skills is very expensive and this is exactly the kind of game where you want to be experimenting as much as possible with the passive tree. Trading is inconvenient and all manual. Most endgame content is gated behind pure RNG. No damage numbers, death logs or recaps in any way, which makes understanding what's going on significantly harder. Inconsistent enemy balance. Extremely overpriced MTX with no way to refund or trade in to get points back. It's impressive that GGG is able to put out big updates every few months, but they never fix the numerous core issues with the game, or they make them worse by balancing around no-life players. I could write a novel about what's wrong with this game from a design standpoint, but that's just more time wasted to PoE. If you want to do any endgame content without wasting countless hours, you'll most likely have to buy your way to it, which isn't how it should be designed at all. Good luck getting anything done in SSF.It's free(except for stash tabs that are absolutely necessary), that's great, but if you want to slave away on boring tasks, you can go get a job that pays you to do that, then you can buy more engaging games."",0"

The massiveness of the game and the constant updates from GGG makes this game allways fresh.GGG has created originality in the sense of there desire to keep inflation out of the game economy which they have done by making every item in the game a currency in itself. Skills are items you find and use in sockets which means skills is a tradeable currency to.Every skill can get enhanced by support gems you link to them, as an excample fireball linked with chain making the fireball chain between targets. There are a lot of different gems and a lot of different ways to combine em. and deserves a try from all gamers out there.You can play this as a casual player, or as a hardcore player that desires the competive scene.At the first glanse of the skill tree in this game it might seem that you will never learn it, but in my oppinion it is far from as hard as people make it to be.Events are being created runningly to keep the game exciting besides the new leagues that last for longer periods at a time. With every new league they create new prices for both the hardcore racers and the casual players that just want to get the achivements or challenges to earn a price.Path of exile has gotten some critisisme for the famours """"Desyncs"""" since the release.With the version 2.0 on the door step GGG has made an official statement they are adding a new network model to the game to fix the issue it has caused for some players.On a more personal note on that matter, i have died to em myself but over my hours of path of exile i have learned to avoid the desyncs you can cause in the game, so for me the desyncs is not a problem anymore. But i understand it can be an annoying factor for some players.A quote from GGG themselves:Wraeclast is a dark, brutal continent. Scarred by mysterious catastrophes of the past and inhabited by creatures of nightmare, the very environment challenges exiles who dare explore it.We're sick of the recent trend towards bright, cartoony RPGs. The art style we chose for Path of Exile is dark, gritty and realistic. Wraeclast is terrifying, and we've tried hard to do it justice.In Path of Exile, replayability is key. All world areas including outdoors ones are instanced for your party and randomly generated, right down to the magic properties of the monsters that dwell in them and the treasure they guard.I coulden agree more.

"2860,Path of Exile,2015.0,""â˜… â˜… â˜… â˜… -POE is a great newer spin on the old 3rd person overhead view rpg games, and also you can scroll in and out to view your char closer or farther away which is nice. If you ever played Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction or Diablo 3 then this is the perfect free to play rpg game for you, thats right lol this game is one of many that gets to hold the illustrious title of """"D2 Clone"""".P.S. I ran a 2.10 Ghz single core processor and ati radeon mobility 4200 with 320MB and i could run it alright but it was kinda laggy so hopefully that helps everyone rate whether they can run it or not.

"2861,Path of Exile,2018.0,""This game is pretty good. I've been playing Diablo since it came out, and Path of Exile just blew my mind at first. The ammount of costumization compared to Diablo is insane. True classic hardcore gameplay in which you can do whatever you want with your class of choice. Itemization and gem system are also insanely customizable. It's like a dream come true for someone that have been in a """"cage"""" (Diablo 3) for some years. Huge amount of little mechanics that keeps your head busy for a long time while you're playing the story. Also at this point there's already much more story content: 10 Acts with incredibly varied storylines and distinct artstyle for each world region. I love Diablo but PoE is on a whole another level entirely. This is easily the new standard of modern ARPG. Now for the cons:- Huge letdown is that microtransactions are way too effin expensive, if you're outside US. They've simply converted their DLC store from US dollars to whatever currency it's used in your country, so if my currency is like 1:4 USD, I'm f-ed. A set of skin in this game is worth more than 1 month minimum wage salary here. I don't care about skins but other stuff are needed to play this game confortably, like stash tabs. I can't take this game seriously if I know I won't be able to keep my sanity in the long term. The game is good, but food and housing comes first.- Trade system is archaic, to say the least. I know they're trying to replicate Diablo 2 nostalgia here, but its a process that aged very poorly. The game absolutely need an in game full fledged market system. I'm glad there's any trade at all, but I often want to quit the game just because trading is so cumbersome. You have to pm people, hope that they're online and wait for replies that almost never come."",1"

The core difference being that GGG is constantly talking with the community and popping out new content FOR FREE.The cash shop is on the pricey side - but it's purely cosmetic / stash tabs. Uniquely packed with plenty of different cosmetics and even different types of stash tabs for QoL use.Highly recommend if you want an ARPG to sink your time into, but if you're not into hours of Grinding for gear and currency, i suggest clicking away."",1"
"2871,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Path of Exile is an ARPG that has the highest level of character customization I've ever seen. Within the seven classes, there are at least a couple hundred builds that are fundamentally different and VIABLE.--------The game is Free to Play, and NOT Pay to Win. You will likely end up dropping $15-30 for quality of life features, but those are completely unnecessary before your first 50 hours of having fun.However, not only the playstyles of characters vary a lot, but the way enemies try to defeat you as well. The game progressively introduces concepts such as rogue exiles, enemies that use group skills, auras, shrines, ghosts haunting bosses, blood magic etc. that keep raising the difficulty while keeping it skill, and not gear-dependent.In the endgame, players often find themselves making dozens of actions/decisions per second, dodging different projectiles, spells and charging monsters, using flasks, teleporting, modifying auras, applying curses in order to stay alive. Not only there are a lot of things to do once the main storyline is complete (after about 20 hours for a new player, another 10 hours if you want to read the in-depth lore), but simply fighting diverse endgame bosses is an exhilarating challenge in itself."",1"

The game is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing HUGE with tons of challenges.  You will not be grinding the cow level or doing baal run after baal run for the best loot that the game has to offer.

From the gigantic passive tree, to the crazy combination of gems you can make or how certain unique items completely change how some skill works... It's so amazing at letting you be creative and come up with ways to grow your character! And then the world of wreaclast is just amazing to explore, lots of lore and a very grim and dark setting reminding of the best parts of diablo 1. The soundtrack is incredible as well.Hand down my favorite diablo like and one of my fave games of all time, and it's truly free (money only gives cosmetics and inventory management help). The few cons - you cant turn the camera, meaning its best to attack enemies from the south when you're a long range hero. -Self Founds will have a hard time progressing in the end game.- Act 2 is unfortunately pretty boring compared to the rest of the game."",1"

"2890,Path of Exile,2014.0,""My review for this game back in 2014 was extremely positive when it first came around. Now in 2018 I decided to re:review this messy messy game. Unfortunately POE has gotten worse with every release of new content. Kinda the opposite of what you would think would happen right. In the first year of the game being released it was very fun to play with excellent balance of difficulty, slightly complicated socket system but amazing when you finally digested it. Then...................they F'ked with it. Every time new content was released they would up the difficulty level and completely destroy builds that were very fun and effective but still challenging as you continued. Eventually it got to the point where there was no use in exploring any of the new content because it was all """"cow level"""" one hit death stuff. Remember the secret cow level in Diablo 2? Pointlessly accessible early in the game but impossible to do until you've reached a super high level and have been through the game 3 times over. Absolutely pointless content because it is not ever even close to doable when you come across it.This game pretty much exclusively caters to hardcore super grind style players who enjoy statistic/stats minutiae hell. Despite its vast depth, Path of Exile just isn't fun to play if you are a casual gamer. Try Diablo 2/3 or Torchlight 2.

They definitely have brainstorming sessions for how to come up with new items and even categories of items to add to the game. this way they can sell you a new card tab, and an essence tab, etc.They have lost sight of what made the game good. It went from a game with the best loot to one of the worst. 99% of items that drop are now garbage. It is bad enough that they expect people to buy more and more tabs to deal with their hyper inflation of item types and categories, but they don't even care that we also have to sort all this junk.Do they realize that they are making the game tedious? Even if I was filthy rich, and I could buy 10,000 tabs, why would I want to sort that many items?!?! This utter disrespect for the time of their customers, just so they can make as much money as possible, has earned them this negative review.Strawberry fields forever... because: greed.original review several years ago: the true diablo 2, because it understood the best part of diablo 2: how to make the powerful armor/weapons feel distinct and their effectiveness and useability unique and not just different numerical values. amazing game, until you reach end game. then you start to see how the free to play model does actually influence gameplay design and how the player is expected to become a gambler and hoarder to continue enjoying the game (inventory space = $$). however, the game is free and the skill system gives you hundreds (thousands?) of hours of nerd or-ga-sm-ic (don't censor this volvo, because that makes it unintelligible) experimentation with new characters, so i must recommend it."",0"
"2892,Path of Exile,2015.0,""Thank you for erasing the build I have put, actually, too much thought into.  I will be reclaiming all 15 GB of space this game has taken up.  The aggravation this game has given me has finally broke the camel's back.  Goodbye."",0"
"2893,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Go big or go home.PoE is, at its core, all about RNG. RNG loot drops are the core game mechanic. As one person put it """"Fighting loot, finding monsters."""" The game has plenty to recommend it: great graphics, inspiring sound & music, a deep meta game whereby the number of possible character builds is nearly endless, great customisation and the best MTX system I've yet seen in a game where 95% of all items that can be purchased with real money are purely cosmetic in nature. The other 5% are quality of life items that do not in any way make PoE pay to win. This is how all game companies should do microtransactions.My problem with PoE is that the nature of the RNG systems means that actually useful items are *incredibly* rare. The entire game economy appears to be designed with the 1% twitch broadcasters in mind who play thousands of hours of PoE & nothing else. That's fine, but it essentially locks an actually significant amount of the game content behind difficulty walls that can only be breached by spending huge amounts of time playing. If like me you have very limited gaming time between real life stuff, work, family etc then I would seriously recommend that you will likely only find frustration in this game and you should look elsewhere. My ~500 hours (at the time of writing) have been accumulated over the past 5 years.If you're willing to put in the time the sheer range of possibilities that PoE offers, and the deep meta game are very rewarding and for these players PoE is the best ARPG available. If however you have limited gaming time or play casually then don't bother, you're not the target audience for this game unfortunately.Would I recommend PoE? Yes, but only because I enjoy playing with my friends. This is not a game that I play solo because the sheer size of the mindless grind to get the best gear is frankly unbelievably boring."",1"
"2894,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Fun game occassionally. But the game is really really unbalanced. Some parts are just way too easy and all you have to do is spamming random keys, and then suddenly the next boss just oneshots you and you can't do anything about it. Also running around on the maps and having to kill never ending masses of weak enemies gets more annoying than fun real quick."",0"
"2895,Path of Exile,,""of Exile is a better Diablo 2 sequel which Blizzard wish they would have developed it.""""Diablo 3 is a better """"Action""""rpg and have a stylized, cartoony look.Path of Exile is a better action""""RPG"""" and have gritty, dark but dated graphics.PoE: A character can be anything and is no one.

D3 is still expensive with all the DLCs and have a casual or even shallow end-game.Looking for a well polished, hack n slash game : D3Looking for Diablo 2 on steroids : PoE."",1"
"2896,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Honestly, I love many parts about this game... but I can't overlook a couple things about it.  TLDR: Path of Exile does not value your time.  If you have a carreer, or family, or anything else in your life, PoE is not made for you.  You would have to spend thousands of hours to get to play all the way through the game, and that is horrendous in my opinion.  A game should be fun, challenging, and rewarding.  Forcing people to pull the lever on a slot machine is not real difficulty.  Their main goal is to keep the carrot danging in front of you, and you will never, ever, find the game you want.  It's all about the chase, and at the end you will have nothing to show for it.What I love:1) The customization is super deep and very enjoyable.2) There are lots of activities to grind and feel like you are making progressWhat I hate:1) You will have to trade.  Other players will do their best to rip you off.  It is a job to become knowledgable about the market so that you can properly price and trade items, but investing hours pouring over pages of item prices won't make you good at it.  Some people play this game for the """"economy"""" and enjoy trading and becoming stupid wealthy... to them I say fine.  Enjoy flipping currency and buying out items to inflate prices.  I will go play SSF... except you will never find the items you need, and you can't craft endgame items for a targeted build.  So either learn to love poe.trade or play a different game.  Hint: play a different game.2) Crafting is so absurdly expensive that you should never try it.  It is deep, but you will blow every single currency item you have before you see the item of your dreams.  You may be able to accidently craft something other people could use, but then you have to find out what it's worth and trade it.  Or play SSF, and never see the great items you want to make your obscure builds work.3) Gating content behind RNG... So Breaches spawn randomly, and then they drop a random number of shards, and then when you finally get 100 (could take 15-50 breaches.. no joke sometimes they drop 2), the Breach boss has an RNG chance to drop a unique item.  They don't have to drop, which is suppperr frustrating.  Took me months to finall run a breach and Xoph dropped nothing.  Was crushing.  In SSF I can't just run it again...Another example is uber atziri.. I've never fought her.  I map fragments drop randomly, and there is no recepie to trade them up.  So you will be waiting for midnight fragments to randomly drop... then Atziri has a random chance to drop fragments for her more difficult version... and again you will never get the rare fragment you need.  Another example is Shaper.. I have never fought him because I can't get the maps to drop in order to fight him.  I have played over 1000 hours in SSF and still i'm missing some of the shaper fragments.  Sustaining tier 15's is impossible.  I can sustain 11-12's but past that it is random that if you get the maps you need.  The more maps you finish the LESS likely the map you need will drop.  Infuriating as all hell.  Never fought uber elder or even Red spawn elder... not because I can't kill it, but because I can't get the maps to drop to kill his guardians.Why are prophecies weighted by rarity?  You will get the same 10 prophecies that do nothing over and over again.  You will never see the ones that you find exciting.  Plagues of frogs and lost maps forever.  Smothering tendrils? ughSo Basicallllyy... It is a cluster of RNG on top of RNG.  It's a slot machine, and all the """"skill"""" in the world won't help you.4) Party play sucks.  People just rip through maps in this game.. like literally a whole map (like 40 screen widths) in about 2 minutes, then rush through the next one.  The game is balanced around this and you have to go that fast to see profit.. there isn't a way to go slow in a dangerous map and see the same returns.  It's all about easy maps as fast as possible.  You will feel like people pulling you through the whole game.  This game has to be tuned down so that the pace is more reasonable, then they could retune the drops to also be more reasonable.Another problem with party play is the sheer number of sparkly things and circles and rings and projectiles.  It's is impossible to see what is going on.  Generally everything is dead the second you see it, but if it's not you wouldn't be able to tell.If you love this game, I could understand why, but don't pretend you love these parts of it.  These are fixable problems if there is the community will to have them fixed.  If you don't think over a thousand hours is a long time to play a game, I think you have an addiction.  I am an avid gamer, but there has to be bounderies on what is reasonable to expect your players to do in order to progress.   Hope they fix it"",0"
2897,Path of Exile,2017.0,What can be said about this game that hasn't already been said....nothing really but here goes nothing! It's kinda a Diablo 2 clone but does have its own original gamestyle.

"2900,Path of Exile,2014.0,""I have completed most Endgame content as of 3.1. Including solo Shaper (a bunch of times) and solo uber Atziri (once), I've played on and off since closed beta. I have spent quite some money on this game.I gave this game a positive review back in 2014 and I have since then changed my mind. MicrotransactionsOkay, let's face it: the microtransactions are pay to win now (and they have always been pay to win). People who pay money get disproportionate storage space - especially for currency, maps, and essences. When you hit the lategame - your stash will clog up. Please don't deny this fact.Temp leaguesI like the idea of temp leagues (last a bunch of weeks, fresh economy, fresh start for everyone). They're great. You get challenges, you run around and complete them, some special gimmick is introduced as well - fun all around. You progress through the game, you get various gear, you go to weird and beautiful places. All good. However, this doesn't work well with the main issue I have with the game.The main issueThe developers have realised that variation is core to keeping this game fresh...... and the main component that does not get enough variation is your player character.The issue is that when you hit the late-game your character usually does one or two things to deal with combat. It usually runs some auras, an attack skill (maybe two?), and some movement skills. These setups are extremely hard to change as you need to revamp your passive skill tree - something which costs ingame currency. You are essentially encouraged to specialise into one particular thing and not do anything else on that character. Unplanned characters generally do not work in the lategame.I'm going to draw some comparisons to Warframe now (yes, I know, Warframe is blatantly pay to win).In Warframe you are encouraged to mix your playstyle up. You level up by using different kind of gear and characters. You are encouraged to build everything and try it. Getting a new character may at times take a while, but mostly - you can generally get a new character ready to play in one hour of playtime + 3 days of wait if you're in the lategame. A game for the patient, but you don't need a plan to start playing with the character. You just use it and then later on you can optimize. There's obviously some characters that are better than others, but generally speaking, things are open to change and you can experiment without too much cost. You can re-use weapons and components (mods) across characters as well.Contrast this to Path of Exile: you get one skill tree per character, if you want another one you first need to hit the lategame with a character (takes maybe.. 8 hours or so?), followed by many hours spent getting gear for it, getting through the lategame and that gives you one new setup that you can use.If you want to change things up you have to spend a lot of time getting another character essentially, spend a bunch of currency on orbs of regret to respec an existing character, or use Path of Building and try to imagine what it would be like. Also, there's no practical re-use between characters as each item has to be physically moved to that character.My general suggestion would be to at least allow characters to change their skill tree and ascendancy at any given time or have several passive tree setups that you can swap between while in a town (say 3-5 different trees). Before you say """"I'm so hardcore I don't need additional trees or any reallocation like that because I plan ahead!"""" - is it worth it though? Consider that newbies will get confused by the passive tree and make the wrong decisions at some point - which means that they will possibly quit the game forever when they hit the lategame as their characters are in a worthless state. It ultimately harms the game and makes it less fun for most people. Heck, why not have a separate league where reallocation is allowed? I would probably start playing the game again if that was introduced.(edit: newbies hitting the lategame and then just quitting due to their characters being bad does happen, I've spoken to some)ConclusionWhile I would highly recommend trying the game to see what a F2P diablo-like looks like, the core issue of a lack of variation in the character itself kills it for me in the long run. Find a build on the forums that people say are good and use that if you want to play it."",0"

"2902,Path of Exile,2014.0,""Path of exile is by far the most riveting and intriguing game I have ever played.  Through the variations of character selection and weapon/armor  types it is just absolutely superior to all other games.  Through my career of working for Riot games I have earned the opportunity to play and help design many variations of video games.  I truly believe that no other game compares to this one.  Path of exile is a game that you will not soon forget and will not easily get bored of. Path of exile leads you to many hours of action packed game play.  From the start of the game you are immediately thrown into action as you wash up on the shore and you find that everyone is dead around and you are surrounded by flesh eating zombies as well as many other creatures.  You have to fight your way through the unforgiving world as you collect new weapons, armor, stones, wands, and many other achievable items.

"2906,Path of Exile,2018.0,""Whenever I decide to go back to Path of Exile, I remember the good old days when I didn't have any income whatsoever, but was just so excited by the thought of playing those few games I could! Path of Exile was one of those games. If my memory serves me correctly, I have upwards of 200 hours logged in this ARPG.  Each update added a new layer to the complexity of the game. For a new player, the complexity was something that initially pushed me away. Just take a moment to look up """"Path of Exile Passive Tree"""" and you will get a good idea of what I mean. It is (or was) easy to make a character that had such poorly allocated stats that it was very difficult to progress. Perhaps that is (or was) a part of its charm. You have to figure out what skill gems, equipment, support gems, passive tree configurations, and (if you were so lucky as to get a relevant one) unique items would serve you best. Finally claiming success in beating all of the acts for the first time brought me a feeling that I would claim rivals beating a Dark Souls game for the first time. I have not caught up with the community, but in my experience, it can be quite toxic. I recommend trying it out with personal friends or alone, rather than a random party. That being said, it is absolutely viable to play on ones own, and that is was I did before I figured out how to properly navigate the initially confusing UI. Definitely need an open mind when trying this one out."",1"
