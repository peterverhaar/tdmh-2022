I was always checking in on the Starbound dev blog when one day I came across this game's forum. I checked that forum every week from when I discovered in 2014 (I think) to when the game was released on Steam in 2016. I bought the game day one, spending the entire weekend playing Stardew Valley. At the time, there were no wikis, no guides, no walkthroughs. There was no maximally efficient system to play the game with... there was just the game. My original playthrough is like nothing I can possibly describe - the extreme stress of making it back to bed before 2:00AM or getting through watering all my crops without running out of energy contrasted with the absolute ease of fishing or just walking around and listening to one of the greatest video game soundtracks of all time is just awe inspiring. Stardew Valley really has the highest highs and the lowest lows that the medium can offer. All that and the game was coded, graphically designed, and soundtracked by ONE PERSON. The gameplay is bar none the greatest of all time. The combat is solid, the farming is better than I ever could have  asked for, the economy of the game is well balanced while leaving multiple avenues to success and not just one optimized solution. The progression system is rewarding, the lore of the game is exciting to find and uncover, and the villagers make for interesting background pieces in a game focused on being a simple farmer. Every little detail in the game seems to be crafted perfectly, as if ConcernedApe left absolutely no stone unturned in the creation of this timeless classic. And yet the game is STILL getting free content updates and was later updated to include seamless multiplayer. When I say that this game is GOATED I mean that this game is absolutely GOATED. If you haven't played the game and enjoy video games in any sense of the word, pick this game up. If you hate video games and think that having fun is a sin, still pick up this game so that ConcernedApe's next title is just as much of a masterpiece.","timestamp_created":1648176472,"timestamp_updated":1648176472,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113155793","author":{"steamid":"76561198361109415","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":107,"playtime_last_two_weeks":107,"playtime_at_review":30,"last_played":1649333330},"language":"english","review":"I already played this game with game pass.\nThis game is literally on another level 10/10","timestamp_created":1648803040,"timestamp_updated":1648803040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560293138027191162","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"113118409","author":{"steamid":"76561198996619436","num_games_owned":42,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":3121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":552,"playtime_at_review":2959,"last_played":1648998454},"language":"english","review":"Add sex","timestamp_created":1648736845,"timestamp_updated":1648736845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558680891990661621","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112618670","author":{"steamid":"76561198042308537","num_games_owned":428,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":24615,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":24441,"last_played":1648161080},"language":"english","review":"Krobus and I have entered an uneasy alliance against women.","timestamp_created":1647906032,"timestamp_updated":1647906032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558232903480529785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"112859466","author":{"steamid":"76561198043658305","num_games_owned":215,"num_reviews":15,"playtime_forever":6595,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":6595,"last_played":1612480271},"language":"english","review":"TL;DR\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☑ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☑ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☑ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☑ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☑ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Significant brain usage\n☐ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☑ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☐ No Story\n☑ Some lore\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☑ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☑ Worth the price\n☐ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☑ Never heard of\n☐ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☐ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☑ 10\n\nThis game is a God send for casual players, I'll tell ya.

You can even marry the character of your dreams and have children with them. All the characters have their own story, and you can really vibe with them. The characters in the game are good, in the sense that they hit that \"realism\" where you can connect with the characters and maybe even think of a couple of people in their life that are just like them. They all have their own schedules as well. \n\nThere are seasons in the game and you can upgrade your farm with husbandry, coops, etc. You can go into a dungeon and just adventure. \n\nIt even vibes well as a multiplayer game. One time a group of us were playing and I wanted to be a fisherman so I only fished, another friend was a dungeon crawler, and the third friend was the farmer. We all turn our stuff in to sell/collect at the end of the in-game day, and whenever we're all ready we just progress. It's all chill and wholesome af. \n\nLiterally anyone can play this game. This is also a great way to get the older generation into video games if they never played games before.\n\nDid I mention this was made by one person?

It's especially annoying when you want to explore the mines, as you can't go too far without running out of energy. When you run out of energy, you pass out, lose money (someone robs you) and then you wake up in your house the next day.\n\nThis limiting factor seeps into the entire gameplay where you will always nervously watch the time and energy meter, making sure that you're back in your house before it gets too late, and this ruins the freedom to explore and fun factor for me.\n\nThere's also a FOMO factor in that if you miss f.ex. an event or someone's birthday, you lost some potential progress and/or rewards.\n\nThe controls are a bit too clunky and inaccurate for my taste.\n\nOn the plus side, there's a lot of choice in the game, there are many varied activities, the pixel art is great and the music is allright.\n\nIf you're a completionist or perfectionist, I don't recommend this game. You have to pick and choose what activities to focus on, and you will always miss out on some things.
