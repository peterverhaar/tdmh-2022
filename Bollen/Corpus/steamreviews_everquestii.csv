"25471,EverQuest II,2014.0,""its okay, but not great, thats just it. It has so much potential as a free to play game, but you cant play free unless you are in a clan. tradeing is limited, and thus so is your ability to play free. you can not buy krono if youre a free player, and you can not sell things on the auctionhouse to get the plat for krono. if you can see past limitations and want a good game to explore, this game is for you.the crafting system is a nice feature, though the sounds may put you to sleep as it is very relaxing.overall, the game is more of a 7/10 for what it has to offer, but bear in mind that you can expect some pretty steep limitations if you just want to play free.update: I dont know what the hell happened but the game is now riddled with bugs. you are officially better off playing runescape!"",0"
"25472,EverQuest II,2014.0,""EDIT (2/1/15): I just found out about something called heroic characters. This is a great feature for where EQ2 is in its lifetime. It allows you to pay to get a level 90 character of any class/race along with appropriate gear and 320 alternate advancement points. You don't have to pay to try out any race/class combination. There is a try before you buy option which lets you play for as long as you want with that class at level 85, but once you reach level 86 the character becomes locked.Since the strong point of the game was always the classes as I stated in my initial review I think this is a great opportunity to give EQ2 a try. You'll be able to experience a lot of different classes and explore a lot of the world. I plan to play this off and on until EQ Next just to see some of the lore and great locations the game has to offer. I am changing my initial review. I definitely recommend jumping in and just exploring and trying out the different classes for free at level 85. I'll continue to post updates to this review on what I actually think of the content.Original Review (6/21/14):EverQuest 2, the sequel to the best MMORPG of all time. For me this game came out at a bad time because I was still heavily into EverQuest 1 so when I first played it I found it so different that it made it hard to like it. It just didn't feel like EverQuest"
"25473,EverQuest II,2016.0,""Played this game back in 2004 on release. Saw it on steam under daybreak instead of SOE and gave it a try with it being free to play which it is. Levelup much easier and with dungeon/group finder it is quick to hop in and do something fun. Just working on a character from 1 to max or where you need to buy a pass/subscription which is only actually needed for the end game material. With as much fun as I've had when I get to that point I will get the extra pass. I wish more people would play this because it is the most content and fun filled free to play game I have found on steam. Have a friend to get to level 20 with and then the game really gets going. Still fun, and for someone new like the friends I play this with the game has plenty of tips and shows the new things going on and how to play. If anything this is at least worth a try. It's free for countless hours if you do end up enjoying it."",1"
"25474,EverQuest II,2016.0,""this is the sequel to the first big 3d mmorpg and i really like it. its part of that world of warcraft generation of mmoÃ‚Â´s much like lotro,rift and wow, but with alot of elements that i wished wow had back then player housing tons of spells and such while wow ditched so much. this game is fantasy turned up to 11"",1"
"25475,EverQuest II,2016.0,""I have been playing Everquest 2 for a few months.  I really enjot this game, even though some of the featues in the free to play  environment are not available until you purchase into the game, but you can still play.  Irs really fun."",1"
"25476,EverQuest II,2013.0,""VERY addicting, the free trial is great for getting to know the game, after which purchasing silver membership is cheap and well worth the little it cost. I buy extra character slots, races, classes and whatever i want , when i want it, instead of paying monthly and it works out very well for me. (there are ofcourse up-sides to get higher membership but not needed)"",1"
"25477,EverQuest II,2015.0,""One of the largest and by far the most versatile of the mmorpg's on the market.  Since having left EverQuest for EverQuest II, this has been my home that always calls me back from my visits to other games."",1"
"25478,EverQuest II,2012.0,""if you like a game with a likeable community, a never ending world, and a lot of classes with lots of dfferent kinds of skills. Then you will love EverQuest 2, I personly have over a 100 hours in this game."",1"
25479,EverQuest II,2015.0,I like EQ2 alot because of the shear depth of things to do to develop your character.  Not simply levels and gear like in some games with 3 letters!  AB is the server to play on if you want lots of people FYI.,1
"25480,EverQuest II,2015.0,""I've been playing for 10 years and recommend this game to any serious MMORPG fan.  The graphics and engine may seem outdated to some, but the vast amount of content makes up for it."",1"
"25481,EverQuest II,2015.0,""Great MMO that is fun for the whole family. I grew up playing this and have fond memories of it. Though I advise players not to get overly involved in guilds to the point where it's like a cult taking away all of your free time. That's why my family stopped playing on Butcherblock server. We took a few years off until the game showed up on steam, then we re-envested our time into making our own guild on a new server. I do like the economic set up of the game, execpt that some items wont always be on the broker when you want it. I recomened the game to people who have the time to invest themselves in it."",1"
"25482,EverQuest II,2015.0,""dear creatorss of everquest 2, this game is a very awesome adicting game that you can almost never beat because of its updates that always bring great amounts of joy. even though it is a tiny bit slow on my windows 8 it is still very fun and adicting. i am going around  and comenting on all the games that i own on steam while vindictus downloads. as i was saying this game has a lot of potential with hard bosses easy control mechanics fun exploration and a lot of skeltons laghing. sorry for the typos but i have to do this rather quickly. sincerely mm9136"",1"
"25483,EverQuest II,2014.0,""EQ 2 is a cut above with all the tweeks and changes made in response to player feed back.  This game is truely a spectacular MMO that feels similar to the way EQ1 made me feel when I logged in day one in March 1999.  It is to this day the only MMO I go back to if I am in the mood for some multiplayer.  Remember the days when a class had a specific duty and you had to pull your weight in a group?  EQ 2 has a little of this now, I will be honest, but it still feels like if I am a tank I am not a dps.  I am not a shaman/melee dps with dual weilding... I digress.  Give this a shot, you might find yourself lost in Norath, and if you don't want to jump in yet, give a look to Everquest Next.  Sony might not be following Verrants old ideals, but I think they might be remembering why we played in the first place."",1"
"25484,EverQuest II,2014.0,""I purchased this game back and 2008 and only played the 30 day free trial but didnt feel like it was worth the subscription fee at the time as I probably didnt put enough time into. When everquest 2 extended came out I downloaded it too but never ended up really playing it as I just couldnt get into it.Finally I decided to play it again now that it was Free to Play. Fist I downloaded the standalone client and played for quite sometime and began enjoying the what I was able to do in this game and what the future had in store for this game. When I noticed it was on steam I reinstalled it on here and Iv been playing non stop eversince. One of the huge perks I found as I was playing was I had recieved tons of free ingame goods such as housing items, 500 Station Cash I didnt know I had and tons and tons of other bonuses I had recieved from purchasing and registering the game back on 08. This really had me sucked in now as even though most of the goods were not entirly powerful or usful for adventuring it really gave me a glimps of what I could do in the game. Especially with housing.Graphics:This is obviously a game that is getting up in age and the graphics do show in this way, however it seems like this was the perfect time for graphics engines because a lot of these games still look really good. Its not all blocky and cluncky like a ps1 game or everquest one but its smooth and has really nice looking landscapes, armor sets ect. It all just rolls out to look so good for its age. There are tons of settings that you can dink with to make it look as good good as you need it and its garenteed youll probably be able to find what looks best for you depending on your pc spec. In some of the main hub towns, especially freeport, the frames dropped crazy low. Im not sure if its a server issue or my internet. Its not so laggy that its unplayable by any means especially due to the fact that main cities are more or less used for grabbing quest, crafting, trading which means you wont need as many frames anyways to do these smaller faster taskes.Gameplay:Iv sunk so much time into this game so fast too. I dont think iv been able to dedicate myself to an mmo from the start as quick as I did with this game"
"25485,EverQuest II,2013.0,""It's a good game, if you played WoW or EQ you won't be lost. The F2P aspect is very competent but some will find fault with the item and spell restrictions for F2P players. It's still very playable free or paid and a great MMO to have installed when the need calls."",1"
"25486,EverQuest II,2013.0,""La verdad, quisiera poder decir algo de este juego, pero, sus servidores se la pasana eternamente ocupados y cuando me ha dejado entrar, no me deja ni siquiera avanzar en la creaciÃ³n del personaje, cuando ya me boto. Muy mal, pÃ©simo en ese sentido"",1"
"25487,EverQuest II,2013.0,""I've played this game a lot over the years. I've played it for like 4 consecutive years and it still amazes me to this day. The amount of races, classes, tradeskills, and the community make this game what it is. I find myself immersed in this game everytime I play it, whenever I take a break I feel so hesitant to come back to it asap. I highly recommend it to people looking for a good free MMO"",1"
"25488,EverQuest II,2011.0,""I've played my share of MMORPGs over the years, from freebies to subscriptions, even a few in-browser games. I'm not saying this is the best of any of the categories, but it is certainly one of the richest in characterization. I can't imagine any 2 characters ending up the same in this game, and that, for me at least, makes it worth looking into. Especially when its free!"",1"
"25489,EverQuest II,2013.0,""I have been playing this game since it first came out. Lots of content is an understatement. Gorgeous graphics that are still giving other games a run for their money. A wonderful, mature, and helpful community is the most notable quality of all."",1"
"25490,EverQuest II,2012.0,""Have you ever wanted to quest, ever? Welcome to Everquest, a game where you can quest as long as you like, forever if you'd like.  A game where leveling is ever lasting, and pvp is ever exciting.  Watch your back, you could be ganked by someone ever so quietly.  But don't be scared, you can stay in towns and craft if you wanted to, ever.  Everquest 2, a little bit of Everquest, just with a 2."",1"
"25491,EverQuest II,2013.0,""Awesome F2P MMO, you realllly don't have to spend money, and with Dailies, you can turn daily tokens into plat, and use the plat to buy a month's worth of sub.  It's also a very solo-friendly game for those that aren't into working their playtime around others."",1"
"25492,EverQuest II,2016.0,""this is the sequel to the first big 3d mmorpg and i really like it. its part of that world of warcraft generation of mmoÂ´s much like lotro,rift and wow, but with alot of elements that i wished wow had back then player housing tons of spells and such while wow ditched so much. this game is fantasy turned up to 11"",1"
"25493,EverQuest II,2014.0,""Its awsome ive played world of warcraft, and i can only play up to level 20 for free then i have to pay. In EverQuest 2 i can play up to level 90 for free. The quests are better in everquest than WOW, the graphics, character custimization, and combat two."",1"
"25494,EverQuest II,2014.0,""Love it. Another game I played before steam. One of the Major MMORPGs I played, and the gameplay along with the wide variety of choices are great. Free to play is okay, it limits so much, so Id recommend being prepared to buy the DLC if you want to actually get in this game. All DLC comes withe the original game, so youll get the full version. 15$ is a pain, but its well worth it."",1"
"25495,EverQuest II,2014.0,""This game is really fun, although it might take awhile to level up and get used to the controls and find a guild etc that's willing to invite you into their guild, I think that the community is pretty awesome, once you join a guild, that is. Some people you encounter are kind of helpful, say your running around and then a higher level guy comes alnog and you party up, theres a mentor option, and that bringgs the higher level player to your own level allowing you to get exp, because if not, you don't get the exp nor does the higher level player, but then they don't get the exp anyway because they out level pretty much whatever area your in anyway... if thats the case. all in all, I feel like its polished and would recomend (and yes, this revew sucks)10/10"",1"
"25496,EverQuest II,2012.0,""Would be one of the best F2P-MMORPGs (Bit of a mouth-full) I've ever played!Heaps of stuff you can do, no level cap and cheap if you decided to upgrade to Gold membership (Got some nice perks too if you do).All-in-all this would be an MMORPG I recommend to people"",1"
"25497,EverQuest II,2013.0,""My referral link (can use existing account if you haven't played for 6 months): http://alturl.com/t74ogEverquest II is an open-world MMORPG whose basic controls are similar to World of Warcraft, but whose integral mechanics and interface are quite different (and really, dramatically superior.)As an SOE game, Everquest II shares its Station Cash currency with all other SOE games: Everquest 1, DC Universe Online, PlanetSide 2, and even Free Realms. Because of this, taking advantage of SC-related offers in one game is redeemable in any other game.LORE AND SETTINGEverquest II takes place in a low-mid-fantasy world. Although it has fairies and lizard people and other stuff, they are portrayed relatively realistically. Early locations in particular are quite grounded and not really all that fantastic or colorful.Fortunately, Everquest II doesn't take its seemingly-serious setting very seriously, especially compared to WoW, and much of the setting is self-deprecating (try learning Faerlie.) Despite that, it has a few rules in its lore that limit the player just a smidgen.For instance, the playable classes are aligned good, neutral, or evil... as are the races. If you pick a """"good"""" class, you can't pick an """"evil"""" race, and vice versa"
"25498,EverQuest II,2016.0,""started playing this game with nothing but a few youtube videos to get me started. next thing i know i'm betraying a city and crafting tiles for my house with my little pixie on a string. the combat is slow at first so you just mash buttons until they are dead, it is best to have 3 hotbars open and blank so the new skills fill them up themselves. only two downsides i have sadly found with this is 1. the constant popup of the all access members and 2. you cant write a very long Bio :'( i was really getting into crafting a false backstory when it cut me short."",1"
"25499,EverQuest II,2016.0,""i have been playing EQ2 since its inception. decent game for anyone who likes role playing. Crafting has always what i enjoy most, but EQ2 crafting is a really tedious game of whack-a-mole, constantly countering spells and getting whacked if you don't.  What i have found over the years is that mentoring has to be one of the greatest features in the game. Being able to down-level to help a friend or to just do low level quests is fantastic. i would give this game a B+"",1"
25500,EverQuest II,2016.0,Honestly i am nuetral about this game. It is great for anyone like me who loves mmorpg's or just anyone new to them. It is a beautiful game for something made years ago. But the combat system is quite wonky to put it lightly. It confuses a guy who loves mmorpg's like me and i cant wrap my head around how weird and broken it is.,1
"25501,EverQuest II,2014.0,""I'm just begining but am really enjoying the game so far. It's a fun and addicting RPG that I find myself saying """"I better stop after this quest. Nah, one more quest then I will stop, nope gonna keep going."""" If you're on the fence about trying this, TRY IT! you won't regret it."",1"
25502,EverQuest II,2014.0,A great old-school MMORPG. It still has high system requirements but most shouldn't have a problem with it. It is a gorgeous game with very in-depth lore. You can't get any better than that for old school either.,1
"25503,EverQuest II,2014.0,""Several years old, but with recent additions like Mercenaries something you can even play solo. While you might not be able to solo everything (Hero ^^^ can be hard, even with the slightly overpowered Merc), the level progression is extremly fast and easy with the Merc's help. Obviously, if you want a hard game, this is nothing for you. And yes, there are still other players around and you can still contribute to your Guild by earning status. Its a pretty standard MMO with skills on buttons and the fights go against the selected target, not where the mouse points to. Its old, but still very enjoyable."",1"
25504,EverQuest II,2011.0,Questen bis zum Umfallen. Und nun ohne GebÃ¼hren.Immer noch ein erstklassiges MMORPG. Bestes Housing aller verfÃ¼gbaren MMORPS!Neverending Quests without monthly fees.Still a great MMORPG. Best Housing of all MMORPGS available.,1
"25505,EverQuest II,2014.0,""Okay. Here goes.I may have played this game for 2 hours in all, butthat was because my computer crapped out on me and i had to put it in the shop.AFter two weeks, it came back to me, completely wiped to factory specs because of a nasty virus.Two hours of gameplay, however, is enough to me to recommend this game.The character customization itself is enough to keep me occupied for 45 minutes or so, as there are a large number of races that include the """"average"""" fantasy races like dwarves, wood elves, dark elves, and even two different kinds of fae (we'll get into that in a moment), but there are also unique and interesting creatures like the Frogloks (good aligned frog people), Ratonga (Rat folk the size of dwarves) and two different species of lizardfolk.Also, this game gives you the option between good and evil. there are a surprising amount of evil aligned classes (and good, too, for you light siders out there) and the choice of alignment changes starting areas and such.The deity you decide to worship (much like neverwinter) will give you buffs and items. UNLIKE neverwinter, the deity you worship actually matters in the game. Depending on the amount of of worshippers, the god or goddess can materiallize in the world as an Avatar, giving server wide buffs to worshippers and offering quests.And if you're like me, you will want to spend thousands of hours playing this game purely because of collectables. Artifacts and books (much like Rift) are scattered everywhere, and they seem much more common in this game than in Rift. I can't really walk 40 feet ithout finding something interesting, whether that's an artifact, wierd enemy, or absolutely beautiful view.This game is VERY pretty, in my opinion. I have it on lowest settings because of preference (I want performance, not quality) but I've seen some things in my TWO whole hours that make me think """"Wow.""""The good starter area, for instance, is on an icy continent/island/archipelago thing, and the ocean is VERY deep. I was a froglok, so i could breathe underwater, and i stopped before finding the bottom because i kind of wanted to play instead of swim downward for a lifetime.Definately give it a try, better than WOW in my opinion, mostly because they don't try as hard to suck every penny out of you.Yes, there is a cash shop, but you can definitely play without spending a dime. I know, i looked around in it."",1"
"25506,EverQuest II,2014.0,""Nice gameplay, nice storyline, interesting quests and NPCs, BAD optimization and slow support. If the last two problems were handled better this game would go shoulder to shoulder with WoW and some other top MMORPGs, but I think with the coming of Next that the community and support are simply dying. The game itself is worth your time, if you don't get angry over the bad optimization like I did. Still, I'd recommend this game for any classic MMORPG lover out there. 7/10"",1"
"25507,EverQuest II,2014.0,""So for years I have had a dislike of the Everquest series. (Itâ€™s a long story and involved and abusive/neglectful father)However, after finding out that this is free on Steam, i decided to give it a shot.First I tried Everquest (The first one) and absolutely hated it. Then i tried this one, and canâ€™t stop playing it. it's very fun, and a great MMORPG.now Iâ€™m not a fan of most MMORPG's like WoW and the likes, however i find EverQuest II a very fun game, and a must have for fans of Fantasy, RPG's, MMO's, adventuring.8.5/10"",1"
"25508,EverQuest II,2012.0,""In the sake of full disclosure Everquest the original was a game that is and will always be in my heart for the experience, the memories, the great fun, the wonderful community and for getting me past some very bad very terrible times in my life.  With that said, and me having gone deep into EQ2 I thought it time to write a proper review of MY take on the game good, bad, and the so so.I found that the game still holds up well with the graphics and the music and zone immersion that can be tricky for any mmo or guge single player rpg to capture correctly.  The game has done a much better job recently of helping showing in the starting zones what skills and combat and crafting and gathering types of game play that is in and wanted by any fan of the mmo game.The amount of races and classes in this game are incrediable.  Over 25 classes (only 1 or 2 need to be baught in the in game cash shop) and 21 races (2 of which are again in the cash shop that need to be baught to be available).  An let's address that quickly.  Yes some of the best things are in the cash shop, 2 races and 2 classes, and the best housing (no monly in game cost of gold or solver aka """"rent"""") and some other conveinces things like armor skins and very cool mounts.  HOWEVER, free to play players can have a fun, very vast, open world of experience that can easily be over 100 to 200 hours of content if the player wants to simply level to cap and see 10 years worth of zones, dungeons, quests and raids.  Now I went sub, ( I choose to pay monthly to play) as free to play players can not use some chat options and some other limiations I did not want.  However, again I stress a free to play player can come in treat this game (dungeons and raids aside) like Skyrim and have over 150 to 200 hours of free content to see and experience.An while the style of game is dated after 10 years and the combat again very classic Everquest or World of Warcraft, for some of us that is a plus and not a minus.  I do want to stress this point out for modern mmo fans that if you are looking for a world less static and more """"alive"""" like Guild Wars2 or Rift, or anything else coming our recently this may not be the mmo for you.For people wanting to play alone, you have (in my eyes) some of the best voice acting that still holds up on most quest s, (75% voice acted), great great immersive zones and music, and a very strong personal and world story to experience.  You can hire mercenaries to aid you in your quest or dungeons, and can always over level a dungeon and do it later to both see it and solo.  Since this game has been out 10 years there are hundreds of zones, dungeons, areas, lands, public (non instance) dungeon zones and private (instance) dungeons to experience.The only bad or dissapointing aspects of the game to me, other then the game being 10 years old at this point is the dated UI (there are add ons to fix) and the quest mapping and tracking can take awhile to get into and understamd.  Definately advise you find a good community, active player base since I think (I do not know for sure) their are only several hundred thousand to a million players off an on.  However, no zone felt empty and i saw people in every zone and most eager to help or talk to new players.Overall, while this was not Everquest to me, it is a game i look forward to spending a year or two in off and on to see everything i missed, and to enjoy the next chapter of the Everquest saga before the next chapter in Everquest starts.  To any fan of old school mmo's or single players wanting a vast world to explore you could do far far worse then spend some time in this vast wonderful world."",1"
25509,EverQuest II,2011.0,If you want a challenging MMO I would recommend this. They upgraded the free to play feature as well so it's more viable now. Every fight could be your last this isn't kiddie mode and is actually challenging :),1
"25510,EverQuest II,2014.0,""I played this at launch and many times off and on.  For the most part get into a guild, ask questions, and know that this is almost pure PvE.  Pros: F2P (Free to play), huge world to explore (map shows you general level ranges but not all), great crafting system albeit tedious (you feel like you're actually apart of the creation, until your 200th pristine something for that next level on rush orders), many classes to play, and pretty active playerbase.  The playerbase isn't that bad I've found.  The guilds I've been in had helpful people in it and its a relief to not find trolls in  the community.Cons: A lot of grinding, the queue system for dungeons doesn't work (for ex. you could be queued for 4 hours, get the queue  and it only brings in one other person...Also, I queued with a party a couple times and it split us into different dungeons so 2 went into one and the other 3 went into another...yea.)Repeditive.  If you bring up other classes you're going to go through the same content over and over.  You'll do this because if you go to other content you'll get much slower xp and leveling in this game is slow.  Many people multi-box, mentor their other toons they want to level and aoe zones, which screws the other people in the zone actually playing their toon.Parties are almost non-existent until level cap.  For a multiplayer mmo...I for one want to group with other people.You have to pay to unlock certain races / classes.  This is to be expected in a F2P model though and for the most part didn't effect me.The pvp in this game has many issues.  First the pvp is on a different server, the queue system doesn't work very well and its usually one team dominating another as there's no balancing level wise.  Some level brackets noone queues for (most actually).I can safely say the queue system not working killed this game for me.  I don't play mmos to be alone especially when leveling up but if my past history is any indication, I'll probably go back to it at some point.  If you haven't tried it and you liked EQ1 or quest based mmos you should give it a try."",1"
"25511,EverQuest II,2014.0,""The Everquest Franchise has always been a great experience. I have played Since 2004 - Everquest I and II. Since Everquest II came out around the same time another big MMO name came out, they seemed alot like the same game. But the changes and the hard work that the developers have put into it, listening to players"
"25512,EverQuest II,2012.0,""I've put quite a bit of time into this game over the years. No it's not WoW, but I see that as a good thing. WoW is a monolith of it's own and deserves a notable step forward in online gaming for the time it was released.  Everquest 2 is geared to a more mature/higher attention span audience.   You won't level from 1 to 92 in a couple weeks, but the leveling can be fun if you mix your play types just right. There is so much content that has been added to this game over it's going-on 8 year run. The graphics still look very nice, and there is a great community to be tapped into (although some of the community has been diluted since free to play). But due to the fact that it is now free to play, and you don't have to spend $250+ just on expansions like I've done as they came out, give this game a go!! There is much to be enjoyed here."",1"
"25513,EverQuest II,2011.0,""An acceptable way to spend your time if you're looking for an MMO that isn't WoW, but not worth playing if you're not planning on subscribing"
"25514,EverQuest II,2013.0,""Satisfying combat, fun progression, best in industry business model. Can't really ask for more in an MMORPG. SOE knows their stuff. No one gives you this level of content without a pay wall. $40 for the top tier expansion, virtually everything else is available for free and isn't behind some insane grind that premium members can skip. They're moving more towards a Guild Wars model with every patch and it works."",1"
"25515,EverQuest II,2013.0,""Truely endless adventure, epic battles, sweet loot, and mini-games. What more could you ask for in any game, but this one lets you play with your friends and soon to be friends as well!"",1"
"25516,EverQuest II,2016.0,""I enjoy this game, but I do have an issue with it: it shares the same geography as the original EQ. I know, I know it is all Norrath. That is not a problem in a broad sense, but it is for me. I have spent so much time delving into the world of the first EQ that being in a place that is the same but different seems odd. I just turn off that part of my brain and enjoy the game. "",1"
"25517,EverQuest II,2014.0,""The good World of Warcraft.  better than most mmo's out there, and its mostly free, except for some microtransactions, but not enought to make it play to win.  Check it out if you wana have something to occupy you far a couple weeks, and maybe even longer."",1"
"25518,EverQuest II,2012.0,""Payed and played from '04 to '11 then i lost interest in MMOs in general. But hoowee! I had a blast with this! WoW, go throw yourself against a spiked wall. You got nothing on this beast!"",1"
"25519,EverQuest II,2015.0,""A beautiful game world to explore. I have been playing for years and still discovering new quests, new dungeons, new things to do. Great friends. Just lots of awesome things to do and see. I just dont have all the words. There is always something new going on."",1"
"25520,EverQuest II,2015.0,""The game has a large amount of content. Also includes user created content that is supported by the dev team. The player housing is great with a vast array of things you can use to place in your home. There are many classes and races to support actual RP servers. Great experince all around. And the comunity is a great improvment over other mmorpg games, they help you rather than hinder and there's no such thing as a stupid question. Guild setup is nice and the ammenities you can gain make being in a guild nice. The music is great to for those of you audio techs like me. (Though there are some sound FX issues that make my ears twinge) Been playing on and off for almost 7 years."",1"
25521,EverQuest II,2014.0,Of all the MMOs out there like WoW and even original EQ...this is the only one that keeps drawing me back. I don't know why. The multitude of races certainly makes for a wonderful RP opportunity.,1
"25522,EverQuest II,2013.0,""This game is absolutely amazing. Sequel to Everquest 1, this game is a continuation of the mmorpg that basically birthed mmorpgs. This game gives you access to anything and all except for a few things. it even gives you all expansions packs except tears of veeshan for free. You have access to all the races except the Freeblood vampires. You also have access to all classes except the two new ones, included when purchasing tears of Veeshan. The priest class known as channeler, and the scout class known as beastlord. You are able to level all the way up to lvl 85 with no purchases, and then 86-95 with tears of Veeshan. In all i HIGHLY recommend this game to any and all people who would want to be apart of an amazing community and an amazing story to go through. 10/10 my friends. Download this game.Alright with the release of another expansion pack it's time to update my review again. Altar of Malice the new expansion pack features a new race, areas etc. The new race is called Areyrkn or something along those lines. They are part human part Draco. Huge dragon wings and horns sprouting this way and that from their head they are actually pretty cool. No new classes were added sadly but then again. This game has aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ton already in it. The game is still 100% worth playing after all these years and i still fully reccommend it!."",1"
"25523,EverQuest II,2016.0,""Product received for freeYou shoudnt judge the game by what people say... even if they spent 6 years and so on on the game... The games F2P with years of worth of content for you to explore. I have been looking for an mmo to play thats worth investing my time. Time i believe is the most valuable thing we have as our biological clock is ever ticking. Believe me i could be doing way more important stuff than writing this crap. I have 6 hours on record I wont lie to you. Game is good, Try it. It has everything an mmo needs to have and more. The game isnt ruined by what people say. It isnt pay to win as everything can be earned by just playing. If you are looking for that classic feel look no other. This games got history. It has attidute and it will consume you. Just give it a go you can always uninstall. For more information about subscriptions etc here.http://eq2.zam.com/wiki/Membership_Matrix_(EQ2) "",1"
"25524,EverQuest II,2013.0,""As an original contract visual artist for EQ2, I can say that I am happy about the way EQ2 has come along.  If you're an avid MMOer but crave the traditional gaming experience, EQ2 is for you.  If you're hack and slash, however, stick to World of Warcraft."",1"
25525,EverQuest II,2016.0,This game for me is the best MMORPG game ever never mind the free to play part as it has such wonderful scenery everywhere you go around the game world and the music for each scenario really fits just adding to that amazing gameplay of leveling up your character or playing with your friends :),1
"25526,EverQuest II,2013.0,""One of the greatest MMORPGs of all time. Their Free-to-Play doesn't give it justice, though. It's definitely worth the subscription"
"25527,EverQuest II,2014.0,""Ah Everquest, we meet again. This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing nostalgic timesink is something that I wouldn't really call a videogame, an adventure rather, an experience. A phase. It comes and goes, sometimes it lasts for a long while, sometimes a short burst. A lot of the time you find yourself returning, 'back to basics' and such.This â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥er is very different to the first Everquest, yet still deep and loving. You can explore with friends and go on a mystical journey, or more importantly you can go on your own. The lone warrior, adventurer, explorer. You will fail, you will succeed, you'll dance, laugh, cry, heck you'll even fall asleep. You will gain knowledge of the lore, aquire sets of particular skill, view many landscapes and battles till your eyes tear up.Everquest is now on steam and in the heart it hasn't changed a bit, although the population is now 3, the graphics outdated and I don't recommend it at all.I lied. I do recommend it, the thousands and thousands of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hours that I've spent, scream at me to recommend it, even though I don't want to. It's Everquest or your life, you choose.You only get one childhood... and one adulthood, Norrath or your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing life.Play it or don't, doesn't really matter to me, the original is deeper and worse for your health, this one is slightly more casual.Just watch where you step."",1"
"25528,EverQuest II,2012.0,""This is why steam needs a neutral review option, the game was at one point my MMO of choice but overtime it faded making bad decision after bad decision after bad decision i still look back fondly at my times in this game and the only reason i have 300 hours is leaving the launcher open on accident in reality i have what may be thousands of hours in this game and can tell you that if you want an MMO world were there is a great amount of lore then try it if you want difficulty then look up Project 1999 which is based off of everquest 1 a much better game it will always have a special place in my heart but its more like a bad romance where i have to leave it but cant help and remember he good times"",1"
"25529,EverQuest II,2015.0,""NOTE: This is an updated review. I had taken down my previous not recommended one a while back. I have such a severe love/hate relationship with this game, but this one will remain.I have been with this franchise since 1999. Hours played on here is so far off due to playing for so many years off of Steam. With my love of the franchise, you won't get a biased review here. In fact, I don't even always know why I recommend this game. And yes, I know how commentors work, if I have THIS many hours in a game, how can it NOT be recommended? Quite frankly because this is not the same game I used to play all those hours. This is an MMO, and MMOs change. But, I recommend this game, to an extent.The beginning and first few expansions are great. But then, I think there is only 1 word to describe how the game becomes: Bloated. They seem to add more features for advancement, than actual content. Sometimes it feels as if they are trying to give the illusion that there is more content than their really is. Kunark Ascending tried doing that with the Epic 2.0 weapons. You will be doing more in older content, than current content, to gain that weapon. And I am talking content that is much lower than you. I don't mind working for a weapon that is the best in slot for 2-ish years, but their wasn't much in the way of new content to do.I know I don't speak for everyone, but I feel this is a game that only gets worse if you rush it. There are over 8,000 quests in this game, but expansions only add in the double digits these days. If you are a quester, if you want to adventure, I can only recommend this game if you don't rush, because once you get to the end game, you will see many illusions of content.So why recommend this game? The content that IS there, is fairly good. It sucks that it ends so quickly at end game, but the grind will at least be real if you want that. But I mainly recommend the start and the first few expansions. After that, it just gets bloated. But some people do enjoy that.This is just my 2 cents, I don't expect everyone to agree with me. But you can get hundreds, if not thousands, of hours out of this game on 1 character, and not be able to do everything, unless you rush and only focus on the last couple expansions. But, grinders can get those hours. I am just speaking of unique content. Not repeats."",1"
"25530,EverQuest II,2017.0,""Everquest 2 always was an amazing game. It hit it's peak with Kunark, much like EQ1, and got better and better with each expansion. I haven't played in the last year or 2, but the previous content alone would be worth it. Lush story, great dialog, great characters all voiced over. There is enough lore here to keep you immersed for a long, long time."",1"
"25531,EverQuest II,2017.0,""I would vote this better than World of Warcraft. On just gameplay alone. Better crafting system, creature language system your character can learn and speak, amazing Player/Guild housing system, an in-depth character leveling up system and more! Spend a few days learning the game and playing it and going through all the """"Advanced Options"""" and menus and really dig deep into this game. You'll love what it can offer to you as a roleplaying lover. Also, with this being on Steam in the first place, already has my vote over WoW any day."",1"
"25532,EverQuest II,2017.0,""I have always loved this game! I love the idea of owning my own home, be it an inn or prestige, and being able to decorate it. Lots of endless possibilities. I love doing the quests. Crafting. Raids. The most unique part of this MMO compared to others, the Guides. They are there to chat, listen to your concerns, and they take time out of their day to also run quests. A game I will continue to play."",1"
"25533,EverQuest II,2013.0,""After I had played it extensively for four years I tried other MMO's. Unfortunately I had to notice that they can't compete with EverQuest. Reason enough to return "
"25534,EverQuest II,2017.0,""this was the first MMORPG i've ever played but after not having played it for many, many years and then playing it again has only helped me once again realise why i switched to WoW all these years ago"",0"
"25535,EverQuest II,2012.0,""Arguably the single greatest mmorp that exists today, and now its free!!!! There is little to no competition for this game. Graphics that bend to a weak â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ computer, as well as an extreme graphics option offering the most insanely beautiful graphics a pc game has every brought you, but i warn you, even the most high end computers have a hard time handling extreme mode "
"25536,EverQuest II,2017.0,""An older game, to be sure, but has its own charm and holds a special place in my heart - having played it since I was young. Definitely still has some grind if you want to run through *all* of the content, but if someone just wanted to get right into the action, I'm fairly certain he or she could get up to speed quickly. Pretty expansive variety of races and classes, with few restrictions if any (evil races can play as good classes by betraying and vice versa).I would still recommend buying a subscription if you want to play endgame content (removes most limitations), and unfortunately there are a couple extra features that need to be bought outside of that, but if you buy the sub, you can collect the credits to get those free of charge anyhow. Not sure how playing free through the whole game would be, but I'm sure it's both viable and still fun.The lore in this game is incredible if you're into deep storylines. I wouldn't say the questing feels as epic as it did in the original Everquest, but some of the story arcs can make you feel like your character is the hero he or she is espoused to be. Plus, the game still receives consistent updates and I've even seen guide-run events (by volunteers or employees in game) more recently.Playerbase can be a bit slim, but when a new server launches, usually there's a ton of people who come out.If you're into MMO's, don't mind a bit of grind and graphics that aren't cutting edge, I'd recommend trying this game!"",1"
"25537,EverQuest II,2011.0,""When I frist started playing Everquest 2 it was amazing (its still great). The players were friendly and mature, there were lots of things to do (still is) but now days groups are tough to come by because of the population decline about a year ago (update 6/2/2018: population problems seem to have been evened out due to server merges). The shadow oddesy was the prime of everquest 2 (iMO). I suggest playing this, many people have made life long friends and even gotten married IRL because of this game. I still have so many great memories from people I played this with, but, bridges have been burned and I cant relive them, so I have to make new ones. It's so sad for me to see so many people I used to play with leave for other mmo's and never return. The best time of my gaming life was when I was playing my main (at the time) on the everfrost server (merged with another server so it isnt call that anymore) in a guild called Stormsurge. This is a game where you have to be respectul of other players because there arent millions of people loggin on every day like FF14 or ESO. You unknowingly begin making a name for yourself when you begin playing.Get this game. Maybe you can have great memories like I do. Everquest is an mmorpg unlike any other, unriveled in its content. Update 6/2/2018: I have been playing EQ2 for 10 years. The only reason steam says i have less than 300 hours is because it hasnt been on steam for the full duration of it's release. So if I had to guess i'd say I have around 3000 - 4000 hours on Everquest 2.My main is called Scuttlebutt and he is on the Antonia bayle server. Hit me up if you want to play."",1"
"25538,EverQuest II,,""cool game. THe only thing that REALLY PISSES ME OFF, is the ridable transport. It takes you through the most scenic route and then fakes you out on another docking platform, before looping back around to take you through the scenic route to your destination, LIVID"",1"
"25539,EverQuest II,,""this game since I was a little kid, always have since. I still remember my first ever name, Zookoos lol, I thought it was so cool back in the day lmao but it seems edgy now, anyways if I've enjoyed this for years and years of my life, I'm sure you will too :)"",1"
