review_text
Crusader Kings II is a powerful game by Swedish studio Paradox. It is strategy game which gameplay revolves around life of medieval noble. Crusader Kings II is immensely detailed and rich in historical events and intriguing quests providing many hours of fascinating gameplay for player. Predominantly it is representation of life of medieval noble who is fighting in crusades seducing women and collecting money as well as titles. You can be almost everyone who you can imagine: immensely powerful and cruel Byzantine Emperor or kind and merry count of Aargau. The game contains yet another layer of vivid references to medieval history of Europe.  As for characterization the game designers are enormously successful in forging the reality of cruel and dangerous medieval world. You can basically forget that`s only a video game.  My only reservation about this game is the fact that the optimization is not the best as game can crush in various occasions. In spite of this I literally could not take my eyes of the screen! I highly recommend Crusaders Kings II which is truly magnificent achievement from Swedish studio Paradox.
Totally boring not worth buying at all.  In all seriousness Crusader Kings 2 is a great game hampered by Paradox's poor DLC scheme. The base game is definitely playable and definitely still fun but you'll be missing out on many years of content that Paradox has unfortunately locked behind a paywall. Even without the DLC you'll find yourself saying things like 'I need to kill my second son to make sure my inheritance doesn't get split!' and other things that'll make your friends think you're a psychopath.  Multiplayer sessions are incredibly fun as well though the game lacks drop-in multiplayer necessitating a save-and-load if someone needs to join.  I would highly recommend this if on sale as the game regularly goes on sale for at least 50% off        if not more. Otherwise        it's a fortune for all the DLC.
Great game overall
Well at this point I've played 307 hours of this game. That means        if it were my full time job        I'd have to work there SEVEN weeks to hit that amount of time. And yeah        I have a real job.  Anyhow        at first I hated this game because I couldn't figure it out and I had little or no interest in medieval times. In fact        I had to google stuff        just to figure out what the terms meant. Agnatic-Cognatic? Primageniture? Wha?  But        at some point        I got totally sucked in. This is one of the greatest games of all times and I will continue playing it probably for my whole life.   And        even then        I won't understand everything about the game. It's filled with a million little rules and mechanics all buzzing away in the backgroun all fronted by building the story of a family and a dynasty. It's both human
Are you a high strategy fan? do you like scheming and backstabbing and dealing with unforseen circumstances? then this is the game for you v\if your not then it isn't        it is not for you.  This game has a long long time period to get anywhere unless your really really good at the game or just really lucky        you will find your subordinates will betray you no matter how hard you try to keep the peace        because you cannot make everyone happy right?  What sucks is you can too often get a rebellion in the early stages of the game and find yourself massively outnumbered if your not extremly careful        this I feel needs to change        would be really cool to have the option to hire foriegn mercenaries to come help you can even loan money from friendly neighbouring countries        but you can't so your screwed.  I feel this game is lacking something        more diplomacy perhaps        more intuitive building        this is a game you will be looking up stuff on google because the game fails to explain it properly and that's a shame because once you learn everything        you can have some fun with this game.  Recommended if it is on discount.
A very complex yet satisfying game nothing is better than promotiing your character's rank from a lowly count to a grand emporer. beware though        the game is a fantastic time sink. 10/10 would procrastinate with again.
My favorite game of all time. If you love strategy you will probably like this game. it has a large learning curve but once you get past that you can play this game for hundreds of hour like me. You can make history or you can rewrite history. The best way i have heard this game described as is a giant medieval sandbox strategy simulator.
590 hours played.... need I say more? Edit: Still playing with over a thousand more.
A wet dream for any history freak.
Really cool an interesting game.Only problems with crashes sometimes.
Reformed the Roman Empire then it got destroyed by the Anti-christ and Aztecs. 11/10
I think this is the most accessible Paradox Interactive game. The main reason I prefer CK2 to their other works (I enjoy them all) is that this game focuses on individuals and lets you operate as a seperate entity than the state. I find myself having much more humorous and crazy stories here than in Vicky say. Say. Say. Say Yay and theres a douible on the step. So step        up        DAD!!!! DAD?
One of my favorite games of all time!
Ever wanted to be a medieval dickweed? This is your chance!
There really isn't much to say beyond GET IT!!!  Seriously though this is a great gameespecially if you are interested in any combination of history grand strategy or politics you will like this game.  Also this is one of the few games where you can stare at a gaint map for countless hourswhilst having fun doing it.
Highly addictive strategy game. Highly recommended
Well when i first played it i thought it was boring... Then i tried the Ruler designer Dlc and it was much more fun. And if you think its boring while you playThen you can allways start a new scheme to gain more powerland and more vassals and courtiers! Good luck in your Conquest!
Very good but if your gonna get you should buy the ruler designerthe old godsand sons of aberham dlc.
Overall the game is greatlatest free patch implements significant options for ironman modeincluding disabling shattered retreat. Game is just as good as its ever been now
My wife tried to kill my son. I blinded her. I slept with another woman. I bought my wife a necklace 'To bring out the colour in her eyes'.   10/10 would taunt eyeless wife again.   Seriously thoughincredible game with loads of depth. Many useful cheats for solving bugs or accidents. Like pressing the 'surrender' button instead of enforce 'demands' button during a war.
One of the best games I have ever played
I promised when I was in sight of 700 hours I would right a bit more depth review of the game and it's current state. But today is the 4 year birthday of this great gameso figured why not.  I want to start with saying this is one of my favourite games. It beats out anything else for staying power of enjoyment. I have poured hundreds of hours in single player and mulitplayer. The base gamethe expansions
a very-very complex game for a strategy lover! its hard at first but if u keep patient and keep learningthis game is awesome
It's the greatest game I've ever played. I've committed a terrifying number of hours to this game and I've still never come close to my primary goal of completing a save from the early start to the bitter end. I'll do it one day! I'd recommend picking up DLC a few months after it's released to save yourself from buggy dissapointment. GenerallyI feel the portrait DLCs and anything introducing game mechanics are normally worth it (but slightly expensive) and the music/unit sprite DLCs are an utter waste of your cash.
Have Germanic Pagan heir with excellent stats Send heir to fight in a crusade Heir comes back a blind catholic eunuch Heir wins a spear throwing competition Heir falls out of a window and dies  10/10 would shag concubine for more sons again.
OK I don't like writing reviewsreally. I've logged countless hours on this game. I love it. I don't know what to say. I like it more than EU4basically because I like trying to tie in the personal relations to other kingdoms and empires
This is a game where you can get killed by your mentally fuckfuck half-brother for your claim to the throne and then see your kingdom go from a golden age of military domination and economic prosperity into several independence wars to break away from the gay aspie king.
Don't be discouraged by the complexity of this game!  When you first get started you may find it overwhelmingbut spend some time and understand one thing at a time and you will having fun in no time.  In this gameyou don't play as a nation or country
As King of Leonhad my childhood friend Oveco build some walls.  Beat back the invading emirs. Made them pay for the walls. ( ?° ?? ?°)  #MakeAndalusiaGreatAgain #DeusVult
I loved this gamebut due to the battle changes and 'coalition/defensive pact' changes in conclaveas well as bugs that have persisted for over a year (The worst of which is when a revolt leader dies they'll just get their own independant country instead of folding back into yours)
This game is so in depthand eats up time like its nothing. You can spend all your time just focusing on your home country without even going on crusade! A lot of attention to detail and history.
This game will reveal to you just how much of an absolute fuck you can be when forced.
best grand strategy game! thank you paradox
You will lose months of your life.
One of the finest games ever made. A pinnacle. The only other strategy game in the same league as Dwarf Fortress. In additionParadox is probably the best in the business at supporting their games. They released a game which was already magnificentand since then they have released incredible expansions
This game is amazing!!! Reminds me of game of thrones XDlike i found a (cersei lannister-wannabe character) in the game. Hahahahah XDjust so fun
36 hours in still haven't figured out many aspects of this game. It's cool to guide your bloodline to successbut having to watch youtube videos just to understand simple mechanics of a game is a big negative to me. 7/10
Played a county in norwaygot destroyed by harold fairhair. 10/10 would unite norway again.
This game is abolutely class. The 11 hours I've played on Steam unfortunately does not count the 30+ hours I played before getting the Steam edition. It is worth every pennyone of the deepest and most satisfying gaming experiences ever.
This is a richcomplicated game that sits at the intersection of many richcomplicated things: centuries-long empire building
BUY THIS GAME. I HAVE HAD IT FOR A LONG TIME AND IT NEVER GETS OLD... if you love history and geography at all... +detail +accuracy +genius
Forged an empire. Banned pants.  10/10.
This game is mindblowing in its absurd complexity. Fairly serious learning curvebut personallyworth the trouble. I can sink lifetimes into this badboy. The DLC and expansions for this game only make things better. Leaves the Total War series in the dust. (It's only drawback is the lack of realtime battles
In one of my games I've seen an Askhenazi Jewish guy inheriting the Holy Roman Empire!  A must have for all the fans of Medieval times!
Quality game
This game is pretty great... if theres one thing I wish was more intuitiveit would be starting wars. Besides that GREAT GAME... but honestly I'm writing this to get a badge
One of the Best games in My Libray. A must buy for anyone who finds it much more rewarding to work for their goals rather than get them in a quick fash of gunfire. It is slowit plods along and it is what you see is what you get( the whole game is played out on the Risk style map of Europe). It is However one of the most engaging ames out therea game where you can loose not just hours but days trying to scheme and murder your way to the top (when all else fails you can just bull your way with your armies).   In this game you play as powerful dynasty in medival Europe
Grand strategy at its finesta must play if you love managing a dynasty as opposed to a nation like in EU3/EU4
This game is extremely deep and continually updated. I have played around 6 full campaigns at this point and just now feel like I have a decent grasp of most every mechanic in the game. I am still wrestling with creating good army compositions and assigning sub-unit leaders.   Definitely worth the $40 investment when I bought it. Almost 4 hours of entertainment per dollar. That's a good rate.
Hours of fun. This game allows you take control of any major member of the nobility of medieval europe. There isn't a game out there that can compare to this.
So... I have finally passed 100 hours spent in this game. I'd say all of it was worth it. Through all of itI was captivated and engrossed with my several fledgling kingdoms and dominating empires. Combining the depth of an RTS with the addictiveness of an RPGthis game is unique and brilliant. If you are someone who enjoys strategy games such as total war as well as RPGs
You can play as small or as big as you want. You can focus on just building your dynasty and just stay as count or duke while influenceing the area around you still. OR you can go full out world domination if you so desire.  I love the game for the stories that evole out of all the random events and mistakes that I can make. Having your leader die at the wrong time and then your kindgom splits up as you have to play as a baby for a few years doesnt sound fun but it weirdly is. Espeically if 50 years later you have taken back your kingdom and MORE as that same character. Right from baby to 50 year old King. :)  It is really hard game to describe for me. If you like StrategyRPGsHistory
Fun game with a relatively large learning curve very challenging and seems to slap you in the face and kick you in the shin every time you get comfortable. Not for those who love world-conquering combatmore for those who can act with patience and caution towards a long term plan.
This game took me a very long time to figure out. After looking around the map for a while and watching some tutorial videos I dove in. It ended up being a very enjoyable time watching the rise to power and eventual horribleinbreddecline of my dynasty. If you have the time to put into learn this game. I really recommend picking it up with DLC on a sale.
I've played about 20 hours of the regular game and... its ok I guess. I prefer Victoria 2 or EU3 honestly.  What makes this game simply amazing is its potential to be modded. Crusader Kings 2 hands down has the best mods out of any Paradox grad strategy gameand I'd argue that its a top 10 contender for modded games or games to enjoy with mods.  My other 300+ hours have been in the Game of Thrones mod which is simply fantastic. If you're going to play this gameyou have to try that mod at some point.  My only complaint of this game compared to Vicky or EU is that its much more RNG heavy. I've found myself far too often stripped of meaningful control and have my nation fall apart to one or two silly events. This simply doesn't happen in the other grand strat games- you have more control of your nation in those.
Struggleconspire and conquer great realms and lands. Expand your kingdomonly to see it all fall apart when your leader dies and all his children greedely fight over the remains of the nation.. Great game!
now...where to start? amazing graphics superb gameplay and never ending action(except for ireland) and is always fun. my offical rating 9/10  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  That is my review from many years and many hundreds of hours ago  Still as amazing as before just even more so from all the DLCs and mods so my new rating has to be a 11/10. my absolute favourite game
I married a dwarf and had twin dwarf babies.
I really really need Chineseplease give me Chinese.This is a gorgeous gamebut language is a problem to Chinese. I hope paradox will care about it in the future.
Here we go... Finally I am reviewing a grand strategy game. First offI just want to say that this game is definitely NOT for everyone. Due to the learning curve of the genre (more on that later)this game will inevitably have haters
The complex social kingdom world domination game! In reality this is a deep empire builder while with a steep learning curveit's large array of tutorials really help to get the most out of whatever social position you find yourself in. Building your family dynasty takes time effortand sometimes a bit of forced luck. Definitely a keeper for the future this is the most epic strategy game for all those who love the genre
A game thats all about getting to the top through a combination of strategic marriage and even more strategic murder.
You're God Damn Right
i don't know what is going on but i killed 2 of my children and my wife ran away
A Paradox game that isn't broken. We have been blessed by God.  Hapsburg Simulator 2.0. Best grand strategy release ever.
One of the best games I have ever played.
This game is increadibly amazing for a game that you can not observe your troops do battlebut plotting to kill your relatives or KingsPopes
My favourite game by a country mile. If you like GoT and grand strategyseriously you have been missing the point of existence.
I game I come back to constantly and play for hundreds of hours each time. I really enjoy the game and all the extra content they keep producing. You have to buy a few DLC to really get the full feeling of this gameunfortunatelybut they have sales regularly. And although all the DLC can be off-putting the game truly is worth it.
Have you ever glimpsed inside the cockpit of a large passenger jetand noticed all those buttons and switches? That's what Crusader Kings II is likeat first
This game (albeit incredibly complicated) is TONS of fun if you are interested in military/political simulators. The more popular mods (i.e. Game of Thrones mod) are very well done and offer an almost completely different playthrough. The numerous DLCfactionsreligions
such strategy. much grand. so tactic. wow.
Probably the most involved interesting game I have ever playedforget linear storylines written by the dev's in this game you create your own storyline.
This is a must have. I've never devoted so much time to another game as I have CKII.
The absence of markets upsets mebut you can execute children and fuckfuck people.
Great game. There's a learning curvebut it's incredibly engaging once you master the mechanics.
Perfect grand strategy. I have 11 hours played time on steam but hundreds of hours did not registered because i was not using steam to play it. Highly recommended to anyone that loves micro management.
Good Game Recomend!
The combination of playing a character as well as a countrywith dynastic concerns being paramount over everything elseis a unique twist on the usual formula of Paradox games. There are so many different ways to play
Invading india with armies of vikings or england with hordes of horse archers? check Arresting people? check Plot against people? check participate in the jihads/crusades? check blind and castrate your enemies? check sacrifice the pope to odin? check create a harem? check nail your sister/mother/aunt? check murder your husband infant son of another wifeso your son inherits? check  question iswhy arent you playing this game yet?
This is probably the best Paradox game to date.  It appears overwhelming at first (at first i bought the gamethen gave up because i didn't understand a damn thing). I came back to it later and found it a very deep and enjoyable experience because of the focus on characters.  The only downside is the DLC pricing systemthey charge you for 15$ for a few new features every 6 months
Oh the intrigue
For methis game is perhaps the most gripping medieval political simulation I've ever played. Hours upon hours of my life have been invested in this gameestimated more than 300 hours before I converted my copy to a steam copy (gamersgate gave me a steam code for it and all the dlc I had). Deep and engaging diplomacy that requires one to have a strategy
I fled the learning curve of this game years agothinking it impossible due to my poor grasp of family lineage/relations.  This time I watched all of Arumba's tutorial videosin one go
Awesome game! Founding kingdoms and empires. Creating a vast family tree to secure the continuation of your dynasty only to have everyone turn on eachother. Get an idiot for an heir. Steal some land from neighbour whose territory is falling apart from civil wars. fuck off the Pope. And just when you think you have everything sorted out barbarians invade. This game is not so much about winning as dodging disasters. Going from being emperor to just a duke few generations later doesn't have to mean you did anything wrong. Keep going. See how far you can get!  This game is hard! It takes a quite while before you figure out what's important and how to do anything. I recommend playing the demo a few times until you know it well and know if this is the game for you. The game might have seen a few updates since the demo but it will give you a sense of how things work.
It's fair to say i've played this game quite alotand that's because it's probably one of the greatest strategy games in existence. Howeverthe DLC and the dlc of the dlc is beginning to get a little tiresome
I love this gameand have playing so much of it. My #1 fav. game.
This game is a must own for any fan of strategy gaming.
CKII is definitely the best Medieval strategy game on today's marketsand is the only game that keeps permanent residence on my hard drive.
In this gameyou can marry your sister and do lots of lewd thingslike ruling all of Europe!
A great paradox game blackmailassassinationsmarraige
Best game I've ever played with unrivaled moddability 11/10.
So far it's the only game that I really can't stop playing.. so many choices so many events 350+ years of bloodlineand i've only just hit 120 years! 10/10
I bought this game because I read absurd stories about murder and warfare in this game. It absolutely allows for you to have the very same tales for you to telland lends itself quite well to have books written about escapades of your dynasty. If you can overcome the learning curve or have a buddy to play with while you figure out what all those buttons doyou'll have a great time with this game.
Picture Medieval Two Total War. Now Picture Medieval Two Total War with awesome diplomacy. Now simply remove the hour long battles you must fight. That is CKII. And it's brilliant.
5/5  Great dynasty simulator game.   i just wish the other lords realised how suss it is when a characters wife is murderedand the husband of another character is murdered and the two characters get married
From what I've played in my short amount of timeI can say that this game is one of the most amazing medieval simulators ever created. HoweverI am disappointed in the fact that in order to really get into the game
This is Grand strategy at its finest. In CK2 you don't play a country or some invisible power controling everything. Here you play a character. With all it's good and bad traits which influence your rule.   Just the other night my renowned polish kingwho won every war he startedincluding two crusades
DONT EVEN ASK JUST BUY IT BOY.GIVE PARADOX MORE MONEY TO MAKE MORE DLC . DONT YOU DARE NOT BUY CRUSADER KINGS 2 BOY BUY IT fuck?. :)
1
Probably the most detailed game I've ever played... and will continue to play. It probably has the longest shelf life of any game I've ever played. Had this one for a year and a half now.
One of the best games paradox has released in my opinion with a great merge of roleplaying and strategy mechanics.   No other game can make you feel like a medieval ruler quite as good as crusader kings 2!
I started off as ruler of a small plot of land in norway.  400 years lateri had converted all of europe and most of africka to the Norse Religionand united Western civilization under Scandinavia. Christianity had been stomped out. England and france no longer existed. The world worshipped Odin and Thor
This game is perhaps the best strategy game ever created. It offers freedom to the player and the community has crafted some great mods!! I highly recommend this game and its DLC.
Easily one of the best Strategy Games I have ever played. I cannot recommend it enough to people who enjoy the genre.
I bought this game when on salefor 9.90 euros. Best I ever spent. This game is so brilliant I just want to play it all the time. Truethe first couple of times you will fail miserably at ANYTHING you try
This is one of the best games out there. Pretty much infinite magical contentthere is always something to doalways someone fun to play as. I found this game to be one of the most interesting ones I ever played
I led a war to retake Scotland from some jerks and I called in allies. The war ended because I died of a cold. 30 years onI try to retake Scotland again. I called in allies.   The war ended because I died of a cold.  11/10 would die from cold again.
A complex game sliighty overpricedbut features one of the highest quality hardcore strategy games on the planet! CKII's lovely combination of character developmentimmersive intruige
Great Strategy Game
This is one of the greatest games I have played. It marries a choose your own adventure game with the mechanics of a hardcore sim. Educational as well as fun. Make your own goals and discover that this game is as much fun failing as it is succeeding.
This game is fantastic. I play it endlessly and continue campaigns for game-generations. Choose a dynasty (small or large) and fight for power. There are various ways to approach this--whether you choose militarilypolticallyor any of the various other routes to power--that allow you to play to your enjoyment. Besides the fantastic base game
While having a rough learning curve at the very beginningCrusader Kings II is one of the best rpg simulator gamesand can really drag you in with its endless variables that lead to a different game every time you play. whether a count
As Crusader as it is King.
Two words: Zoroastrian wedding
One of my favorite games. This is a strategy/history gamebased on Medieval Europe. Unlike other grand strategy gamesyou don't control a country
this game is a time based strategy game. it is very fun. you have the choice of any king or duke in europe. you can expand your empirego on crusadesand marry hot people. when your leader dies you take on as his son.
wifekilling and warmongering simulator. would conquer europe as ethiopia again 10/10
This game is possibly the best grand strategy game of all timeimagine playing as a Game of Thrones character and trying to gain powerland
doges every where
GlitterhoofI appoint thee as Chancellor of the realm!'  - Me playing as the (custom) King of Austria who is a lunatic and just appointed his horse as chancellor through an event.   Played nearly 1000 hours and still finding amazing things.
Well I haven't spent a whole lot of time playing this game but time sure did fly when I did...When I first played I was very overwhelmed and confused just with all that I had at my control. The best way I started to enjoy this game was to tinker with everything and to see what happened. I have kept save files for all my heirs...that way I can always go back and change history or let a friend pick a save file to play from. This game to me does not have the RTS elements of starcraftshoguncommand and conquer etc. but has elements of Europa Universalis and Civilization. However I feel the intrigue
1600 hours played 1600 hours well spent.
This game is a marvel. It's amazingeasy to play and a great bridge towards Paradox's heavier gamesbut that dosen't mean this game isn't heavy as well
Best incest &amp family murdering simulator.- Omega
Wife your mother while having an affair with your niece after murdering your father and brother.
Thrown in with a wealth of real history (Including factual informationa and in game links to wikipages on important characters) this game is a deep and complex grand stratergy based on families and blood line. Conquest makes for a catalyst for power but to truely make ones mark they must delve into the socialeconomic and political innerworkings of their realms and neighbours.   Although the game has a set start and end date (Id recomment The old gods expantion as a must as it puts the start tade further back) there is still hours/days/weeks of fun in each campaignand when you think its all over
This game is amazingthe more you playthe more you learn. (I do recommend googling some stuff
Alright. This game is a simple humble ?/10.
Awesome gameif you have the DLCs. And it's a lot of DLCs.  Be sure to buy at discount but check the price of the last two main DLCsthat's where the stab comes usually.  Single-player is where the game reaches its full potential. Multiplayer is interesting and fun.
A medievaltwisted familypolitical drama
Great Game
A high learning curve but easily one of the best strategy games out there. Having to manage and grow your realmprotect your familymanage plots and schemes
As far as grand strategy games goit's hard to beat Crusader Kings II. The scopereplayability
I really can't recommend this game enough.    New game. Pagan. Marry. Wage war.    Every non-pagan around me wages war.    I lose eventually within 3 years.    King is killed.    Game over      9/8. Only played a few hours.
A whole load of fun if you have any affinity for history.
this game is very interesting and kept me playing for very long
This iswithout a doubtthe best game ever created.
There is no other game that has kept me occupied on and off for such a long period of time. Crusader Kings II offers endless replayability and is a crown jewel of the Grand Strategy genre. Be an Irish Lord with ambitions for greatness and turn your one county into the new Irish Empire of Britanniaor start as the all-powerful Emperor of Byzantium and restore the old Roman Empireoptions are limitless. I highly recommend CK2 to anyone who enjoys strategy games and/or history.
its not an action game or for everyonebut it can be very amusing. the ridiclous amout of DLC is my only complaint.    playing the game of thrones mod  stannis won   tyroin exectued  Sansa ended up marrying the mountian for some reason  that kind of amusing
This game is amazing you can play it for hours on end with out getting sick of it 11/10
Best Historically accuratefuncustomizable medieval game ever.
Joined a cultsummoned a monstersailed out in to the ocean alone and killed it. Woke up with the title 'Godslayer'. Accurate.
I've got 120 hours in this game and I still don't know how to play properly.  10/10.
Steepest learning curve I've experienced in a strategy gamebut totally worth it once you mastered the little stuffs. You never seem to stop learning how to play the game coz it gets really complicated as you progress. But all in allbest and hardest strategy game I've ever played. Extremely worth it!   - Player of Age of Empires
Absolutely amazing. You'll never know what will happen to you in Crusader Kings 2.  10/10
From turning some backwards Irish hillbilly clan into the kings of Western Europe to making a Norse Death-Pope that retakes the homeland for the Pantheon of Asgardthis game has a vast range of alternate histories and presents a ver fun experience.
Having riegned as the magnificent King of Bohemia for 15 yearsonly to die infirm and crippled in bedmy brother took to the throne. He lasted two years before his sister tried to depose him. She forced him to abidcate. The next King (her son) lasted three days before being forced to adbicate by his mothers sister.   The crown returned to the former monarch. He reigned for a month before being assassinated by his own son. That son took to the throne. Taking every town
It is an amazing gamehuge replayability. It is for ppl willing to put some hours in order to learn it...tons of dlc that don't add a lot besides the expansions..
This game has oneof the steepest learning curves of any game i have ever playedbut once you learn how to play this will be your go to game.
One of the best strategy games I have ever played44844
This is a very fun game for people who like more complex strategy of medieval timesbut the dlc is overpriced and too much money aside from that you have many fun things to do like making allies and marrying cousins and this game has some roleplaying mechinacs that make it even better this game desveres a 9.5 out of 10 because of the overpriced and some stupid dlc.
It's good to be the King
One of the best Paradox games. With all the DLC updates this game has converted in a HUGE game. Totally recomended if you like strategy games.
Highly engrossing. Now with the Old Gods expansion you can't put it down. Be everything from the Emperor of Rome to a landless Viking raiding the Irish coast and sacrificing hostage to Odin. What more could you want? Fantasy there is that to with the Game of Thrones mod.
Crusader Kings II is beyond a doubt one of the most immersive strategy games I have ever played. The sheer vastness of options is overwhelming and means that you will never be at a loss of things to do. Twisting history is one of the most rewarding aspects of the game. Want to form the empire of Brittania? You can do that.   There are hundreds of in game random events and the amount of time and effort you put into your characters makes you feel more immersed. In factwhen your beloved character dies after having ruled for 70 years you do feel somewhat saddened. The game definitely brings out emotionsuch as when your only male heir dies
This Game is awesome... very in-depth
The game is great. Prepare to spend countless hours trying to figure it out but once you do the game becomes amazing and offers a unique experience each time you play. Want to be Ghengis Khan and kick the crap out of eastern Europe? Want to be a Viking and pillage? How about join a Jihad to kick the Christian infidels from the Holy Land or join a crusade to save Jerusalem from the Muslim invaders? Do it. Its not flashy but the music goes along with the game and the music DLCs offer hours of great sounding music. Nothing like reforming the Roman Empire listening to the Songs of Byzantium DLC. Its a great game and can be found in a bundle pack for a good price. Paradox keep up the good work.
This is one of the best games I have ever played. If you like historical 'what-if?' simulatorsthen this game is for you. It allows you to play from 1066 to 1421 in full control of any country in medival europefrom England to the Byzantium Empire. It really is a awesome game
This is the best game I have ever played. Not a statement to be made lightly.  What sets Crusader Kings II apart from other strategy games is the simple fact that your country doesn't matter. This is a design choicebut it is also a huge plus. Once you realize thisthe game opens up and becomes immense fun.  So if your choosen country doesn't matter
Have you ever wanted to play a wonderful strategy game that didn't require you to go to war to advance in the world? If sothen this is the game for you. You can schemecheat
Yahafter like 470 hrs playing I still like this game. If you have the Europa converter you will have even more fun with the game. It becomes a giant map builder at that point. By itselfthis game is a story maker. Off your nephew
Epic gameplayEU taken to a new level. This is the way to go for future EU genre games to take. For now the game needs a better interface though. It is difficult to find your way through the horde of NPC and constructing a solid strategy for your House.  All in all a great game that can still be improved!
Great game! Much improved over Crusader Kings I. The game incoporates elements of a RPG in the middle agesand strategy. You have to manage your familycourt and realms. Lots of flexibility
If you enjoy long-strategy based gamesI'd purchase CK2. The DLC adds extra dimensions to the gameplay and the gameplay lends itself to that 'just a little longer' addiction. While the price and learning curb are steepif you have the $ and the time
Game of Thrones: The Game.
This is one of the most addictive strategy games I have every played.
A great game truly!
First of all let me just say that this game is the best strategy game I have ever played. No other game in which you control a civilisation or nation etc can come even close. The details and stories that come out of this game can be found in any review and give you ideas of just what can happen. The interface can be slightly tricky when you first start and it probably takes a couple of hours too truly understand the complex behaviour of other charactersincluding your own children. But you WILL get used to it and find it very well produced and easy to use when you get used to it.  The look of the game is perfectsimple enough in some aspects (that can be modded) yet enough detail in certain map modes (there are about 8 different map modes that you will be using really) to make it very pretty indeed.  Now for some stories... -Murdering your wife and son and banishing your daughter because your dad made you marry your aunt and your two children are inbred 8/10 -Raiding the lands of the Holy Roman Emperor who gets super mad and declares a Holy war against you and your pagan people. Almost dead then converting to Catholicism and joining the HRE for your grandchild to then become the Emperor yourself and then converting back to Norse Pagan and forcing half of the Empire to convert too 9/10 -Killing your disabled and wheelchair bound brother and then invading half of Germany because a fat German lass has taken pity on him and made spastic love creating an inbred devilspawn who somehow is the heir to your realm 10/10
If you're looking for a heavily detailed strategy game to get lost inthen look no further. Crusader Kings 2 is like an advanced version of Risk (advanced to a ballistic extent!) You not only have to manage the land which your dynasty controlsbut the crazy politics within your own family (they will assassinate each other to further their own interests
This is one of the best grand strategies ever. It has captured my attention and imagination for gods know how long. I love it. Everything about it is just brilliantaltough I think that paradox COULD stop with all the dlc-ing. So much money for sometimes SOOO little. But none-the-less I love it. If you are thinking about buying it you are crazyyou should've allready done it.
This game is some of the most fun I've had in a long time. Speaking as someone who enjoys the total war series as well as many other strategy titlesthis was a greatgreat buy. It's very much a strategy game (don't expect *to* much depth to the combat)
Somewhere between Grand Strategy games and Roleplaying Games sits Crusader Kings IIand it seems to be a quite comfortable place to be. This is one of those games that can suck you in for hours. Assuming the role of a European Noble (With more play options avalable via DLC)it becomes your task to manage both your lands and your dynasty.  This game is ultimately
My son became celebate and I was worried that he wouldn't produce an heirso I shagged his wife. Problem solved.  Get the DLCs if they go on sale - they really add a lot of depth to an already deep game.
Don't approach this game as an excercise in world dominationor with the idea that holding land makes you the winner. It is instead a family simulationwhere inheritance
Takes a little while to get used to the gamebut GREAT strategy and skill required to fully exploit the game
I have spent a ridiculous amount of time playing this. Seriously the amount of replayability is crazy        and the same game will never happen twice. Also fun to set goals for yourself        like my current game where I saw if I could unite all of Spain        and another where I set up my own AntiPope and (unsuccessfully) chipped away at the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Italy.  Get it        it is fun        you will have fun        and if you don't we have nothing further to discuss.the amount of replayability is crazy
This game is alot of fun and joy and it forces you to think like medival humans. Yea I'm going to marry away my daughter to a pervert so that I become allied with the holy roman empire. What could go wrong? Not likeFrance hating you and de-throning you for creating that daughter by sleeping with the kings wife. hehehe...
First play through was as a Jewish Count in the Byzantine empire. Became best friends with my superior but otherwise everyone despised me. My own assassin tried to kill me replaced him with my son Nin of house Jitsu.  Second playthrough rolled an Aztec Norseman bezerker warrior living in southern Ireland. Died to my wounds the moment the game started.   9/10
Longest game i've played in awhile you'll get fucked left right and centre from your allies        friends        family and whoever else can fuck you. It's an awesome game        addictive and so much to do! If you plan on playing this game        make sure you are prepared to give up your life        literally your real life. Anyway also this has to many expansions        not complaining it's just irratating because i think as owners of the game we should be given vouchers for discounts on them        you'll get fucked left right and centre from your allies
Do you want a life? A spouse? Children? If sodo NOT play this game.  Insanely detailed and FUN medieval nobility simulator. Historically accurate. Found a dynasty and play it until 1453 in Europeeast Asia and the African coast. Want to go on a crusade? Want to play as a merchant prince from Venice? Want to install your own pope? How about bringing the word of Allah to the benighted Christian lands?  Heck
My character died from depression. In battle. No reallyhe was leading a group of 3000+ fuck?? off tribal Prussian raiders into battle and he fucking died of depression in the middle of it. If that's not pure quality I don't know what is I mean Jesus Christ 7.5/10 not enough water.
No game has matched Crusader Kings II for it's ability to create fantastic emerging narratives. Truethere's a steep learning curvedeath hides behind most corners
Do not waste your time nor your money on this game. Like with paradox grand strategy games they base them off their Europa Universalis games. If you want a good grand strategy game just buy Europa. Crusader Kings 2 is just less game for more of your money.  Here is a video of somebody's opinions of the gamewhich are close to my own.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ZkO8CclhI&ampfeature=youtu.be
Once played an until I was an old hag who killed anyone that dares oppose her. It got so far that started killing my own children and grandchildren. Also once played as this king and went through hell and back to gain a megaton of land and power. Age reaches 82 and he gets senile and completely incapable of basic speechI watch as my right hand abuses that and gets all the titles he wants by claiming i agreed! Amazing game with massive learning curve that pays out very well. Definetly reccomend.
Never has there been a better map based drama filled thriller.
Amazing game with massive amounts of replay potential. It may seem a little difficult to get into at first but after those first few hours you'll be taking part in court-conspiracy with the best of them.
Play as one of the great people in history. Do things they never didlike plot to brutally murder their wife because the two of you haven't produced a son (The game ends before you could play as Henry VIII). Mess up their reputation and die of dysentery.    11/10 would die on the pooper again.
An amazing grand strategy and dynasty simulation.
Crusader Kings II is sort of a cross between Richard Dawkins' 'The Selfish Gene' and Niccolo Machiavelli's 'The Prince'. You play a dynastyand it's your job to make sure that dynasty survives and prospers by any means necessary - and if that includes marrying your daughters to the princes of foreign lands and then ensuring an unfortunate accident befalls said princesthen so be it. Just be warned that this game turns you into a terrible person
Really enjoyable game. Recommended.
You can become a Doge0/10 would play again
Best grand strategy game ever. Its RPG elements make it unique and fun in a bun. Its as historically accurate as you can get while still having a fun gameand the modding community is incredible. Game of thrones and Tamriel mods are out there and are just amazing.
Excellent game!! A little complex for those first diving into Paradox's well-known grand strategy genreso I would advise a small amount of research on Youtube before going into itotherwise you might be helplessly confused. But if you like the sounds of killing your wife to ensure your son's claim onto a throne
In my opinionthis game is one of the best I've ever played. The only downside is that about 50 % of the game needs to be bought as DLC.
One of the best games ever
very in depth.................love it
You should play Crusader Kings. It has the best live-action trailer series. Wroth  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpAYY3BvviE  Envy  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cle3Vxjl5Vc  Greed  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xIxrx5i1To  Sloth  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kX5ggw5AIU  Lust  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1BVW14qXNE  Pride  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCQRIl9McAU
This is the deepestmost fun strategy game I have ever chanced across. The learning curve is steepbut it's one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've ever had.
This game has a very high learning curve and takes a lot of patients but once you figure it out it is very rewarding and a ton of fun.
This is definitely the best Paradox game I've played. Have owned EU3 and HOI3and this blows both out of the water. The concept is great- basically guiding a family throughout the medieval times. Expand your power by pressing your claims by waging warmarrying your family to another
I highly recommend Purchasing this game. A true must play for grand strategy fansor anyone who is a major euro-centric history lover like myself.
This game made me buy ten acres of land and marry my cousin.   10/10
Perhaps the greatest strategy game of all time. Buy
Easily one of the best games I have ever purchased. For once I can say without a doubt buying the DLCs and expansions is worth it as well.   10/10
4/5  Medieval chess.  Buy.
A little hard to learn but once you've mastered the game it becomes something unexplainableamazingastonishing...
assassinated my own Mother 10/10
Not so much a game as a scenario generator set in feudal era Europe. The point of the game is to keep your family legacy alivewith anything else you achieve in the meantime bolstering your end game score. How you choose to grow that legacy depends upon your ambitionthe intentions of those around you
come play Crusader Kings II my'lord
The greatest 'Grand Strategy' game ever produced. It doesn't exist a game which achieves this qualityhistorical reference and complexity.  I played it more than 1'100 hours and I'm far away to get tired of playing Crusader Kings II and I'm very far away of having played all the interesting kingdomsclans or religions.   Each game differs so much from the last one. The dynasty mustn't die out - to marry the right wife is essential in order of a successor and strategic alliances. Subordinated nobility aspires as much my crown as legitimated successors or relatives. Where is the greatest danger? A rising neighbour
Get thisyou need never play anything else again. Except maybe the expansions.
Possibly the best game made by Paradoxyeseven better than EU IV.Unlike the aforementioned
Best game ever. Over 200 hrs under the belt and still cant get enough of it. Also great with friendscan be serious and fun good mix of cuning and strategy.
Laxman Vs Manfredwho will win? You decide!
Crusader Kings II is what I would consider as a 'hyper realistic strategy game as it's a game that you will most likely lose at the first few times. This game's learning curve is massiveas is it's replayablity if you can over come the learning curve. This game is rather well crafted though
I don't even own this game and i can write a review
This is simply one of the best games you can ever play. I didn't expect it when I started it and the videos of gameplay don't do it justice but this is the height of strategy gaming.
Very great and deep game. When you understand how to play it you will be greatly rewarded.
Incredibly complexand all the more rewarding for it. Also check out the Game of Thrones mod!
An amazing gamewell worth the moneyeven if some of the DLC is overpriced. Multiplayer is quite bugged
It is not too bad.
There are so many options when starting a new game and that's not even including the multitude of mods available. From the seemingly endless cultures and variety of religions your charcter can have to playing as a new character every time you die (no achivements for that one of course) you can enjoy many hours of gameplay. There is something mesmerizing about this game that keeps me for one wanting more and more.
Had to bone the pope to get granted a divorce.  11/10
The game that makes you yell things like 'How hard can it be to kill a baby?!' out loud. 10/10
Really complex and inaccessiblebut totally worth it if you invest the time.
1776/10  Excellentthe historical feels and ability to play as the Emperor of Brittania in 1066 as an Aztec-cultured ethnic Norse Muslim makes it quite the game.
Before Crusader Kings III never dreamed that plotting the downfall of your parentsspouses
Very good midevil strategy game.  10/10
Fantastic game! Do not be fooled by the huge amount of DLCmost of it is cosmetic and the rest is definately worth the price when there is a sale going on. Updated are many and often enough to make returning periodically to the game after a long-ish while an extremely fun experience.   My rating: 8/10 for the base game9/10 for the game plus the extensions I've decided to purchase and the mods i've installed.
Replay value= 10/10. No two playthroughs are the same even if you pick the same person.
Havn't played muchbut from what I have... I've experiened what it's like to impregnate all of irelandincluding all my family... So that was cool.
17 months and 90 hours later the awful truth is much too obvious... I wouldn't last a week as someone important in the middle ages without absurd amounts of luck/save scumming... Once I managed to get myself killedstill as a childafter losing pretty much all of my lands to Moors and Spanish (Well
Paradox' second entry in their medieval dynasty simulator series continues to provide brilliant emergent narrative from complex interconnected systems. It often makes mistakes incredible funlike when I had my stupid Sicilian King cheat on his wifewho happened to be his spymaster. He made one of the classic blunders: never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line. Needless to say
1
Awsome.Takes a little time to learn but overall very good. best paeadox game ever!
Although the learning curve proved to be slightly steeper than the Europa Universalis gamesthere is nothing like that feeling of realizing that at any given moment you find out what something actually doesyou now have gained a deeper understanding of this game. Though this happens pretty often
fucking hate this game. 9/10
It's great how at the start you have no idea what you're doingthe next game you barely know what to doin your third game you can do things by yourself
its aight
This is one of my all time favorite games. I can't even guess the number of hours I spent playing. I recently purchased two copies on Steam so that I could play multiplayer with my son who lives out of state. Multiplayer made CKa game I already thought to be the best of the besteven better! It was a fantastic experience.
It is rather easy to exploit the systemand yet it is the most realistic strategy game i've ever played.
One of the best games out there it does have a steep learning curv but eventually you can get the hang of it.
I really really tried to like this game. It's well madevery in depthvery complicated
Deep character-focused diplomacy and political modelpretty much Game of Thrones with less incest.
Started as the King of Poland in 1066 and became the Wendish Emperor. Executed all my weak sons in favour of my one strong and genius son so he could conquer all of eastern Europe.  He died 2 years into his rule and was succeeded by an inbred imbecile who reigned for 60 years before dying heirless and ending my game.  10/10.
yeahman is good ok get this box out my face
The best Karling assasination and wincest simulator I have played
People who do not like this game are bad and should kill themselves.
This is hands down my fav Paradox Game/Strategy game of all time. Its rich in immersiontacticsflavorful history
This game
11/10 Would incest again.
Seems like an interesting gamebut unfortunately haven't really played it much.
Unstablebut very very good. Will probably crash from time to timebut that will be more than worth it. Better than EUIV.
Deepcomplexwonderful and not for everyone
I literally cannot play anything else. Even if I go on a binge with another game I always come back and play regularily.
This isperhapsone of the most addictive Grand Strategy games ever in existence. If you have the time to get used to the game
Over 800 hours on CK IIprobably 200+ hours on CK I...and I have never yet played a full game from start to finish. Just to many options to exploreto many 'what if' scenarios come to mind
Best strategy game currently available. This game scores very high on depthinteresting themesatisfaction
With the time I spent on this game I could have obtained a Bacherlor's Degree. I regret nothing.
Countless hours of political string-pulling and well placed bribes makes progression within the game extremely satisfying. DLC is fun and adds value (except ruler designerdon't bother with that one).  10/10 Don't get frustrated by steep learning curve. This game is worth listening to an hour or so of youtube tutorials.
AWESOME mass-strategy! Change the fate of the world in many more than just war but also intrigue! The roleplay aspect as well as the deep familyreligion and state politics is every-intriguingand the posibilities are near endless in this game of lord and emperors and even popes!  I highly recommend this for those who love RPG elements as well as world changing abilities and very very deep strategy!
One of the best games ever.
Best strategy game in the last 10 years?
I don't write a lot of game reviewsbut I really had to review this one. This is one of the best strategy games I have ever playedalthough it is not a game without its quirks and flaws
for history nerds who like incest and genocide :)
great game:) reccomended to all :)
1as you can see i put 'a few' hours into this game already.. but I dont think I tried that many nations yet... not even play as republic and just started my first pagan game (romuva) dont let make you ppl belive the base game is some of kind of ripoff... you get hunders of hours out of itnot one game is the same  2
Great game if you want to play a Game of Throne type of gamelots of backstabings and politicsi love games that don't just focus on military/war. This game is just another level of gameply
What this guy said   http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/23/wot-i-think-crusader-kings-ii/#more-95722
Fascinating and addictive strategy game focusing on building a medieval dynasty. There are no real goals so you're free to do pretty much as you like. I'd recommend watching a couple of quick YouTube tutorials and then you're off. Also check out the excellent Game of Thrones complete mod for this. Incest isn't THE reason to buy this gamemind youbut it is A reason.
Crusader Kings II is not for people who hate loosing. Because you will loose. Alot.   As with real life Crusader Kings II makes the game both a challenge to create and maintain large empires. In crusader kings 2 it is not good enough to create a giant empire that spans the globeyou have to make sure that you also rule it.  While many good 4x style games focus on military warfarecrusader kings II focuses on the other end intrigue. It is a refreshing to see a game give players a full compilment of political options instead of military ones.  Unfortunately
I bought the game only a few months after it came outso I've seen how the game has evolved over the years with the constant free updates the game has recieved. I can honestly say that most of the changes were for the betterexecpt for the borking of the assassination system. Still
A fabulous grand strategy game. I've found a lot of paradox's previous games a bit ugly and clunky but thisalongside its sister game Europa Universalis IV is a visual and aural feast-a-plentyand a rich depth of gameplay. This is with a BUT though... I'm not so fond of paradox's dlc policy and can only recommend getting the majority when on sale as its nearly bordering on EA's cheeky pricing policy for BF4.. but other than that
Jesus gives military advice +20 marshal  11/10
Pros: -Depth of the gameplay is amazing play anything from a count in some county you never heard ofall the way to the Emporor of any empiresome of which never existed. But if you have the strategy and the will to execute it
Great Gamegot me into paradox!
Do not buy this game. You will become a incestuous vampire who is secretly bangin' his sistersecretly plotting to kill his brotherand has already taken his neighbors wife as a concubine.                                                                                               Best game ever.
It is what you expectand more. Make your way from a count to an emperor. DLCSSSS are insanecant help to buy it though.
Played as the Kingdom of Castille. Was helping my Leonese brethren with a rebellionwhen he decided it would be best to assassinate me. I began playing as the supreme ruler of both countriesuntil my one year old daughter hatched out a plan to assassinate me
Played game with friendsI no longer have family 10/10
Falling behind in school and grades dropping but it's ok because Asturias dominates the Muslims
A really interesting turn based total war (minus the battle control) style strategy game. What they lack in battle control of the total war series they make up for in the rest of the game however. It's vastly more complicated and confusing to start but with a bit of online research and trial and error it makes for a really rewarding gameplay experience.
The game of thrones mod is ultimately more fun than the base game.
Installed the Game of Thrones modwas a badass Dragon Rider warrior who was constantly burning down other rulers lands and destroying their castles. Got killeddaughter inherited
I have no idea what I'm doingbut I pushed my fuck son off a balcony to secure my spot on the throneonly to pushed off a week later by a scheming brother. This game is wonderfully complex
I believe my play time says it all.
The perfect strategy gamegiving you not only the tools to shape the course of historybut also through engaging and innovative character motivated gameplay also gives a reason to do just that.  This game remains one of the greatest games of all time in my opinion.
I don't condone the insatiable hunger for DLC money that Paradox seems to have for this game. However I cannot deny thatas of writingthis is my most played game on Steam and for good reason.  I highly recommend this game to anyone.
Family Incest Simulator II is the best midevil simulator.
I don't know what's better. Being an animalisticcruel incest-loving pagan king or real life. After much deep thoughtI thought the former's more me.
if you have tactical genius you will love this game.
My fatherthe Count of Vermandoishad - through judicious marriage policy - won a Duchy for his only son
What have you done I cant stop playing incest simulator 2014.' - A friend that I gave a coupon for this to.
This is one of the games I have put the most hours in in my whole lifetime. It is initially hard to learnbut once you get the basics the learning process is part of the fun: You really notice you get better over time and get a sense of accomplishment.   For everyone that likes more complicated strategy games: Buybuy
To anyone who writes long reviewsI'll do the same thing that i did to my saxon sister. Let's say my child is inbred.
Guide a dynasty in its bid for powercreate your own goals and see them come to fruitionexecute the heathen prisoner
great game for a history buff that likes to create his own dynasty.
One of the best games i played so far. Huge recommendation!!!
Its good to be the king.
I enjoy this game. I REALLY want to love it- but honestlyI just find it so difficult! Perhaps it's just because I lack a talent for the more martial/technical aspects of the gamebut it seems that
Fun and realistic game. I have used alot of hours in this gameand you don't even feel you have been playing very long even if you have. And alsoyou can download a Game of Thrones mod!! How cool is that!?
Who needs friends when you can plot to overthrow your liege lord?
Great game. Complexfrustrating at times and very engaging. For someone with a intrest in dynasty-management this is well worth your money.
Highly recommended game. This is my first among Paradox's gamesand I have to say I am hooked. Well worth the buy!
Brilliantfun and intriguing grand-strategy-game about starting small or big whichever you prefer and build your family name and make allies to counquer EuropeAsia and North Africa.  The game is set in medieval times and is very accurate on history as you proceed through the game. The game is very hard to understand in the beginning
Imprisoned a little girl for all of her life inside of my dungeon. 9/10 pretty exciting
A lot of fun!
I really tried playing Rome: Total War and Medieval 2 Total War again after playing this game. I really tried.  Pros:  - super in-depth gamegreat for history nuts - insanely addictive - lots of DLC creates a great deal of variety for the game  Cons: - even though there is a lot of DLC for this titlesome of them are priced a bit too high for what they are (such as the portraits add-ons) - France (seriously
I like when you can unpause the game and stuff happens.
-King of Georgia -Captures Islamic region to the east. Secures kingdom and makes sure every vassal is happy -Dies a happy death knowing he did well -Second king of Georgia -Expands further eastward into readily available Islamic realm -Crushes islamic realm twice -Islamic realm destroyedkingdom of Georgia restored to its full extent -Notice nearby independent duke (my cousin) might inherit one of my regions if the current liege dies without heirs -Declare war on cousin. Crush him. -Notice I can use the 'holy war' casus belli with anyone I want -Crush tribes to the northexpand into nearby duchy
A very good game for those who enjoy the viking to medieval eras of europe northern africa and the middle east. Pick a person to emulate and try to be the very best like no one ever was. Kill all your enemies and seduce all the women in the kingdom with your super amazing charms!. Political intrigue and etc etc etctheres alot ot offer from this game and its complex but less so then europa in my opinion which will make it more accessible to those new to the grand strategy genre as it focuses more on the interactions between the characters you control and those around you. I wouldnt recommend that you buy this game without any dlc like I did as it made it a huge hassle later down the line to buy every single dlc seperately. This game will frequently be on sale for 75% off and more and you should purchase it along with all of its dlcs at the same time to get the best experience from the gameyou can exclude the ebooks if you dont plan on reading them. A must own for fans of medieval history and 'what ifs' like me who want to see what could of happened  10/10
You thereever wanted to be king of some weird kingdom you didn't even know existed. This is the game for you.  I've been playing this game for about 3 weeks now and i'm almost getting a picture on how to play this game and I'm still very unsure if im doing anything right yet.  The game is very broad as you can play from a lot of different perspectives from history and you get the ultimate choice of altering history. Note this though you are not trying to conquer the world to begin withfirst you are trying to get an heir secured to take your land after your death to be able to continue
you haven't truly lived until your reformed slavic empire conquered Englandburnt Rome and defended itself from Mongol and Aztec invasions
if you want your plants to die and your other video games to gather dust then this is the game for you its a good game....a very good game where you can kill other kings/emperors/dukes ect and make your family legandary or die horrably trying...  10/10 would be pushed off the battlements of my castle to my doom again
Ruled the glorious Russian Empire as a drunken homosexual craven mastermind. 10/10
Crusader Kings 2 is an amazing game it tends to be very hard to learn but like all paradox games makes you want to play it again and again it's very in depth and all about keeping your dynasty alive going from a count to a duke to King and finally a emperor it's an amazing time wasting and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn to play grand strategy!
Crusader Kings II is one of those games youll lose your life to or forget about after fifteen minutes. The developerParadoxis known for making insanely complicated games that translate to two important facts: 1) Their games have a ton of depth and 2) They are incredibly difficult to penetrate. Crusader Kings II is likely one of the more approachable games from the Paradox catalog
Outstanding game. Love the depth and the ability to start as a DUke or Baron and work your way up to King and even emporer.
I have played this game for a little bit now and have loved every bit of it.
Would I recommend this game?... Abso-freakin'-lutely!!! I've put in hundreds of hours into this game and I still haven't even attempted a fraction of the things that are possible in this game. I still haven't even played as a muslim character! In my most recent game I started out as a Jarl (norse duke) in Norway.

Crusader Kings II is a grand strategy game that will suck you in. There is a lot going onwhich is overwhelming at firstbut allows you to play the game exactly how you want to. You'll be able to steer your own story in medieval Europe
So where to begin... This has easily become my favorite game on Steam. At the time of this review im holding almost 500 hours of play timeworking on a full months worth of timededicated to this game so I think it goes without saying
Killed half of my extended family to inherit a single countynot even the children were spared. 10/10 would kinslay again.
It has wenches.
It's totally awesome when it comes to pretending to be whoever you want in the medieval era.
there is really nothing bad to say about this game. If you like historical strategy gamescrusader kings 2 is for you. between managing your dynastykeeping your vassals happy
A short list of some of the things I have done in Crusader Kings II.  -Gotten into a war with a child -Had an affair with my son's wife -Assassinated my son because he wanted to lower crown authority -Betrothed my 10 year old son to a 23 year old woman because I knew I would be playing as him eventually -Executed some Normans -Gone to a feast and made merry with someone I was plotting to kill -Named my son 'Prawn' so he would become 'King Prawn' -Gone insane and died  All that without leaving Britain!   10/10
this is the most tolerant game i have ever played i love obama
Great game. Buy it.
I absolutely love this game and I recommend it greatly!!!!!!!!!!!!! I absolutely love it!
Prepare to put a lot of hours into this game and its expansions/mods
Basically The Sims but with fighting and sex. Waitthat's still The Sims.
One of the best games i have ever played.
If you like strategy and murdering others to advance in the world this is the game for you. I like how you can even plot to get rid of your emperor or king.
Best middle age game i own it's got a lot of great feactures.
What can I say about a game that I have put more than 300 hours into? I love how this game plays. I love how this game feels. I love how this game makes you have to think a few steps ahead. I love every second that I am playing it. Paradox havn't made a game that I havn't enjoyed and this one wasn't any exception.   If the base game isn't fantasy enough for youthankfully the moding community has your fix. WIth the Eldar Scrolls mod and the Game of Thrones mode I can get just my type of Fantasy based intrigue in whenever I have the time to spend time I should be doing something else.
not half bad
started as a merchant republic went to war with byzantium  lost had to pay 780 in repuations  took 10 years to get back to 0 10/10 play again
this game is greathonestly never found anything like it. Great for Rps and Multiplayer fun. Great Communitywould reccomend to anyone who likes history or playing war games
playing ck2 is like constantly going to the doctor's and being told you have hemorrhoids
Best Role-Play Grabd Strategy game out thereit lets you look throught the perspectives of many Cultures and makes you feel that you are the character. I really recommend this game.
Once upon a time Poland had a Kingwho was a brilliant strategist and a great diplomat. He married a princess from Norway and had a son. Soon it was time to convert the neighbouring pagans to the one true religion and so the King declared a holy war upon the neighbouring pagan states. The Polish armies fought united under the King's banner. Victory was at hand... but thena tragedy struck! In a cruel twist of fate
Well um.. yes crusader kings is  g...good?  um.. uh... yes very....uh... addictive? but uh..... CHECKMATE
I wasted hundreds of hours on this. I will waste a hundred more.
Nobody does Grand Strategy like Paradoxand this game is a clear example of that. Combining RPG elements like a plethora of Leader stats and traitsParadox brings this time period where court politics may have been as important as armies to life. You will deal with threats from inside your kingdom and out as you assemble your empire in this easy to learn
A fantastic addition to any Grand Strategy gamer's arsenal. Play as your ancestors or even people you've never heard ofit doesn't matter. 10/10 would recommend to all my friends.
one of the best game i playedi like how its more focus on administration rather than conquest since i prefer controlling my country rather than battles.. 10/10 would do incest and slay heathens
What more is there to say that hasn't been said already about this game?  CK2 is a game that tells the story of your family while you build your empire. It's got an extremely steep learning curve and when I started it up for the first time I was immediately overwhelmed by the number of features and lack of anyone telling me what to do. But that has also turned out in the long run to be its greatest strength and the reason I have put 560+ hours into this game. You decide what you want to do. Want to restore the Roman Empire? Sure. Take your Norse Viking raiders south and sack Venice? Why not? Mend The Great Schism and see Christianity as the dominant religion across EuropeNorth Africa and the Middle East? You can do that too.  All those possibilities and more are within the core game itself. Then come the limitless options that the mod community have created for CK2. The ease of modding that Paradox has allowed and nurtured has spawned a great many mods that play like their own full game.   Bottom line is that this game is complex and overwhelming in the beginning (enough so that I didn't pick up the game again until days later after my first attempt) but well worth the learning curve and provides great value and entertainment.
I have play over 300 hours in to this game every time its different so many people you can play as plus alot of DLC and alot of events one of the best games out there with deep play
Not many startegies possiblebecause the game mechanics are a bit shallow. Every country plays more or less the same.  Everytime a king diesyou need to resecure the peace in the kingdom and it fels like it always need to be done over and over again. Getting more complicated as the country grows.  Not bad
Killing inept children so your strangely perfect youngest can rule has never been so fun
Brutal. And I'm not just saying its awsome or fuckit's really freaking brutal. It gives no quarter every little thing you do is potentialy apocalipticor sometimes fenomenal. You need to plan think and think and think and pray hard as hell that some other idiot doesnt  up everything you planned just cause he doesnt like ya... It's dense and dificult and when you achieve something is soooooo rewarding that even the little stupid things you get done right are a major big deal
Easy to mod and very vast gameplay and replayabilityrecommend it.
I was expecting a dry strategy game that contained crusades and/or kings.  I got blood sacrifices to Odininvisible leprechaunshorse-chancellors
Spent over 400 years building an empire in Russia to rival the Byzantines.  Lost it all to the Mongols over the course of a few months.  10/10 would fall to the Mongols again.
Intensely addictive. One of those games that you load up...then suddenly realize 3 hours have gone by.  Don't be intimidated by the number of buttons and options. Do the tutorial to learn the very basicsand just un-pause the game!
Fun gamediverse ways of playingepic feel
only marry geniuses. have brilliant children. have genius children marry each other and make more inbred geniuses. inbred simulator 1278. potato/10
My most favorite game. Sadly I haven`t managed to play it for 1000 hours yet.
Not Holy or Romanbut definitely an empire.
Very complex strategy game based on feudalism politicsespcially recommend if you've ever wanted to imprison (or assassinate) your wife because she's plotting to kill your son...
For those that always wanted more depth to the likes of Civ and Total War. A Strategy game with a large emphasis on family and continuing your Dynasty! Alliancesstrategic marriages andof course
The game is fun and the only dlc you need for sure is the old godsthe rest is optional and most are pure cosmetic so do not feel discouraged by the amont and price of all dlc. I personally have something like 6 or 7 of dlc - all those which are useful and bought on sale for 2 euro each.
I love this game and thank paradox for making it i wish there were more games like this.
One of the best strategy games i ever played! 10/10
Family murder simulator 2012  Also Crusades and Incest I guess.
Addicting. A bit of a tough learning curve at first but definitely rewarding. The developers have a wicked sense of humor and I love it.
Awesome game.
Love this game super addicting
One of the best games I have ever played. 10/10 would get fucked over by succecsion crisis again.
This game can offer coutless hours of entertainment to the right audience. This game if for people with patienceand like strategy games. The beginning can be a bit complicated to new players and will probably take some time to get used to. But once you doyou rewrite history. Either as the Emporer of The Holy Roman Empire
Great Game. Best game of history strategy so far.  The number of strategical options are not limited Yet I only hope they add battle management systems ... something like empire total war battles will make this game the best.
Great RTS and always on sale so you might as well get it anyways.
This game is great. If you like grand conquer the world strategy games like Europa Universalis this is for you.   My only complaint is that the collection doesn't include all the dlc. Kinda lame. Definitely get The Old Gods expansion because you can start the game 400 years earlier.   Also get the game converter because once you finish this game you can convert your save and play your empire in Europa Universalis 4. Which if you're like me you bought already.
Killed my wife after she slept with my brother.  Would kill again.  10/10
I went into this game not expecting much..... and i proceeded to play one of the best games i have ever played. in CKii you can play as any noble in europe/parts of Asia and Africa in any time between 1066 and 1446. If you have ever watched Game of Thronesor read a Song of Ice and Firethen you can expand on the thousands of hours of fun with an adventyre into Westeros. If you can afford the 40$
I married off a 0 year old newborn to a 50 year old guy with syphlius! I have over 3000 family members! Buy the game now!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You can probably add about 200 additional hours to the time listed on my profile. I bought this recently after having a 'review' (ahem) copy for a while. What can I say that hasn't already been said? This game is like a hybridrole-playing/grand strategy game. You are roleplaying as a dynasty during the middle agesand your goal is to...welldo whatever the hell you want to do. Want to paint the map in your country's preferred color? Check. Want to reform the Roman Empire? Check. Want to invite nobles to parties
One of the best grand strategy games there isbut also one of the ones with the steepest learning curves if you are a beginner. If you have played Europa Universalis or other Paradox gamesthis is for you. It's pretty rough to get into
CK2 is amazing. You will have a blast playing this game if you enjoy strategy gamesespecially those that require patience and planning. If you read the negative reviews you will realize that 80% of them are just complaining about the cosmetic DLC's. Don't buy them. Worked for me. The other DLC's added significant content and kept the game fresh to long time players.  Betrothed your 4 year old matrilineally to the 8th in line to the Bulgarian crown? Start assasinating that line and you just might have control of the kingdom in 25 years. In the meantime attack your stronger neighbor who just lost their levies in a war using the allies you gained by marrying off your sisters.  Go from a lowly Irish count to Emperor of the British Isles. Then watch it be torn asunder as your heir dies of tuburcolosis and your uncles declare war for the crown.
If you're into historycharacter developmentand have plenty of patience you'll love it. It is truly remarkable what you can do in this game. The stories that are told are just incredible. Lead your character to glory or ruin
Pros: -Great as an engine for alt-history emergent storytelling.  -Very easy to become invested in.  -Many of the systems that seem incomprehensible at first are actually pretty simple with a little experience. So there's a good sense of reward when it comes to system mastery.  Cons: -Steep learning curve. I think it took some fifteen multiplayer hours before the friend I was teaching this game got a real hold on how to do things in gameand even at that point he still kept declaring wars for claimants that did not matter.  -While it is satisfying to expand the domain of your kingdom/empire early in the gamethe late game tends to become really easy and it can be easy to become disengaged.
By far the best game I've bought from steam. What I like about it is that you have so much depth placed on the individual ruler more depth than even The Sims really. You can basically do just about anything with your ruler and you will see the consquences whether positive or negative. Plus you can completly alter history in many ways: warsexmarriages
Quite simply the best game I have ever played.
Its been an uphill battle getting my friends onto this gameand I completely understand why. The amount of information tossed at you puts old school text games to shameA very specific but overloaded UI will take you a very long time to understand all the features
If you're looking for a realistic historical stategy gameor to simply live your dream as a medieval rulerthis game is for you. It's not as inaccessiable as one may first think. And it puts you right into the dynasty game.   The amount of history you experience by playing this game is fascinating. Your options are immense. Not out to conquer the world? Simply play your dynasty
Got it for free. 2 hours later I have no idea what I'm doing.
Trained awesome son and heir.  Typhoid ravages Kingdom.  Son diesget left with awful heir.  Ruler becomes incapable.  11/10 would lead troops again.
Love this gamenot really a fan of all the add on content. Gameplay can be pretty slowmore or less a medieval political simulator. If you don't like the 1000ad era check out Hearts of Iron
Played the tutorialstill don't know what to dobut I still love this game so far.
Map the game. This game is great if you want to be a sociopathic meglomaniac and fulfil all your dreams to conquer Europe.
Pretty Dank. The Good Dank
Played it for the 'A Game of Thrones' Mod. Love it. Also played some India and Jewish (African) Dynasties. The best Game for 'Game of Thrones / Song of Ice and Fire - Fans
Great for avid history playersthis is a quality game and DOES take time to understandbut it well worth it. The DLC is also well priced and adds great detail into the base game.  Would reccommend to any historians
Paradox game are games that made you forget your real life
Absolutely fascinating game. You can elaborately plot and scheme because the mechanics allow itbut don't neccesarily lay it out for you. I'll give you an example. I built an empire and installed an antipope in Rome. The previous pope was a personal friend of mineso after he was displaced I accepted him into my court.  Because he was a celibate
Started out in Iceland. Became Jarl of Icelandthen King of Norwayfollowed by Denmark and Scotland. Vassalized Sweden and became the Emperor of Scandinavia. Married Byzantine Princess. Her father died and older brother became Emperor of Byzantines. He and his other 5 brothers all died from 'mysterious' circumstances
I once made an Irish Hindu Finland. A+
YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING IN THIS WOW ITS JUST SO SO CHALLENGING BUT IF YOU GET IT IS IT HOURS AND HOURS OF FUN
I should have had a 1000 plus hours with this beauty right here since I played this since last yearAlas I was poor as dirt as well as living in a third world country where people play DOTA more than rare gems such as this. And yes I torrented this gamesue me
This game will steal your lifebut in a good way. This is a game that is not so much about winningbut perservering and enjoying the chaos your attemps at supremacy will cause.  I think of CKII as a massive shift from the Civilization series. You're not an omnipotent godlike ruler able to micromanage and do whatever you want
All my offspring are idiots and my wife is past childbearing age.  The wife of one of my vassels is a 16 year old genius....  I guess it's time to speak to my very good friend the pope about removing my wifeand my spymaster about removing my poor vassels head.....
While playing this game I have had a few thoughts..  ..trying to take over the world sounds easybut isnt.. ..wowI feel like a dog breeder when choosing a spouse
The Europe Universalis is a perfect game. This Game is more then perfect....   Crusader Kings 2 I LOVE YOU SO MUCH &lt3 &lt3 &lt3
Without a doubt the best game I own on Steam.
Considering that I've got more than a month of real time put into this gameI can definitely say I recommend it. However I should note that the vast majority of that time comes not from playing the base game (which is decent) but was actually spent playing the stellar Game of Thrones mod. It's literally better than any of the actual GoT games. Seriouslycheck it out.
Worth the time to learn how to play. Its a game that just keeps on giving.
Steep learning curvebut if you like the thought of maniliplating historyand would like to learn why so many pointless wars occur....... I highly recommend..
A bit of a learning curve but highly addictive once you know the basics. Check out some newbie or lets play videos on youtube and you are set.  The replay value is immensebeing able to start in several eras and as a huge amount of leaders (kingscounts etc) in each era
This game takes longer to learn than most gamesdue to its complexity I hated this game when I first started playing it. After a little while I loved itcharacter roleplaying and governmental management combined beautifully. This is a smooth game and it only gets more fun with the DLCs I've had this game for almost a year and I still play it. I wish they would make a Crusader Kings DLC for ancient Mesopotamia and other Ancient power struggles.
Poeple may say that this game was created to suck money out of our pockets...Well this game is also one of the best games I have ever played (Fallout is my favorite but this is a good 5). Its addicting as hellit gives you a lot of replayablilityand in most cases the game is random so you may have a massive Norse Empire on one game while on another you may have a bunch of warring Norse states just becuase of one event. If you really want to have a challenge or Fun
Easily one of the best purchases I've ever made on steam. Although I've only sunk about 400 hours into the game it feels like a lot more than thatand that's a good thing.   The level of management and the depth of political intrigue and maintaining diplomatic relations through marriages and inheritances is amazing. Not only that but the variotions on play are staggering. Playing as a Catholic King is vastly different from playing as a Merchant Republic or a Raja. Another fantastic Grand Strategy game made by Paradox that is contantly updated and rebalanced.   The only thing is that there are a ton of DLC for the gameand they change the gameplay fairly significantly
A rare and mesmerizing blend of strategysimulationroleplay
10/10 would murder parents again
Cant recommend this game enough.
Literally one of the bestif not the best Medieval grand strategy game of all time.
It's real good
I bought this game a week ago during the winter sale. At first I rage quit multiple timesbut when I made the effort to learn the gameit was easily worth it. Now 100 hours into it
Few minutes inI get blown up in a tavern  10/10 would blow up again  In all seriousnessthis is very fun and challenging. I doubt I scraped the surface yet
it's alright.
Best family sim ever.
Basically a easy paradox game for those wanting to get into their gamesstart here
Very hard to understand at firstbut once you get the idea its such a good game!
Marry a girl. Fall in love... With a different girl. Ignore your wife. Have a child. Why's he black? Kill your wife. Go to war. Kick some . Marry another girl. Have a son. Homosexuality is hereditary? Kill the brat. Legitimize your fuck. Conqure some land. Die a painful death. Watch your fuck son lose half the kingdom. Repeat the process.  So many fun things to do in this game :3
It is the best strategy game ever made !
If you like grand strategy this is definitly a good game to have a look at. It starts off very complex and detailed but the more you play the more you get drawn into the strategy behind the game. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge and likes strategy game.
An astounding strategy game that offers loads of enjoyment.
Stay as far away as possible. This game will ruin your life in the most disturbing ways imaginable. Just today I found myself resisting the urge to assassinate my own mother by having her explode in a hailstrom of fiery manure because of the benefits I would gain by usurping power in my house. Thisand many other sick and twisted thoughts have been engrained into my mind by this incredibly addictingwholly irresistable game. Do the right thing
Helped my liege kill his wife so he could marry my daughter.  After they got marriedI seduced his daughter from the previous marriage and turned her into one of my 12 lovers. My daughter blackmailed me into paying her so I could keep sleeping with her step-daughter without my liege knowing. My liege's daughter gives birth to my fuck child 3 days before her would-be-husband turns 16. Liege declares war of aggression on me Have to take out huge loan from jews then banish them to hire mercenaries and stay alive Die randomly from stress caused by having 12 lovers 10/10
Todayi looked at my son in real life and considered hiring an assassin and wondering whoelse in my family might conspire with mesimply because he had the last chocolate bar and i was worried he was becoming too powerful in my own home. I think it's time i put this game down....oooh new dlc...
The pope is raising my son.
My King ruled in Kiev. Peasents kept revoltingbut I put them down. Took over 1 neigbouring tribe. Cheated on my wife when she went to the convent. I made my child a illegitamate fuck. After seven years of rulingmy servants were tipped off and gave me a bath. During the bath they pushed me under and I was drowned.  I also forgot to make a hier.  10/10.

Live out all your sick incest fantasies in this charming dynasty simulator from Paradox. There is nothing quite like owning a harem of Norwegian princesses and still lusting after your hunchback sister.
Played it like one timewife got seduced by inbredlunatic
Ohthis game. This game is beautiful.   It's not in graphics or in gameplayreally. Nor in the story the game tells you.  No
19 years after I start my entire family is assassinated by a 3 year old. 10/10
i have a humble amount of 50 hours on record. normally this is more than enough to start understand a game. But i literally have no clue how to play this.
An excellent game from the strategy/role-playing/simulation/religion/murder/incest genre.
Crusader Kings is when your homosexual character has 10 legit offspring plus 6 fucks. And your lustful straight brother bears no children.  10/10 would be gay
I married a random west francian princess for prestige and an alliance. They fell in love and had a child who was ugly deformed and blatantly fuckfuck. Turns out My King and the princess were cousins. Ten/Ten would incest again.
Played the game of thrones mod with two friends. All of our families ended up being gay and crippled. My one friend was having an affair with his incapable son's wife. Daenerys became a badass then died in a duel and the dragons went to Barristan. While my two friends fought in the north I married my children to others. Arya Stark married my son and was stripped of her clothes in the middle of her wedding and forced to have sex with my son. Then one said friend of mine and I assassinated all of the Selmy's trying to take control of the dragons. Then he warred me and Murdered my entire family while my allies sat in their own lands taking attrition. 10/10 Love this game!
My king baged all of his courtiersgot 16 heirs and turned gay at age 57.  10/10 would bang all my courtiers again.
Between August 2014 and January 2015I have logged more than 400 hours in this game. If that doesn't tell you how much I like itand how good the game is
Tried to kill a newborn. Was found outand was in turn killed by said newborn.  11/10

This game turned me into Viking Hitler.  10/10would conquer Europe and wipe out all who oppose me again.
Entire Muslin world declares war on me to retake the Holy Land of Jerusalem. I proceed to single handedly slaughter 10000 infidels. Win war. Game gives me the nickname: 'The Hammer'  10/10
Constantinople does funny things to a man...
Engineered an heir with perfect genetics to rule my empire after mewhen all of a sudden he becomes a lunatic. I diehe dies
It shouldn't be this hard to kill an infant I'm fostering in my own castle. Why can't I just walk next door and throw him out of a window.
A true strategy gameonce you start playing you can't stop
My ruler died and my 3 year old son inherited the throne and the war I was in. 13 years later when he comes of ageand I'm still at war. Took the seduction focus and cuckolded the king I was at war with for 13 years. I then proceeded to end the war and seize his entire kingdom. Then his wife gave birth to my child and he got the herpes I gave her.  10/10would cuck again.
Played this game with a frienddecided to use the Ruler Designer to give my ruler syphillusrepeatedly seduced and banged my friends wives who he repeatedly imprisoned and executed

Son was the devil.  Son killed me...  I am the Devil...  10/10 Would kill my father again.
If you fantasize about fucking your sister or slaughtering your second cousin in cold bloodI advise you buy this game and it's wonderful DLC. It's worth every penny.
Probably checked out this game 20 times over a duration of 2 years before buying. When I played it for the first time I just want to travel back in time and slap myself with my wallet.
An amazing game. It puts to shame most other games of the strategy Genre in terms of depth and realism. The stories that are created just by you playing are amazing and great as well. The multiplayer is confusing though. But the game truely shines in singleplayer.
Due to succession laws my half brother was more powerful than me and made me change the law so the oldest member in my dynasty would inherit my throne it turns out that bloke is also the king of england and he is plotting to kill me so I plot to kill him and his wife drowns him when he is in his bath also at the time England was at war with Scotland   My half brother was killed in battle so his 4 year old son was count of his counties so then i plot to have his son killed and his is suffocated with a pillow next i conquer one more bit of land and then i declare myself king of newbie island (Ireland)   I think im invincible then my uncle over throws me then I die of some disease and next im playing as a four year old  So in the space of an hour I was one of the most dangerous people in Europe then I was a four year old girl with nothing to do.  10/10
Starts the tutorial Assassinates 2 brothers reunites spain has 6 daughters Assassinates 5  10/10 best dysfunctional family simulator around.
All my sons were straight.  Except for the one I named after myself. 10/10 would cry again.
Friends got bored in a MP match so we married off all of our young daughters to old men  10/10 would enslave again.
I created an incestous line of jewish rule in ireland. It's great.
I murdered and assassinated my way into controlling half of Europe. I no longer have any family left to inherit my empire due them rebelling and 'accidently' being blown up by manurefalling' off the castle parapetsbeing murdered by 'random' highway men
Why is everyone rebeling!? Ill just pay them all.... 10/10
I murder rivalstake over kingdomsusurp duchies and execute innocents. Get title 'the holy'  Crusader Kings 2 - giving the phrase 'our family is close' a new meaning where your parents are also uncle and niece  Ruling Holy Roman Empire as Hitler the Holy #expelledjews
There are Crusaders and there are Kings... I am neither because my fuck nephew keeps rebelling against my superior scottish rule and won't shut the fuck up about the time I accidentally let his mother spend 13 years in my dungeon and then die. 1066/10
Great Gamebut its quite complicatedand needs quite a while to understand and get used to the game. The tutorial doesnt really help that much
I was 25Emperor of the newly reunited Roman Empirewith most of the Mediterranean in my grasp. My only offspring was my 6-year-old daughter
Just look at the hours played! XD
Crusade in far off lands!   Travel to holy places!  Excommunicate your rivals!  Restore the Roman Empire!  Mend the Great Schism!  Go from lowly count to a grandoise emperor!  Sacrifice the Pope to your Gods!  Bang your close relatives!  Kill people who love you!  Imprison and execute your genetically defective firstborn so your genius son can become heir!  Swear angrily at the Mongols!  Convert to Zoroastrianism as Genghis Khan!  Die and leave your newborn imbecile son in charge of your rebellious vassals!  Invade India as a Norseman!  Commit ethnic cleansing!  Try your hand at eugenics!  Blind and castrate those who step out of line!  Have a family full of dwarves!   Be a well-meaning fuck!  Have a blast playing this game!
So what happens when you mix monopolynonstop incest and Europe? Well you most likely get a disapointing birthday party. But what if you could do all of the above and still have a magnificent beard? Then you are most likely homeless.  Sorry what was I reviewing again? Oh yeah Crusader Kings II.  It's a game in wich you have intercourse with your family members and then somehow trough throwing money at thingsto make other things give up to you conquer Europe. Or you could do that without the first part
I was blackmailed by a banditThen I arrange my daughter marry him to reward his courage against his King.  10/10 madness.
A good gamepretty goodBUT GOD DAMMIT PARADOX DLC HELL.  9/11
Goodnessthis game is unbelievable. When you first play ityou WILL NOT understand how anything works
You can find and kill the Robin Hood.  10/10
Started off as Fairhair. Built a kingdom with my own 2 hands. Fended off lapish rebels. Was succeeded by my homosexual heir that sired 7 children. The eldest of his 7 children went on to unite the empire of Scandanavia and reformed the Germanic religion to contend with the Christian upstarts. He died in combat trying to put down Irish rebels in his nearby colonies. Shortly after his deathhis two sons duel each other over honor and both end up maimed.

Spent most of my first playthrough marrying off daughters to all the surrounding counts and dukes in northern Germanyonly to discover 40 years later my character was 2nd in the line to the Italian throne.

Crusader Kings 2 is literally the BEST medieval political simulator. You can wage warmake alliancesmarry cousins... eh... ignore the last part.
Conquered many of the northern tribestook many of their women hostage. Tried to ransom them back to their husbands. Husbands didn't want them.  So I held a great blot and hung all the prisoners from a tree outside my mead hall.  10/10 would sacrifice to Odin again.

really great game that is hard to get into at first
I killed my family and inherited a lot of land. Then the Pope with the power of jesus took down my kingdom from where it stood! The pope is evil become friends with him. Lick his pickle make him pleased so the world wont come crashing on your head.
The King (my character) had seven childrenthree of which died during a plaguetwo of which were murdered
So I just poisoned my motherstabbed my fatherimprisoned and executed my brother
This is an amazing game which so much depth I still haven't seen it allwant to be the savior of your religion? Want to feed the devil inside you buy conquering the world then this is the game for you.  Now you can't just go attacking countries and take everything its more strategic than that thankfullyyou need to get a claim on a bit of land and press the claim giving you or someone else the title. There are downsides you will find (which just add to the game) out soon enough
While it boasts a steep learning curve as many Paradox games once you get into it the game is fantastic. Multiplayer can be wonky sometimes but it's well worth hearing from your buddy the various things you'll go through out of context. Notable mentions go toCan you kill my son?'I have four toddlers in prison.'
MY BROTHER DIED IN JAIL  IM SO SORRY
Yesyesyes
First five lives I was really confused. Prepare for that. One time I noticed that my sister didn't like me very much. So I locked her in prison for thirty years. 10/10
Became a renown conqueror and then died of a heart attack from having sex with my wife.  10/10.
Imprisoned my son after he plotted to kill mewas killed by my wife.  10/10 best simulator to get fucked by your wife.
Welcome to betryal simulator 2013the game where you can see your precious hours of work undone because you decided that a 1% chance of dying in a hunting incident is low enoughthen you see as all your vassals scheme against your 8 year old heir. Then
crazy amazing. Watch a youtube playthru then buy this when its on sale/ Well worth full pricebut wait till its on sale. U really need all the content expansions in order for it to be most fun. Def get ruler creator and the customization pack too..hands down one of my TOP 3 games of all time.. this game made me a huge paradox(name of studio) fan
Getting deposed by your maimed harelip muslim nephew has never been so fun!
Let crusader kings 2 draw you the idea of trying to running an empirekeeping your fuck cousin from stealing your titlesand keep the pope happy and stop him from excommunicating you and crusader kings 2 will end up the game equivalent of crack:)
not NEARLY as complicated as the reputation makes out. this game is hard to get intobut not so much as to stop it being fun to get into. its the only game which truly manages to do feudalism and noble family mechanics properly while mixing it in with grand stratergy wars and diplomacy
Befriended my brother and invaded my other two while also bribing them so they would like me. Later assassinated one and jailed the other. Went on a holy war marathon with my friendly brother conquering everyone. Got killed in a battle. A day latermy heir was also killed in the battle. His heir remained alive but had a regent. Grew up. Asked my noble about his impotentness. He got angry so I jailed him. Befriended all my good brothers alliesinvaded him. Executed my noble in jail after 22 years.   20/10 Would do it again.
Great grand-strategy game. I've found it to have much more depth than I was used to but while being a bit advancedit's easy to get a feel for the game after a few tries
This might be the best Grand Strategy game ever madequite simply.
Best game ive ever played why havent you bought it yet
A very good game. Feels historical. Bring pillows to put on keyboard. Notice how long you play it before you fall asleep!
Killing the wrong babies. Revoking the wrong titles. Banishing the wrong people. This game is great. I'll get it right eventually
Astonishing detailbeautiful mapand a soundtrack alone that's worth the price.
Crazy depth and diffculty   Limitless options and play as anyone   Buy at your own peril fall in love with this and expect your life to be ruled by this game
Crusader Kings 2 is one the best games in the genre. Paradox really blew the lid off with this game. Oh yeah!!
Awesomefeudal sandbox simulationwhen you start to understand whats going on in the game. Its hard to stop playing.
I was the Byzantine Empire my wife cheated on me with a 70 years old man I imprisoned both  I tortured them and executed them  10/10 would do it again
Well worth the learning curve! Better beanywayconsidering my 22+ days of playtime.
Possibly one of the best grand strategy games to date. It may seem a bit intimidating at firstbut all you need to give it is a good solid shot. If you dothen I can almost guarantee you that it will be one of your best purchases for a long time.
I love Paradox games and this one is no exception. CK2 is a sprawling detailed game with enough depth to keep you playing. DLC's are always worth buying since they add a whole new dimension to the game mechanics.
Got killed by wife in first month 10/10
Great Game. My brother and I play multiplayer to give a more difficult plot line to an already amazing game. You can do anythingbe anyonereach the stars or plummet to the pits of the earth. Awesome.
Me and a buddy played for 15 hours straight on the Multiplayer Game of Thrones mod (0.4.6) 'Nuff Said.
From start to finsh its a good gameits well madethe gameplay is easy to pick up and once you get what your doing its a very adictive game. The only negative point to the game is that its not with steam workshop.
This game allows to you weave a story with every character you play. With as many hours that I have with itI have not run out of fun things to try.  If you like strategy but haven't found a game that scratches that one itchdo yourself a favor and pick this up when you can.
Though the difficulty curve is quite high as many other reviewers have mentionedthis game is totally worth the time and effort in learning. I have really enjoyed playing this game with my wife in multiplayer it's just a shame that there was an issue with the game continually crashing. Regardless of that multiplayer bugI highly recommend this game.
It's really good. Sums it up really. If you like EU4 then you'll enjoy this
Murder your wife! Assassinate your children! Do the same to your neighbour! Also A Game of Thrones mod!
incest and genocide simulator 10/10
If you like the intrigue of Game of Thronesyou really need this game.
Not bad. Just do it. You won't regret it.
Where to start?   Crusader Kings 2 is by far one of the bestif not the beststrategy games I have played. The depth Paradox have created is mind blowing. Not only does this prove to be a game of military strategy but political
Would marry the princess's cousin and usurp the empire then kill my wife all in the name of satan /10
The best game where you get to figure out how you can get your idiot firstborn killed so your genius second inherits your lands instead.
Excellent. Through monumental musicenjoyable graphics and a lot of chartstables and
Holy f#ck this is goodlove roleplaying as a duke and getting 13 daughters then a baby son then die and get declared war on beacuse I married my daughters to kings SO FUN
Played as King of Denmark became the ultimate army leader and fighter lost my eyes and my right arm then becam insane challenging all the things then grew my arm back and had 12 fucks and not a single legit child and died at age 127  100/10
Solid.  8/10.  Pros: *Awesome politics. *Dat soundtrack.  Cons: Casus Beli is required.  A great game where you take on the role of a ruler or influential political figurethe game can span for quite awhile determining which expansions you have or mods you use. The politics in this game are easily the best aroundwith diverse things ranging from your Uncle assassinating your Father and imprisoning you
The UI is tough to understandbut it's well worth taking the time to understand. Now that I learnt how to playit is superb fun
I killed my kidsa bear and myself after I joined a mermaid cult all in the same day. This game is the peak of the human experiance.
Great game that will really make you think. This isn't a run and gun turn based strategy and a devout Civ player made me really think more politically then trying to just steamroll everything.
This is THE GAME! Crusader Kings 2 was first introduced to me by a friend who was already addicted and felt the need to pass that addiction on. We continued to playdespite the dismay of othersfar into the night as we ravaged Northern Europe and Scandinavia as savage Norse Lords! I became a King whom other felt unable to refuse
Build up your medieval dynasty to the heights of power. And when some jerk kills your one year oldyou can have great have spending the next decade systematically slaughtering every single living member of his dynasty! Fun for the whole family!
Awsome game!!!!!
Every history lover must own this game . Great mechanicshistorical accuracy and deep intruge system ...These are the things that makes you love the game . Of course it has some sort of bugs (such as changing your heir without a reason) but you start getting used to that after a time .Understanding the game mechanics is going to take time too but when you do you feel a great accomplishment feeling that i never felt in any other game ... My final verdict would be 8/10. Have a nice day ... (btw you might want to wait for summer sale or something like that to buy this game ... )
Like the Sims.
a Great game for those who like a more in depth aproach than CivCrusader Kings takes a while to learn but will soon be sucking away all of the hours of the night as you destory all your scheeming rivals
Who doesnt like an incestious family that rules the world?
This is one of my favorite games. Yet more proof that Paradox is the go-to for those who like immensely entertaining and richly complex historical games.  Simple enough to have a very manageable learning curvecomplex enough to keep me hooked for (as of this writing) nearly 90 hoursthis game is well worth the money. Get a few DLCs as well
Crusader kings 2: electric boogaloo Is a massive 2 thumbs up from me.
I can't recommend this game enough! A thinking man's gamesomething that will require some time and effort to masterbut oh so rewarding. 10/10
If the incest doesn't draw you inthe eugenics will!
Bought this game a couple days agomainly for the A game of thrones mod (Amazing mod to an amazing game).  There is nothing more satisfying than playing as King Robb Starkand get revenge on the lannisters.
Some of the most fun I have ever had playing a video game. Also having your king die while taking his mistress to the bed chamber = Priceless.
You think this is a strategy game? Oh nonononononomy friends
A huge game spanning several hundred years of Eurasian history with incredible amount of replayability. If you are even remotely interested in history then I'd say this is an absolute must have. The DLC isn't necessary but having them makes the game a whole lot more fun.  In this game you are more capable of making your own story better than any tell-tale game can. Watch as you go from a lowly irish count to sovereign king of the british isles or become a wealthy venetian merchant who rules trade in the mediterrean. Defend your provinces from the mongol hordesor even play as Temujin himself!   10/10 no doubt about it.
Possibly my new favorite game of all timemind you it's been over a week and I'm still not quite done my first gamebut the debth is awesome.
This game is a great representation of a period of time filled with incestintrigue and infamy. I love this game for it's wide array of interesting charactersfrom measly counts to kings of HUGE empires. This variety that the game provides the user with is one of acheivement once you overcome the slight learning curve associated with the game. The sense of longevity that the game provides and can provide many hours of fun and you will find this game may become a huge time sink. One problem that I did find is that the game's multiplayer has some issues with desyncing and overall performance. That said this game is a winner for Lan events and one of my personal favourites on PC.  The Verdict I would recommend this game to anyone that has an interest in the medieval era and the grand strategy genre.  The muliplayer functionality is not quite there and the game has quite the learning curve associated with it.
Fantastic gamehighly immersive. With so much to do.
It takes watching 12 or so hours of tutorials to still not fully understand what's going on. But once you figure things outit's an amazing game.
10/10 Would impregnate own sister again
Amazing historical grand strategy game!  Play through hundreds of years and make your family the most powerful in the world.
Very good game with amazing mods to tack onto it for a long fun in depth experience!
Masterpiece... Absolutely recommended! Especially for those that like history and middle ages... But everyone with the thing for strategy/RPG should try it... It's beautiful...
Best game I've ever played. It plays out like the three-way love child of an RPG gamea grand strategy gameand a tyranny simulator. So much fun horrible
You will like this game.  Never will you spend so much time stressing about whether or not people like you enough to help you kill your brother...
Daughter wanted to kill me. Made a son with my sister. My brother raised an army against me. Had bubonic plague all my life. Assassinated my father to take his land.  10/10
Played as dublinjoined a Crusadebecame the Kingdom of Jerusalem only to be annexed by Muslims.  14/10 Would be annexed by Muslims again.
I didn't know I could be much worse of a person. Then I played this game.  10/10 would drown incompetent blind child again.
Endless funIf you can play a text-Based game
I've had to uninstall this twice to stop playing. Then EU4 came...
Emperor Boko no Pico of Ireland was assassinated by King XXXSSJ420GOKUXXX of Sweden.
The only game where Greece's Economy is stable  also  you can marry your cousin 10/10 Dixies approve
I tried to rebel against the Byzantine Emperor and got my  kickedwhile I was rotting in jailthe Emperor ordered me to be castrated. 10/10
Another fantastic stradegy game published by Paradox Interactive.
Upon the death of my father I ascended to the throneI then realized I was unmarried and needed to fix this ASAPso I could produce an heir. A search of the realm revealed a beautiful and intelligent woman
Murder familybecome King.
First you will start this game as a moral upright noble trying to gain some legacy for the familyprobably somewhere in Ireland (really safe and easy place to start).  An hour later you will be executing five year old kidsbutchering christians in the name of the Alfather and lathering yourself in their blood
Fun game. Very confusing to start off withso I recommend looking at videos on youtube. They are really helpful!
CK2 Is one of the best games I have ever played. The scale of it is absolutley enourmousfrom muslims and christians to jews and pagans the sheer variety of characters you can play is enourmous. The possibilties are endless. Shall you be William the Conquerer and invade England or will you be Hardold Godwinson and oppose him. This game is absolutley fantastic and I can not reccomend it more.
Playing cooperative Crusader Kings II is like sitting down with your friends to play Let's Pretend. It's an endless gold mine of interesting storiesamusing decisionsand surprise events. The learning curve is very steep as far as normal game standards go
Great game to play coop with friends. Game of Thrones Mod is a must. This dynastywarfare and politics simulator has no match.
This game pisses me off. It's amazing.
10/10 would waste thousands of hours of my life again.  In all seriousness. If you have the patience to play this gameit will eventually consume your soul. Turning off shattered retreats and keeping ironman is the best change in recent patches.
Formed Brittania as the Antichrist. 10/10.
In terms of value for moneythis is probably the best game I have ever bought on Steam. I've played hours of this and will probably continue playing for hours to come. Every play through is different. Even if you're an expert at the gamethings will still surprise you and test you. The mix of strategy and RPG is perfect and the combination of political and military strategy is so well done. And the updates! So many free ones and some very well-priced
So much DLC you'd think it was published by SEGA  Good game though
This is the best possible game to play created by Paradox Interactivein my humble opinion. While I have personally packed hundreds of hours into EU4in regards to accurate simulation of feudalism
Oh god. This is a true love and hate relationship.  Just imagine...you've got the perfect rulerheritage all set upyou son is a genius
Nice gameawfull DLC policy
The more titles I usurp the more I like this game.
My most played game and a definite favourite of mine. I bought the base game on salebest buy ever!  You can be any rank of nobility in any european country (to start with). And you can fight your way up to emperorvia war (you can see the battles)
Amazing Grand Strategy game. The game revolves around your character and their dynastyrather than the country itself. It contains a large amount of thought provoking strategy and scenarios for youand the harder the challenge
One of the best strategy games I've ever played. This game is as fun to loose as it is to winand when things go wrong they are often hilarious.  There's so many ways to play I cant begin to describe them all. A good start would be to take a small county in Ireland and learn the game at your own pace as you build a kingdom.  10/10 Would raise lunatic heir again.
An insanely addictive and satisfying game (so long as you know how to play it). If you're new to paradox gamesthis'll take a little while to get used to. This game may not be for everybodybut I highly recommend it. There is nothing like the first time you murder a 2 year old to inherit a small duchy in switzerland. 9/10.
What to say about Crusader Kings 2.....  I believe it's safe to say this game is a masterpiece. Do you enjoy murdering your siblings? Your wives? Your secret lovers? How about conquering the lands of Europethe Middle EastIndia
Forget Dungeon Keeper and its many clones. Forget Overlord. Forget Evil Genius. If you want to know what it's like to be evilto be the bad guythen you have to play Crusader Kings 2. This is a game where you have your eldest son murdered so that your second son can inherit in his place. This is a game where you find that your heir has decided to marry some baron's daughter
Europa Universalis on steroids. Glorious!
A difficult game to learnbut once you doit becomes incredibly addicting. Great for history buffs who want an alternate Europe
This game has taken a lot of my time that I would gladly lose again. In this game I can play as a Curonian and rewrite history. It's a fun gamethat takes a lot of practicepatience and wits to stand over your enemies. I own many games and much more DLC's ut this game is one of the few in which each next one keeps on giving. The only dislike is for how the Baltic region state has been overlooked and is made weaker than it was in reality and as well the names of most of Curonians are taken from lithuanian language and as well the pronaunciation of our deity are skewed between our nations. SOme are modern Latvian
I ruletherefore I am.  10/10.
This review is written in mind for those of you who are intrigued but put off by the DLC.  Crusader Kings isn't for everyone. Just because you like or even LOVE civilization 5 doesn't mean you'll like this game. I grew up with Civ 2-4 and found 5 to be dreary and I then found this game. The only real similarity is the historical role playing aspect.   This game has MUCH more appeal to history geeksserious game of thrones nerds fantasy and mideval hobbyists in general.   That saidyou shouldn't invest too much money in this thing if its not going to fit you
My 61-year old Ruler - the 4th of his nameself-made Double-Emperor and Uniter of Paganist Scandinavia and beyond - maimed in battle 3 decades beforeInfirm' since the last decade
What to say about Crusader Kings 2.....  I believe it's safe to say this game is a masterpiece. Do you enjoy murdering your siblings? Your wives? Your secret lovers? How about conquering the lands of Europethe Middle EastIndia
I would probably give this game 6/10but I still recommend it as a good game.  Sometimes it will feel like a lot of stuff is happening all at onceand you are being invaded from all sides
A new Reviewnot too many people are gonna readbut I do not care
Overwhelming at firstbut then addictive
If youas Ienjoy watching a map for hundreds of hours
One of the best and most comprehensive strategy games I have ever played.  My only complaints are that the DLC is too focussed on adding new areas rather than mechanics (where are cadet branches?!) and that the game can snowball a bit too easily (like Civ V).
Pretty awesome game.   Not sure I can say anything that has not already been said!  I was a fan of the total war games back in the day like manybut sadly they have over time lost much of their depth... If you like a very deep strategy(when I saw deep lets talk multiple generations and hours of game down the road deep)then you have to give the game a chance. Want that county or crown? Put some plans into action now for either your son or grandson down the road....   The game is easy to lose yourself in and its one of those games you can play over and over and over again.... you can scheme very little or constant
great game with a steep learning curve. i watched about 6h of tutorial before i was ready to play. once you understand all the deep game mechanisim its just addicting. it realy divers from all the other grand strategy games due to the fact that its a game about the characters and not the countrys. prices for the dlcs are high but iam sure you can get 100-200h of fun with the basegame (i bought some stuff for 10 EUR after 90h)
Singleplayer is fun and realistic -- Multiplayer is the bane of enjoyment.  I don't care to explain singleplayerit's basic You vs AI in a Medieval world.  Multiplayer however... oh boy. So Multiplayer works like this:   Click Multiplayer   List of game lobbies   Join one that isn't passworded   Kicked/Banned before you can say 'Hello'   Restart because multiplayer sessions corrupt the game state   Rinse and repeat   What makes it worse is because some people host  public games  but have the NERVE to tell you that you just joined a  private game  and then kick/ban you.  So if you're looking for a public game to have fun inlook elsewhere.
This game is quite simply one of the best strategy games ever madeand it never gets old because of truly valuablegame enhancing DLCs still being release and a very active mod community. Yes it is complex
This game beat out Fallout 3 as my favorite game of all time. If you can get past the steep learning curve that most Paradox games haveyou'll find the best diplomacy system ever implemented in a gamewhere one choice will bear fruit generations later.
Not sure I can see this game ever getting old - it's one of those occasional ones that is only improved by sinking a bajillion hours. The depth offered by a game where you can play one campaign as a lowly Scottish countthe next as the Pope and the next as Genghis Khan or a Maharaja of India or the Abbasid Caliph speaks for itself really.  Yesit's super hard to understand at first
I think this is one of the best games out there
I always enjoy a good grand strategy game...but this is the one I always return to. It's a classicand always will be.
I've never had to watch hours worth of videos just to understand how to start a game but in this case it was more then worth it. The amount of choices and the scope of random events avalible to you are staggering. This is a must have for any fan of grand strategy games.
fun game to get play while getting drunk with friendsthe names man
Sometimes you need to murder your entire family for a greater purpose.
Played with friendsfriend had genius son that was posessed by the devil and yolo gave him control of norwaynorway attacking everyone and just killing everyone because guy has 30 base in all stats
I made babies with my mum and became depressedthen killed myself a year later because of the shame and then my brother-son became king and conquerd all of Russia. 10/10
Easily one of my favorite games. While having to pay for all the DLC makes it one of the most expensive games to own (unless you wait for saleswhich I recommend doing)it's definitely worth the investment.  So far I've played as Byzantine Emporers
with all the bashing I think conclave is a very good DLC .you now have a  council that votes .you now have a forces for children.and have mercs. what is so wrong about that.and any bugs I am sure will be fixed by  pardox asap
This is by far my favourite game and it also happens to be my most played. The amount of depth of the politcal system intigue in this game is just astounding and you need to play it yourself to get the full picture. Some people like to b*tch about the amount of DLC released for this gamewhich according to me is nothing bad (more content amirite) and it's not like the base game isn't complete. Atleast they've entertained Crusader Kings for over 4 years which is alot more than most studios do.  Buy itif it isn't for you then you just spent 10 bucks supporting one of the most passionate studios out there.
My best gaming experience since Defenders of the Crown on Commodore 64.
CKII is like someone took a map of the known world during the middle ages and dumped a bucket of dice over it. The object of the game is to use a straw and blow the dice you want to places you want. Some of the dice are inexplicably heavier than the others. There's also a garbage bag full of DLC that adds new dice and dice colors.  I'm nearing the end of my first Ironman with the Ireland King Murchad of Munster 1066 start. I made a lot of mistakesbut I'm proud that I've taken the kingdom of Ireland and Scotland with some of Wales. My progression in the game went something like this:  - Why the fuck can't I fight somebody for their land? - Ohneeded a just cause... ok... give me that then. - Fabricating claim does nothing. - Oh
It's not a game for everyonedue to its sheer complexity. If you're used to strategy games like Total War or Civilizationthat's just training compared to this game. It has a ton of different interacting gameplay mechanisms that can be rather hard to learn at first
I highly recommend this gamealthough I should also warn it is a game that many people will not be interested in. Firstlyit is a grand strategy
The best strategy game i've ever played! Really enjoyed the RPG factor of the game as well as it adds a totally different experience to the game!
This game is very enjoyable and has a lot of depth considering how evil paradox are ( if you think EA are bad with dlcjust buy this game. paradox make an expansion and cut out the fucking art and music from that expansion and sell it differently)   modding is the real winner in this game  if you ever wanted to role play as rob stark and not betary the freys you can do it  if you wanted to conquer the north as a wood elf chiften in the elder scrolls universe you can do it as well.
i understand the dlc hatebut I just got the base game andwhile I do not have much play time yet
If you love strategy games with a rpg touch like I dothen you will love this game! Now I am a little biasbut this game is simply the best stategy game of all time... OF ALL TIME!  You play as an individual
This game is a mix of simulationstrategy and RPGa rare gem among the trillion games available out there. 1) Simulation because it models interactions between rulers and vassals feudal europe in the 11th century quite well. 2) Strategy depends on your goals
After Watching Arumba's tutorial series I played this game for 7 hours straight only stopping because it was 2 AM.  I feel that is a good a review as any.
Amazing Strategy/RPG/Medieval political simulator. CK2 can be overwhelming at first due to its immense depthbut you owe it to your self to give it a try.   Fair warning though be prepared to loose a few hundred hours to this beast.
I had an awesome time playing Crusader Kings 2. The level of strategy available to the player is vastand it was deep enough that I was still learning how to play effectively many hours in.  CK2 has no set goal which allows you to make your own fun. Want to rid the land of unbelieverssure go for it. Want to claim land stolen from you
Recent updaters and DLCs made this game really hard. No more making everyone happy while you murdercheat and plunder at trhe same time.
This is a Great Game! It's actually very realistic and the characters seem almost alive in their interactions.  Yesit takes some time to learnbut with the help of a dictionary to explain certain words
A deeply immersive game where placing your dynasty on the different thrones of EuropeWestern Asiaand North Africa is the main goal. You accumulate score based on the number of empires
This is a mediveal strategy game with a rpg role style element. RPG element as for you can be lordking or even rome emperor. You can start your plot of taking over the countystate or even country.  Well
hard to get intobut when you doyou can't get out!!! 10/10
Most realistic game I have ever played in my life. I am a big fan of simulator gamesand Paradox always delivers. Pros: -A lot of DLC  -good DLC  -Paradox listens to the audience and makes DLC that the players want  -The MP is great. The game will atleast last 4 times as long. Also great MP engine etc. Cons:-the DLC take very long to produce  -The game can be very fast paced (a conbecause you will finish to fast.)  I'd like to add a little update to the revieuw. This game is really good. I remember my first time I was noob and didn't know the game
Rated GlitterhoofHoly Roman Emperor.
The game certainly has a learning curve but every time you play it something new happens and it is incredibly fun to master
Playing Multiplayer Minor English Count All terrible traits except for master seducer Contract Syphillis Other player hates me Has claim on my titles Have an idea Seduce his wife She get's syhpllis He get's Syphillis Biological warfare.jpg Assassinate his heir Die from said Syphillis 10/10
Great game. Nice balance of depth and width/strategy. You can never go wrong with a game that allows you to poison your entire familyand three generations of your relatives just to become the emperor over all Christendom Or when a tiny count somehow gets 30k troops  Overall 10/10 would murder entire family again
Difficult at firstthen just becomes an incest simulator.       Still a better love story than twilight.
Would you like to forget the very existence of the Two Thousand and Sixteenth year of our Lord? WellI would start a long time agoconquer the British isles (as a Romuvan pagan of course)
Played as homosexual embodiment of the seven sins. Invaded the HRE with papal blessing. Became homosexual Emperor that accidentally kills the entire royal family of France by marrying my sister into their family. 100/10 Would commit manslaughter again.
This game is incredible. I've owned it for 3 days and I've played 48 hours without even scratching the surface of what it has to offer. Buy at least the basic versionits cheap and worth it.
My wife stole food supplies during epidemy. My ruler ate her instead. This game is perfect.
I always enjoy a good grand strategy game...but this is the one I always return to. It's a classicand always will be.
I've never had to watch hours worth of videos just to understand how to start a game but in this case it was more then worth it. The amount of choices and the scope of random events avalible to you are staggering. This is a must have for any fan of grand strategy games.
fun game to get play while getting drunk with friendsthe names man
Sometimes you need to murder your entire family for a greater purpose.
Played with friendsfriend had genius son that was posessed by the devil and yolo gave him control of norwaynorway attacking everyone and just killing everyone because guy has 30 base in all stats
I made babies with my mum and became depressedthen killed myself a year later because of the shame and then my brother-son became king and conquerd all of Russia. 10/10
When I bought this gameI didn't think I was going to put so many hours into it. I can say that if you like grand-strategy games and role-playing gamesCrusader Kings II provides the perfect mix from both genres
The question isn't 'Should I choose the seduction focus?' the question is 'How many children should I have with my niece?'
94 hours later and still I can find so many ways to squeeze more fun from this game. Would highly recommend this even if you're not a startergy fan. Also would recommend the Game of Thrones mod.
When I was playing as the king of ScotlandEngland attacked me and lost the war. This resulted in England having a massive debt and becoming a fuckfuck country for 20 years. 10/10 would make William Wallace proud again.
Been playing this game for yearsstill feels like I haven't sunk nearly the amount of time into it that it deserves. Much like Dwarf Fortressthis game has a pretty bad user interface that hides the greatest storytelling engine of our time. I remember the time I accidentally ended up as an Irish warrior queen and part time werewolf leading an invasion of England. Things didn't work out for her after her demonic posession was lifted
Brilliant game.
Not quite the genocide simulator that EU4 isbut you can still commit ethnocide quite well and get a quite nice eugenics program going.  I give it a Deus out of Vult
CK2 isn't going to be most gamers cup of tea. I would strongly recommend for people who like Europa Universalis.
The Roman empire has Fallen and the medeval age has begun. you take on the role of a feudal lord trying to spread his power and influence across the worldplay as a lowely count or a powerful Emperor or as a weak Emperor at the whim of his vassal lords. Tax the hell out of your people or tax them next to nothing. be a cruel unforgiving tyrant or a benevolent ruler. take care thoughanger the people or be too kind and they may revolt or want even more. and if you appear weak your allies and vassals may turn against you. as the saying goes keep your enemies close but keep your friends closer. it dosen't take much for another lord to stab you in the back.  this game is fun and rewarding if you have the patiance to get past the learning curb. and patiance to plot and scheme your way to the top. the game also has a great UI and the AI is very clever. 10/10 game
If you like epic strategy games and medieval historythen this game is a must-try. It's got some RPG elements and lots of opportunities for intrigue in addition to epic grindy warfare. It can be confusing at times as some of the numbers are hidden or difficult to findbut this doesn't majorly effect gameplay (at least not at the beginner levels). It's a little 'rail-roady' with the big tech advantages given to 'western' civs
Great game. Never figured out what the hell I was doingbut it's kinda fun anyway.
Like: Everything Dislike: Everything
What can one say about this game?  You've got time? Try it.. the thing istime actually accelerates while playing CKII and you are left with none.  All in all this is an addicting and great strategy game with lots of contentespecially with all the additional content DLCs.
It's a good gameokay? You fuck people overkill your children

Released in 2012Crusader Kings II still receives sporadic updates and new DLCsome of it cosmetic
In Crusader Kings II you select a character ranging from Count to EmperorIceland to Indiaand guide his or her dynasty to glory from the days of Charlemagne all the way to the Hundred Years' War (769 - 1453).  Along the journey you will encounter friends to help you gain power and prestige rivals to scheme against allies and enemies to defend and dominate... all while ensuring your family lives on in power
I fucked my fuckfuck friend's motherwifesisters
Crusader kings II is the kind of game that you need help to learn. The tutorial is bad and I learned with youtube. But once you understand the gameonce you got the basic downit becomes the best game I ever played. With the huge selection of good quality mods and the replayability of the base game you always have an interessting new run to do. The stories craft themselves in a organic way
Fantastically addictivebut extremely overpriced and has way too many expensive DLC. Stillvery very fun.

Plays as Piast King of Poland. Continually declares holy wars against pagans. Expanded into de jure wendish empire. Gets closer and closer to forming wendish empire. King dies. Literally everyone starts faction to be king or independent. Pope Excommunicates me. Every single army is destroyed by pagans. Holy Roman Emperor declares war. All Rebels revolt. I catch Typhus. Factions press their demands. I will not be blackmailed! Wife starts plotting to kill me. Wife plots to kill heir. The fuck hits the fan. The end.
One of Paradoxes more difficult titlesif you can get past it's steep learning curveit will provide you with hundreds out hours of fun.
Never trust your family.
Crusader Kings II is one of the best games you could buyeverythingfrom the freedom the game offers the player to the intricate stategies that makes your influence grow manages to hold you on to the game. You can play in several aspects of the game
Wish I could play as the Soviet Union
Story time. (Game of Thrones mod.)  Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. Have beautiful wife. Beautiful wife gets fucked by local lord. I can jail local lord. I failand he rebels. Call the Reach (my allies) into this war. Take local lord and his greatest General as a prisoner. Behead the General and feed the local lord to the Lions. Enforce demands and jail his 2 year old daughter/heir. Throw her in the oubliette. Her regent is actually intelligent and well rounded. But her sister/heir is dumb as a fucking nail. Strangle the 2 year old while her sister watches. Tywin (Dynasty name is my real last name) is now known as 'The Bewitched.' Gain the trait 'Tyrant.'  10/10 would do again.
A brutally realistic stragetgy-rpg that places you in the position of a fuedal Lordand essentially says 'Your orderssire?' Left to you're own devices
I now wonder if the Seljuks are supposed to be in Swedenthe Byzantines in England and the French in Mauritania. Great gamewould fuck history again.
Once you make it past the (at first) intimidating layout and learning curvethis game provides more value for money than 9/10 games I can think ofperhaps even more
Got cancer. My court physician had me tied to a chair. That did not cure cancer. Died.  2/10worst chair ever.
The best thing Paradox has ever done. One of the three best strategy games of all time.  I owned it for a year before I even bothered to play. I had to sit through 6 hours of tutorial youtube videos. I said 'this better be worth it'. It is.
Pros  Playing as one family makes you feel more involved Large timespan Lot of things to do in peacetime Incest = Wincest   Cons  Relatively expensive DLCs that are necessary to play most characters Significant learning curve   Final Vertict:  This is my second most played game for a reason it is one of the best games I have played and would recommend it to anyone.
A great game that you can waste hours on! Conquer rampage and destroy all you want of ancient europe and asia! Take it further with more mods than I know what to do with.
Sole Heir is a lunaticKing dies.  Things are going very poorly in my kingdomvassals are pretty unhappy. Fired traitorious Chancellor and appoint my horse in his place. Newly angered ex-Chancellor joins oust Ruler faction. Said faction now has enough forces they can confidantly make their demand. Refuse. War starts. Lost because lunatic is useless.  10/10 would lose kingdom for a horse again.
LookI reviewed this game two months after I first got itand it was great then. 300 hours later
While the game is quite expansive (including all it's DLC)you will see that it's really worth it (But: buy at sales with 75% off )). You maybe pay some moneybut you will get a game which you can play for hours
Whiny vassalspeasantsand a whole lot of random inheritances going on everywhere messing up all of the clean borders and making everything super weird and confusing as you wonder how a random count in the middle of Ireland gained land in the middle of the HRE.

This game is just about one of the most fun games I've played in a long time. This game and the mods for it make it endlessly fun. The game is complexbut luckily they provide a tutorial and once you get the basics down you won't be able to put it down.
A game with immense depth of playvarried strategyand at it's core a game that knows what it's about and arrays all its various mechanics and themes to serve this end: Feudal social relations and their evolution.

Only played it for a few minutesseems pretty good!        I lieit has utterly taken over my life. Send help.
Spent soo much time on this game and more time on mods for this game.
Bang your relatives to greatness!
Thousands upon thousands of hours worth of replayability. The depth of this game is amazing. It has a steep learning curve but once you start to understand the mechanics the gameplay is rewarding.
Excelent game with endless possibilities.
After more than four years from release this game still feels new and fresh. Developers keep working on it with DLCs and free patches and every new playthrough there is something new to discover.
Steam Awards 2016 - The 'best use of a farm animal' award - Crusader Kings II  Make it happen.  --Glitterhoof
Endless replayability.
This game is life. Reallyreally well made game. The DLC mostly makes big improvements to the base gamethough that on its own is still fun. Get it.
Look at my playtime...
44781
One of the best strategy games available!
Grand Strategy + RPGa delicious combination.  It's not easy to get into itbut after a while you will fall in love.
It's a great strategy game for those who want to tell the story of their civilisation rather than just beating everyone. It makes losing compelling and really encourages you to roleplay your rulerchoosing different objectives each generation. It's a glorious timesink and I've been happy through every playthrougheven when losing.
Crusader Kings 2 has an amazing community that has developed mods that have taken up hundreds of hours of my time. The game itself is an amazing timesink but can be quite daunting at first due to the extreme price tag of all the dlcswithout many of the dlcs I believe that Crusader Kings 2 is still an amazign game that is added to due to the use of dlc.
My best friend fucked my wife 10/10 would play again
This is not a game about winningalthough you can certainly strive for that if you want. This is a game about altering the history of Europeand the stories of the myriad nobles (and ignobles) embroiled in it. It's the sort of game that you find yourself wanting to play just one more year
A feudal house of cards that topples continuouslyCrusader Kings II is a fascinating sandbox for intricate webweavers and flamboyant schemers alike.
A very unique RPG/Strategy game about the Medieval world. As the name suggestsyou can play as a crusader kingbut that is far from everything
The best game that has ever been conceived of. It's like real lifebut better.
Even after 200 hoursCK2 offers new and interesting eventsthe different govenment types
Most enjoyed game I have ever owned. I have played 1000 (really) and I still play. There is no solution Crusader Kings 2 play different every time. If you have any interest at all in the subject you will enjoy it.
Best game to teach you live with your family.

Great game and all the modded stuff make it betterhowever optimization would be greatly appreciated in a patch or update.

I love this game. I love its community. I usually love its development team.  Sureit might be considered complexand there is quite a learning curve

My Opinion of Crusader Kings II
Awesome GameA must buy for anyone who thinks they might like it. High learning curvebut it pays off 100x.
I can't really decide if I recommend this game. On the one handit's awesome and so much fun. On the other handI've sunk more money into this one game than half my Steam library and I still don't have the full thing.  Paradox
The only game where you can kill of all pretenders of the thronedo viking raidsand start holy wars. 10/10 would commit mass genocide against all my male family members again.
Best medieval cancer sim on the market.
Crusader Kings II.  A game that perfectly combines Strategy and RPG together. Whether you'd like to start out as a petty king of Walesor a sheikh of a Muslim caliphate- (DLC's may be needed unfortunately)this game is very intriuging and fun with every one of your actions having a knock-on effect that could affect you later on in the game. Though I sometimes struggle to expand out of my tiny county in France
An excellent game. If you're a fan of Games like the Total War Series or even the Civilization series then you'll likely love this. Probably more challengingbut with a huge degree of variety (especially with the excellent value DLC) and replayability.
Get this only if you intend to study it like a fuck textbook. This is Civilization's biggerslowermore Game of Thrones-y brother. You can wage wars for your kingdom
As an avid fan of grand strategy gamesthis is the one i would recommend to get if you are new to the genre.   To me Crusader Kings II is a game about creating  interesting stories . I'll elaborate: The most interesting moments in this game usually are so random and unexpectedthat when you tell other people who play CK2 they will be genuinely interested and intrigued by them.  It really feels like anything and everything can happen . It is total chaos. Sometimes EVERYTHING goes wrong
An excellent sandbox of potato faced npc's to assassinate seduce.
This is what has happened in the 20 or so hours of playtime: *Started out as the Byzantine Emperor *Half of my land was taken by the barbarians of the East( no idea what they are called) *Engulfed lands up to rostov *half of my vassals rebelled *Rebels crushed  *Emperor discovered the game of Miniature armies *plays more miniature army games *Busts door down with the use of the royal guard and plays with teenagersTWICE! *Becomes fat *Prince of the Byzantine Empire becomes a fortune builder *dies of age  10/10 Would play miniature armies again during war!
This game is amazing and addictive and had a long shelf life for me. The problem though is that the game is only worth purchasing during the huge steam sales because their product model is DLC heavy. Only buy the base game and the major DLC's that are not cosmetic. ToGSoARoI
My 61-year old Ruler - the 4th of his nameself-made Double-Emperor and Uniter of Paganist Scandinavia and beyond - maimed in battle 3 decades beforeInfirm' since the last decade
This game has taken a lot of my time that I would gladly lose again. In this game I can play as a Curonian and rewrite history. It's a fun gamethat takes a lot of practicepatience and wits to stand over your enemies. I own many games and much more DLC's ut this game is one of the few in which each next one keeps on giving. The only dislike is for how the Baltic region state has been overlooked and is made weaker than it was in reality and as well the names of most of Curonians are taken from lithuanian language and as well the pronaunciation of our deity are skewed between our nations. SOme are modern Latvian
If you love strategy games with a rpg touch like I dothen you will love this game! Now I am a little biasbut this game is simply the best stategy game of all time... OF ALL TIME!  You play as an individual
This game is a mix of simulationstrategy and RPGa rare gem among the trillion games available out there. 1) Simulation because it models interactions between rulers and vassals feudal europe in the 11th century quite well. 2) Strategy depends on your goals
After Watching Arumba's tutorial series I played this game for 7 hours straight only stopping because it was 2 AM.  I feel that is a good a review as any.
I have more time on this game than the next 5 most played in my library. The DLC list looks intimidating but most of them make more characters playableIf you want to get into itget the base game and play as a count in Ireland (best place to learn the mechanics).
First let me start by sayingI love this game.  It's a well constructed strategy masterpiece that really is something you can play for hours on end. However it might not be for everyone who likes strategy as it is essentially a whole other side to the strategy genre. For fans of total war games I'd probably advise you to do a lot of research before buying this if you really think you might like it.  As a total war fan myselfthis game seems to heavily relate to the campaigns of the older games where you had to manage a family tree and ensure it's sucess. But the family tree in this game is much more complex and so are the methods that you must use to ensure it's sucess.  The base game (No DLC) is fun to play on it's own for those of you who worry about the £120 price but whilst the dlc is none essential it certainly adds to the gameplay and makes it much more interesting.  I was going to a Pros and cons list at this point but really I don't see the point as there are only 2 cons I can think of:  Multiplayer games are a rarity and those that do start end up finishing quickly Price tag  For those of you who want this game I heavily advise you to wait for a sale as this games' price goes down massivly:  Normal Game - £30 Sale - £7.29 ish  DLC Version - £120 Sale- £30  Those figures are what I remeber from the last sale so may not be as accurate but it does drop a lot as you can see.
Grand Strategy is the right title for this game. It is a slow gameas in sometimes at max speed it takes 5 minutes for something of true importance to take place. That being said I love this game. I play it as i watch netflixand it works perfectly. Highly suggest the Game of Thrones mod if you are a GoT fan. If you do not mind playing a slower paced game
I came to this game from EU4which I adore. Both games have their strengthsEU4 as a Grand Strategy/Map painting game
I'm a big fan of Paradox's Grand Strategy.   CK2 has been a lot of fun for meespecially with a few pieces of DLC.  Manipulating dynasties while keeping an eye on your own adds a layer of complexity that takes some getting used toso I recommend going into the game without the 'my line will last 1000 years' mindset.  Other than that
I would probably give this game 6/10but I still recommend it as a good game.  Sometimes it will feel like a lot of stuff is happening all at onceand you are being invaded from all sides
Overwhelming at firstbut then addictive
10/10 would give my fat cousin a good tumble whilst she has her midnight snack.
Conquered the world as the Swedish Jewish Calpih of the Roman Empire  10/10
Incredibly addicting with plenty of modsexpansionsand workshop content to keep you busy well after you get tired oft he vanilla setting (which is near infinitely entertaining on its own).   Paradox has been supporting this game for years and plans to continue for more. Great buy.  10/10

This is the best possible game to play created by Paradox Interactivein my humble opinion. While I have personally packed hundreds of hours into EU4in regards to accurate simulation of feudalism
Can I murder this guy? No? Okaywhat about this infant. Still no? I swearI should kill my wife and find a new one.'  My wife has learned to tune sentences like these out.
This with Europa Universalis 4 is some of the shining examples that strategy games are not dead. Very well doneand a lot of laughs from the events.  10/10 would make inbreads again.
I HATE STRATAGY GAMES!!!! but if you like them then its probably prety good.
Played the game for a few hours. Still have not figured out how perform the most important actions e.g.have sex with the popethe wife of a courtier
This is one of my favorite games of all time. With the Old Gods expansion packallowing you to play as a Paganthe majority of your waiting time can be occupied raiding. Initially
Probably one of the best games I have ever played!  Highly replayableand very fun! It is totally not like what it seems (a map with little soldiers walking around).  The roleplaying in it is so much fun. You will never have more fun being the son of a murdered leader whose heir is the killer of your fatherand then ride on your toy wooden wheeled horse to make him fall off the balcony!  So much fun. No better game to win and lose!
Don't be afraid. It can seem complicated at the beginning but give it a try and you'll spend hours enjoying this great strategy game. Make your dynasty live forever and keep your vassals at your order by any means.  Economydiplomacyalliance
It's better than Civ V or EU IV. If you like strategyyou should play this game. It goes on sale a lot thoughI wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.
Deep grand strategy where fighting is secondary. No classic diplomacyonly family ties and cultural/religious opinions affect who is your friend. Very engaging once past the learning curvewhich is 2 parts: one
Its good
Best game ever. I've lost so much time to this game. 10/10
The in depth building of a dinasty while conquering and maneuvering for power in the middle ageskilling off cousins to inherit a title heremarrying daughters for influence and sons to acquire titles in the long run
One of the best games I have ever played. Wasted many hours playing this game. If you like this game you should try Europa Universalis 4 also!
Terrific game made by Paradox interactive I've played hearts of iron 2 as well as EU3 and EU4 and can honestly say that you get more than your money's worth these games. This game in particular starts you out in the year 1066 A.D with the climatic war for england and doesn't end until 1453 with the old gods expansion you start in the 800s and can play as any pagan faction literally hundreds of years on real time strategy fun. The map spans europe the middle east and india. It's very in-depth politically with you having access to every member of your court with a mouse click. you can execute almost anyone you want in your court. Buying the cheap dlc allows even more access to more factions and when you do actually reach the end you can export your game to EU4 and keep playing.

One of the best strategy games ever created a game that creates an experience of building your own stories in your mind as you outwit the A.I.which gets me to my complaint the A.I. is too much like a computer and not enough human variance in its decision making.All in all the balancing of econonmy and politics with a mix of RPG elements make this game a must have.
So much to do in this game. You lose hours and hours without even noticing the time. I enjoy micro managingso this game fits me well. It satisfies the need for more story behind your rulers that the total war series was missing. You may not get the battle depth in CKIIbut i really dont miss it. Diplomacy
Gawd yussbuy it with your monies right frackin meow!!!
I have had this game for over a year and was only able to actually get into a game now as i found it too different from Paradox's other games yet i was eventually able to get into it. Since getting into it i have become addicted. Its a good game but can be unstable sometimes. 9/10
Its a great game i love playing it played for over 200 hours now really but it needs to have battles like rome total war so you can defeat a big army with a small one so please work on tht
Really not enough good things I can say about this game. Such a wonderful game to playlove the strategylove trying to build up my empire while dodging competators to my claims. I've been enticed with this game and I think it was well worth the buy.
My favorite game by farI use all the DLC and continue through to play Europa Universalis. Simply awesome.
Crusader Kings 2 is amazing. I recieved it as a free gift for pre-ordering Europa 4and to be honest I spend more time playing CK2. While the vanilla game is greatthe DLC make this game shine. I will point out that like all games of this series
If you like non-crappy gamesthen buy this game!
I tried playing as the habsburgs oncemy dynasty died off as an inbred imbecile.
A wonderful game that gives you the chance to experience your dreams of being a king and commanding armies! Live a glorious life of conquest! Raid your neighborsplot against your family membersand usurp your allies titles and land! Die pathetically of herpes!  More seriously
Just started playing this about an hour ago. The depth to it from the first moment is astonishing. This is the kind of game i wish i had as a kid with eons of time on my hands. I feel time spent in this great greatly educates about the time periodreguarding namestitles
Okyou're the duke of Norfolk. In an average day you go to war for the thronebecome King of England
Terrible gamehavent played it much. To be more seriusthis game is fantastic
If you like The Sims (specifically torturing them and having thousands of illegitimate fucks running around) and strategy gamesyou'll love CK2
I really like this game alot even though i didn't understand the game completely i just love this game but i think the creaters should have fixed the multiplayer when you try to get in to a game and you need to go back then go back in so this game get's a 8/10.
It stops at 1453! Lame but its super addicting otherwisebut after the end date. I am not sure what to doand that is why this series is so confusing. it has no real sense of direction.. its like the developers just wake up and decide to add to it or something.
I WANT TO TAKE ALL THE THE LAND TO WAR HAHAHA its fun
I've put 60 hours into this game and I dont feel like I've even scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. I wrote my master's thesis on Medieval Islamand while the game doesn't get it exactly rightit is much closer than many other games in the same millieu. That plus my love of the dynastic drama of Game of Thrones makes me very predisposed to this game. I do feel that the rules can be byzantine
kill your wifemarry your daughterlose all your titles when you die because you forgot to change succession laws  the world is your oyster
This may be one of the most engrossing games that I have ever played. I have about 450 hours in gameand about 200 of those were without any kind of dlc. The game packs a lot of contentand it is simply really fun. There is nothing better than the moment you actually create that empire teir title
One of the most addicting and painful games i have ever played. One moment your the king of the world.....and then the next thing you know your armies are scatteredempires crumbling and you're back at square one
Great game for people that like to paint maps... one color.
CK 2 is one of the best medieval grand stratagy simulator games ever. It has the complexity and vastness of some of the older Total War games (minus the battles) but has to make up for it the extremely exhilarating political manuevering. Paradox has developed one of the deepest and comprehensive games I've ever played. It takes some time getting used to itbut that is only because there is so many aspects to the game. So much going on at once! So many choices! So much fun!
This game is amazing and addictive and had a long shelf life for me. The problem though is that the game is only worth purchasing during the huge steam sales because their product model is DLC heavy. Only buy the base game and the major DLC's that are not cosmetic. ToGSoARoI
A wonderful game that gives you the chance to experience your dreams of being a king and commanding armies! Live a glorious life of conquest! Raid your neighborsplot against your family membersand usurp your allies titles and land! Die pathetically of herpes!  More seriously
Best game made by this company. I highly recommend the Game of Thrones modI never really was interested in any of the DLCoriginal game is a lot of fun if you have a creative imagination/visual mindseye.
This is the game that keeps on giving - if you are even slightly interested in character-focused grand strategy.  With under 40 dlc's bought and installed and slightly more than 500 hours logged i suppose i am on the lower end of hardcore ck2-gamers - stilleven playing it 'casually' for years it was worth all the money i invested.  Having bought every dlc while on sale i assume i spend only around 6080 bucks in totalwhich is around 20 cents per hour of fun - you can't beat that. So buy this
Another Great Grand Strategy game. Having it focus on Dynasties/Families instead of nations is a nice change of pace too. If you're a fan of Paradox Interactives other worksI definitely recommend this game.
I upgraded my graphics card to play Dragon Age: Inquisitionand ended up playing Crusader Kings 2 since I completed that.  It's been 2 months.
I really love this gameaddicted to it. It is a different outcomedifferent experience every time I play. I recommend this game
Get this only if you intend to study it like a fuck textbook. This is Civilization's biggerslowermore Game of Thrones-y brother. You can wage wars for your kingdom
Crusader Kings II.  A game that perfectly combines Strategy and RPG together. Whether you'd like to start out as a petty king of Walesor a sheikh of a Muslim caliphate- (DLC's may be needed unfortunately)this game is very intriuging and fun with every one of your actions having a knock-on effect that could affect you later on in the game. Though I sometimes struggle to expand out of my tiny county in France
This game is a complicatedbrutal and backstabbing masterpiece. Respect for the norse ruler of mongolia &lt3
Love this gamecan't play enough of itif I didn't have things to do otherwise I would probably play this game for half the week
Amazing game till you find your bro with your wife and your son with his other uncle...
I've put 60 hours into this game and I dont feel like I've even scratched the surface of what this game has to offer.

kill your wifemarry your daughterlose all your titles when you die because you forgot to change succession laws  the world is your oyster
-looking through decisions  -expel jewry -guessing it expels the jews -*click -guess i was right  10/10 would expel jews again
Amazing game. Very immersive. So many different things you can do and try to do. Currently a Hindu Holy Roman Emperor and Holy Warring the Byzantines into oblivion.
Began as the Duke of Normandy. 5 minutes later the Reich invaded and I lost.  5/5
I had a son and a daughter. My daughter murdered meallowing me to take control of my son. She didnt live very long. Great game
Best Stratagy game I've ever played. Mary the daughter of a powerful minor king(an only child)have her father assassinatedyour wife inherates the foriegn throne
What can I say aout this game? Well for starters its a good solid game. But on its own its unrealistic and can be hardpersonally I'm fine with the hard part but the realism? I think they could have done better on that department. Also it is daunting to start out with even playing as a count can prove diffcultbut don't let that stop you the game does get easier over time.  Now if you want a really good experience with the game your going to have to get DLC's. And unless you're rich you should probably wait till there's a big sale coming up before you buy the game.  Now a lot of people (including me) hate the DLC policy that screws up the game. It is so bad and so annoying
Great game for people that like to paint maps... one color.
One of the most addicting and painful games i have ever played. One moment your the king of the world.....and then the next thing you know your armies are scatteredempires crumbling and you're back at square one
Became King of Sweden.  Sold mother to Mercia for an alliance.  Alliance ended.  Raided Merciaand imprisoned mother.  Took Mother as concubine.  Died.  Inherited Kingdom of Sweden as son of my own brother.  Conquered Scandanavia.  10/10
A very detailed strategy game focusing on aspects of the feudal systemdiplomacywar
Really starting to understand the basic tutorials nowbut I mean I beat Death in a game of chess and got +1 life so I guess it's paying off.
Best description of this game I ever heard was that it is a medieval soap opera generator. Once you get over the fact that it is played differently than any other medieval strategy gameand that there is little in the way of a useful tutorialit is a wonderful experience full of memorable moments. It tends to draw me in
Murder your kinmurder your enemiesmurder your liege
Alfons de Leon:  Took back the land my damn brothers stole. Holy war'd the fuck out of the saracenes. Had to sit around for a whilechristians and muslims did not like my rather expanding politics. Made a deal with france. I get his daugther and he gets some prestige. Capet idiot in france forgot that his daugther was the heir. He did not feel like having a son. Another holy war. They still don't like it. I can understand the saracenes for not liking it... but the christians? I meanI'm one myself. C'mon. France dude died. My wife became queen of france. My son
It's okay I guess.
INCEST SIMULATOR 2016
Pros:   I've watched 30 hours of tutorials and I still only have the slightest idea of how to play.   Can take over the world.   Can marry your cousin.   All of your offspring can be dwarves with lisps.   Addictive.   Cons:   Addictive.   Ridiculous DLC policy.   Just be selective with DLCand try to get as much as possible when it's on sale.
This game is amazing. Basically you can choose to be a kid educator or a kid murder :)
I got close to beating the tutorial 10/10
One of the best games I have ever played 10/10
Medieval politics and soap opera. Roleplaying and strategybut not just military strategybut you also have to think who to marry
A complexdetailednonlinear-story
This game makes my head hurt. In a good way. It's original and exciting with an imense effort put into it. I've found myself spending hours trying to forge claimsfend of heretics and secure a claim. This game isn't easy and it's not going to hold your hand.  My first playthrough wasofcourse as a minor Irish lord
Really funespecially for history buffs like myself. It's not as overwhelming as other Paradox gamesso it's really easy to get into. Definitely one of my favorite games.
Ho ly fuck.  When my friend first opened me to the idea of Paradox gamesI wasn't convinced. Civ 5while an engrossing game
You can't put too many hours into CKII. It's simply impossible. Play. This. Game.
I am the King of Gwynedd and above vowels.
This game is fantasticespecially with the AGOT Modification!
This is the best game because u can marry a child and assassinate her afterwards
When I write this review I have 164 hours of gameplay and I still have so much to do in this game! The possibilities are endless. If you like strategy games with a touch of role-playing and like medieval settingthen this game is definitely for you.
Fought with Cthulhu and wonwrote a book about it. Announced my horse Cliterhoof as counselorsadly he died a few days later. Arrested and sacrificed my wife to the norse gods. Fun times

Here's a single session description which will hopefully strike the reader with the joy I experienced. To be honestit's more like a review for myself than an actual help information but forgive me for being egoistic this time. Not the last time though.  That day I was the ruler of some small territory in Ireland. My name was long so I preferred to call myself Ua which is actually a part of it. I was 47 years old with a wife and a few kids. They all were very talented siblings with good education except for the last one named Dub-da. I decided to experiment a little with him so he ended up not having a guardian and betrothed to a dumb woman. People of my tribe knew me as 'the sloth with good strategic skills'. My treasury was almost empty but I decided to invest last coins in some risky business opportunity. Some oversea lord invited us to his country for a business discussion!  It was a question of whether or not we should buy some merchant's ship or hire bandits to capture one. We hired bandits and were readly to sail off. Some priests catched up and asked to join us. 'Sure sure come in feel yourself like in the Heavens'. After a few days of sailing priests declared that they haven't seen the crew which was fully consist of thieves and bandits.  We finally arrived at the castle of our potential business partner. Feeling ourselves a little uncomfortable we realized that we forgot something important - a gift. Thankfullyon our ship we had: a dozen of good breeded horses

They need to incorporate all of that dlc into the game and just call it what it is
One of the best startegy games ever made. Will be even better with that Muslim DLC this month.

These hours didn't happen on accident
An excellent grand strat game with a dynastic system. If you haven't played it you're missing out.
This game is so fucking good.  DLC is so fucking expensive.  Goes on sale a lot.  This game is so fucking good.
This Game may seem to be a challange at firstBut once you give it the time you will find that you play it for hourslaughing at the stupid names and random events that have both good and bad consequences. The DLCs although pricey
A game worth its pricelike no other. Just like that. Despite having no interest in medieval historyi found it very amusing and fun. I
My wife died while giving birth and my newborn son is ugly as f***.  10/10
This game is like a hooker. It'll give you sweet cheap love but later completely fucks you over with disease and claims of a fuck son who then takes your throne and uses your hat as his privy.
AWESOME! I love this game!  So many ways to enjoy this game i cant even start to tell you. Just try itits worth every pennyif you like strat games. Also there are tons of mods for this game.
Murderincestand jihad simulator. Thoroughly Machiavellian as well.
You wake up in the morning to find an army outside your windowthat's new. It appears your brothers has decided to claim the throne and the Duke of Lancaster has sided with himyou can tell because of the banners.You sigh
Its hard for me to find anything wrong with this gameapart from the classic Paradox expansion pack strategy which sinks all your hard earned money into getting the latest features of it. Overall as a history buff this has been one of my favourite games of all timefrom the role playing aspect to building your own dyansty to rule the World. However the greatest part of this game is its modding scene. Its diverse group of features has allowed for massive overhaul mods such as the Game of Thrones mod and After the End mod. In this way it has become my favourite game giving me new opportunies in every play through. The campaign is never the same!!!!
I love this game. 100% the best choose your own adventure sandbox visual novel.
Highly stable as far as I can tell. Really fun to play with really inexpensive DLC available. DLC packages also add a great deal to the game so you get a lot for your money.  I currently own reaper's dueold godssword os islam
This is an amazing game with really great developers who still care about the game and its fans even after launch and yet still update there game despite this game being a few years old KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!
My gay viking king fathered 9 kids and founded the Empire of Scandinavia.  10/10would pillage again.
I never liked grand strategy games before but after much nagging from a friendi got this game and i realised i was stupid for not playing it sooner. 10/10
An incredibly deep and fun game. You play as countdukeking or emperor and attempt to expand your realm.  However to get even a basic grasp of the game you need to watch many youtube tutorials. The ingame tutorial is very bad..
Love. Hate. Power. Death. Betrayal. Sins. Death. Virtues. Religion. People. Child Killing. And Death.  All these words are related to the game that is Crusader Kings II: A game I've put 500+ hours into and would happily spend another 500 hours with.  It's a grand strategy game. You play as a feudal lord in medieval europe (with parts of the middle east and north africa) as you struggle through a world of war and intrigue to survive andmost importantlymake sure your dynasty (family) survives. The game is completely open
The best game everPeriod
I captured my rival in a battle. I soon realised he had no male heirs and no way for his 3 daughters to inherit. So I castrated him.  Years later I was able to capture him againthis time blinding him.  Kidnapped his 3 daughters and converted them into beautiful pagans and raised them as my own. Rebellion soon follows and his kingdom crumblesI'm laughing
It's real good.
On a serious notethis is honestly one of the best games I've ever played even without all the 'major' DLCs you can have incedible fun. The gameplay is just so complex &amp derpy sometimeswhich just improves the experience! Great game! 10/10
Anyone who play's as William or Harold the Conquerer will learn to hate the name 'Morcar of York'. Seriously screw that guy and his plots! So... many... plots...  Just execute him and live happily ever after.
One of the best game I have played so far!
This game has a lot of depth in politics and intrigue. I like the fact that you can work your way up from a simple Count to eventually becoming the Holy Roman Emperor or King of a country. It really depends on what goals you would like to pursue and working towards them by any means at your disposal. Be it murdermarriagealliances
Kill-your-wife simulator 2014.
This is the strategy game where my mother declared war on me because the pope excommunicated me because some guy I'd been taking counties from had influence with him.  If you've ever wanted a strategy game that is far more about people than about unit placementthis is that game.
Sets the standard for grand strategy RTSs while at the same time having some nice RPG elemenents. Quite a few paid for updates over time though!
Very cool game
this is da best gane you will ever see so go have teh fun
By far my favorite game ever. I've logged 450 hrs into the game and I keep coming back. A must buy for any steam useras it's become the anchor for my gaming life since I first heard of it.
Had my son get married and slept with his wifewhile taking over Ireland.
So good that I can't recommend this game. It will change your life (you will lose it to this game)
1242.7 hrs on record...and enjoyed every minute of it!
This game is awesome!! But dont get it yet just to play MP Paradox patched the game breaking Multiplayer even worse then it was before patching.... But Singleplayer is madafaking awesome too!!!
After owning this game for a couple of months I believe I can share my opinion with the community.  1. What is the game about? This game contains alot of history from the real world and allows you to control the outcome of. Ofcourse some people will not understand what i am saying so let me give you an example. If you want to play as Any of the leaders your outcome could change from what really happenedIts stratigy game that you need to think as a leader not a player. As a player your aim is to rule your country and stretch your dynasty as long as possable. If you die with no heirs the game will end and you will have a score and a summary of the dynasty you beat in score.  2. What happens if I die in the game? If you die as a ruler for any reason and have no heir the game ends. You need to have an heir to continue playing when you die.  3. Why should i buy this instead of any other game like Civ or Cursadar castle? Well this game is unique because of its features that make the game come aliveyou dont die in civ as a leader you get conquered same in Crusadar castle
Created the Empire of Ireland. Named my son Eddard Stark. He was assassinated. In his horner named my next son Eddard Stark. He died sick in bed. Named my third son Eddard Stark. Assassinated. Don't name your kid Eddard Starkand you'll do just fine.
A very good game to play with friends if you want to know who is trustworthy and who will attempt to cuck you.
I became the King of Ireland 9/10
Crusader Kings II isperhapsone of the richest strategy games on the market
its a very good game
I cant even explain the enourmus amounts of incest in this game... whenever i play games where i conquer landscontinents or even planets i can just think how much misery I bringadministrativ fuckt I create and how much genocid and incest spreads out of it. 8/10 with DLCs 10/10
Don't buy this game! It will consume you!
The game where you have sex with you're Sister and everyone you want :D 10/10 incest sim
Crusader Kings 2... is a grande strategy game...
11/10 would assassinate my brother again. A great gamethough CKII does promote some questionable ethics.
A masterfully crafted strategy game with RPG-esqe elements woven into the gameplay. With the variety of historical figures (and custom-made characters you can create) to play as and the variety of traits you can aquire within the gameno two playthroughs are alike.  9.5/10one of Paradox's best works.
A must buy for any strategy lover out there
So much dlc but really good game. Download the Game of Thrones Mod if you are a fan.
From the writer of the critically acclaimed Age of Empires II reviewbrings you the Crusader Kings II review.* This game is a nusance on life. You control a dynasty through the ages as you build up your empire. If you have played a paradox strategy game you will be very familiar with the layout. You have a mapyour character
This game is pretty good. won it for free in some giveaway it is really complex and deep strategyyou will need to finish tutorial to understand the mechanics of game but after that it is easier. be a king and experience medieval life as a king on your road to conquest . 9/10

Your path to power is littered with dead bodies. Or you can convert yourself into a heretic and conquer the rest of the Christian world. Obviouslythey'll try to wipe your table with your faceso be afraid. Be very afraid. Did I forget to mention that your heir is someone not from your dynasty because every last one of your vassals voted for him because they hate your freaking guts. Say good bye to the game when you go kick the bucket.
1500 hours played 'nuff said.
My character arrested his son and sexed up said son's wife.
Why can't my people just get along...
Crusader Kings 2 best game i have ever playedmainly because i love strategy games. And this one is truly a GRAND strategy gamerecomend it for everyone. Fantastic game over 800 hours and owned it half a year. It truly is AMASING
I seduced all my sisters and got excommunicated by the Pope  10/10 would incest again
This game is amazingthe dlc might seem bad when you look at all the reveiws but here is a simple and cool trick i found outDON'T BUY THE DLC
Hard gam but u can kill ur famalams and palzgood u can kill countries but i har d i fink dis is 0.81/1
best game ever on steam
It takes some effort to get intobut once you startyou want to lead your dynasty to greatness! It's a great game
Steep learning curve but tends to be very rewarding afterwards. Expect to spend the first couple hours confused as to what makes everything tickbut it'll eventually all fall into place and be hard to stop clickinga-la-Civilization.   If you start playing in the evening
My King became depressed because he was a homosexual and he got married to a woman.  10/10 would commit suicide again
Gave all major queens of Europe syphilis.  10/10  Would give birth to the spawn of satan again.
Made my queen wife the court jester. 11/10.
The Pope tried to seduce my female ruler.   69/10
Perfect game for someone who likes middle ages history.
You can seduce your daughter
Crusader Kings II is one of the four main Grand Strategy games that Paradox has in its belt currentlyand it is easily one of deepest games Paradox has with the ability to role play a ruler while managing your dynasty.  The best thing about Crusader Kings II is not how you can seduce your fuck child or how you can assassinate your way to be the next kingbut how mods like 'A Game of Thrones' or 'Elder Kings' (which portrays CK2 in Elder Scrolls universe) can increase the re playability of the game by two fold.  I can easily give this game a 8.5/10. Just be sure to book some time in the weekend as half a sitting can easily cost more than 8 hours.
The book was better.
Haven't played very muchbut the regent system is broken as fuck.
I've only played it onceI might try it again just to see if anything differenct happens this time.
You can restore the roman empireconvert your gameand colonize the Americas as Romans
Cool but super difficult. I've played 34 hours and I still suck severely. I get revolts and vassals turning on me constantly no matter what I do. The game's goal is domination of Europe and a few countries in Africa. It's a really fun gameespecially with the ruler designerit's just too hard. I recommend it but if you're gonna buy it
1
Ain't nobody got time fo dat' is what your gonna be saying as you try to comprehend this grand strategybut if you have the time of day to sit down and absorb all the fuck this game has to offer you may enjoy it. However for me after an unnecessarily long period of tutorials I give upand proceeded to qq in the nearest corner
Best FPS i have everplayedreally cheapno DLC unfortunately paradox could have made it better with dlcs
very fun but i still have no idea how some things work. but it's enjoyable noodling around and having things happen. trulyeven without the game of thrones modit's a terrific simulation for that kind of storytelling.  the MOST irksome thing is the uneveness of the art.  - paintings accompanying events are amazing. - portrait artwork is hideous. it's f@#$ing hideous actually. - map is amazing and great - the 3d units are stock footage atrocities with the worst animation this side of that chinese website that animates the news. i really really wish they got rid of ALL animation and just replace the unit graphics with non moving
Literally the best game ever.
This game is very fun but there is a lot of dlc that should just have been updates.
I LIKE THIS GAYME ITS PRETTY FUN U CONTROL UNITS AND STUFF AND I GET TO DO THINGS LIKE RULE A FEUDAL FAMILYRUN A NATIONGET MARRIED

Very addictiveand historically rich
After playing Total War Medieval II for a lot of hours but always simulating battles I thought of a game that would focus a lot more on the generals and what kind of people they would be. Wouldn't it be great if there was a game that focussed much more on the strategy of rulingon you as a person and how to manage your realm? And then I found Crusader Kings 2. And I fell in love with this game. It has cost me many hours and days but I have no regrets. This is truely an amazing game that has even helped me understand some bits of history better. I think this game can have some educational value as well. I would love to have this played during history lessons at school. There is so much detailsophisticated gameplay and richness in this game you can play it over and over again. So I did. I still love it
Took me about 50 hours to figure out the basics. Still don't completely understand. And yet I'm still enjoying myself.
Wait I am NO T KING OF ALL THE WORLD......... my life........... what happened to it all...........  10/10 Would forget what my real life is like again.
My grandson is also my son. 10/10 Best game.
Murdered my son because he was a gay dwarf with a lisp who everyone hated and was heir to the throne. My wife murdered me in revenge then married my brother and took over the kingdom. Would murder my own deformed children again. 10/10
CK2 is one of the best strategy games out there. It is unique in that it requires a working understanding of the medieval feudal system and that you play as an individual with a unique set of traits that can interact with virtually any other individual in the game. It is an incredibly challenging experience that requires a lot of learning by trail and error. Once you understand the base mechanics of the game you're bound to play 100+ hours.
He who neglects what is done for what ought to be donesooner effects his ruin than his preservation.'-Machiavelli  This game is basicly a modern game version of the Princeit shows the cold nature of power and ambition among the ruling classes and the clergy and the lenghts they are willing to go. I went into this game thinking i was gonna play as a noble ruler protecting his people
My brother got half of my kingdom. MY KINGDOM. Gonna invade this little scat really fast.  Well his army is hugecalling for help. Nobody answers. Except my mom.  Of course I will help you. Here's my armytake it
when u play the game of ck2 u r teh win or die or maybe u collapse because u forget to assert claim on throne leleleleel
Awesome strategy gamebut be warned as you really need a brain to enjoy this one.
really great if you like strategy!
Crusader Kings 2 is an extremly fun game to play once you understand how to play it (find tutorial on youtubein game tutorial is broken.) very addictive and you come out of the game with many stories to tell.   (Alternative Review)   -Gates of hell open in my land -tell people to fill it in with rocks -Hear sceams of those tormented in hell -people don't want to fill in hell anymore -make them do it anyway -fills in gates of hell with rocks -seen by world as savior  11/10 Not today Satan
I can't stopthis is cutting into my dota time
This game is a large mix of history. Since I have always been a history nut I must say that this game is somewhat correct in its historical accuracy. However I think that it should increase the number of provinces I have noticed that they dont always have the exact amont of different provinces that are in real life or in the past. Also I found that a lot of what is inthe game is somewhat realted to my family. For example the Gallowglass mercenaries for the northern Irish are true in the fact that they are scottish or came from Scotland but they dont tell u which clans are they. I know that my ancestors were part of the Gallowglass or atleast some of my family members. So it is historical and has many features. If you know that your family has history (from around the middle ages) then you may be able to find a hint of what your family has done in this game.
One of the best and deepest game never played! Not only you have to take care about your stateexpanding it and defend itbut also of your dynasty. Be sure to have good marriages and ensure its continuity.  - the game has two main levels of game
Crusader Kings 2 is the kind of game that physically ruins your life. I have spent hours plotting the downfall of my enemies and my eventual expansion into their territoriesand many more hours attempting to make that happen. Mind youhalf of this process takes place while I'm working
Awesome game about politics and plotting in the medieval times.
Be so close to achieve all your goals ... just to experience all kind of calamities and see your dreams perish one by one!  Don't worryyou'll be back for more instantly. 10/10

What can I say about this game? It's absolutely great!  You can play in a medieval settingall the way from around 867 AD - 1434 AD! Fantasticisn't it!? You can play a variety of countries
A really fun game you can play by yourself or with friends.
This is a game thatprovided you have most of the major DLC (which can be pretty expensive added together)and you can appreciate the time period

I didn't sleep and played this game for 15 hours non-stopand I didn't get bored. This game is incredibly playable and I really reccommend you buy it. I really like Paradox games and this one is no exceptionI give it 5 stars   P.S. That was on vanilla

Crusader Kings drops you down in Medieval Europe 1066 to 1453 a time where life was about getting womenmaking babies and war lots of war. I can count the on my fingers the amount of games that dunk you into a situation where thinking 12 steps ahead is critical to your survival if your wanting to be anything other than a pauper begging for your lieges' table scraps.  Though it has a somewhat steep learning curvethe pay off is being able to have members of your house laying the foundation for children to one day take over your neighbors lawn

if you like big battles of a total war scale...stay away from this game  if you like management and micromanagement and all that lovely stuff by all means thought to yourself 'gee I wish Medieval 2 Total War had more focus on the management' this game is for you  the Good Points a large scope and large world the random and intersting stuff that goes on the management aspects aren't overbearing and you can just be king of an island  the political intrigue stuff of the middle ages  the Bad Points  all of the DLCI mean people complain about EA and Sega for DLC...but I say at least you get the full game sure some things may be added later but seriouslywant to create King Dave DLC
My ruler became a raving lunatic who then became a cannibal who also gave birth to a possessed daughter who murdered all of my heirs in their sleep leading to the end of my dynasty.  Would do it all over again.  10/10
The tutorials are a mess and you will most likely need to watch or read a guide onlinebut once you get it you can play this game for dozens of hours at a time without getting boredthe only thing stopping you from playing more being your need to sleep.
Our review begins in The year 1080- The Norman king Bohemund rules over all of Sicily.  Early in his reignBohemund falls illand it is thought that he will not survive. One fever-sick night
I've played a little bit of the game. To be honest I still don't know how to playbut I am pretty sure I have fun playing.
Bought the game a week before it went 75% off on sale. FML.
So. Many. God. Damn. DLC. Love this gamebut the amount of DLC is completely ridiculous.  Stop milking us players Paradox! Just make it an update!
This is one of the best games I have ever playedperiod. While it can be confusing for the first dozon or so hours after that point there is near limitless replayability with just the base game. The expansions that add gameplay and mods add so much to it as well. I realize if you do not have an interest in HistoryCrusader Kings II may seem increadibly boring but
I WISH I KNEW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME. EVERYONE SWEAR'S IT'S FUN.
Great gamewould love more buddies to play with- Everything from simple diplomacy to sleeping with your brothers wifeit's all possible in CK2.
It's like Call Of Duty.
Crusader of Kings is one of the best games that i ever played. In several sessions experimenting with different cultures and playstyles my enthusiam growed even larger. With almost all DLC`s the there are seemingly endless possibilities and varieties to play the game your way. If you are a fan of grand strategy games this is a must have game for you.

This quite simply is the bang for your buck paradox game you know well. Crusader Kings II is set in the dark ages of Europe. And several factors are already in play from the start of the default game.You start out as any lord of Europe. From the count of Norfolk to the Emperor of Byzantium. The following situation faces you. (Edit) They also added to the depths of Mongolia. If Yurits and eating fish is your niche.  The remains of Rome are declining in the east. And the Muslim hordes are still on the offensive in Spain and in northern Persia against the remains of the Zoastrians. Keepers of the old Persian Imperial Traditions. The Lords of Russia are shattered and infighting. Leaving great chance to a crafty and respectable warrior.   Western Europe is in a stable. But inevitably declining status quo. The French King is faced with an issue. His greatest General and overall vassal William is leaving France to become King of England. Making a French dominated England as a rival quite the possibility. The Holy Roman Empire eyes French holdings in the modern day Netherlands with envy and seeks to take it for themselves. Spain is divided between 3 Christian lords and one powerful Muslim lord. The Christians face the greatest chance they have had in quite a while however with the Muslim lord being of lesser stature. Whom is losing his grip on his African holdings. With an intelligent and brave warrior king. Iberia may yet be under the cross again.   In Scandinavia. The last of the vikings are chafing under the new found power of Christianity. The Lord of Norway still holds a lot of power. But is distracted with affairs in England. Where he claims England for the Norwegian crown against the local King Harold. And Duke William. Sweden has just formed.It still has several Norse Worshippers within the realm. And may be brought to be the last viking Kingdom in Europe.. Denmark has long converted to the cross. Fearing a Christian invasion from the South. The King of the Danish with several tactical marriages holds the oppertunity to unite the scandinavian realms under his grip. But must tread carefully due to his size and lack of an army.  The middle east is in a similar situation to Western Europe. Egypt is under the power of the Shia Fatimid lords. Whom control both Jerusalem and Mecca. However they are facing major sectarian issues. In the regard of Religion. Islam is split between two powerful lords. The Sunni Sejuk Turks in Persia. And the Fatimids in EgyptWere it not for Byzantium. The Sejuks would be invading Europe proper. No concern should be held by the lords in the west if you do not take the reigns of the Sejuk. If you do however lead either lords. They have the power and ability to rapidly become the true Islamic nation.   India is DLC based. But I will briefly mention it  5 Kings. All ruling vast domains of varying cultures and religions. They contain advanced cities. Massive armies. And wealth beyond measure. Their one problem? They are very inward focused due to internal conflict and the nature of the religions of India. With a caste system and religious warfare rife. Many see no chance for the Indian Kingdoms to unite into one Empire. But if it is done. The Sejuks in Persia stand to fight off the Indian hordes which will have to invade through the mountains of Afghanistan. India is a great oppertunity. But more than skill is needed in this untamed land of mystery and old legends.     My Final Ratings
this game make me sour
Killed my wifeimpregnated my sisterMutilated some random dude
RANDOM KINGS 2: Having spend some hrs.. I draw your attention not to buy this gamebuy a dice instead (much cheaper). - You will need some hours in order to understand the gameplaybecause the tutorial is just for laughs. - Numbers of your figure's supposed wealth
Prepare thy 'b\_/ttholes' for the most massive and epic backstabbing contest of all time. You will get posessed daughters that will slaughter your male heirs and make your courtiers suicide themselves. Your liege will want your titles and will revoke thembecause .... screw you that's why. What will seem like an infinite amount of muslims will come decapitate you and take back Jerusalem. The Pope hates you and wont give you any money and wont let you divorce your psychotic wife. Gravelkind succession will ruin your pathetic miserable life &amp make it even more pathetic and miserable. You will form the HRE with the Great Charlemagne but will die of a cold the next day leaving the empire in such a fucked up position that it will crumble down to the ground faster than it got up. fucking Byzantine Emperor blinding all my spies. Yet another fuck Cathar Heretic declaring war...    11/10 I get rekt by &amp i rek the vicious lords of Europe on a daily basis.
Get the dlc on cs.rin
Indulge your lifelong fantasies of being an incestuouschild-killing fuck?? who is also a violent religious zealot and a member of the nobility. Quite possibly the most offensive game ever made. 10/10.
I was 74 and Satan visited me and made me gay.
Best game I ever played
This review is from someone who was never a strategy buffat allmore the contrary. However
I've spent a long time playing CK II and enjoyed it but would I recommend it in its current state. I'm unsure. So many DLC components that to get the full game working costs over £130. That's a lot of money. DLC which often delivers functionality but not the graphics ... severe price gouging. They need a new model and it really leaves a bad taste in the mouth for me and many other players. SHameas the underlyingb game isn't bad.
I'm extremely lost in this gamebut I sure had loads of fun when I played it in multiplayer mode with friends. Hardly ever I have laughed so much while playing a video game.
20 hours I am now king of Ireland.  1 year later my daughter is getting married to the prince and heir of England.  She dies 3 weeks before to disease.  My second daughterI schooled in plotting. She married the french king of Aquitaine..  2 years later I'm dead my daughter poisoned me leaving my 8 year old son kingmy dynasty completely 'fecked'
Killed my wifeimpregnated my sisterMutilated some random dude
Pushed my nan down a staircase to steal her shekels Murdered 16 brothers to make sure i got one piece of land in France which raised 267 troops Seduced my nephews to keep my bloodlines pure Multiplayer is the way to play because when you become incapable your friend can help plot to drown you in the bath or when your son becomes obsolete he can plot to throw dem down the chimney  11/10 would bang nephew again
The game was mediocre when it first came out but I loved it. The DLCs were amazing at first but quickly became bland filler content that added very littleand should have been in the base game itself. Paradox Interactive has done this to all of their titles as of latedisregarding quality and instead have chosen a business model that is meant to extract as much money from their customers as possible. They have thrown their old and very loyal fan base to the side and treat them with contempt and distain. As someone who has been playing Paradox titles since childhood its very sad to see them become such a horrible company.
Tutorial Sucks. dont know what it wants me to after reading directions over and over again. frustration with game is over 9000. might refund it
great game played it lotsand can't stop playing.
Complicated. Not user friendly. Hard to understand what's going on. Not fun...
its ok
It would be good if the CKII collection sold all the expansions instead of just picking and choosing.
Extremely Buggy for Maccrashes all the time and has other issues. Don't reccomend it if you intend to play it on a Mac. Otherwise it's a good game.
Great game but horrible moneychurning DLC policy.  Steer clear till Crusader Kings III comes or if there is a big sale that includes all the current expansions (current sales always leave the newest one/two out).    I love the game but the policy is just horrendous and frustratingThere's an incredible amount of content that you're lacking if you don't buy the DLC and the DLC themselves come with an additional content pack that you will have to purchase as wellthis means DLC for this game usually costs 20 euros on release
I'm sure it's a good game that some people likebut I can't read the text on my TV. I tried changing the resolutionlooked at the forums
Sure going to pay 300 bucks for all that DLC or start playing a game that thus feels like half a product. Are you on cracked cocaine paradox?
Stage your very own brexitChexitPolexit
Sit down kidsand let me tell you a story. Long ago back in the Nintendo dayslike 1992 when most of you weren't even born
Why does every paradox title seem to suffer from the patented paradox tiny text syndrome? All the money you make from DLCs and you can't afford to implement a 'font size' option? Or at least set the default size from 'migraine-inducing microscopic' to 'somewhat readable if you squint really hard'. That'd be a 1000% improvement.  I shouldn't have to rent the hubble telescope off NASA just so I have the ability to read your damn games' text.
I love this game.... but.... why does the DLC collection feature only like half of the DLCs? Its very misleading. It doesnt include Old gods or Son of Abraham its kinda stupid. Its very hard to recommend when i couldve had to pay 80$ for half of the gameit makes the game stupidly expensive.
There are some games that age like winethe patches and expansions and mods all adding up to make a classic game. Crusader Kings is not one of these gamesit has aged like milk.  Each DLC delivers less than the one before
First offI don't hate this game. I just feel there were better choices that could of been done in its creation. I think I'm upset because I didn't get what I expected in the game. I'm accusing this game of trying to appear to be more than it really is. Like a good spymasteryou look at it on Steam and it intrigues you. There is no other game quite like it from other developers and you believe you're going to get wrapped up in some non stop Game of Throne like challenges. You get those situations
I regret I sank too much time into this black hole of a game. CK2 when everything boils down to it is essentially a university student's biology simulator but with medevil politcs survival instead of plants and animals competing.  Oh it started so wellbut patch after patchdlc after dlc and the game's been shackled to a CPU load whether you bought the extras or not. Great way to sell you the stuff because it's right there up in your face in game but after the Rajas of India expansion no one could deny the devasting effects of Paradox's business model.  Today the final straw broke the camels back. Got bored so I reinstalled to see how things went after very very long hiatus and low and behold the one and only great saving grace: Crusader Kings 2 Plus mod (CK2+) was pulled from steam workshop along with zero activity on GitHub and the others after July. In conclusion
Assassinate my motherassassinated by father.  10/10 Would assassinated again
This game is amazing. Buy it and its DLCs.
Very recommend
I said this game was boring and that i would never buy something so fuck?? and with no action.   Then i murdered my Sister2 Nephews and 3 Nieces in order to make me the only legitimate heir of a region. Then a future bribe so that i don't lose prestige for canceling the betrothal.  11/10 best plot simulator 2014
Great game with tons of replayability and lots of mods if the base game isn't enough.
Great game
Rating - 9/10 Outstanding  An absolutely outstanding game where you lead and manage a dynasty in the feudal age.   Similiar to the other great Paradox strategy titles like EU and Vicky this is a sandbox game where you can ultimately choose your own goals but different in that this one is much more RPG'ish and the main objective being to see your family dynasty succeed and survive.  The game revolves mainly around managing relationships with all the other characters in the game which include your family membersneigbhorsvassals
Great historical empire building RTS with infinite possibilties to make your own history happen.
Kill the imbecile heir! Oh nohe survived. Welllet's just...  What? I DIED?!  Oh f***
Complex. Smart. Entertaining. Addictive. If you like smart games - buy it without question.
It's like Skyrim with incest
In the 32nd year of the reign of Scottish King Constantine IIIshortly after becoming possessed by demonic spirits and finally succeeding in plots to kill off his other sons to ensure that his ace son with a martial prowess shall inherit all of his possessions despite the gavelkind lawscalamity struck. Constantine the younger
:)
This game is so fun I didn't even stop playing at 420 hours to make a joke. I'll still make one: 4/20 not enough blazing.
Id recommend this game for people who like civilisation
I can only recomend this game. Where else could you murder your husbandget married again matrilineallymake some kids
It's a pretty fun strategy gameit has a lot of depth and management. It's somewhat like a more complicated Civ/AOE with less focus on visuals and more on just the 'idea' something epic just happened. It's quite complicated and you'll need to sink a lot of time into it to really enjoy the game. The DLCfest is kind of disappointing but besides that there's an excellent gem underneath all that. Personally I was looking for something a little more simple to learn but hard to play game hereand while it is hard to play
This is so confusingyou'll be FORCED to read the tutorialsgo eat some dog food
This game is truly a masterpiecei came from playing civilization V and i have spent 180 hours on that gamehowever after playing crusader kings
One of the most confusing games ever very fun 9.6/10
1st review dont judge me -.- So im on a quest to get perfect game for ck2 and one of these achievments was Khan of Khans so basically started up conquered persia canamara (something like that) hungary brysantine  ex ex after 30000 hours of doing this i finally did it and im like wut? no achievement  60 years left so i look around and see that i havent evicted the holy orders so i start doin it  and i was done and then realized ironman was off  am done.
This game is brilliant!   Even when I didn't know what I was doingthe game still held me because all of the crazy happenings continue to happen.  Point of entry is very expensive if you want all of the DLC. But you can grab most of it up for around $40 if you get it during a major sale. Usually it won't include the 'latest' DLC though.  Personally I've spent probably around $80 on it because 2 more DLC packs have released since I bought this gameand I picked up some of the optional cosmetic changes. Considering how much I've played this game
Amazing gamefully convinced that I passed the 500 hour mark in offline sessions. Not recommended if you're more of a First Person Shooter personbut if you like strategy games you'll love this. It takes a while to understand and learn
The only game in which you can play as the Immortal God Emperor of Carpathia.   https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/the-immortal-god-emperor-of-carpathia.732160/   10/10 would play again
If you have played Europa or games like it. This is a great game. This game is a little complexbut once you learn it its really fun. I prefer playing this with friends but even by your self its awesome.
Does very good at the things that are great.
This game has consumed my life. Even playing as a count with not much to do (at least in comparison to emperors or kings)I end up strategizing how to marry off a daughter to a more prestigious family or how I can get my worthless heir out of the line of succession in favor of his more talented brother.  I'll settle in for a session to knock off 5 or 10 years and next thing I know it's 6 hours later. Probably the only game I've ever actually bought DLC forwhich makes for a more immersive experience.  There's a learning curve
This game has eaten a significant portion of my life. It is awesome. If you like Europemedieval timesgeneology
Really good game if you enjoyed Rome Total Warthis is a game for you.   However some minor problemsfor example
Solid medieval strategy game. Offers you the ability to play as both a major player or as a minor noble.  Things to be aware of: 1) The tutorial is not great. You're better off watching a guide on Youtube. 2) You don't need DLCbut several DLCs in particular do greatly expand the game- Way of LifeLegacy of Rome
I have over 350 hours in this game. I have conquered the world as IrelandScandinaviathe Romans
The Game (Base and DLC) offers a great outlook on lawcustomssociety
Rich and compelling.
Great game!
In my honest opinion one of the greatest grand strategy game of all time and the mods add so muchtry ones like Game of thrones mod. With more expansion mods even get better and for the price is really good if you are in these kind of games
Was 49. Had a passionate embrace with my wife to remember our younger years. Died of a heart attack... (this was only my 3rd or 4th year into a game on Ironman.)  I have immensely enjoyed this game and the amount of replay-ability is incredibly high. I don't know what else I can say other than this game is absolutely amazing and Paradox has done a superb job on it. The DLC is definitely recommended. I have a recorded 209 hours as of this review and will have more. I don't know what it is about this game...maybe it's just my kind of game. I LOVE Civ 4 and Civ 5and the amount of complexity CK2 offers is what I enjoy. The micromanagingthe thrill of defeating my enemies and conquering the lands
The most fun strategy game I have ever played. It is almost as much an RPG as it is a game of war and politics. I can think of no other game to compare it to. I have never watched Game of Thronesbut if you like thatyou will probably enjoy this more. on top of it being super fun (even my wife enjoyed playing this with me)
The start of a very beautiful relationship between ParadoxPC gaming and I... &lt3   10/10
This is honestly the best game I've ever playedthe playable characters are endless and so are the possiblities
Very good game and highly addicting once you get to know the mechanics. There is a bit of a learning curveand you do need to set own restrictions once you get too good at the game. But I definitly recomend it to anybody who likes history just the slightest! Can be blayed both with and without the DLC expansions.
Arguably one of the easiest paradox gamesand the amount of DLCs are a bit obnoxious however its still got a lot of depth in the base game and is addictive if you like the time period (like me)
All I want in life is to force the pope to convert to Germanic Reformed Paganism. Is that too much to ask?
This game is really good you can marry your daughter off and have her kill her husband so he doesnt declare war on you then you can declare war on people because you want their stuff and then you can take their stuff then when you have all the stuff you need to keep the stuff from people that are trying to take your stuff.
Better than Civ 5
Easily one of the best games I've ever playedand one with incredible longevity and replayability. I have not yet regretted a DLC purchase for thsi gamewhich is really saying something considering the sheer volume. Game has a definite learning curve
Meh I guess its okay
spymaster got murdered for investigating the murder of someone who was investigating a different murder. wud r8 9/11 m8
This game combines history with intriguing gameplay and good music. I especially like the fact that the game presents you with clear goals and infinite ways of achieving them.  Two things to consider: - it is easy to burn out on the game after playing it too much - I consider the game to be a little dated
It's definitely an anomaly of a game. The premise of the game is simple you are a part of a dynasty in medieval historyand you are to make your dynasty the greatest. This can be achieved through various means such as marriagewar
If you take a look at how long I've played this gameyou'll realize I know what I'm talking about. I own this game since the day of its release. I waited until now to make my review because I was too busy playing it.  First things firstlet me get this straight: this game will make you EVIL. And I'm not talking about the GTA kind of evil
This is a great game. One of Paradox's bestand I've played nearly everything they have released from Europa Universalis (2000). It's probably the best medieval strategy game on the market right now.  That being saidbuy this game on sale. It's ridiculousy expensive
It's pretty good i guess.
A GreatAddictive game.
The only game where I can blame all of my problems on other religions and get away with it
hard to understand but when you do its amazing
As of this momentI have 1951 hours in this game.  Need I say more?
If the trailer for this game doesn't sell you on itthen nothing I can say will.   Even if I were to say you can forge new alliances by cuckholding other rulersor that you can engage in biological warfare using STDs
One of the best strategy games of all time. Take control of a character and ensure your dynasty survives from 769 (with Charlemagne dlc) to 1453. Create your family's story as you weave through medieval politicsfamily dramaintrigue and war.  Deal with troublesome vassals and family members
While the game is greatthe business practices of its publisher are terrible.  'Look at this amazing game they said
Fantastic strategy gamedon't be put off by the menus and such at first. Bit of a learning curve but you get used to it.
Without a doubt one of the best games I've ever played.  It's hard. God is it hard. 500 hours in this thing and I'm still learning new things about the Catholic nations. I've played the ERE a littlebut none of the other multitude of nations.  Give it chance. Watch some videos. It really helps. You'll get there one day! Don't throw away one of the best gaming experiences without giving it a fair chance!
AhI do love the peace of England right nowruling from the county of Kent. Hey look
I have been playing Crusader Kings 2 on and off almost since the vanilla launch. This game after several years manages to keep me coming back. Paradox are constantly even now a few years on pumping out DLC which have for the most part really added depth and fun to the original release of Crusader Kings 2. I almost don't know if I could play the vanilla version of the game now knowing how much has been added to the game with the DLC so really keep that in mind if you intend to buy this game.  The game is a wierd mesh of a RPG cross Real Time Grand Strategy cross Fuedal Politics simulator that can be paused and is open ended like sandbox type games. Yep. However it is an insanely clever game that really makes your decisions meaningful. Never in any other game have decisions I made become so important until sometimes I sit there for 10 minutes especially in difficult situations just thinking about the ramifications of that decision.  The game is nicely styled with graphics that are keeping well for a game a few years old. The audio is phenomenal with the score being honestly one of the best in a game I have heard in a long time. The sound effects are nice but do get occassionally annoying especially if you happen to be playing a Muslim character with multiple wives...those babies just don't stop coming! The game is also very stable and has never really frozen or crashed or bugged out. Paradox are pretty on top of bugs and issues for the most part.  So onto the actual game itself... Well in short you pick a characteranyit could be a Count or a Duke
They keep adding 15 dollar expansions every six months! The problem is that the game is fantastic and the DLC only makes the game better. If you like mapgames at allthis merits a look. If you like political-science and wonder how hard keeping a fuedal realm under control actually isthis is a must-buy.  There's a reason everyone goes nuts over the Game of Thrones mods for this game: The base game itself will teach you about how political systems like that in GOT really function. I'm very glad I played this before reading the books
Now that i have a few hours in game i can honestly give this game a good review.
Play It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Medival dysfunctional family simulator 2000.
hundreds of dollars of DLC for this game and its not even good
My friend murdered my character three times. As revenge I kidnapped his 6 year old son and offered him back for ransom. He refused. His son was executed the next day. 10/10 would kidnap again

Bought the game with the way of life expansion   How to do some messed up stuff with this game:  Step 1: Have the seduction focus  Step 2: Have the homosexual trait Step 3 Make sure the pope has the homosexual trait  Step 4: Seduce the pope Step 5: Do whatever the hell you want now that the pope is your lover.  8/10 would bang the pope again
Good game but not enough content to keep you occupied for long.
I am going to be really honest herei really enjoy this game and the mechanics of the game are fantastic. The system is very diverse when compared to other RTShowever i find the pricing on the expansions a little more than what they are worth. I have only purchased one and am excitedly waiting for another juicy steam sale
Absolutelyballs to the wallamazing.
An excellent game with no real end goal other than surviving your dynasty throughout the ages. It can be tedious sometimesbut when you manage to kill that little kid that blocks your way to the thronea warm feeling of achievement and success shows you these dark places within you
Married my grandkidsgave them syphilis.
Your wife resents you.  Your children wish you were dead. And all you want to do is go hunting or get drunk with your friends. ... So basically it's real life.

YeahI played a few minutes of it. It's alrightI guess.
In times of succession trouble you either kill your second son or buy DLC and send him to monastery.  9/10 with DLCs6/10 without.
Crusader kings II Takes you back to a much more simple time. Play back in the years where Children had to go outside instead of playing video games..... only to be murdered by a 'Kind' and caring mother. Or before Vaccine's turned Humanity into a bunch of weaklings after all you cant claim your a man until you have had the plague for the third time in a rowdid i also mention that this game takes place before political correctness so feel free to force the Jews out of your land or to eradicate a race.  Thank you Paradox for taking me back to my fathers childhood :D.

If you like medieval strategydynasty management and long gameplay this is the title for you ! I used to be a Civ addict then I spent a few hours trying to tame this beast . While it can be intimidating to the newer player the effort to learn it is worth the time .  If you like the Historical aspect and a Civilisation type game on steroids then this title may be for youthrow in mods for Game of Thrones and Warhammer and you begin to see the value you can get out of the title .

I had a life outside. I had a girlfriend and a nice job. I had freedom. But then Crusader Kings II appeared and it all changed. When the HRE usurped my title as King of Scotlandhe also usurped my life. I only bought this game a week and a half agobut I've already somehow got 40 hours. I don't think I can leave the game... My vassals... my people.... My people need me. I must keep playing. There is no going back. I am The King of Scotland...
Play this with the Game of Thrones Mod.  No need to thank me :)

Reading great CKII stories on Reddit. Bought the game. Watched 10 hours of tutorials on youtube. Forgot everything in about half an hour. Played 2 hours afterwards. Not having the slightest clue what I'm supposed to do. Uninstalled the game. Reading great CKII stories on Reddit.
In this game you can bang someones wifesister and daughter including castrating people for doing so
Crusader Kings II is a dynasty and kindom strategy game in which you play a ruler controlling the serfs and gentrythe politics and advancement of your people.  The base game feels very lacking but the explansions really flesh out the playability and the longevity of the game  Must Have DLC: The Old Gods and Legacy of Rome.  The other DLCs add religious aspects and pointless things. If you're an avid fan of historically accurate scenario starts and creating alternate historieschanging the destiny of an empire than this game is great. If you want tactical warfare try something else. It's more like Risk in its terms of battle mechanics
taught me how to crusade against the muslims i am now prepared for europe's upcoming crusade against the middle east
In 10 yearsthis game will truly be considered a classic -- If that's not the case already.   There's a lot of juggle in this gamebut once mastered

I love this game.

I still don't know why sometimes titles get destroyed...
3-day weekends get destroyed by this game.   10/10 will ignore wife again.
First offon the day this review has been writtenI have owned this game for less than a year and have racked up almost 450 hours already. If you are a fan of strategy games
I began as a king in the northern Iberia peninsulaMy cusins owned the different norhtern kingdoms in the north. As I improve relations with france through fuckingEngland declares war on me. The famine ravages the land as the british purge my land of its riches and women. With the last standing army
Crusader Kings II is a great game. Everytime you play you have an endless amount of stories you can create and weave in your small alternate universes. Every expansion adds many new and interesting features to challenge you or to increase the overall game time / replayability.  Whenever I have a rough day I like to return to this game to escape. I find myself waging warcreating romances and even planning which of my in-game children I will marry off for my gain.  Crusader Kings II is one of the easier Paradox games to learn but that doesn't say much because most of the Paradox games have a high learning curve. Crusader Kings II is semi-difficult to learn but extremely hard to master. I have spent my good share of time learning small tricks or techniques to get better at the game. Everytime I return to CK II I learn a little more about the game.  I love Crusader Kings II and everything about it. ---------------------------------------------------------- I often use a ratio to determine if a game is good or bad.  For every dollar I spendI hope to play at least an hours worth of time.  If I spend somewhere around 70 dollars for the entire game on sale. (nearlly all the dlc's included) and I spend nearly 342 hours playing the game that is roughly 20 cents per hour.  The way I qualify games is that if the ratio is 1 dollar per hour it is a good game because it has made me want to return to play it enough for that ratio to happen. If a games playtime ratio is 50 cents per hour I consider it to be a great game because it means I have spent a crazy amount of time playing that game. -_--------------------------------------------------------
I love killing my children and/or close realatives.
The definition of adiction.
:'))))) 10/10 would transfer AIDS to
This is my favorite game by Paradoxwhich is saying something. It's all in all a fantastic gameand I'd reccomend it to anyone with an interest in strategy games.
Click on 'ADD TO CART'please.
Apart from some annoying bugsthis game is great. If you happen to be looking for a Game of Thrones game that's not terriblegrab the mod for this. Even without mods
Crusader Kings II has a very steep learning curve but once you have learned how it works it is well worth it.
Great game soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much detail  you have to be very careful with how u play I was a 9 year old stoping rebelions with ease and look up tutorials on youtube to get started 10/10 to high stress 4 me
Great game. Deep and complex makes it a worthwhile game to play. Learnign curve is steep but worth it. This is what the strategy portion of Medival Total War should have been.
When you turn half of Ireland into Russian Orthodoxs then have mass revolts because thats all Irish are good for 10/10
Crusader Kings 2 is one of the best games i've ever playedit is addictive and lots of fun once you get past the learning curve and paradox are the leaders when it comes to grand strategy games. However prepare to be molested by downloadable content and microtransactions. Paradox is worse than EA whin it comes to releasing stuff as downloadable content and expansions when it should have shipped with the game to begin with. Sword of Islamcharachter potraits
Be warnedthis game is a DLC trap. Don't expect to play as MuslimsJews
Haven't played much of it but would recommend for anyone who enjoys strategy games. 10/10.
This is definitely my favorite gameright up there with Skyrim and Rome: Total War. None of my friends play itbut I manage to enjoy it by myself. Highly recommended
I recommend this game on ONE conditionyou get civ 5 FIRST. If you prefer a prettyeasy to understand RTS
After months still addicted. Especially with so many mods out there. 10/10 This is a must buy for strategy fans.
I don't really get it - what is so great about this game??? maybe I just didn't play long enough... :)))
All I can say is that this RPG is spectacular!
Married one of the heirs to the Holy Roman Empirefabricated a claimand tried to kill my brother. While he was helping me take over the demesne I'd fabricated the claim to. And I'm a 'family man.'   10/10. Recommended especially to history buffs.

Great game
I can kill hours in this game without realising itif you like histrical games and grand strategy you'll probably like Crusader Kings.
great game but ... so many bugs that make bethesda games stable in comparison DLC feastthe full game with full stuiff cost more than 200 buck ! seriously ????  i would recommand that game ... if you re rich enough to get it up to date otherwise it's a waste of time

10/10 It's Ok - IGN
As the King of Georgia I went to war with some Islamic Empire in the East. I eventually captured the king of the empire and castrated him. 20 years later that same king comes back with a 2000 man strong army with one goal: to get revenge and castrate me. I then had to pledge loyalty to the Byzantine Empire in exchange for protection from that King and I was able to repel that king's invasion. 40 years laterthe Byzantine Empire is in ruins due to a civil war and I am on my deathbed from a failed assassination attempt. That same Islamic King then invades my lands again and captures me and castrates me. We both die in the same month. My son then takes over as and is able to repeal the Islamic Empire from my lands. A few years later he too is on his deathbed and only has a female heir. To make sure that the family legacy continues he then changed the succession laws so that woman can inherit on the same grounds men do. One day after passing the law the grandson of the Islamic King that castrated me declares a jihad on me for allowing a woman to rule

Trying out the 6 day trial. Have not gotten past the tutorial yet. The naval invasion of the canaries faileddid not have enough ships to carry the army even though I hired all I could find. Liked it up to the island part. Im sure its an oversite on my part. Seems to be a good game once you get the way its played.
My hours on record are just what I do on multiplayer. On singleplayer... I don't know how many hundreds of hours I have sunk into this game. Every game is a new experience.  There's one issue that everyone hatesand that's the tutorial. There is no tutorial as bad as CK2's anywhere else in gamingnow
This game is a career. You dont win you just clock in. Excelent.
I successfully married the King of France to some random 8 year old. 11/10 would turn a king into a pedo again

I bought this game for the Game of Thrones mod and I do not regret it! Awesome gameplayploys of intriguewar
NoI wouldn't recommend this game for people who value their lives. As you can seeI've wasted over 600 hours of my life playing CK2. Run while you still can!
I accidentally inherited the Bysantine empire and fathered so many secret fucks on my vassals wives that my court eventually became made up of literally inbred morons. 10/10
Nowlet me tell you. This is one fecking awesome game.
The game is really complexbut you will love it! I started with Total War Medieval 2but then moved over to more 'serious business' medieval games like this.
You can murder your childrenwhat more could you want?
This game is great. It is well worth the price of admission.
Killed a king not relizing it was me 0_0 ? 10/10
Crusader Kings ll : The Game of Thrones
Infinite times better than Rome 2: total war0/10 would bang.
This game took and will take daysweeks of my life ... it looks not so addicting but when you start playing it ! It's over ! You can't just let go your king's crown and your realm .  One of the games where you really need to think about your actions . I wish someone will mix technologies and battles from total war vs Crusaider Kings 2 / EU 4 games . It's would be perfect strategy game .
this game sucks
10/10 would crash again at startup.  should be awarded game of the year!
One of the most in-depth games you'll ever find. And i'm too lazy to describe this game more.
love the series but... too much revoults it annoys me. but i like it the game overall. just one con is all.
Went from the Duchy of Cornwall to the Empire of Britannia... 10/10
Crusader Kings 2a rather complicated game that will have you posining babies and having 4 wives. A game that murder is perfectly fineaslong as they are not of your dynasty (and if your brother is of another
Best game of its time by far.  In DepthExpansiveand Great in all categories.  Keep the updates up!  Great Game
10 out of 10number 1 one game of all years
Game of thrones simulator right here. Incesttreasonbackstabbing and endless plots
My best game!
The most epic game of changing map colours EVAH. Buy itlose your life for six months. Assassinate your children. Get in!
Takes a long time to learnbut worth it.
Great game
Very nice game and complex
Great game if you have the time and imagination for it. Stuff happens all the timeif it isn't the duke next door trying to bribe your servants then it's your wife trying to kill you with a poisonous scorpion. And then the muslims suddenly invadewhich makes the pope force you into raising an army and ride right down to jerusalem to take back the holy country. Probably the easiest paradox game to get into.
My philandering as a minor Irish lord led to the assassination of Charlemagne and the decline of Christianity in Europe. --11/10--Would start inbred Irish Empire and cleanse peasant revolts with fire again...
This game Is amazingIt has probably the best graphics for this genre and is by far the most in-depth and complex one out there. (Other than Hearts of Iron 3 which is also made by the same company who made this where you pretty much have to sell your soul to the devil to learn it) There are so many possibilities to play from a viking in sweden where you form the empire of scandinaviereform the norse faith
Vae VictusDeus Vult.  I have watched this gameand this company
This is a game about how long it will take you to become a racist tyrant. At first your intentions might be like mine: get a small kingdom going with a few alliesa good economy and try to intergrate different cultures and religions into your kingdom. In other words: a multicultural becon.  Thathowever is not how it went down. I was a small kingdom
Crusasder Kings is loveCrusader Kings is life.
Tons of fun!
My 19 year old Niece-Wife got Syphilis and died whilst I was getting invaded by 130 thousand Aztecs  10/10 would STD again
A brilliant game full of intrigue. The Golden Horde is a bit unfairthe combat system lets the game down when fighting an army that's larger. The Mongolians are incredibly unfair and very hard to beat. All in all a very well polished and assembled game. The DLC really make the game better. The mods are some of the best mods i've ever played or used.
Crusader Kings II. It was the best purchase I have made on Steam. This game is so in depth and so vast in options that you could play this game for years on end! I seriously reccomend this game to anyone who has played a Paradox game before! It was the first Paradox game I boughtand after buying Europa Universalis IV I am considering making a collection! If you think this game is your thinggo buy it! Its worth every cent!
The in game tutorial is absolutely horrible. I barely learned anything. I learned how to expand my kingdom through war and assassinating my relatives but what about all the other factions? and how do I earn gold anyway. Despite being completely lost what I have done so far has been a lot of funso I give it a positive reviewI'm sure video tutorials will clear it up.  edit. I'm starting to get the hang of it and I love this game. The feeling you get when everything is going smoothly and you have an entire kingdom reclaimed
incestand murder. Who wouldn't want to play?
Great game  10/10
Extremely deep and easily imersive I have to recomend this great time killer.   Be warned though this game takes time and patience to be enjoyableso if that is an issuedon't buy this game.
This is my favorite game. I have probably played quadruple my online game time offline. I like EU4 toobut this one is still the best to me. It's one of those games that you will either love or hate.
Probably one of the most interesting games I've had the pleasure of playing. I bought it at full price before most of the DLC came outhowever this game as a standalone is still addicting so long as you're into grand strategy.  This game takes a  very  long time to actually understandalthough after about 20 hours I had a revelation and was able to comprehend what I was doing and actually managed to start enjoying the game even more so than I had been. Even now at about 500 hours I still seem to be learning new things
I like this game and I hate everything. So yeah buy it and stuff.
Started a game as Harald Fairhair wanting to unite Norway under one banner.  Ended up conquering Spain and France instead.   10/10 would be the northern moors again.
I enjoyed the game Crusader Kings 2. It demonstrated a thorough understanding of the characteristics of the midieval period in Europe from the age of Charlemagneto the Post-Crusades area. The DLCs are manybut most are unessesary to the newer user. The game's simple
Got possessed by the devil and he told me I was gay.  5/5
The best game paradox has ever made
Castles and Vikings and Family lines and stuff.  Pretty good.
One of the best game made by Paradox.
Great
One does not simply start playing CKII without knowledge on how to play.
Incest Simulator 2013.  Has murder and other fun stuff tooif you like a complex strategy game with some involving RPG elements then don't hesitate! There is a reason this game doesn't drop in price often.
Absolutely love it.
8/10 Vanilla  10/10 With essential DLC    -Old Gods  -Legacy of Rome  -Sword of Islam
So addicting this game is. play all the time i will. Special this game is to me. Fun this game isto not play this game idiotic it is. Clue you must getfun game this is. balls deep i will go
Great game with hours and hours and hours of gameplay.  Do wait to buy the pack in a promo sale thoughcosts are somewhat exagerated if you don't )
The sheer joy of getting your head around this game and doing well is like no other. Had a son named Frank. Spawn of Satan. Frank became king. Italy became Mordor. Love this game.
I suffer alot of ddos attacks but theres not a whole lot we can really do about that.
Hello all! Today I will review Crusader Kings II  Crusader Kings II is a game where you can play from 769 (With the Charlemange DLC) to 1337 This game is all about building the greatest dynasty and make sure you go down in the history books  What can you do in this game?  You can play as the Duke in England in 1066 and try to get the English crown for yourself  You can play as a merchant republic in Italy and try to build a mighty trade empire  You can play as pagan rulers to try and establish your very own religon You can play as a Bysantine Emperor and try to reform the roman empire and reclaim its borders  The Good: Large map to play on (Scotland to India) Many character's to play as Good timeline system Many different religon's to choose  Many ways to play the game  Great modding community  Excellent DLC (well mostly) Historicly accuate   The Bad: Alot of DLC (Over £100 for the best experience) Huge learning curve   Conlusion  Overall i think this is the one of the best games on steam if you can get all the DLC still worth it wothout them but DLC make this game alot better. Paradox are one of those companies that work har on there games and update there games constantly. Keep up the work. Can't wait for Hearts of Iron IV
it's a pretty neat game
Although the learning curve is like climbing up a 900 ft wall that's been covered in oil this is a fantastic game. As long as you don't mind plotting the murder of infants then you are in for a good time. Highly suggest getting the main DLC packs (the old godssons of whatever ect) as they add an incredible amount to the game and make it much more fun.
One of the best Real Time Strategy Games that I ever played!  I like this gamebecause: It's very interestingthere are many playable characters
That feel when you're on to some real big expansions of a good empire and a ruler that is loved by all is replaced with a cravenarbitrary 6 year old child who's weak because your first in line dies in battle.  That feel when the regent is replaced by a family member who wants your titles and is an unmovable -100 opinion  That feel when your glorious empire that you spend hours growing crumbles into rebellion and disarray.  10/10 would rage and cry at again.
I will say this game has a very steep learning curve. I am still figuring things outand I have over 100 into it.  That being saidthis is one of my favorite games that I've found recently. It's a really packed game surprisingly
This game is awesome and WILL eat your time up.
This is one of my favourite games that i have ever playedit may be complex but it is such a fun game to play.
Great gamenot much else to say. Learning curve isn't particularly steep and it's a great time waster if nothing else since you can just hop in and out of ruling your kingdom whenever you please.
Had a child with my neice and declared war on the byzantine empire while holding only a castle.  11/10 would commit incest/ suicide again!

Of all the games I have played throughout the yearsnone have compared to Crusader Kings II. Not a single playthrough in the 700+ hours I have spent in-game has been the same as a previous one. Former empires crumbling early due to weak leaderssmall duchies becoming kingdoms through an early conquest. Many things change from one game to the next. It's for this reason that I feel that Crusader Kings II has replaybility unlike any other.   When I first played the game
The greatest time sink in human existance
So 355 hours into the gameplaying it since the original releaseand i've finally decided to write a review. I dont think much more needs to be said. Say good bye to your family
This is a game where your kingdom will be invaded by the all powerful Vikings of the savage Nordlandspretty much every day. This is a game where all of your 2 million sons hate youand devise ghastly plans to take your throne
When it was first releasedCrusader Kings 2 was a complex game having you take control of a CATHOLIC ruler and see where you could go from there. But nowoh sweet Jesus/Muhammed/Ragnar Lodbrok. There are so many different playstyles that if you don't get any of the DLC you will be seriously robbed from the potentially hundreds of extra hours you would spend playing this game. Take it from me. After this review is over I'm going straight back to playing.   The aim of CK2 isn't to 'win' really
I love the gamebut Paradox should be known for their buggy releases. EVERY content patchdlc
This game is greatseriously it imitates perfectly (or at least better than any other similar games) the ruling dinamics of that timeI am a history enthusiast so I was shocked how well this game was created. I don't like the whole thing about the DLC policy
Best strategy game ever madeand very modable.
After 650 hours over three yearsthis game has hit my number one spot on my personal 'best games ever list'. I've been thinking about writing a small review for it for a while but damn there is just way too much to say. I own all the DLCeach one bought on day one - that is how good this game is. Sadly
This game just keeps getting better. One of the few games that has actually improved greatly every time they have updated it. Massive replayability. Highly recommend.
This is a great game.........but there's a pretty steep learning curve. It took me more than a few tries to get a hang of the basics. And even now I find myself struggling to do EXACTLY what I want to do in the game.  Took me even longer to realize that inorder to gain achievements you have to play on ironman mode.  The game itself is really addictive and fun once you get the hang of it. I love the little things and the politics that come up during your gameplays. Some of the situations honestly feel like something out of Game of Thrones. This person married that person's sisternow they pushing their claim on their landonce claimed they imprison and execute their wife they marry their cousin and so on and so forth.
A highly complex medieval strategy game with some educational elements. It's absolutely perfect for those who are seeking to become either a benevolent ruler who treats his subjects fairly or a tyrannical medieval basterd seeking to expand his the borders of his realm. Whichever real historical character you decide to go for you'd be surprised how attached you can become to a simple character portrait and a few traits.
Easy to learnhard to master. You can see many people who got 700+ hours playtimeand trust me
Not Enough Incest'' 7/10-IGN Seriously though this game is really fun
CK2 is a great game with a lot of depth and the modding community has done wonders to create new experiences. (Big fan of the Game of Thrones mod.) HOWEVER this game always crashes. it is really unstable and the dev's really need to fix this part as I really would like to play more than an hour before it I'm booted out of the game. I know this is not just me as I have gone through different sites trying to find solutions to this problem. I also play Europa and never have this problem. Still going to recommend though because every time it crashes I jump straight back in and keep going.
Everything missing from Civ 5. If you could meld them togetheryou'd have a hell of a game.
You can buy DLC to shave and have new haircut.
Hugely engaging and intricate in its mechanismboth in combat and diplomacy - cannot be mastered which is what i love about it :)
The learning curve is steep steep steepbut if you groove on medieval timesyou'll love just grinding through the immense detail.
Very detailed game. Lots to figure out. A lot of fun to play. Don't let the 2-3 hour learning curve stop you from playing!
This is one of Paradox's better games. It doesn't drown in its own complexityand because of thisit doesn't suffer as much from the developer's usual lack of skill in explaining their product to the player. Generally I find Paradox games are inaccessible not because they are too hardcore
This is the game I always come back to. While other games might give me a few days of enjoymentwhen they're 'new game shine' wears offthis is the game I return to. This is the game that has been holding my interest for years.  Nothing else has the same combination of things to do. It has the war and development of a grand strategy game
Manage familiesdiplomatic relationssabotage
Probably the greatest strategy game i've ever played
Best historical grand strategy game ever. More depth and replayability than anything it compares toincluding other Paradox games. It's even educationalprobably the funnest way to learn about medieval history .. although I'd hesitate to let my kid play it
I declared war on a 4 year old boy he was the king of West Francia... I captured him in a seige and won the war in 1 monthafter that I owned all of france. 10/10 would do it again.
Best strategy games are from Pradox Interactive.
My first campaign on Crusader kings II:  My kinglet's call him Robertsince i've forgotten his name. My king
Lived as an honest man and gave my son everything he wantedincluding a beautiful wife.He decided to kill me in my sleep with a snake. 11/10 would get poisoned again.
Great
You aren't a true king untill your sistermother and aunt are all the same person.  Keeping the bloodline pure. 10/10
named my son fuckfuck &lt3
This is an amazing game. Fun if you like strategy. At first I immediatly related this game to a (not so) similar gameCivilization V. After playing it thoughI soon realized that the two differ greatly.
I started out as a fat dude trying to find a wife. Found one and had a sonbut my Aunt was scheming for my throne. I send her a bunch of hush moneythen plotted to kill my two brothers in neighboring duchies. Blew one up with a fertilizer bomb and the other was attacked by 'Highway Men'. Now I own most of Spain and I go to war with the Moors. I occupy their heretic lands and then die of natural causes when my son and heir is only 12. Soon as he's King now my Aunts start their crap again
Dont know how to play. waste 2hours on nothing rebellion starts sister threatens me to give my title away i accept 2mins later she dies of depression i curse her my kingdom gets wrecked up im proud of my brother. ragequits 10!1/10
it's ok
Made my Huntchback granddaughter marry the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empirenow the Holy Roman Empire has had 4 Huntchback Emperors empire and was offically renamed by me into the Holy Huntchback Empire...   11/10 would definitely fuck up the Succession line of a powerful empire's current Dynasty
Killed the King of Scotlandthen his two sons 'disappeared' and I became king.  I am literally Macbeth0/10.
i played as the the petty kingdom of munster and declared war against the desmond and somehow managed to have only 300 troops to combat the 1.5k sent out by desmond. i was thoroughly crushed in my war efforts and diedand played as a six year old boy for 12 years 10/10 would recommend
It's kind of like dust II but different
I was planning on studying for a social studies test over Islamthe Dark Ages and the Crusades. To prepare for itI thought that playing a game of Crusader Kings 2 would be an effective way to learn
10/10 would throw my Alanian half-brother off the castle roof again!
Awesome gameone of the best investments (in both time and money) I have ever made. Hands down one of the little gems that could be easily overlooked
married my hunchbacked 16 year old niece at the age of 70 10/10 would play again
This game is the Bee's knees!
I started in Saxony as an High Chief (Duke) and my friend was the king. Fight a war with the Danish and shortly after in the first battle my battlewarrior king dies out of the 100 people loss for our side (killed two lords in the battle as well). My son who is literally 0 years old with no real particular traits is placed under regent. My son finally comes of age after a long period of time and after all the events and traits he's gained he is a battlegod ungodly good at warfare. In fact after a few small conquering wars of our neighbors of Saxony he kills several lords and best others in battle no one wants to challenge this guy to a duel as well.   Soon after Charlemagne united Francia after rebel wars for 50-70 years he conquered Saxony placing me in his territory while my depressedwerewolfand former king (my dear friend) was temporarily in the kingdom to be released by rebels and we are split apart from one another. The king (Francia) begins to plot my demise after his brother lost to rebels (that lost him the throne and his titles as well as freed 1/2 of Saxony). My son gets to the age of 21 I'm bored of war/stuck with Francia a place of constant turmoil. I begin to sleep with all the Pagan neighbors from Germany to Russia. By the time of my death at the age of 61-62 (which I was seducing 16 year olds to 40 year olds) I have 21 children most of them claimed by the ruler of the country. I was a master seducer
Start as Gotland in 867. Build up county over all the yearseventually gain some land in Britain. Second ruler conquers all of Scandinavia and things are going well. He has two sonsa genius
Murder and incest simulator.  Conquer the world and shag your cousin.
Crusader Kings 2 is a grand strategi game that really sparks your imagination. Will you start in the big and counquer the world? Or will you start in the small and become great? Crusader Kings 2 is one of those games you will constantly try over and over simply because there's so many different options for expansions.
Love this game and not sick of it yet. Hard to learneven harder to master but a very fun process if you like the time period and strategy games. As someone saideven losing in this game is a lot of fun.
My nutts in your mouththat is how serious this fuck is.
Marry a princesswage warplot
This must be one of the best games I have ever playedI love the amount of detail that has been used to allow a player to micromanage just about everything. Only problem is that I can't find people to have a multiplayer game with
I Love this game! I enjoy the strategythe gameplay and the immersion. It's so easy to become immersed in this game and The time It's taken me to create the kingdom I have. I do recommend this game to all who want a different kind of grand strategy game besides Total war or CIV. please note that to enjoy the full extent of this game there is a lot of DLC to purchase so take that into accountother than that...perfect example of a strategy game
Wellyou can see how much I've played it. It really is a wonderful game :)
This game is a piece of rat dirt/10
It's fine game put due of unfixed crashes when playing more nations with or without mods and cause me to mash my deskop on game mods. 8/10
Base Game- 20 hours 'A Game Of Thrones' mod- 887 hours
I managed to end up banging My SisterMother and Aunt... Been hoping to do that for a while.  10/10 Would Recommend
The king's eyes shot openbut he could not move. There was a hand over his mouth and a dagger above his head.'  Crusader Kings II is perhaps the best and the worst. It makes you believe that there is so much more possible out thereand there is! But it's so hard. So
This is a very authentic RPG that is based in a medieval grand strategy genre. It gives a magnificent portrayal of the way medieval society worked. It is also hilarious half the time as it makes you realize just how randomly cruel both life and politics can be.  Nobles will always be a pain in the inheritance is never easyand your ruler will obviously never be perfect
Started as an emperor in the Byzantine Empiredid very welldied at the ripe age of 60.  Start playing as my son
Best Strategy Game EVER! If you like strategy gamesyou MUST get this game!!!!
??
- Start out as 21 year old King Kanye of Wessex. - Has first son before hes 28. - Name him Kanye II of Wessex. - King Kanye of Wessex dies in battle less than a year later. - Wait 16 years for Kanye II to become of age. - Kanye II has first sonKanye III of Wessexbefore he's 20. - King Kanye II gets sick 5 months later - King Kanye II dies of illness 2 months later.  - Waits another 16 years for Kanye III to become of age.  Long live the Kanye Dynasty!
Killing your own family has never been more fun
My daughter's A S S is bleeding.   After I fuck E D HER.
This is a Paradox game - a probably eeriely complex strategy gameif you never heard of them before. You probably need dozens of hours to learn the gameafter  the tutorial
This game has no learning curve it has a brick wall with glass shards and AIDs. But once you get past that messy disgusting wall it becomes one of the most enjoyable strategy games on the market. The game is also slightly easy once you get good so i suggest cranking that difficulty bar up!
-Started the game in Ireland. -Conquered Ireland in the lifetime of my first king. -First born son took the thrown and married a vassal's daughter. -Wife and her brother have an affair. -Imprisoned and executed wife and brother. -Spend the lifetime of the 2nd king fighting the rebellion started by ex Father-InLaw. -Rebellion squashed -Ex Father-InLaw dies in the dungeons after failed rebellion.  10/10 -- Would squash rebellion again!
Assassinated my wife using a manure explosion.  10/10would play again.
A+++++++ would kill son in law again.
I found this game confusing the tutorial does not really teach you how to play the game (Which it should). Little too much is going on making the hard to learn. but if you get pass that it a great game
Best Incest-Murder-Infanticide-Pedophile-Simulator out there.
&ltFull review will be included in DLC  Cons: Paradox DLC business model  Pros: best grand strategy game ever  Summary: get itif you can afford it!
Crusader Kings II is one of those fewprecious games that will provide you with a true sense of achievement. Once you know what you are doingthat is. And getting to know what to do in the game is the tricky part. However
Took over the Holy Roman Empire and defeated the invading Aztecs as Ireland. Nuff' said.
Great Game for those who want to reshape the history. Highly recommended.
9/10 game. The only bad thing isthere are so many dlcs fixing things and adding things that should have already been in the gameor come later on as patches. Thats what patches are for! Still an overall great game.
Attempt 1 -Started 1st game in Irelandcause I have Irish origins -Formed Ireland -Had a Revolution -Fought it off -Got assassinated by my husband -Changed into my son -My dad took over what I had leftand then executed me... Attempt 2 -Found out I can form Russia -Started as Permia -My Vassel rebeled -I got maimed in battle -Lost half my kingdom -Got Ill -Died Attempt 3 -Long story short
I've played this game for 14 hours  Still didn't get a single achievement  And it feels like I haven't even started playing yet. It's like a black hole of medieval age that sucks your time.  If you like grand strategies for auti- ehm intelligent people than this is for you.

Give me my life back....
One of the best strategy games I have ever played. It has a steep learning curvebut once you push through that it is extremely addictive. The sandbox style of gameplay is the perfect opportunity for you to write your own 'Game of Thrones' esque story for your dynastyand it throws some fantastic curveballs at you along the way.   Want your impotent midget to resurrect the Roman Empire? Check. Want to plot against your power hungry half brother as soon as you forge the next Arab Caliphate? Check. Want to spend the next 40 years as the blind
Best of games
Can marry my sister 10/10.
Best game of Paradox and 2012.
WellI will have to apologize and I'm going to have to put down this game and possibly never touch it again.  I can in no way recommend this gameas I felt like it wasn't really worth the price soon after playing it.  Don't get me wrong
Not my cup of tea 4/10
Great Game
Cockblocking kings for days
Don't be afraid of 'Too Much DLC.'  Most DLC for this game was released over time-2 expansions a yeareach expansion had separately released unit pack
This game is extremely deep: you areor managea family of nobles spanning generations of Medieval history. Intrigue
This is by far my favorite game I own. Murderincestwar
love the game! played it for a very long time.
Great gamebut one must purchase all the DLCs to fully enjoy.
I'm sure Crusader Kings II is a good game once you get into itbut I didn't get the chance. Seems to be a rather in depth 4X gamebut I find the learning curve to be a bit steep. Instead of slowing building up your land and getting to learn the different parts of the game slowly
Holy fuck have I really spent 700 hours on this game ? :D Pick any aristocrat born anywhere between Iceland and India in the 9th to 12th century. Start trying to play like a decent personeventually turn into a ruthless monster who will murder your own incompetent family members so the smart kid gets the throne.
The best of the Paradox games in my opinionthis is a deep strategy game with a very high learning curve. It's well worth it if you stick it out though. A rich and rewarding experiencebut not for casual strategy gamers.
Brilliant detailstrategyroleplaying and even a bit of humour wrapped into one package. Amazing game just be prepared to take days off to play it!
A Strategy Masterpiece
While it is called grand strategy and it surely is exactly thatyou can also call it family intrigue simulator or marriage simulator  If you ever wanted to seduce your auntassassinate your brother (before he assassinates you) and sleep with your sister while waging big wars then CK2 is the game for you. But be prepared to be overrun by mongols while you are busy with your family.  I didn't regret a single hour of my play time with this game
Start off in Axum as Gideon a hardy Ethiopian Jew Surrounded by the Miaphysite Menace Neighbouring the Abbasid blob Begin rapid and aggressive expansion The kingdoms of Nubia and Abyssinia fall for the glory of Yahweh Spend centuries repelling the Muslim hordes and assassinating the Caliphs Slowly creeping towards my goal of retaking Jerusalem 'Jerusalem for the Jews' Wife gives birth to midget Decide to start a dynasty of Dwarfish African Warrior Jews Assassinate and marry off non-dwarves Push for the Islamic Holy Sites Abbassid blob tears itself apart in heretical revolts and uprisings Retake Jerusalem Rebuild the Temple and restore the Kohen Gadol Form the Empire of Judea stretching from Western Africa to the shores of Constantinople Get bored of midgets  Decide to start a new game playing as a Viking Horse  10/10 would play again
A most excellent Strategy game.

The game contains quite bit of depth. I've bought several of the expansions and a lot of dlcas welland that is where I have mixed reviews. The vanilla game is fantastic
Incredible gameabsolutely complex and difficult for first-timersbut immersive as hell! Beware
Best RTS game i've ever played. I played civilization for a longe time and its excellent game but i always felt that it lacked some deph. If you feel the samegive this game a try and you won't regret it.
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Hours turn into days as you advance your family to great power through warmarriagesand assassinations. It is very rewarding to start as a lowly count and make your way up to the King of a whole country(France
Unoubtably my favorite gameThis game will keep you interested for a whiiiile. Especially if you try to get the really hardcore almost impossible achievements.
very very very fun for people who like strategy games similar in scope to the total war series but quite a bit more in depth
You get to kill the Pope... and all his fuck children! Don't play any faction outside of the medditerannian because you will get bored due to lack of decent enimies. 9/10!
Very funimmersive game. However tech support is very slow to fix very common bugs.
great gameplayed 50 hours before even realising it
Great game with well thought out mechanicsnone of which I use as I cheat my way along
My friend gifted me this game so I could host multiplayer for him. After learning how to play the steep learning curve via steam voice call. We started an actual multiplayer game for keeps.   I started off as a Count in Spain and immeadiately died of old age at 74. My 70 year old younger brother inherits and begins knocking up a bunch of courtiers with fucks. I have no idea what to do with fucks and just marry them off. Finally two years later I die of old age again and my daugbhter whom I married off to the King of Leon inherits. Dynasty almost ends there with no male hier of my dynasty until my friend tells me you can change how things are inherited through inheritance laws. I go ahead and change it to seniority and die.   I end up being now the Duke of Gwyneald who's at war with the two other players in this multiplayer game. Immeadiately surrender to thier demands to join the Kingdom of Ireland after my marshall with a skill of 25 gets killed by a 7yo in a duel and my army enters a broken retreat. I get assassinated by my sisterwho then murders my youngest son.  Tldr A game where you try to keep your land in your family and gain more landwith a robust political and marriage system and enough randomness to keep you intrested for long time even though it plays quite slowly. One year in game is about one hour realtime on the regular speed.
I was a dabbler in this gameuntil I got bedbound by the flu and some other infections. Now I am empress of all I survey.  I really recommend checkingout the CK II forums and Wiki for beginner guides. Its a lot easier than the tutorial. Rememberthis is a game that is fun to lose! Always stick around to see what happens
Crusader Kings II The Great Game! Love it!

A Strategy Masterpiece
Utterly engrossing simulation of medieval politicswith an emphasis on establishing and preserving a dynasty. As suchmarriages and good child-rearing are at least as important as warfare. Events in Crusader Kings unfold in a way that makes a story

Rogelio has gained the Stressed trait trying to run the kingdom of Wessex.  10/10 would gain trait again
This is one of the best game ever to be produced by paradox and the best grand strategy game that you can buy.
Eugenics simulator. Lost many hours of my life on thiswould do it again.
steep learning curvemaybe a bit off historically (William the Conquerer dying of a illness before he even landed in England) great gamestill don't know how to play properly
An amazing game with one of the most immersive depictions of the medieval world I've ever seen. I can hardly wait for the sequel. If you're into deep strategy and roleplaythis is the game for you - if you're notget something with flashier graphics and action.
32 hours in and only just working out the basics...........  love it :)
There's nothing I can tell you about this game that the other reviews haven't already covered but I'll go ahead and summarize the salient points. It's a lovely game made somewhat intimidating to new players by it's grotesquely long list of DLC. I'll say what others have said wishlist this game and wait for the inevitable 75% off sales that role around three or four times a year for Paradox games. Then gobble them all up because this game is easily worth it for the time you'll spend playing it.   Other than thatmy playtime speaks for itself. Totally a worthwhile buyeven if you don't get the DLC.
Pretty awesome and strategic. You take the role of a lord. By far my favorite game
This is a very fun gameand I would reccomend it to any fans of the strategy genre. The game is funengaging

This game is pretty addicting. I often play with mah freinds on it and the only thing I really don't like about it is how frickin long it takes to get a claim. But sometimes it doesn't take that long. Howeverif you're stuck with someone that sucks your whole life as a Chancellor you're screwed. AnywayI think this is a great game aside from that. You think carefully or else
Played as byzantium for around 200 years. Starting in 1066 Conquest of de jure lands and holy wars. Gave lands and title kingdoms to loyal courtiers who served me well Took mecca and medina. fuck?? off Muslims. Jihads Everywhere Defeated jihads. Wiped Muslims off the face of the earth. Tons of rebels.15th rebellion to lower crown authority. Got fuck?? off became a psycho and a tyrant All Vassals rebelled no more medium crown authority got autonomous vassals. Another rebellion followed in a month forced to accepted demands for Elective Monarchy due no having men to fight back after the lower crown authority rebellions and war with Holy Roman Empire. Empire has fragmented into different kingdoms the descendant kings of the courtiers who have served me well have rebelled. Became duke due to lost of byzantium title goddaam elective monarchy.  11/10 will replay and kill all of these annonying vassals
This game was released in 2012however they still continue to release DLC for itand change it every so often.  I really like the ability to mod the game yourself
A game about having holy wars declared on youyour heirs being assassinated and having your titles revoked.
A game you can kill many hours onbut beware the DLC.
So much DLC... Not enough money...
Changing Crown Law I love this game but have become rather dissapointed with it and certain aspects that are unrealistic which is pretty obvious that the dev's didn't really think some aspects of the gameplay through properly or played the game as we all do.   The fact that one can only change crown law once in a rulers reign is rather preposterious I would say!! Unrealisticnot authentic and would never have happened in the 'real world'! Especially if it was changing from low crown law to no crown law under duress and under regency when no option was given to contest the vassal demand although I had the levy force to easilly surpress it! This scenario certainly shouldn't count as the King or Emperor's decision to change crown law! It should at least be possible to change crown law every 10 years then!   Bit disappointed to have a young midas touched 16 year old emperor who can not revoke any titles for the rest of his reign no matter the treason or misconduct! Defeats the purpose really and absolutely no point to continue playing!  THANKS FOR A GREAT GAME BUT I HOPE PARADOX DEV'S SEES THIS!!!
I'll admit that I had absolutely no idea what I was doing at first. First game I playedI quickly lost all power and my character's brother took the throne. Started my second game and that's still the one I'm playing right now (so I guess you could say I'm doing a bit better). It's a greataddictive game
Personal rating: 9/10 Replayability: N/A Budget: Worth it. Get the DLC too!  Lenght: Infinate.   Crusader Kings II is a typical paradox games. Paradox excell at making games that you can essentially play forever. Extremely similar to Europa Universalis IIIthis title is even better if you ask me.   It's very difficult to review a paradox game. What makes it great? In truththe game is very simple. You have a map

Veryvery steep learning curve. Excellent DLC. Extremely addictive.
Good game but way too overrated by fan boys.
I think it's hard to lose this gameeven when you're first learning how to play. I'm not sure how to win the game either. All I know for sure is that I have tried to kill off children (my own included)marry infidels
I was a dabbler in this gameuntil I got bedbound by the flu and some other infections. Now I am empress of all I survey.  I really recommend checkingout the CK II forums and Wiki for beginner guides.

You can bang your smoking hot sisterwhats not to like?  11/10I must incest that you buy this game.
yeah its ok
InitiallyI bounced very hard off the original Crusader Kings. Sengoku was a little better (and didn't require reading a 1200 page wiki to play)but CKII is really what I think Paradox were going for. It is a sandbox of the best kind
Worth the moneyand I would suggest stragic purchase of DLC. Paradox is a pretty good company.
One of the best strategy games I've ever played.
If you like strategya bity of RPG and muderous plots than this game is the best thing you will find.  Medieval awesomeness! Wars! Tyranical stuff! THATS CK2 FOR YOU!
Duke Wallan II The Fat - I re-took Rome from a Viking invasion and seduced the king of Italy's wifetwo other duke's wives. And became best friends with two children both under the age of ten where strange things would 'happen' between me and the two innocent children which would always end in a blur. Often getting drunksleeping with people's wives and retaking Rome all in an hour.   10/10 with rice.
Hours and hours of replayabilty. This game is just outstanding. Difficult at firstbut highly rewarding as you learn your way around the menu's and gameplay mechanics. The best partare the EXTREMELY DIFFICULT achievements. Some are rather easy
Do you hate heretics? Are you fond of incest? And have you ever wondered what 'suzerainty' means?  If any or all of these are trueCK2 is the game for you! (Warning: heresy is in the eye of the beholder).
The strategy genre got so much to offer in so many ways. Some focus on the economical part and others focus on the action part but in Crusader Kings 2 you play of a total different perspektiv. If you compare a campaign based FPS game you will surely finish it within a week or two but you will never finish Crusader Kings 2.   The game got different time periods and stretches across all of Europe and large part of Asia and North Afrika with tons of playable characters. Since Paradox spend there time on DLC to develop the game even further (which i personaly think is great) the game becomes unending and I will surley play it for hundreds of hours.  You simplye never get bored and if you do you find a way to make it fun again with trying a different character in another part of the world or they relase a new DLC that you have to try out.  THIS IS A MUST BUY IF YOU LIKE STRATEGY GAMES!
I thinking Thatcher Thialf game has a lot of improving ti do espessially in the graphics department. i meanderende Thialf game rücksichtslos Dickens because it is bad. Complete waste of ur Monegaskische and ur time.
Once you get past the moderate learning curvethis game opens up a wide range of possibilities to play the way you want.
Slowlybut surely stealing away my life.  5/7
CK2 is a fantastic game with a learning curvebut once you get over it the game is a ball. You can refine your dynasty through genetic selectionconquer much of the world or just live out the game as an unambitious duke if you're so inclined. The great thing about CK2 is that it follows very little stories beyond characters like Charlemagne and the history of other famous bookmarked characters and yet so many stories can unfold for you. Mongols conquer Byzantium. Scotland conquering England and countless other ahistorical potential stories.  The downside though is an expensive DLC list. For the uninitiatied
Thank you all who helped me play the game so that I could write a more meaningful review.  In the sake of not wasting your time I'll keep this short.  Gameplay: Has a very high early learning curve. Sadly I felt like after I got a good hang of the game and played for a bitI got bored just before uniting Ireland and felt like the game was lacking something. But then I'm not inherently a fan of 'grand strategy' games for that same reasonthey tend to feel bland and unfinished to me. If you like other Grand Strategy games
Can marry my sister 10/10.
Best of games
While it is called grand strategy and it surely is exactly thatyou can also call it family intrigue simulator or marriage simulator  If you ever wanted to seduce your auntassassinate your brother (before he assassinates you) and sleep with your sister while waging big wars then CK2 is the game for you. But be prepared to be overrun by mongols while you are busy with your family.  I didn't regret a single hour of my play time with this game
Start off in Axum as Gideon a hardy Ethiopian Jew Surrounded by the Miaphysite Menace Neighbouring the Abbasid blob Begin rapid and aggressive expansion The kingdoms of Nubia and Abyssinia fall for the glory of Yahweh Spend centuries repelling the Muslim hordes and assassinating the Caliphs Slowly creeping towards my goal of retaking Jerusalem 'Jerusalem for the Jews' Wife gives birth to midget Decide to start a dynasty of Dwarfish African Warrior Jews Assassinate and marry off non-dwarves Push for the Islamic Holy Sites Abbassid blob tears itself apart in heretical revolts and uprisings Retake Jerusalem Rebuild the Temple and restore the Kohen Gadol Form the Empire of Judea stretching from Western Africa to the shores of Constantinople Get bored of midgets  Decide to start a new game playing as a Viking Horse  10/10 would play again
Just buy it on sale with all the DLCs . It's a must have for every RTS fan.

My son was gay so I castrated him and had him executed. 10/10 realistic and harrowing portrayal of modern day Saudi Arabia
It's a Crusader Kings game from Paradox Interactivewhat more do you need? Nothing! Buy it! 10/10 would marry their cousin.
Crusader Kings 2 is a great gamewhat is there not to love about conquestseduction and murder.  Build your empire and see it crumle when you die. Get frustrated and rage quit or succeed and enjoy it.   The negative side is that its not easy to learn and it takes a long time to play.  Secondary is always the discussion about the DLC's The base game is already a great game. But Paradox likes to support their games for a long time and CK2 is one of those games. That means that they do add functionality
Game is constantly being updated. New DLC's/Patches  Massive communitymods of all kinds.  10/10 would subscribe to cannabilism mod to eat my leper father again
Suceeded the Empire from my father  Vassals start to rebel   Go on then as charles magne went on the saxons  everything is going ok...  my brother attempts to murder mehe fails but I go paranoid  my new chancelor is a horse and my brother is dead  Pope calls for a crusade  I forget to not lead the armywounded in combat
This game is incredibly complex &amp tedious.
this game is way too confusing i have no idea what the fuck is going on and the explaination or learn scenario makes no sense it dsnt even say anything and dsn tell u to unpause game and i dont even know whats happening
The problem I had with this game is it is really difficult and time consuming to learn. I spent more time watching user created youtube videos than playing the game.   This game doesn't have any playable tutorial (only some in game description of things) and instead expects you to learn the game from user generated content.
i have no idea what to do. the tutorial doesnt show you how to do a damn thing so fuck the devs for that and there is so much dlc that finding a server with the same version as yours is impossible so dont think your gonna get to ask other players for help
I used to like Crusader Kings II. I stopped playing for a little while then updated the game to play again. It is now as if all of my saves are worthless because they changed the game so significantly that my armies and whole kingdom makes no sense under the new rules. It looks like Paradox has lost a good customer.
A tutorial is supposed to tell you how a game works. I've played through all tutorialsread through all kinds of guides and still have no idea what's going on. I have no problems with linear algebracalculus
game stoped working i want my money back
Only buy this if you know people who have played it and can help outor have a second computer that you can use to search for help.  The interface is so frustratingtrying to work out what you should do when an alert appears. It took me about 30 minutes to select a bride for someone
Game crashes on 'Loading sounds...'  Back to EU4  0/10
Was 'fun' in the beginningbut now it's seems to developing in to a money grap.
Crusader kings 2... an incredibly involvingsteep learning curvedheartless
I clearly don't have enough patience for this kind of game. I've heard if you take the time to learn it's really a lot of fun! I'm more of a casual gamerso extensive learning before you begin playing isn't fun to me. That's cool if you do and this game is for you!

I've been playing hardcore strategy games since I picked up a copy of Russian Campaign in 1978. The same year I began playing roleplaying games at summer camp by tearing up little pieces of paperwriting numbers on themand pulling them out of cups to generate random numbers. Two years later I was playing Ultima I. Since that time
The best incest simulator on steam.
1. Was kingdom of leon 2. Killed both brothers and inhereted kingdoms. 3. Went on massive murder spree kiling all muslims in iberia. 4. Formed empire of hispana. 5. Realised wife cant give child 6.

Have 10 children with mom. 11. conquer france in a bunch of wars. 12. Conquer the holy landfrom crusade. 13. Conquer finland from crusade. 14. Convert or die!!!!!!!!. 15.

My king is childlessa weak ruler of a great kingdom spanning the length and breadth of Britainwhere his family have ruled unquestioned for two hundred years. His barren wife hates him and he's got the pox from knocking off a maidservant. When he dies
I hate this game. I've tried so hard to like itto learn the ins and outsthe underlying nuances. I've spent hours on tutorials
my friend fucked my wife 10/10
Murder your brother just to get the throne and holdings? Tick! Marry of your sisters to powerful kings just to inherit their thrones after a few murders? Tick! Conquer famous dynastiesempireskingdoms and chief villages? Tick! Beg the pope for gold? Tick! Thousands of DLCs? ... well
Once you get past the moderate learning curvethis game opens up a wide range of possibilities to play the way you want.
I am not addicted.  This isn't a Game of Thrones simulator that will leave you plotting and scheming for hours.  It won't affect your entire worldviewand suddenly you'll feel a compelling need to found a long-lasting dynasty both in-game and in real life.  It's fine. Really.
Another great game by Paradox! One of the best games of all time!  Take control of a member of a nationbecome a Vassal or a King and rule your County or Empire. Contol your army as you expand your Kingdom and take new lands and make new enemies.  This game will keep you confused for about the first 10 hoursthen you will fall in love with the in-depth gameplay.

Although many would claim there is a steep learning curveand a select few would claim it takes too long to learn the game mechanicsI would have to disagree with both of these statements. Personally
1. Started as the Petty King of mercia 2. Decided to marry a Italian wifebecause I need to get married. 3. Have 2 kidsthey get educated by ''good'' people 4. Invade East Anglia because gg 5. Boy grows up to be insterile hunchback 6. Girl grows up to be a homosexual warrior princess 7. Girl plots against me to become homosexual warrior queen 8. Marries off girl to avoid plot 9. Husband of girl dies in a year 10. I invite her back to my court
This gameand every Paradox gamehave within it the seeds of your destruction. In most games
Destroyed the Muslims  Stopped the Barbarians  Saved the Roman Civialization    Gets in to a civil war and a dark Latin age starts
Quite possibly my favorite game of all time.
I am become baby killer - king of eugenics.
This game made me a better christian.

Probably the best strategy game ever made. Certainly among the top five.
One of the best Medieval strategies ever made. Simple as that.
Game of Thrones: The Game. Now with 50% more incest!
Tried to marry my own grand daughter as the 87 year old Sunni Caliph. That wasn't allowedso I married my 17-year-old great grand daughter instead.   10/10
An insanely fun waste of time. Best time spent doing nothing when I should be working.
I had my own son killed so a son of my house could inherit the byzantine empire. I threw a lord into prison for conspiring against me but my guards failed to catch himand all my dukes rebelled. I used my stock pile of gold to hire nearly all the mercenaries in the gameand became the sole lord of the Byzantine's lands.
This game is so good I've bought it twice with most of the dlc on different accounts. It's a masterpiece of programming in terms of AI rationality. You'll almost always understand why people do the things they do. Since every person has a set of actions and decisions to take based on these parametersevery game will be different.  You liked the family tree system in earlier TW games? Have at it! One warning thoughdon't get too enamored with your longer surviving dynasties or the individuals in them (your prodigy progeny may make some people jealous enough to snuff them out XD)
I am not addicted.  This isn't a Game of Thrones simulator that will leave you plotting and scheming for hours.  It won't affect your entire worldviewand suddenly you'll feel a compelling need to found a long-lasting dynasty both in-game and in real life.  It's fine. Really.
I have played this game too damn many hours.  10/10
Played as the King of Poland. Married into The Holy Roman Empire along with my children. Then claimed the land and executed the Emperor. Everyone hated meand I died of old age. 10/10 would betray and conquer and get away with it again.  Highly recommend this game to everyone that loves strategy. It is a more diplomatic approach to it compared to Total Warand has a more realistic form of war

I'm not sure i can review this game yet. I think i need some more hours in the game.....
This gameand every Paradox gamehave within it the seeds of your destruction. In most games
If you don't like this game you're dumb
-I was playing as the celibate 64 year old Emperor of Byzatine -My wife got pregnant -She said that she was blessed by the God like Virgin Mary -My emperor convinced himself that this was true and spend the next 9 months praying to God for what he has done -After 9 months the baby is born -I named him Jesus II -Later i realized that the baby was inbred  69/11 Would castrate my wife's lover again
i killed my brother and fucked my sister  10/10
This game is amazing. The depth of intrigue and the plots are well worth the highearly skill curve. The excellenttactical diplomacy and finesse required to build and manage a kingdom or empire is incredibly engrossing.  This says nothing
i dont even have this game how can i write a review O.o...
I am sure this game is amazingand fun to play...but the learning curve and the sheer amount of things you need to know in order to play this game just intimidates me.   Don't let this review steer you away from trying this game.
Steam asked me to review Crusader Kings after playing for 12 hours.  lol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOW20IrnlIk
I only regret that it's on my brother's account. Argh!
Probably the best strategy game ever made. Certainly among the top five.
You can't go wrong with a game that has warmurderincest and infanticide. Medieval themed torture porn at its best!
Would kill my son again.
Can fuck up towelheads 10/10
This game has a steep learning curve but it also has endless replayabilityloads of mods and workshop content to download and incredible game depth. This game is worth whatever price they're asking for itonly downside is that they will force dlc down your throat until you literally cough up the money.
Haven't played it yetstill waiting on the full release.
Fantasically deep game with loads of intrigue amongst family members. It is one of those games where things of interest keep cropping up all the time - usually just when you are about to pack in for the night. I haven't been a massive fan of some past Paradox games but this one is perfectly made. Anyone with an interest in history and Medieval times should try the demo. But if you do make sure you watch some video tutorials on YouTube before you dive in because this is not a game you can just pick up and play - but is really worth the effort of learning it. The sheer amount of gameplay provided in this game is amazing.  The only issue with this game now is the sheer amount of DLC. I stopped playing it because I just couldnt not keep up with it and now that I am around 30 DLC short it stops me feeling like playing again becaiuse I feel like I am playing an incomplete experience. I know that isnt the case but thats how it feels. So in this case the sheer amount of DLC has put me off playing.  Same with EU4 as well actually. And would have to say I would think twice now about buying any future Paradox games for this very reason. Just cant keep up with all the DLC. If they honestly need to add so much stuff into the game after release then there is something wrong somewhere. And a lot of the DLC coming out is a bit dodgy lately it has to be said.  So this game is recommended for anyone who likes a deep Medieval strategy game and if you dont mind playing a certain faction (like Celtic or English) you can sort of get by on some limited DLCbut if you dont have a lot of money dont even think of getting into this game or any other recently Paradox game.
All the exhileration of spreadsheet simulation with the added fun of constant crashing and absurd levels of instability- but I'd much rather they release $100 worth of DLC then fix their inexplicably unstable game. Overallwould randomly die of pneumonia after a 1 year rule again 10/10 its okay

I wanted to like this game. I still have and play the original complete version on Steam and I would recommend that one to anyone who doesn't love obfuscated UI. I'm guessint that they wanted to add more featuresbut the way they did it make actions harder to do (more clicksless straight forward) than before in CKI. The mark of a great game is one that can show all of this information in a clear manner
10 years into Fabricate Claim and Chill and your Chancellor gives you this look
One of the best strategy games that I ever playedbut you cannot sell model packsor 'customization packs'
Actually CK2 at its core is a good game. I played hundreds of hours offline and own most of the major DLC. But my gripe with this game is the poor quality of the recent DLC (and associated patches)each of them introducing (partly game-breaking) bugs and/or unfinished features which are hardly dealt with or not at all.   Examples includes the Decadence system introduces in one of the first DLC (Sword of Islam) which was not working as intended for (3?) years or the Converter for EU4 which was sold long time even it was known to be not functional . While the first few DLC are quite nice or at least okthe quality of recent releases rapidly dropped i think with 'Rajas of India'
Bought the game only to figure out i dont have access to many featuresbecause DLC nightmare. Go to hell Paradox.
The game is constantly crashing. Paradox make that every their updates a trap for everyone that don't buy their DLC. I will never more buy any of their games or DLCs. Illegal version oddly were fair more stable and reliable that original version when you are playing long timelines.
CRUSADER KINGS? MORE LIKE CASUAL KINGS HAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA
i feel like this game is just a waste of time all together. i played it for a while and i did the tutorial at least 3 times and each time i got more and more confused because they throw out pointless names and dates and words that are so old you will think they are made up. there was no clear cut way this game is organised so you can pick it up and playits spend the next 10 years of your life reading every single one of the messages that annoyingly pop up in the middle of your screen. in the tutorial it vaugly begins to show you a warand says that i should start one with my brother who likes me? (something really fuckin dumb if you ask me) then the brother sytematically rapes your entire kingdom because only 1 second before told you about a tab somewhere that you have to take ages to find and by that time your army is down to a very respectable 43 against six and a half thousand. i fail to see how i am meant to win that scenario or even walk away from that defeat with any knowledge to help me win next time. maybe someone else can be bothered to watch the 1 hour videos on youtube about what in the living hell is going on in this game but i really honestly cbf. i really hope steam does refund cause i would like to get the few dollars i spent on this so i can melt them down and poison the feral cats that are in my neighbourhood.  to sum up
honestlyi think ck2 and grand strategy made by paradox are all fuck. honestlyevery single one of them is a steaming pile of poorly made
Started as a white nazi in the middle east. I eradicated all mudfuck? and fuck and created a white paradise. Then I married my sistertook my momdaughter and niece as sexslaves. 10/10 would eradicate sandfuck again
I'm leaving this review in the negative sectionfor two reasons. Onepeople who are on the fence about the game will check the negative section
If you have even remotely poor eyesightavoid this game. I found it very difficult to read the large blocks of text required to understand the game. This is the only game I've played in recent memory that I've had this problem with.  Game seems funbut I can't recommend it to anybody that has difficulty reading small print.
This game used to be a very fun game but I just can not find it in me to enjoy it anymore. I truly wish that the developers would STOP MAKING DLC for this and just make a sequel already its long past time to make one imo. While I do enjoy seeing a developer supporting their older games I HATE IT when a developer does not progress and instead just continues to update the same game making very minor tweaks half the time at a certain point which this game is LONG PAST it just becomes boring plain and simple. No matter how many little new baby death screams or children education bs that gets added in at the end of the day its the same game. SO MAKE A NEW ONE ALREADY

This is probably as deepcomplex and rewarding as everybody saysbut until Paradox figure out how to create a sensible and logical tutorial that actually explains how to play their frigging games
Obscure interfaceincomprehensible and incomplete tutorialsthis is just unplayable...
This game i great paradox has done it again 10/10
Cool gamebut the multiplayer works 20% of the time. Very poorly optimizated. Good contentbad engine.
VERY difficult to start playing. User interface is horrible. Spent my first hour fuck?? off at this game. Not worth my aggravation to try to figure it out.
Jean Kirstein approves of this game.
Didn't realise how lacking in visuals this game wasbit to turn based for me
Long time Civ player. This game was not for me. Refunded because I already have a strategy game fix and the interface for this game is too obtuse for me to want to learn how to play. Hopefully Steam will honor my refund since I'm barely at the 2 hour mark.  It's probably not a bad game for those of you willing to learn the UI and really dive into it. I originally purchased it on the recommendation of several friendsand I can respect why they enjoy it for its historical worldbuilding and potential depth. I just genuinely can't handle the UI design. Bittersweet.
Get this gameit's good. If you're a heterosexual male who enjoys having sex with femalesjust get this game. If you enjoy sex in the morning
0/10this game contains no mechanics for heretic-purging.  Oh. Wait.
pretty good i guess
My homosexual emperor had to marry his underagepox afflicted sister in order to save the dynasty from annihilation. Five years latershe cheated on me with the Ecumenical Patriarch who was also my lover.   With all this
Clearly is historically accurate and the graphics is decent but is totally mess an inintuitive on windows. The interface create an idea what you can do but at the end just click this or that only if works. The windows help instead to helpcreate more confusion on the game. The tutorial scenario dont explain nothing about the strategy of the game and the plots and marriage is very limited on prestige and other main values. The battle look like poorly developed (win or loose without any player moves) So for me have good potential but at moment is still lame. It's a pity because the idea itself is good. P.S after few moves you realize that all windows and icons are related to game but isnt clear as well what is the relations and interactions with different windowsunfortunately this happen in the tutorial scenario! If you dont know how to play in tutorial how can you play a single or a multiplayer game?
Realy good gamebut  -you have to buy all bigger DLC's to have the complete fun -the systemrequirement is higher then release -there coming 2-3 bigger  overpriced  DLC's every Year -you have to pay for playing other religions then catholic  SoParadox is just 'steeling' your money out of your wallet!
This is a complex game and it's very different. Your family (a.k.a Dynasty) and spreading it is a big part of the game and warfare is generally secondary. So as a grand strategy gamewhile you can start as a noble with a family where you constantly warthis isn't at all necessary. So it's very different in this way.   CK2 is very detailed in lots of mechanics to manage your noble and your family as well as others who control lands and are your subjects. You can have people trying to assassinate you
At first glanceit looks like a game right up my alley with all it's features. I hated this game because everything you do is so hard to do and from what I playedyou can't do anything apart from get married. Don't buy this game unless you are willing to spend 5 hours trying to figure out how to play and what to do.
I wanted to like this game but it seems like I wasted many hours figuring out how to play only for the game to be unplayable. After sinking hours into building my dynasty I boot up the game and find it crashes every time I try to load a save. It seems like this is a problem other people have experienced and there is no complete fix for it only a hodgepodge of suggestions that may or may not work (didn't work for me).  At least I know to avoid this developer in the future. I'm not sure if its the time or the money I wasted that I'm more upset about.
My favourite part was when some hacker fuck stole my CD Key so I wouldn't be able to play
Shortly: I want to like itbut no.
After playing this game for several weeksone simple free patch made it unplayable. It is impossible to contact anyone in support. All e-mails are generated by a computer. Game support is the worst of any that I have ever been involved with. Save your money and frustration. Do NOT pay a dime for this game!!
DO NOT BUY RIGHT NOW! The most recent update/DLC has broken the gamemaking it completely unplayable. The DLCs dont work properlythe game crashes unexpectedly and sometimes crashes the whole computer. Many in game features are broken
First of all i dont even like strategy games that muchthis is probably the only strategy game i have that i can really enjoy without getting bored. I first of all love the whole family tree idea and how you can make offspring to make a new heir to the throne and you can betroth peaple that you are incharge of even if you are not blood related and i also love how you have different traits like cruelgluteness
AMAZING strategy game if you want to simulate being a king.  Oh my lord is it complex.
AMAZING strategy game if you want to simulate being a king.  Oh my lord is it complex.
Funhas a Game of Thrones mod. Game itself is ridiculously hardbut an enjoyable challenge
its a good game buy it now
If you haven't played this gameyou haven't lived.
Great conceptbut too dependent on DLCs to make it a fun game. I look for games to play not cash cows to pay... notice how there's no 'L' in pay. I should not have to pay to play and enjoy the game for which content the company was too lazy to put in or rather attempt to make money off.
If you like crusadingand kingsbuy this game.
One of the best games out there.
Had 4 babies with a married womenonly her husband knew until I imprisoned and tortured him.  Ruler of Volantis (Game of Thrones) declared a slave raid on my lands. I invaded himslaughtered his troops
Everything is unbelievably greatexcept for Paradox's marketing policywhich ruins everything.  I like the game but this had to be said.
I went into this game with high hopes. I had heard from a number of people that it's level of detail was simply like no other. You can build a dynastythey said... The only dynasty I built crashed down 5 minutes into the game due to a poorly-instructed tutorialridiculously confusing and complex game system.
10/10 would marry my own son again
Pros: idk  Cons: unfinishedmap doesn't even have the united states  it's ok
The possibilities offered by this game are endless and many hours of gameplay that await me captivate me too. Having your own lineage and live all the wonders and misfortunes of the Middle Ages is an ingredient enviciará you forever.  After my best character died of ill health at age 44 ... misfortuneheir was a complete incompetent who hated all my subjects. After 2 years in officehis own son
One of my favorite games of all time but the DLC prices are ricidulousshould be free
Take that Spain! You're all West Africans now! 10/10
cash cows 2. now with more dlc!
Steep learning curveafter 50 hours of playing I still learned new things. Played over 600 hours and still loving it.
I used to be a competent ruler like youthen I took incapability to the knee.  11/10 wouldn't conquer Breizh again. ========================================================  EDIT: OKnow with 200 hours behind me
Now i've played this game for 16 hours now and I love it so much. It has a complex political systemand a suprisingly good combat system. Now there are flaws like charecters traits going all out of wack and can turn new players off by the games difficulty. But all in all this is a good game. So long as you have brians and alot of time. 8.5/10
This is a good game ! !!
Great gameI suggest it to anyone who likes history and wants to make the historical experience worthwhile.
This game is just amazingno words for it. I love the Strategy-RPG and the setting is ofcourse nice to play in. Paradox really made a great game in 2012 and now in 2015 they are still releasing new dlc's and I am still playing it. I love this games and every other game Paradox made.
As much as i try to like this gameim just not smart enough to succeed on easy. Battles give me fits and are always my downfall. For a smarter personi would recommend this game.because like most.paradox games
Great gameI love conquoring the Irish lands
Even if you aren't really into strategy gamesCK2 has a lot of RPG elements to offerwhich perfectly fits into the strategic atmosphere. You can either bring Europe to its knees
I invaded Ireland and murdered everyone's family then replaced them with my vassals while fending off a rebellion from my inbred son.  If that doesn't convince you to buy this gamenothing will.
This game is very in depth and is very difficult for newcomers to the genre to get into. There is a lot of aspects to the game that you will have to learn through experimentationand ultimately failure.  Overallthe level of replay-ability in this game is almost endless. There are thousands of rulers that you can play as
I killed all but my eldest son to ensure he got all my landsand no i couldn't change my succession laws before you ask! Anyways turns out all my court now hates meincluding my son
Watch some youtube videos to get a hang of this game before trying to play it. It's a bit thick in every sense of the word but once you realize it isn't as deep as it seems and understand the gimmicks it's quite accessible and can be quite fun.
Playing the Game of Thrones mod for this as a Wildlingthey only respect strongmale
JULY 2014 re-review:   I changed my mind. To hell with this game and the damage it has done to my reputation. I don't know why I keep falling for this.
the game has been updateing for 3 years and each time it has gotten better! anyone who is a fan of strategy gamesshould give this one a lookit even has light roleplay elaments. the is simmiler in style to the total war series but it brings more to the tablewith a in depth trait system that determens how the game may trun out for you. no two games are the same and the AI can be diffucalt even for pros.  the lack of llamas disapoints me so it gets -2 pineapples just kidding i can't stop playing and i recommand it to anyone who enjoys strategy games. 8/10
Henry VIII of England executed way more less wifes than my MatildaDuchess of Tuscany executed husbands. 10/10 would play again
At least 7 times more like Game of Thrones than any of the actual Game of Thrones games.
Ah..Crusader kings II..where Racism is perfectly acceptable but being a muslim apparently is not.. 10/10
The depth to the game is just brilliant. The strategy is on another level compared to previous RTS's. One thing I don't like is the spelling and grammar. While there has been some effort for UK English there are still a few americanism's in there which is a shame but a big improvement on the demo.  Good game though.
Crusader Kings 2 is Bae. Would totally bang againeven though it is a used product.
absolutely fantastic
It's OK
Supersimply super.
The best game i ever played.
They call it 'interactive map staring'but honestly in the end if you're willing to learn the interfaceit's one of the richest games ever as far as micromangement strategey games go.
fuck your momyour sisteryour aunt and then kill all your brothers.  A realistic simulation of medieval Europe.

Great Gamefun and unpredictable
Save your money on Conclave DLC. Conclave adds next to nothing and the game has not worked properly since the release date of Conclave. At the very least wait until they fix the bugsgame crashes 9 out of 10 times when trying to start a new game.
Good gamebest wait for a sale though!
Playing a custom guy of a small province in ireland. Veryvery religious place. I have no income. Local priest doesn't want to pay me any taxes because I am not pious enough. Try everything. *everything* to convince him that I am the holiest irishman around. Character gets drunk and becomes a hedonist. Yay fertility boost? Priest is abhorredand vows to write to the pope! He must be stopped. I have decided to kill him. Have a word with my spymaster and a few of my closest allies. One drunken irish lord comes to me with a plan. 'Listen!' he says. 'Listen
fuck your momyour sisteryour aunt and then kill all your brothers.  A realistic simulation of medieval Europe.
I downloaded a mod to kill my kids.  10/10 would kill my deformed son again.
I thought this game would get boring after the first time I played an almost immortal celibate Doge of Venicebut it didn't.
The basic concept of this game is greatas well as is the implementation.   Howeverthe game has an extremely big and fatal flaw. This is:  Whenever there is a patch or update to the game
It can be difficult to put into words the kind of effect Crusader Kings can have on a personbut I will do my best to do so.  If youre anything like meyou start as a lowly
Probably the best game I've ever played.
You will lose. Over and over. Your vassals will hate you. Their armies will be bigger than yours. You will lose. Be Charlemagne. You lose. Be William the Conquerer. You lose. On easyyou lose. This game sucks. 0/10
Accidentally got seduced by my sonwife divorced memarried my daughter
During first raid attempt to burn a part of france. Gets castrated. Goes on holy war of castration. Son decides he feels bad for christians. Son declares me rival. Imprisons son. Kills son. Takes his skull as a trophy. 111/10 would go on war of castration again.
If you were ever intrested in Medieval politics then this game was made for you. Very High learning curve and bewarethe Mongols are coming...
absolutely fantastic
-Started in Powyscustom ruler and house. -Take over Wales in the lifetime of my first ruler -Die from a 'accident' ona hunting trip -Now playing as my sonturns out he was teh one who caused the 'accident' -Form the Kingdom of Wales -Not much happens in Wales(as it is now :P) but Kent in somehow uniting England -Kent somehow falls to a Jewish ruler -Kent declares a holy war
This is fun gamea interesting game and a game that looks like it could entertain a long time. Too bad that you have to pay for DLCs that include nearly all fun content that also should have been in the main game from the very beginning.   So let's summon up what you can in the main game which is about 40 or 30£ if you live in the UK. Can you play as MuslimJew or Pagan? No. Nut don't worry there are various DLCs which allow you to do that
10/10 Can marry a horse

This is why I love CK2  I start the game as the Kingdom of Axum in the year 1081. The goal is to do whatever it takes to Re-establish the Kingdom of Israelbuild the Third Holy Temple (or rebuild the Second Templeeven we haven't fully decided on that XD) and then go on to rule 'Greter Israel' or Zion with it being a fully Jewish population.  Start of the game I wait a few months for my levies to build up so I can strike out against Abyssinia in order to claim the holdings of Axum. I win that war
its good.
10\10
I would like start by pointing out if you come to into CK2 and think you're getting a Total War gamestop right there. Total War and CK2 are nothing a like they're completely different titles that offer completely different play styles. If you think CK2 will be same you will be strongly disappointed.   This game is a medieval dynasty based strategy game. Meaningyou play a house(family) you create or chose already established dynasty. At that point you play the head of a household
The game seems funbut the tutorials are absolutly terrible.
Crusader Kings II = Good
It's really good.
great strategy game for great minded people
One of my favorite games ever.
Cannot recommend highly enough if you enjoy games where you can plot and scheme and have an interest in Medieval History. However the battle system is incredibly basic so if you're looking for a game like Medieval Total War then you're best of waiting for the next one. However I cannot understate how good a game based upon its strategy and intrigue aspects. In addition DLCs are always coming out so fingers crossed we will have an advance battle system at some point.
Created Hellenic Doge. Conquered the boot of Italyincluding the Popewho I gleefully murdered. Wife was my lover
Ye its pretty good
Amazing game! Trust me get it! So much replay potential!
Good but overpriced.Wait until theres a special deal then buy it
sick game m8
i cant play this beacuse when im loading the flags it fucks with the runtime
Being a regular gamer (any genre) since the era of PongI really don't want to know just how many hours of my life I spent gaming. But these last few yearsI was kinda getting bored of modern day computer games. Lots of FPS with great graphics but zero originality. RPG's started too look dull (do quest
So... you wanna rule a country? Then this game is for you [Insert Your Name Here].  Compared to its brothers and sisters within the Paradox universe this is definately one of the more complex and may take a tiny while to get your head aroundbut firstly before anything I would definately recommend getting the DLC for this game where you can create your leader it just makes it alot more enjoyable playing as a more successful version of yourself. So down to the bacon of this sandwichthe game is great for anyone who loves the whole owning a small tiny piece of country with a pitiful title and growing into a country and becoming king of all you can see
10/10 would exile the jews again.
Fun. Innovative. Need to not just worry about you but who will succeed you. Never ever turn you back on anyoneespecially those in your court.
This game is great although I would recommend getting it with at least the Old Gods and the Legacy Of Rome DLCs to really get the full experience! It really does go in deep when it comes to the medieval feel you get from it.
Extremly complex gamebut very rewarding once mastered.
fuck fantastic and with the great game of thrones mod this game is pretty much a must own for strategy lovers. The game may seem overly complicated at first and really could use a better tutorial and user interface compared to the new europa universalisbut there is nothing like ruling a medieval dynasty and growing in power from count to emperor over generations. Really a great game and the game of thrones mod really improves the experience.
Really good game and absoultely worth it to buybut the game is really complicated and hard too so it's not for 'everyone'.
I would recommend this game to any one who like real time strat games
pretty good. Its a solid 10/10-IGN
When I wake up I think three things:  1) What's my lucture timetable?  2) Scrambled eggs for breakfast  3) Can I play Crusader Kings II?  For years now Paradox Interactive has been slowly boiling away in the backgroundmaking intricate games for nerds to sink hours in to.  But when this thing hit the marketI saw potential. And Jesus did it deliver. It is a sadist's paradise. The point is simple. To send your dynasty to the heights of fame and pulverize your enemies to dust. Along the way you'll have to commit the worst abominations known to man.   Don't have any sons? Wife too old? Murder her! First born son an imbecile? Murder him! Brother trying to overthrow you? Let him. Then when you capture him
It's complicatedunforgiving and to be honest a bit buggybut it's also unlike anything
Buy this or I'll whoop yo !
there are 5 words to explain this game  what who when why where
As the King of England I had the Duke of York as my court dwarf. But he didn't mind. My daughter wanted to be a nunwhich was fine until she had two children with two different men and remained an unmarried nun. Classy gal.
Be sure to check out all the fantastic user made content for this fantastic gem from Paradox. Warhammer fantasy and A Game of Thrones are perfect additions to round out this infinately replayable empire building game. Attention to detail and a wide array of optionschoicescustom events and interesting decisions are all just part and parcel for what is the crown jewel of the medieval grand-strategy genre. 9/10
So I started the game as some random count in Ireland. This count apparently was vassal of one of the Norse tribes in Great Britain. I quickly expanded as much as I could and declared independence. I was barely winning when all of Ireland decided to declare holy war on me. My only ally is some relative in Norway and he cant help me at all. By some sheer luck I manage to win all of those wars and was planning to expandwhen Irish liberation revolt with about 6 times as much men as I have. They instantly capture me and win the war. As I was about to quit the game it turned out thatfor some reason
Out of eight childrenthree of which seemed to have committed suicideonly one survived to inherit my kingdom as I was assinated by my own wife probably because I was sleeping with her sister. This game is GREAT. It's more about personalities abd characters than anyhting else. I don't have much time in it
iTunes update prompts will cause this game to crash during suspenseful campaigns.  10/10 would varify game cache again.
When I heard about this game from a friendI was very relunctant to purchase this strategy game. At the timeI did not really care much for RTS games and this game looked like one in my opinion from the pictures but anyhow I purchased this game just to give it a try. When I first started the game
Amazing game but not worth the 40 buckswait till its on sale. And if you don't buy and DLC for itits pretty bad. EU4 is definitely is a better game if you have 40$
Family murder simulator 1066 Finally figured out how to actually play it 10/10
It took me a long time to learn this game. I watched a lot of people play the game on Youtube. I would load the video on my second monitor and have the game running and mirror their actions. While this only worked for so long because of random chance it was impossible to keep that going for more than an hour or two. It still taught me a lot about the game. I would highly recommend this gameit might take awhile to learnbut once you do you'll want to master it.
CK IIanother paradox title that could be a great game if the devs would do anything against tech-issues like desynchsbug etc. I really like the game and single player is no problem but the desynch makes multiplayer unplayable! (crashing sometimes constantly

Amazing Game! One of the best strategy games.
Had a fuck who suffocated his older brother and poisoned the younger. It's good to see some initiative- made him heir and duke to a land that neighbours muslims. 10/10
If you love strategy game you will love this game. WarDiplomacy and more. One of the best stategy games out there
I did many horrible things for my realm. Murder kidsseduce siblingscommit genocides
My original review of this game was negativebut after I passed the steep learning curveI am starting to enjoy this game. I suppose that it was all about my lack of understanding of the feudal system. I'll update this as I play.
Great game
Great gamelargely historically accurateuntil you unpause. Actually I got perfect on a university history test on maps largely from this game. Infinite replayability
I think I've actually started to understand something about medieval society and politics.

Jfc I'm thirty hours in and still making new play-throughs because I've learnt something new. Such a hugeand fascinating game. (Posting this review on my way to buy DLC)
It is good to be the King!
One of the best games I've ever played.

I meanits alright I guess

This Games is one of the best startegy games out there 11/10
Poor review on this game and every piece of DL content I've bought based on the corrupt way that add-ons and packages are put together and charged. Completely sick of getting ripped off by the Steam profit engineand the dispicabble customer service which also runs down to the makers of the core game and the DLC. I know bad reviews will do littlebut it seems fitting. DONT BUY THIS GAME. - 700+ hour on record.
Honestly if you want to take over the world with incestual dynasties or murder your way into power. Than go no furtherthis is the game for you 10/10
44844
Best game for medievil fans and master seducters! 10 breads out of loaf!
Anyone familiar with Paradox titles is likely to hold this game in high regardand many think of this game as the best Paradox title as of yet.  Even though it's complexand requires a learning curve
Excellent game! More concentrated on character relations than waras opposed to Europa universalis. Although I hate that they started with this terrible practice of making as much game content a DLC as posible...
This game will soon be my life
I suck at this. Huge Learning Curve. Hard as hell. But i love every second of it. id recommnend it to anyone who loves grand strategy or histroical games in general. and a word of advice to people. LEAVE YOUR MORALITY AT THE DOOR!!!
Great for nurturing your inner infanticidalincest-driven European political power fantasies. Alsofantastic Game of Thrones mod.
Bought it for 10$ instead of 30$. Getting heart attack while watching new DLC price.
This game is extremly fun i mean I have been addicted to Crusader Kings II for years ignore the negitive reviews they were made by butthurt losers
A game of many names. The 'Crap I forgot to eat ! Again ! - game' or the 'F*** ! F***ing game of f***ing fuck ! - game' or the 'Oh ? It's already night ? - game'...  Ohand you also get to learn your geographyisn't that great ? :)
Played a game as the King of France. Married my oldest son with Strong trait off to a princess of the HRE with genius trait. Eventually the Emperor of the HRE dies. My grandson with both Strong and Genius trait inherits the HRE because of his brilliant stats. Eventually my ruler dies and my grandson inherits my titles. Now I am my grandson and I establish Primogenture succession law so I don't lose my titles when I die. Now I have 40k troops with de jure FranceGermanyPoland and Italy combined. Time to conquer eastwards! DEUS VULT!
first I took the emperor hostage for about 28 yearsmaking his whole empire fall down to about 50% of its former strengththen declared independents and won the war
Yeahlet's go fam!
This game is addicting! Love that I finally get to name my children!!
I thought I was good at history then I played this ...
Killed all my sons but one to keep my land in one piece gg 10/10 would murder family again
Still fuck?? at my son for cheating on me with my grandmother
It was ok for a short time.
I forced every character in the kingdom but mine to inbreed. I had literally no competition for the throne because barely anybody was competent enough to realise their ambitions.  10/10
Made the kingdom of Ireland in two gens to lose it all because my good son was assinated and was inherited by a real dumpster fire.  10/10 will lose kingdom again
This is the best sibling murdering simulator since I bought Cain and Abel 2015 during the Spring sale last year. 11/10 would eliminate blood relatives 1 by 1 again.
banged emperor's wfe 11/10 would buy again
Buy a copy for my girlfriend so we can play a game together  Taught her the ropesshe was a fast learner.  She was the Duke of SicilyI was the Petty King of Essex.  Convinced her to fight for independence from the Byzantine Empire.  She won.  I secretly seduced her Duke's wife.   'How did my wife get 'Lover's Pox'?'
LOL What the fuck was i thinking.
Can I file a complaint against the makers of CKII for my wife's anger at me. I swear the 700+ hours of play is not total true play...but damn the game is addictive and fun.  What I love about CKII more than other games is that unlike many where your empire grows too largeevery generation brings a new crisisand a re-beat down of your Kingdom. And if you move up a level - then you have a still small group to manage- only now it is of kingdoms instead of counties.   Perhaps
this is the best paradox game it makes me want to dance in my underwear..
do you like crappy dlc's? do you like patches that break every single mod and save game you worked so hard on? do you hate how some games have working multiplayer? do you love cheating ai? then this is the game for you!
I'm still terrible at this game. It's amazing.
Stuck with a one-year-old ruler again. Sure hope my regent isn't in on a plot to kill me. Ohhe is? Well I'll make him Count of East fuckoff and hope the next one is nicer. Maybe that'll give me time to learn to walk.
I've now spent more hours of my life playing this game than in the presence of breathing females. 10/10
Its ok I guess.
Ok gamehaven`t really had the time to play it yet.
Never before noticed the alarming tendency I have towards killing absolutely everybody that gets in my way. Or that it is - apparently - one of my nicer traits.   10/10 - Not everyday you get the opportunity to impregnate half the population of Sweden and then pretend you didn't do it.
Oh boy. What can I possibly say that will do this game proper justice. My ruler had a genius son that was so hedonistic he decided to cuckold his father by having sex with his step mom. When said son took the throne he had so much sex that he was driven insane and appointed his horse as chancellor. When the poor guy finally kicked the bucket at 67 from syphails he was survived by 20 children. I cant reccomend this game enough.
how to play this?  no tutorial or clue  how to play this?  my mouse is broklen?  I threw at wall.  Call me crazy?...  Alan 
wth how can i write a review ... I dont even have this game! AHAHA   10/10 I can write a review
Had a daughter Named her Grace. Born an imbecile. Became slothful. Grew into a brilliant tactician. Died of childbirth. Best Eugenics Simulator around.  10/10 would reproduce again.
Lots and lots of incest and 62 year olds having sex with 16 year olds. My favourite type of game.
Half political chess gamehalf Shakespearean drama. Highly recommend.
What' the difference between Democracy and Monarchy? In a democracyyour vote countsin a Monarchy
One of my children was the antichrist
I keep having sex with my childrenthey keep dying of some sort of illnessand my son/brother keeps trying to kill me. 10/10
Almost as good as Bush's presidential run. gr8 r8 m8 8/8
I'm the Emperor of FranceBritanniaand Hispania
If you have mixed feelings about buying this game..... JUST.... DO IT! MAKE YOU'RE DREAMS COME TRUE! JUST *does hand thing* DO IT!
It's all fun and games until you accidently fuck your cousin...
This game is greatsomeday i hope to be able to finish enough of the events to unpause it.
Play to become the kindjust and brave ruler of Castille. Continue playing to die as the lunaticparanoid and maimed ruler of an obscure castle. Perfect life simulator.
1. Select the mighty Roman Byzantine Empire. 2. Remove kebab. 3. ??? 4. Castrate the pope
-Been playing CK2 on and off with buds for a few years -We get back into it recently -We decide to play some multiplayer because whythefucknot.jpg -I got good as sweeden in super early start date -My friend plays as gotlandwants to be republic -Start game -All goes well at firstcounties destroyed
Feels like im taking a college course 11/10
Just finished my first game. Gotta play a bit more to make sure it's good
I dont even own this game. Why is steam letting me write a review?  This is the best game i have never playedand my opinion has no merit.
This is by far my favorite strategy gamequite possiblythe most unique and satisfying game I have ever played. I have probably spent more time reading about the crazy stories in this game than my total playtime.  Crusader Kings 2 is a medieval dynasty/family simulator complete with all the intrigues and dramas usually associated with that term
Really good gamehave over 180 hours in it.
Fantastic gamevery in-depth. It can be hard to learn for a start but it will be worth it. i played 11 hours straight and i didnt want to stop. i recommend this game. 10/10
The wife I married solely for political ties murdered all my smartstrongcapable heirs so her incompetent buffoon of a son could inherit.
9/10 DLC Trap
Started out as a small countonly one of my namebecame holy roman emperor and committed suicide when he had a daughter... epic
I arranged a marriage for my sonthen promptly banged his newlywed wife and got her preggers. My son found outand plotted to kill me and so I had him locked away in my darkest dungeon. My 'grandson' is born and is now my primary heir.  It's good to be king! lol
I started as a Pagan High Chieftess with a seduction focus. I subjugated a neighboring High Chiefthen seduced him to bring his opinion of me up to 100. I took him as my lover. My husband found out and I lied through my teeth about it. Husband challenged him to a duel. My lover got scared and broke up with me. I decided to revoke his titles. He revolted. A neighboring tribe declared war on him and took over. I lost the counties and ended with the same titles and land.   His wife and four daughters remained in my court as he fled to Lithuania. I assassinated each and every one. He then assassinated me.   10/10 would conquerlove
Play as petyr baelishtake over westeros via backstabs and turn it into a merchant republiccuckold vassals' daughters en masse
I learned way more about history playing this game than I did in high school with that guy who kept me locked in his basement and threatened to kill my parents if I ever tried to escape. Waitthat wasn't high school. That was that guy who kidnapped teenagers and locked them in his basement.
5 minutes into the game a scottish revolt is declared against me.  1 hour into the game my army gets destroyed and my title of king has been revolked.  11/10.
10/10 throw your wife in jail simulator
Do you want a game of thrones like game with deceitincestbetrayal and incest? if you said yes this is the game for you.   Unlike Previus Paradox games you play as a Person and their Heirs instead of some mysterius guiding force behind a nation. Your Goal is well what ever you want it to be.  Do you want to DEUS VULT your way to India?  Reform the Roman Empire?   Leave a legacy that could rival the Hapsburgs?  fuck your sister?  Kill Babies?  All of these things and much more are possible in Crusader Kings 2. It is not a perfect game however. Most of the characters look downright ugly
I really want to like this gamebut the tutorial does not explain how to play it and I am bad at guessing
Bought all the DLC...
Like a pepper. At first it seems too spicy but then you think too yourself 'It's spicy but it's a good spice'
after 3 years of building a spy network my spymaster told me he was gay and asked if I wanted to imprison or blackmail him  10/10 homophobia sim 2016
fuck game tbh
So glad I don't have a wife!
Wife keeps asking why she keeps hearing a baby crying when I'm just playing 'maps'  10/10
You can kill children
my mothers my sister
I wheely enjoy this gameit rolls like a dream. Everytime I end up losing a duchy I screamnot out of glee. I have to stop writing now as I have club now. But to all those players who struggle to get into teh game
Ok here is what i think of this game it is excelnt dont listen to those other haters they are just to lazy to learn how to play it really only take 1 to 2 hors to learn how to play it enough to have fun the only problem with it is that there are to many dlc and withoughtthem you cant play as certain countrys so all in all id say a 8 out of 10 because of the dlcs but oter then that 10 out of 10 i hope this review was helpful
Fawk this game is soo good @_@
One of my absolute favourites. You can play anywhere from lower nobility to the supreme authorities of a nation. In some casesthat is actually a bad thing. It's a game where you must balance the survival of your dynasty and the maintenance of political power. If you are searching for the ultimate internal political simulator (especially set in the medieval world) then you really need to get this game. The expansions are also all well worth it and offer fantastic synergy. Oh and for Game of Thrones fansthe single greatest mod for any game relating to that world (sorry Clash of Kings) is also a blast (quite literally in the case of wildfire).  Happy Empire-Building!
I bought this game because of all the possitive reviewsand because it was on sale and it looked interesting. When I got into the gameI was lost as hell. The tutorial
It's a bit difficult to explain Paradox Interactive grand strategy games to someone who hasn't played them before however that is the customer whom this review is directed towards. Perhaps a good comparison then is to the Total War games. Right off the batmost TW players will recognize the grand strategy-style map that they are presented with when starting a game--which bares many similarities to the TW campaign maps (albeit with far more informationgrand scale
A very nice and sweet game about running your own apple store and making friendships that last a life time
Who doesn't need a murder and political eugenics simulator rolled into one in their life?
love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I played the game mostly in 2013-2015 and haven't kept up with it as muchbut 1500 hrs inI figure I could give it a review. Not much to add that hasn't been said
-You can retake the Holy Land from the Saracens   Deus Vult/10
probably one of the best games ever
Grew up a great steward and think this game is worth every penny.
too much dlc ... just bundle it up instead of nickel and diming uscool game though
My most-played game: a middle-ages politics simulator 11/10
I wish there is Crusader kings III with better graphics and animations :D
Step 1. Buy the game Congratulations! You've bought the game and gained a right to open the game Step 2. Buy dlc Congratulations! You've gained a right to play the game  But still 10/10
Seduce your brother's wife while plotting to have her killedsend your sons to the varangian guard and pray they dont come back castratedget possessed by the devil and become the antichrist
I'm not too far into itbut so far I've learned what about half of the buttons doand that the other half kill me.
cool
I can't stand this game!
The only game i know where it is politically acceptable to murder babies
10/10 Best waiting simulator I have ever played
I never knew how easy it was to convince the Spanish to murder children.
its pretty good i guess
My original character died at age 51 do to a severe case of POX diseasea strong Just Norse King he was. Those left behinda second wife who he had 6 children and a son
Entertaining gamehopefully they keep working on fixing the vast host of bugsborked events and unbalanced additions that they have admittedly appear to be working hard on attending to.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
I like itplayed over 1000 hoursbuy it... best game ever!
This game will teach you about AN ASSORTMENT OF TERRITORIES ON EARTH in medieval times and the people that lived in them. Then it let's you murder/bribe/incest/vassalize/banish/imprison/castrate them.
Best incest simulator of the century! 10/10
Crusader Kings 2 is and remains the best Medieval politics simulator on the market. Not only is it very eye opening about how politics worked back thenbut even how politics works now in the contemporary period.  I definitely would recommend this to anyone. No other game will boil away idealism like this one.
10/10  Nominated this game for the Test of time category because truly it will stand as a great game even 10 years from now. This is one of the games that I always have installed and even after all these years dev team still shows love to the game expanding it.
The absolute best thing I can say about this game is this: My roommate once came to my roomto see me staring at the screen with the game pauseda look on intense conflict and concetration on my face as I was mulling something over. I'd been sitting like this for some time
Really love this game. Highly recommend it.
Great game for anyone who loves the Total War series. AlthoughI would say that to truly enjoy the gameyou've got download most of the DLC
This game has everything from interpersonal petty squabbling to grand strategic international intrigue and diplomacy. If you thought that Game of Thrones was controversal because of all the incesttorture and mass murders then it's all just a joke compared to what's going on in CK II. The winter is coming from both steppes of Mongolia and unpredictable waters of Atlantic Ocean. Instead of dragons there are Holy Orders. Murdering or dismembering your close relatives can become routine throughout generations. Burning down settlements can be humorous minigame.  If i missed something then leave a commentthanks.
Nice game.
Few games keep me up at night plotting out my empire. The game offers a variety of playstylesand reallyI can't go into better depth than 1
10/10 would imprison and execute all my non-genius children again.
Reigned for 119 yearsburied five wives fathered5 sons and 5 daughters
I Realy like this game but i am having one probolem with it. When ever i try to start an ironman mode with dlcs on and get achivments it says i cant even though there are achivments for the dlc can someone help me?
Spent 300+ hours chasing the white stag.  10/10 would screw my bloodline with an inbred homosexual ruler again.
One of the best strategies out there.
It's okay. The mechanics are good and interesting and the gameplay was funif not a little confusing. Most of my time spent in this game was with a Game of Thrones modsince without the absurd amount of DLC
This is literally the best game that Paradox has made to dateand its constantly being improved by them via patches and through its fan community via mods.
This game is very fantastic. This is best Paradox game that I ever play. This could be the 2nd Game that is in my favorite list below Medieval II: Total War Kingdoms. So I really recommend you this game. Worthful and especially for those who likes the MedievalCrusadeor Levantian history... I bet they will like this game. Why do I recommend this game? first of all
CKII is a title from Paradoxa company with a great reputation for grand strategy gamesand Crusader Kings lives up to this. Though the game has been called a 'kill your brother and steal his stuff simulator
I hate every second of playing this game.  But you know what?  I LOVE IT!!!
Truely the best incest/murder simulator on the market.
This game brings out the worst in you in the best ways i ever seen. You are the king of franceclose to deathyour heir is imcompetant
Game never worked for me and has just been a disappointment
CK2 is best foking G.R.R. Martin simulation ever !
Extremly addictive once you start playing it is very hard to stop
Seems complicated at firstbut the Game of Thrones mode makes it worth it!
Ever wanted to get into real strategy? Have a love for history? If so this game is for you. It is very complicated at firstbut within 30-45 min you will feel like you have the power of a real king at your fingertips. One thing to note though you will get the ultimate expirence with the dlc most of this games dlc is godly really great strategy game. SoIf you are sick of being babied by civ 5 and want a true startegy game GET THIS GAME I GARENTEEE THAT YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
Love ItNuff said
Historical. Difficult. Very good.
Get this game and support Paradox Interactive. Their strategy games continue to impress and improve upon depth and detail.
Crusader KIngs II is the best strategy game that has ever been. It is a very dry gameit is not action packedbut the political machinations
Crusader Kings II is a really good strategy game but vvery complex which makes it 10x better. if you like strategy games like civ 5 you will be in for a suprise because it's totally different hen it.
The only gay son simulator you'll ever need
Dear Godhelp me. My life is slowly being sucked away and I find myself slowly descending into madness. All I do with my free time is murder my family to maintain a stable empire. I will kill every claimantevery pretender
Don't buy this game unless you want to spend the next 6 months staring at mapsand then buy EUIV and stare at slightly different maps for 6 months after that.
steep learning curve but great game.
Do you like political intrigue? Do you like invading smaller countries 'just because?' Does the idea of poisoning your own brother to take his land excite you? Then Crusader Kings II is the game for you!
Awesomeness if you like something new and more advanced thats not truely world dominationbut increasing the strength of your family through the adges.
Best game Paradox has ever made by far.
I like this game it is great
11\10 The best RTS in the world I recommend this game if you like this type of games.  Solo20033
I once had a child with my sisterand it had downsand everyone hated me. Then I converted to islam byaccidently
I used to imagine all the things I'd do if I became king of certain countries throughout history and how I'd be such a benevelont and wonderful ruler.  Ohhow wrong I was.  How veryvery wrong.
I once killed my first born son (who was an imbecile) so that my second could inherit. Needless to say my second son fell ill and died and the following year I was captured in battle and castrated. CK2 WHY YOU DO THIS TO ME???
If you ever have thought i would love to play a game where management is a big part then you will love this. The only thing i would say watch some videos ie Arumba07/Mathasgaming/Northenlion and many more because if you go in this blind you will have a bad time.  10/10
another great grand-strategy game from paradox
Well Paradox have really outdone themselves this time. Deathkidnappingsplunder
Difficult game to start but once you get used to itit's still difficult.  Raised an army of 400 soldiers and leading them to fight 9000 arabic soldiers.  Lovely game indeed.
This game has a VERY LARGE learning curve and after 2 hours of messing aroundi only have a tiny bit of knowledge (i didnt do the tutorials because man.. tl:dr) Anywho good game to waste time on.
Very fun but may be confusing and overwhelming at first.
Would be a cool game if it was less laggyand more simple. Sometimes less is more.
I CANT SEE WITH ALL THIS fuck ON THE SCREEN
great game init
I would definately recommend this game. This is the sort of game where you end up in such a messy situation that the only way out is to take out a massive loan to arrange the murder of your two childrenyour husband and then plunge yourself into a war you can't win so your better suited brother can take over and clean up your mess.  Definately recommendworth the money although the learning curve is a fuck?.
10/10 would execute infidels again
My son is the spawn of satanmy wife is a kinslaying gardenerand my brother wants me dead. Awesome 10/10
I only played the vanilla so farbut the DLCs are definitely on the way. A very intriguing gameit's a bit of an interactive Game of Thrones actually (BTW I strongly recommend that mod
Killed my wife because I could.  10/10 would assassinate again.
TodayI get the first achievement in CK II.It's a very nice start.
The GOT/ASOIAF mod is a must haveincreases fun 10 tmes.
10/10 Would play as an incestuousgayviking terror of the seas Ragnarr Lodbrock again.
One of my favourite games of all times. 300+ hours
my wife will literally not stop trying to kill my son it's just like real life wtf
Yeah the only problem Ive had with this game is that yesterday it updated and now I cant play... and I cant play without my mods... can someone help because I even got rid of most of the mods and the game still isn't working.
This is quite simply one of the best games I have ever played.
Yonder game is the finest sport thou canst have unless thou unzippest thyne breeches.'  - Everyone who played it.  This is clearly the best strategy game I knowbasically Game of Trones without dragons.  It's so complexfirst time I played it I hadn't fully comprehended all features and rules and therefore had to resort to unconventional methods to keep my kingdom under control.  10/10 would stab toddlers again.
I have yet to find a more in depthutterly life consuming RTS than this fine game here. And what's moreit's entirely centered around my favorite era to study
Good and time consuming gamewith a lot of mods
There's nothing more satisfying than a well-executed family extermination.
killed my sisters bat girlwhy can't you have a fuck?and my 4 nephews
This game is addicting if you can get over the large learning curve. Creating your own dynasty and conquering an empire yourself is so nice.
On a scale of eight to threeI'd give this game an ninety-four for incest and genocide.
Addictive in a way that previously only belonged to the Civilization series. Sit downstart a dynastylook up
Start game as King of Castille in 1066 Bro getting rekt by infidels I help him out and rek infidels  Donuthin' for a bit  Wage Holy War for Valencia Win Kill all of bro's Children  Bro Ded and I get his kingdom Wage more Holy wars win create Empire of hispana Sleep with sister Sister had lover's pox deciede to spread lover's pox to as many girls as possible gave 4 girls lovers pox DED Son even smexier than his daddy fuck? up Africa and lil' bit o' France At war w/ Black people Crusades!!!!! White peace w/ Black people to Deus Vult Win Back to killing Black people. DED Son is Gay. Didn't do much except swor dfight w/ all fair lords of the land Vassal Rebellion fuck? slap Vassal DEDED By Lover's Wife Son only 4 Gets bullied by faction Lower Crown Authority Bullied a bit more Even lower crown authority  Bullied out the Empire Dukeified Empire collapses in on itself thanks to fuckfuck succession laws End  52/10 would Spread Lovers pox globallyDominate Black peoplehave gay Anal and lose empire due to regency again
I Played as Basileus Basilius of the Byzantine empire Restored the Roman empire but soon got Murdered by my own son a Great Civil war Erupts My Murderous son got murdered by my other son namen Basilius II   10/10 would kill my son again
A fairly accurate representation of how the feudal system and medieval Europe worked. Would reccommend to history majors.
This game may seem completely overwellming at first.  But if you start off with small holdings and give it some time you start to realize that the game basically plays itself. You just kind of nudge it in the direction you want over many *in game* years.  Pretty fun overall but a time sink.
Cant believe I havent reviewd this............and Im not going to now. I just wanted to give it the old thumbs up. Must be good just look at all those hours sunk into it and it still gets a thumbs up.
Bloody spent hours on this came and it felt like seconds. Highly reccomend to any strategy gamer!
Why aren't you on Crusade to reclaim the Holy Land?' 'But I haven't bou-' 'DEUS VULT INFIDEL!'
If you can get by learning the overwhelming user interface (it really isnt that bad)then this game is hours and hours of fun. It gives you so many options for different play throughs that that alone is worth its price tag not to mention some of the amazing mods the game has released from its dedicated community. And think about it this wayin what other game can you go from being a lowly count to Emperor of half the world only to lose it all to your demon child who takes military advice from Jesus (is an actual event in the game).
Wincest.
i just want the badge for posting a revew. games fine. carry on
Even without the DLC: 10/10
It's hours of addictive fun!
Played in the Byzantine Empire with elective monarchy before opinion nerfs. All of a sudden 20 people want to kill me. I get assassinated. 10/10 would die again.
When Paradox releases DLC
One of the greatest games ever!
great game
This game's content is interesting the date'stitle's and names of the rulers are all true however I am not sure about the religious regional information seems to be inacurate or based on false information. Also when I saw the map of england the provinces seemed to be in the wrong locationsspeculative data. The game play seemed lacking at first but the graphic's
Can get fuck?s for yourself 10/10
If you like elder scrolls or game of throne SHUT THE fuck UP AND BUY THE GAME AND INSTALL ELDERKINGS OR A GAME OF THRONES MOD DAMIT
The perfect medieval RPG
hello. i am korean game player. i hope crusader kings II can play korean. i am not good at english. so i have so many handicapp to play this game. ?? i love this game. but also i can't this game either .
After 255 hrs of playingI think I can write a review for this game.  Let's start off with the negative aspects:  The worst part about CK2 is that there is absolutely no challenge. Not to saythe game is easy as it can be. I always started with a county as crappy as possible in the hope of a real challenge but it never took me long (never more than 50 years I think) to become emperor of a great realm
DESTROY THE INFIDELS!
My favorite way to play this is to read up on a dynasty or regionlike de Coucy in France or the Conchobair in Ireland and secure their legacy through ruthless exapnsionism. The expansion of religion in the Old Gods is totally worth itthough the smaller DLCs are pretty extraneous. The excellent mod for A Game of Thrones justifies buying the base game on its own.
This game ......  Chose to by a Noble of cornwall Takes over devon by years of plotting Takes over more land in ireland by using powerful allies My character dies Loses Land in Ireland  Trys to take winchester They have powerful allies Lose all money Lose Devon  9/10 would defintly start as a minor noble again
Shattered retreat. As long as that stays a part of this gameI can't recommend it to anyone. If they change itthen sure
Screen is oversized and doesnt show start menu buttons. Unplayable. free for a week thoughThanks for not being like all the othe guys and stealing my money for unplayable games.
game wont load for me
Political intrigue and dynastic management. Steep learning curvebut very rewarding. You can marry your son to the distant relative of a kingthen plot to kill that king and all of his other relatives so your son can attempt to usurp the throne for himself... if he doesn't die of the Plague first.   Incest
Used cheats to get a claim on the entire world then conquered everyone as a crippled shia caliph with 12 sons  10/10
Has a steep learning curvebut once you overcome it you'll be lost in the imagination of the game. Take your time to learn and it will yield hundreds of hours of fun.
If you have a lot of spare timethis might me what you want to play. Europa Universalis if you like painting the world mapCrusader kings if you like some roleplaying and ruling on a much more personal level. Can be very difficult to learn at first
Imagine the Sims but set within a medieval time period with WAY more strategy (And nonot like that awful The Sims Medieval game). Pretty much sums up Crusader Kings. I have still yet to figure out many of this game's mechanicsand this definitely requires an extensive research and trial-and-error strategies. All in all
Usually sequels come out and improve on a game in small ways: something is better herebut something is worse there. CK2 improves on the original in practically everyway possible it's an upgrade in every department - which is not something you can say about many sequels. It basically makes the original completely redundant. One of my favourite games of all timeincredibly deep and interesting. I've played it offline a lot so my time played is probably treble at least what it shows here. Everytime you play it you will end up with a different story to tell.   I was once Emperor of the Eastern Roman empire
Ck2 is an nice game it has dept and everything needed for an good game
In what other game can you excommunicate your uncleassassinate your brotherand marry your cousin?
Crusader Kings 2 is the first game that i played in this genreI can tell you that it's very difficult in the beginningyou need to look up stuff on the internet to actually get what you need to do
Doth thou wish of rule over Europe? Simpletis'! Rule over many a provinces and countries as KingDuke
I find it a very interesting game. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that you couldn't just declare war because you wantedyou must have a valid reasonor casus belli
Played with my friend once I was a female character I matrilineal married his 2nd son and he did a revolt against my friend and I took the throne over and I executed his character and the assassinated the rest of his line
this games a fuck
Pretty good I guess.
Just want to show my appreciation another fantastic game from Paradox
Crisis Succession Kingdom split between two sons when I died Took control of firstborn and spent entire 35 years trying to kill my little brother to inherit his kingdom Finally succeed Die a few years later and my kingdom is split between two sons again GG 10/10 will kill my brother again
Only played a few hours and I'm hooked.  Buy buy buy!
Just my favourite gameI don't feel I have to explain myselfI am the King of England
Assassinated my dullard of a first born so I wouldn't have to play as him.  10/10
Crusader Kings 2what have you done to my life?
fucking Holy wars man.
I gave this a shot while it was freeand now I have nearly 200 hours logged. 10 outta 10 would reccomend.
There is only one single unavoidable issue with the game. Howeverwith hindsightyou can forgive it. The problem: -the PRICE!!
Very fun and should buy :)
This game made me realise how cruel I really am0/10 would keep killing babies in Gavelkind
Crusader Kings 2 is far and away mankind's greatest achievement. It possesses the rare quality that it is deep and complex without being complicated or punishing. It may be difficult to learn the intricacies of the interface and how all the different subtleties of the game rules link together to make a cohesive whole but it is worth the effort. Crusader Kings 2 game of the year every year.
Best strategy game I've played. And it has more content from DLC and mods.
Buy it or you're an idiot.
The seed is strong!  Addictivedeep and near infinite re-playability.
best stradegy game i ever played. its like civilization 5 and the board game risk had a genius prodigy child.
44844just a superb game. All the DLC's are fantastic and enhance the game. Would be nice if Paradox could provide an occasion free DLC of substance to loyal fans as playing their games and keeping upto date is an expensive exercise.
My first wife try to kill our firstborn son Gergely. The poison doesn't kill the boystill allive. My wife dies 6 months later. My second wife give me a second boythe tutor of my daughter is give me a third boy. The tutor dies
Hours and Hours and Hours
i have been playing this game for many months and have had nothing but fun
I can't really add anything that has been said before wbout this game. It's great. Superb detailso much playtimeit doesn't assume you are an idiot like most modern games do. Simply faultless. Or so I thought.  Much of the DLC is a joke they shouldn't be things you have to buy. The Old Gods and other addons that add playtime and new realms are understandable. I think they are a great addition. The customisation pack
1
wish this game was 4.99
A great game especially of coupled with AGOT mod
Thank you paradox for great new update.
Dear Prospective CustomerYour wisdom and mercy are legendary.  We propose that Prospective Customer and Crusader Kings II marry.
-Installs game of thrones mod -Creates custom High Valyrian count of Elyriaof the dynasty Valkyrienno dragons in the whole world -Has 6 children -Forms kingdom of North Valyria -3 generations of incest later... -106 Dynasty members
GoT Mod is the best thing thats ever happened.
Great Game! Play anyone in Medival!!!
Huge time suck for people who love geography and history. It's like writing the backstory to Game of Thrones with none of the action and all of the incest and the horrible horrible side effects that come with it. Play a viking lord and pillage and burn. Play a merchant prince and battle against other merchant princes. Want to unify Ireland and beat England to the punch? Murderintrigueand giant armies all in a package that while having no 3D graphics of note
Starts as Norway in 1066Son is much better than me.  *waits until death* *dies* Okay let's go kick some british  *dies again*  10/10 would die again
Chillin' in my castle(swag) safe underneath my roof. Yo' vassals in my oublietteI leave 'em in there and forget (swag!) Then I fuck yo' fuck? and then I kill yo' kids  Eat that wonton soup
The tutorial is broken and buggyin a game that desperately needs the mother of all tutorials. You will need an iron will and/or a PhD in biblical fucking patience (and a few months' time) to even get comfortable with the fundamentals of this pretentious and complicated turn based dynasty game.   Just kidding. Sort of. If you are unemployedhave lots of free time
Amazing game.  If you enjoy indepth grand strategy games with a bit of Game of Thrones-esque flairyou'll love this game. While it seems intimidating and overly-complex at first glancewith a little diligence and patience you'll quickly find yourself sinking hours into forging your family's house and legacy.
Obvious buy is obvious.
Great funquickly became my new favorite strategy game to play. It's a little confusing getting into if you're used to more military-focused gamesbut I enjoy the emphasis on intrigue and diplomacy over the more typical combat centric strategy games.
I'd give a neutral review if I could.  This is a tentative warning to Linux users: it's very unstable.
This game is like a huge messy burger. You just cant comprehend how to play it.
One of the best strategy games i played.
Waay to fucking $$$ hungrya dlc just to play as a nation or two? Get outta here  The rest of the game is addictive toughminus the fact that it is hard to catch people cause when they walk they can change their direction withiout any penalties
I'm not sure what I'm doing or what I have done but is lots of fun
Mehit's alright. I'll probably have to play it a few more hours to be sure though.
*You must buy the 'steam review' DLC for Crusader Kings II to view this review*
If I were to describe this game in one wordit would be frustrating. I completed all of the tutorials and played the learning gameand yet all my play time is spent thinking 'why is this happening?' 'why can't I do this?' 'what does this notification even mean?' It gives me a headache even thinking about it.   I am told that bishops who like me more than the pope will pay taxes to me
.
Crusader Kings II is a grand strategy game from Paradox Interactivea company that focuses on strategy games. From my somewhat limited experienceI have had a lot of fun
One of those games where I can leave it for a few monthsthen get right back in with a new character. Almost endless in the amount of different ways to try and conquer whichever part of the world you go for. A personal favourite was starting as the Jewish Khazars at The Old Gods starting point and eventually having massive holy wars between myself and the Sunnis. Also a great game to play with friends. Have had several games where I would play a few hours a week with some other friendsslowly building up until one of us reckons that we can take on the other two (one good one was all of us starting in Britannia and trying to create the empire for ourselves. For the record
A great game for any interested in finding themselves deep in a world of petty politicsclashing armiesand valiant heroes. Find yourself at the head of a kingdom
10/10. I recommend /r/crusaderkings and /r/shitcrusaderkingssay to anyone who plays this game.
Probably the most addictive strategy game I have ever played. Simple combat mechanics might distract some from the incredible depth of diplomacy and intrigue. Total sandbox play spanning hundreds of years with constantnew and emergent 'distractions' creeping up. Sometimes these break the monotony as you recover from a war or have no exploitable opportunities. Sometimes they throw a wrench into your grand plan and a most unfortunate moment and require careful thought to overcome. Every decision has consequencessometimes generations pass before they become apparent.  Edit: And that was two years and many DLCs ago. It's still my favorite game and I play it regularly.
very in depth stratagy game with
This game is not noob friendly but it is one of my all time favorites without a doubt.

530 hours
This is a fantastic game. Blows Civ 5 out the waters.
Would I have 1090 hours on this game if it was shit?
It's shit
What an amazing game Crusader Kings II is a stunning masterpiece of a strategy game with stong RPG elements that draw you into this beautiful medieval world. One of the only downsides about getting into the game at this point is the mountain of DLC that is out there while the dlc isn't entirely necessary it is very beneficial to your experience to buy the major DLC's like Old Gods Sword of Islam and Legacy of Rome to name a few. Overall this game is amazing and pulls you in as you lead your dynasty as a CountDuke King or Emperor. A quick word of warning is that this game has quite the learning curve but patience and a few hours sunk into it will get you going and you won't ever stop. Two years later and the game is still supported and I still play it whenever I can.  Happy Crusading!  P.S. Check out the Game of Thrones mod it is an amazing and in depth total conversion mod that places you right in the heart of the world of Ice and Fire.   http://www.moddb.com/mods/crusader-kings-2-a-game-of-thrones-ck2agot
This is the most in-depth game I have ever played.
The DLC is far to expensive!
dont buy this shit
A highly enjoyable game with dozens of opportunities for fun. However like most Paradox Interactive games it has a steep learning curb and can be difficult for new players at the very beginning. But once you've got the hang of it hours of fun are almost assured.  In many respects the game can seem lacking without many of the DLCs so if you've got money to burn then do so. If not I would wait for the next round of Steam deals to purchase the DLCs.
Crusader Kings 2 is a very enjoyable game that is complicated but feels greatly rewarding when you achieve something awesome. It is one of the many grand strategy games that paradox makes. If you have not played one of paradox's grand strategy games before thenI would recommend starting with Europa Universallis 4 if you canbut if crusader kings 2 is cheaper or you have an appreciation for medieval history then go and endure the learning curve and you will find hours of fun. The most notable mechanic that seperates this game from the other grand strategies of paradox
This is a high learning curvehigh reward sort of game. It takes awhile to learn what you're looking atand figure out just what it is you're doing
A great game of grand strategy that keeps on getting better with each dlc (except maybe for the sunset invasion). One of my favorite games of all time.
Always on sale... Always....  Why pay $40 for this great game when you could play 5 or 10. Worth every cent.
I played on The Game Of Thrones Mod!  1- Started as Robb Stark with 2 hosts in the south. Even though I was outnumbered by many Lannister Hosts I kept a stronghold. 2- After long bloody battles with intense losses I wipe out the Lannister Hosts. Being Weak I had to wait some time at rivverun healing my armies and marching some more down south from the North. 3- Tywin marries Cersei Off to The vale. The vale declare war on me. The Iron Throne musters a huge host of 20k menthe vale 15k and the Reach 10k. I retreat to the neck. I manage to wipe out the Vale Army first while the others were advancing. I had 25k men and a host of 30k was descending upon me.  4- Having better commanders we just about wipe out the host the Enemy kingdoms are completely ruined and have troubles mustering any decent sized host. 5- I quickly regroup and begin marching on kings landing leaving a small force behind at harrenhall. 6- Aegon of the Golden Company invades The Iron Throne he married Denerys so has fucking dragons. He has a host of 10k men but many other lord are flocking to him including the kingdom of dorne. 7- The Iron Islanders Invaded The North. We had to pull host back to fight them off. 8- We successfully fought them and made peace. 9- My host has now fully healed and our changed the laws in my kingdom. I have a host of 5000 northmen marching down the neck. 10- Robb stark is leading the centre
The best game of all time!
Crusader Kings II is a fun game to play. Unlike most strategy games the A.I. here is intense and brutal. There is hardly any room for blunderand even losing can turn out to be a fun thing. If you arenot into medieval historyyou might not enjoy the game as much as the developers wanted
I was murdered by my wife who then took over the throne of France while it was at war with my dukes after I tried to consolidate too much power.  10/10.
I've only played a little bitbut it seems like a pretty good eugenics simulator as any other.  8/10too much kebab.
Its Fresh
This game is everything you could want in a medieval strategy game. Historical figures and everything. Crusadesetccharacters are important
This game made me seriously consider marrying my younger brother to our second cousin to improve relations between our two dynasties.  13/5 CK2 actually altered my social thinking wtf
My recommendation comes with a caveat: be prepared to possibly spend more time learning to play than playing. To get to a fairly competent place I watched a tutorial series lasting 7 hoursplayed the ingame learning scenarioand the extensive/inadequate ingame tutorials. There is still a lot I have no clue about
Simply Awesome recommend 'Old Gods' version easier to enter into war also recommend watching Youtube Tutorial to learn to play as I gave up on game a few times after intial purchase then over a year later one of my favorite games.
Recommended.
I enjoy my time playing Crusader Kings 2but i must say that a lot of my playing time is spent attempting to fix dysnc issues during multiplayer sessions. The game has MANY facets to itand makes for a very intersting game.   The newest DLC for the game added a lot of cool features
Crusader Kings 2 is a behemoth of a game. If you've never played a grand strategy game before (like mebefore this) you will be intimidated by it's depth. There are a staggering number of buttons to clickscreens to read
Great game
man i got almost 600 hr on ck2. there is no other game besides ck2 forreal
A grand strategy game about sexrelationships and politics. Steep learning curvebut pays off once you get a grip of it. Totally recommended if you can overcome seeing less animations and more menus. A great sandbox with awesome DLC's and mods.
Pro:  - complex game - with a lot of features - with a lot of possibilities  Contra: - more complex than Hearts of Iron - very expensive if you want all DLCs
I love the character traits in this game but I with the battle was more detailed. If they teamed up with creative assembly that would be the greatest game ever.
Great gamejust look at my hours. But don't buy unless on sale. It's been out for over four years now and is over priced at this point.
Let me start by saying this:  Do you like Game of thrones?  Do you want to be a kingmake any decision you want at the risk of being poisoned and killed by your fucking son? Do you want to be a prince and rise to power and take over The Holy Roman Empire after 'accidently' shooting your father on a hunting trip?  Do you want to have a wife birth children until she dies get another wife in the same month have her birth children until she dies have a third wife and have her birth children until she dies all before you turn sixty?  Do you want to assassinate the pope then elect a heretic to destroy the catholic faith?  do you want to ruin your reputation by becoming a 'mad' king and going to war with the 20 neighboring countries surrouding you?  do you want to press '' and type help for a list of cheats that will make the game both hilarious and pointless?  do you want to by the ton of DLC packs because this game will ruin any free time you have?   The point I'm trying to make is you're basically thrown into the world and told to keep it alive without so much as a ten minute training session half the fun is being scared to death because sweden just declared war for half your land and you don't even know how to raise your troops. Or you could be a prince and gain fame and fortune and popularity before you even look at the throne. or do you want to be the pope? it's possible. maybe a lowly begger? that's possible. Barony of a crumbling castle? possible. Wife of a mad king that screws all of your handmaids and servants? possible. this game is only limitted by your imagination. Ive played hundreds of (undocumented) hours and I STILL havent found a repeated event and I STILL havent found and learned every mechanic in this game. this game had so much content thrown in my face all at once that I even put it down for a few days. I couldn't handle it. but once you get a foothold in the right direction once you start figuring out that it's quite comical to marry seven women and have 14 children plus a few illigitament ones once you figure out how to defend yourself and even start claiming some land of your own anything is possible and the only time you'll find a lack of content is by staring at the title screen. There's literally never nothing to do it almost pisses me off. 9.5/10
I've never played this game. How did it even get to my library? 10/10
was assassinated three in two days
It's amazing. Fantastic Gameplay Elements that are Similiar to a CIV gamebut a nicer quicker pace that you can control.
OhI just r@ped the Duke of York's Wife...  Oh...
Assassinated three of my sons castrated my nephew and banged two of my sons wives. 10/10
If you ever wanted to assassinate your friends wife this is the game for you also if you ever wanted to push a stable hand off a cliff or sacrifice a maiden to a volcano that can be arranged.
married my son to his aunt and proceded to watch as 3 inbred children were born. Like Art.    10/10 best dark thought simulaor of the century
my friend and i played this game and we both got assassinated within fifteen minutes and spent the next hour trying to repair our crumbling empires before my sister married my cousin and they captured all of my lands  rostov/10 i never got to the actual crusades era
Makes me wet and hard
Be leperous King of Jerusalem No wifehave the leprosey Sister's son is heir She's married to an fuck in the Knights Templar He and is  hat buddy stir fuck up with the Muslim Traders fuck off my biggest Muslim Neighbor who I have a peace with Favorate vassle legitimizes fuck sondies
Offered to join a Crusadethen used the resulting Papal good-will to ask for money from the Pope. Every penny was spent on hiring assassins to kill my genetically weak 5-year-old sonso as to prevent him from inheriting. Never sent any troops on that Crusade.  10/10 would practice Pope-funded infanticide again.
Steep learning curve but it is totally worth it. Easier to get used to if you played any paradox grand strats before.
Hated this game at firstnow I'm slightly addicted to it. The supported mods really help out when you get tired of Europe.
ITs fun by those game unless your a shmeeb
Okaylet's play at the Emperor of the Byzantines and re-create the Roman Empire! . . Okaya new DLC
Bretty good piece of sliced bread would eat again.
Assisted someone to take their rightful place as King of Scotland then murdered him so I could inherit it to take over all of UK. Then installed the Game of Thrones mod and took over the whole continent as Joffery.  10/10

Friend talked me into buying this game  Promised to pay friend back after buying the game for me Played the game for a few hours with friend Hated the game Friend went psycho and betrayed me Didn't pay friend back No longer friends Started enjoying the game  10/10
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME!!! I CAN NOT UPDATE MY CK2 TO 2.3 OR ANYTHING PAST THAT. I AM STUCK ON 2.2.1 DPOO AND I CAN NOT UPDATE. I TRIED UNINSTALLING AND RE INSTALLING AND THAT DIDN'T HELP. PLEASE HELP ME AND TELL ME HOW TO UPDATE TO THE LATEST VERSION.
Literally the greatest game ever made. 6/10
I started off as a Norse raider.  I captured and turned women to my concubines and got married. Had about 100 Daughters. Had 1 sonHe killed all his siblings. The he killed my wife and lovers. He then turned gay and chaste.  My godI love this game.
44844is only medival incest eroge I know of.
Good game takes a bit to learn how to play/master
If you like political intrigue and your wife trying to poison you this is the game for you 10/10 would play again
Go to hell The Sims Medieval!
This game is fun and easy people that plays Victoria II and other games that are like that should get this! Its easy to figure out and fun!
Crusader Kings IIthe 'Game of Thrones' simulator
Every game is annoyed by irregular pause pattren: The game auto pauses and then sometimes clicking the pause button prevent it from automatically restarting and other times doesn't. You never know.  Other big problem is when lesser nobility will revolt and no notice is given.  Finallythe raiding countryies have to be individually stopped. Your lordswho are being raided will do nothing
It took me alittle bit to get used to the game mechanics but after I read through all the tutorials and had a couple of gamesI found this game to be fantastic.
If you want to have long nights taking over Europe as some random small princapalitythis game is for you!
Second-cheapest way to die of oversexing.
hello if you are cheeking out this game right now you should notthere is no need to buy this game right now it is great and fun and you can most nations in the world play your homeland and make it bigger no matter what this is a good game (you can hope that they make a new it can become much more) anyway it is great
As you can see I have played this game a lot. It is just so much fun to lead a nation through the ages. Every playthrough is different and varies in difficulty. The grafics arent very great and the menus arent very intuitive but once you get used to it the gameplay just makes up for all the flaws.
The most fun you'll have killing children short of the real deal.
Very Good game with a lot of micromanaging factions. Very in depth with acurate historical characters. Multiplayer crashes and has sync errors is low point in game. Single player champaign is very good thou.
Easier than EU IV I feelbut I definitely need another two thousand or so hours to really make a solid comment on it.
Absolutely amazing game! You have to download!
It's goodyo
Well. Many hours of ck2. Here we go. So even with the buttload of dlcsits still a great game however very lacking if you don't have dlcs and you are used to them. Otherwise a great gamemany suprises and lots of fun especially when playing with friends. :)
Amazing game full of detail. I suggest this to anyone who is new to grand strategy and are looking for a nice transition. This game really has me going now and I've played over 40 hours with rarely any time on my hands.
An absolute must buy for those who adore strategy or the history of the world.
1500 hours into it so farand still enjoy loading it up several times every week. It has a steep learning curvebut once you clear that hurdle
great game!! if you like Sid Miers civ with a medival twist.
I enjoy being able to fuck my family members and murder children!
One of the best strategy games of all time. Playing as actual people creates a lot of interesting and detailed stories that I never thought possible in a 4x strategy game. The RPG elements should implemented in all Paradox games IMO.
Addicted...
If you're looking for a game with state of the art new graphics then Crusader kings 2 is definitely not a game for you. Howeverif you're interested in a deep strategy game which will siphon away a great deal of your free time then don't hesitate to buy Crusader Kings 2 immediately.
Absolutely fantastic game!
Just started playing this game and got wrecked. 10/10  Get the Game of Thrones Mod.
This game is better than Empire Total Warand anyother Medievalor Historical commanding game. For this you pick traits
This game makes me feel so messed up. All I do is kill the popemy fatherchildren
It's ok.
I will never see the sun again...
The best game Ive ever played
Executed a dude and made his daughter my sex slave for rebelling against my nation.  11/10
I was a simple English lord. Within six months I created a faction to overthrow the King of England Within eight months I had five other lords backing me Within ten months the heir to the English throne was killed by a Norweigian Army Within eleven months Ialong with my backersrebelled. Within twelve months the King of England became deathly ill With twelve and half months the King of England died from his illness I am now the King of England within thriteen months and without having lost one man in battle.  10/10
Think the older Civs but harder with more depth and much more amusing happenings.
5/5*****
dafuq play?...idk how i did it but mother killed rival sibling on my behalf while i partied with priest 10/10
11/10 would raid England with an army of Vikings again.
-Never heard of or played Crusader Kings -Buys game for myself and Girlfriend -Play as England because it'll be easy -Destroyed in less than 10 minutes by Norway -Decide to play a country with low difficulty -Play as Hungary -We choose two young lords age 13 and 16 -Girlfriend is King -We run country -Rulers unhappy with King's age and threaten to revolt -Civil War breaks out -Girlfriend and I fight to save countrywe lose   10/10 would lose two countries in less than 20 minutes
still don't know how to play
Very good gameI really enjoy this kind of rts games. A must-have!
Let me start this by saying that crusader kings 2 is a grand strategy game about conquering fiefs(castlesbarioniestemples etc)crusader kings 2 has thousands of hours of content on it.You can start out as a count
Fun game for anyone who sometimes finds himself looking for the first in a line of kind on wikipedia.
You can't just say this game is good or bad you have to talk about your first playthrough. I was playing as england fighting off two armies which is when my character got Syphilis he died and his son took his placeeveryone hated him so they wouldnt give me any levies so i lost the war 11/10
Either you'll marryboffkill all the west's nobility until your family becomes the God-Emperors of Europa
Crusader Kings takes an enormous amount of patience. At first I had the odd experience of both feeling like I had nothing to do and that there was entirely too much stuff in the game. Paradox is not at all shy about putting a lot of numbers on stuff and not really explaining them very well.  But if you can get past the inital learning curvethis is a very interesting sim. I am not sure I can actually explain why I like it.  Don't be put off by all the DLC. Most of it is optional additional music and art for units. The rest are expansions that add additonal optionslike playing as Muslims or pagans. You can join a game with expansions enabled even if you don't have them. You simply cannot use the expansion exclusive features. For example
Deep yet engaging - it offers an inaccessable but compelling campaign backed up by a highly detailed feudal simulation. Though the gameplay is flexible with a myriad of actionsthe overall strategies seem somewhat shallow - a negative for some. This is mostly offset by the potential for extensive micromanagementdelivering an interesting experience - 9/10
This is one of the best Grand Strategy games i've ever playedand one of the best strategy games in general. It is beyond fun all the little things you can do with people all the little affairs and funny random events and the WORLD CONQUEST. I give this game an 8.5/10. Only an 8.5 because once you become a giant theres really nothing more to do and it gets slightly boring.
One of my favorite games of all time.
Addictive game to play. Definetly would recommend it to my friends. Lots of fun
This game is one of the BEST games i have ever played. I would totally recommend this game for its complexity.
One of the best games I've ever played. Highly addictive and funCKII is an allround great game with fun gameplayintuitve game mechanics and a high replay value. Every playthrough is different due to the advanced AI and you will enjoy hours of satisfying gameplay.There is also a rich modding community behind the game
Pretty cool game haven't played it much though.
I recommend this game to all who like a challenge when it comes to managing your own nation. I wasn't sure I was going to like it when I first noticed the game's existencebut once I got into the game I found it to be significatly better than its predecessor. I like the challenge of trying to stay in control of a realm while trying to expand that realm and gain prestige and piety at the same time. The addition of baronies makes it harder to take counties (while making it harder for your enemy to take your counties) since each barony must be sieged separately. Overallfive out of five stars.
hell yea
CK2 replicates perfectly the ruthlessnessintrigue and conflict of Europe in the middle ages. And somehow while doing so manages to be very fun - an attribute many games today lack. Easily one of the best grand strategy games about.
This game is amazing. I highly reccomend this game for anyone who likes the Civilization games. Yesthis game has a VERY steep learning curve. Don't worry thoughyou'll get the hang of it after 20 hours.. It's worth the money and the devs are very active in updating it and releasing new DLC. Plus
I have no clue what I'm doing but I like it.
A great game. Loads of depthand huge replay value. Lot's of free added content and there are Still expansions being made.  My only complaint is setting up mutliplayer is complicated and a lot fo timesjust plain doesnt work.
this game is one of the best ive ever play on steam hours can be spent just craveing up hertics :P
If you are a lover of history and wish to rewrite it in your own imagethen this is the game for you!
Spent too much time on this gamebut it is a good time spent. This game is one of my stragetic favourites with a great history you can follow and create with the direction of your selected character. While being a part of history is something that has always fascinated me CKII lets you take your House in any direction you prefer. I started as a Baron of Cornwall and soon became the Duke of Wales. My son who continued my legacy then formed the Kingdom of Wales. The Kingdom grew to take over the entire United Kingdom. A brilliant part of this progression is that while one King I controlled did nothing but fuck? and drinkthe next heir to take the throne would then push on and expand the empire. Each character is different and exciting
1067 not giving her a good tumble
I like playing this game even when I'm kinda of bad at it. So many options to try but it's sad that the expansions add so little
Ever played a strategy game and felt the need for for even more strategy? Grand Strategy games like CKII is for you. You can micromanage to the tiniest details of politics in your kingdom or let the world flow by you as you see if your kingdom can stand the test of time.
I reallyt enjoyed this game. Fantastic engrossing game play.
I still don't know how to play this game. 10/10
Its..uh....very good.  I should really expand this.  If you like strategy gamesmurderrpgs
Started as a bstard Irish Thane adopted into a Norse dynasty (custom characterobviously)finished as the newly crowned Irish Viking Emperor of the restored Roman Empire.  10/10  Would make Europe my btch again.
Fun game to play with friends :)
The one of very few character-centric grand strategy you'll see from a western developer. The game's fine but strategically very shallow. The whole thing distills down to getting the arranged marriage you want and using your political influences from said marriage. You can do very little to play like Genghis Khan where you just outright destroy everything in your path with your own cunning and strategem. Casus Beli system is unrealistic in an actual historical context.  Other than thatthe game's addictive enough to last few dozen hours.
THIS GAME IS AWESOME.
suddenly gay. gets usurped.
Great gametime flies!!!
.
If you enjoy running a country on a more personal level and making decisions on how it will benefit your nation and familythen you will enjoy this game. Plusthe game of thrones mod for this game is incredible.  9.5/10
Great grand strategy game
I swear to Godone day Im going to beat the Tutorial .....
Great game very involved and they are always adding new stuff to keep the experance fresh. You can go deep in to the details of the life of your kingdom and breed useful servants and go 10yrs in 8 realtime hours or go thru the life of 4kings in the same time but it just depends how deep do you want to go quickly gather a rag tag kingdom taken by hired merks or a well fortified small kingdom built over a long period that can embaris a kingdom 2x it size in the art of warit is up to you.
I have lost way too many hours to this game....and this is a good thing.
THIS GAME IS AWESOME.
1
I can't even survived one playthrough...
A game where you can start the game as a countassassinate your own emperorand then be elected to take his throne in that same year is definitely worth fapping to.
Explore one of the defining periods in world history in an experience crafted by the masters of Grand Strategy.
So far I like this game but have to admit I still really dont knwo wtf I am doing. Stuff happensI do stuffbut I still just always feel like I dont knwo whats going on. Maybe I need to read a tutorial or something so I get more out of it. I want to like it since I bought the complete collection and have a bunch of content. Dont get me wrong I so like it
Great game alright im gonna put my top 10 religions on 10.Is Christianity its good but you have no CBS acept for holywar straight away. 9.Islam Islam lets you play as the Caliph with the subjegation clause beli and then County conquest and holy wars between shias and sunnis 8.West african paganism ...Your safe and isolated.... 7.Aztec Well your OP 6.Mespihyte Well there good for one reason there splited up and yeah then you get to if your in egypt or armania rebel and reform your kigndoms 5.Judaism Well a weird choice well first of all for all you horse lords people in the viking era there is a nomadic kingdom with a jewish leader Khazaria a good pick but in one era there is one in Jeruslam 4. Finish paganism or whatever the name Well your isolated from christians and you have a good bost 3. Romuva Isolated good fighters and other stuff 2. Norse YOUR GOD DAM VIKINGS!!!!1 1. Tengri Well this is good most of them are nomadic but in the viking era you can invade bulgaria as a tengri ruler and form hungry and going into tribal people then feudalism also the magyars have a good chance of becoming orthodox and jewish and catholic the tengri have the invasion of a kingdom CB what is OP and you can spam it. (What im saying is this is really good as victoria without ultimate mod with no DLC)
Take Aragon and turn that into the Spanish Empire. Then get attacked by the ByzantineArabianand Holy Roman Empires all at the same time. Never knew starting the first world war would be so much fun.
If you think that you are moral person you will change opinion when you get power.
I love this game. Perfect split of war and politics. Best possible for those who wish to roleplay the life of Nobility.
Want to spend hundreds of hours on a game? This game is it.
Still starting out... but this game is a major timesink
Still starting out... but this game is a major timesink
Very fun game. Huge learning curve. If you dont take time to learn the game then it's really boring. 7/10.
This is a very good game :D i recommend it
Fight in a crusade and get rekt by 10000 Muslims. 10/10 best turn based real time rpg-strategy game.
You too can be a professional map-starer!
I'm waiting for the day Paradox combine their grand strategy approach with real-time battles (total war style). On such a daymy life in the real world would cease to be anything more than a series of intermittent toilet breaks.
-My Duke contracted consumption (tuberculosis) early in his reign -Was able to survive the disease but he became mentally insane -fuck?? off all of his subject by passing the 'Hole in the wall' law -Law states that all homes in the dutchy must at least two holes in them the size of peasants so the wind can move freely through the countyunless someone in that home has bad flatulance (min of 3 holes) -Appointed his favorite horse as his new chancellor -Died from old age at 71 because his intrigue was the highest in the known world and everyone was too afraid to plot against him.  Crazy/10  Best insanity simulator
Conquer stuff and seduce people. Sandbox dynasty building at its finest.
Really isn't anything to do in this game. Got bored quick.
I recommend the base game but I wouldn't bother buying most of the expansions. It feels like the expansions are just designed to make your game more frustratingly difficultnot more fun. The Sunset InvasionThe Old Gods and The Republic are all expansions that just make your game unnecessarily difficult. I have over 200 hours invested in this game so while I might not be the best of the best in terms of skill
Its pretty good.
Very buggyslow moving gameit is enjoyable and I would have recommended it
Crusader Kings II is a game about characters set in a Dark Ages/Medieval backgroundand their interactions in politicswar
Ilike the gamethere should be more games like it.
I would totally recommend this game to anyone who is either interested in medieval history or who is into grand straedgy games. It contains historical eventshistorical figures (William the Conquererthe Alexiad) and you can choose what you do.  Do you want to be William the fuck and rather than crossing the English channel
This game is so absorbing that I'm uncomfortable that Steam logs cumulative play hours.
I killed my son   10/10 would kill again
Imprison your friend simulator 2016
The Best Grand Strategy game i ever played in my lifeand believe me i played a lot !
Get CKIIdownload the ASoIaF mod and show everybody that the North remebers!
I married 5 women and killed them all for the next. I died of a fever 12 years of King.  My son married 10 womenand killed 2 of his children for fun. His rule went on for 32 years until he died in battle.  His son now rules the kingdom. So far he has kill 2 wives and 1 child for The Blood God.   I'm so proud of my Grandson.
Crusader Kings II is a deep look into the medieval worldwith strategyrole-playing elements
I love this game to bitsbut after the last patch it's almost unplayable... The game crashes every other time I try to save or loadforcing me to keep having to restart again... Really hope they fix as soob as possible... :-(
Great Game Only play this game if you are not weak minded.. Its a Strategy Game not some Bs Age of empires.
Best Use of an Animal' doesn't applyas Glitterhoof is people.
Random Person's First experiance in CK2
I have spent 450 hours playing this yet i am yet to actually play a full game. I think that might speak to how enjoyable it is - though I may constantly resetI always come back to it.
Start a game using the tutorial. Kill both my brothers to gain their lands Wife only gives me daughters so my vassals despise me for not having legitimate heir Realm splits apart upon death to all my daughters Commit suicid as seven year old girl so realm passes to smarter younger sister Kill my twelve year sister to gain her lands my uncle (know as king nuno the fat) gains independance Materlinealy marry duke in the holy roman empire Become like henry the eigth except with husbands Gain large part of holy roman empire Kill and bribe a whole bunch of dukes to stop factions Character dies and I play as my son Great reconquista to regain spanish lands (and take back land from previously stated uncle) Commit cultural genocide Execute two year muslim girl Suddenly the Aztecs invade france My character dies at 78 Lands pass to daughter who dies Lands pass to other daughter who then sleeps around to regain fauthers empire change sussesion laws as all the dukes love me (literally) Oldest sun furios as now youngest son inherits get killed by oldest son crusade starts against aztecs who have now conquered britain and france crusade loses conquer more land and found empire of hispania get conquered by aztecs 10/10 would get killed by the aztec colonial empire again On a side note the game only offers this many options if you buy lots of dlc so wait untillit goes 75% off. Don't just buy the complete version as it does not include everything
This game is great for strategybut for me what separates it from the other great strategy games out there is the ability to really build characters. Sureyou can play it straight-edge as much as possible
this thing is bags of brillianti noticed there wasnt any bridge building thoughwhich didnt deter me. Get the GOT mod for it and enslave the fuck out of everyone
complicated af
Every Christian must find it in themselves to further the greatness of god. Be this the conversion of infidels and heathens to the true faithor the directly answering the commands of the lord. The mound on which the Son himself was crucified lies in the hands of infidels who do not recognize his greatness. It is the duty of all Europeans to repel these invaders from the holy landand retake this sacred land
A very good gamebut the 3km long DLC list might drive a lot of people away from buying this.
Steps on how to rule CK2 successfully! (Effective as of Conclave)  1 NEVER GIVE COUNTY TITLES AS DUKES. You can give some counties when you're a king and you exceed demesne limitto counter this you need max centralizationbut nevermind about those pitiful baronies. By doing this
There are no words come to my mind when talking about this game. This proves Paradox is the king of Grand Strategy Games. The game is Dynasty simulator where you start from nothing and now your the unquestioned Emperor of the known world. Your rule was so divine that you stopped multiple invastions such as the mongel and the historically accurate invastion by the Aztecs. Your Dynasty legacy is still seen all around the world and no one questioned any of you destions in your rule because your where god amond man.   Crusader Kings II 1453 out of 10 will murder my heirwife and brother again.
-Become King of Ireland -Land my son in the dutchy of Ulster so everyone stops whining about me owning everything -Forgot to marry him off first -5 years later and the useless moran still hasn't figured out how to get girls -The king of France has a young daughter who'd be perfectbut I can't negotiate on behalf of him -Begin to scheme -Go to Francebegin seducing the young princess -Make her fall in love with me
still learned more about history than in school  11/10 would flip off history teacher and tell him that the pope had many affairs
Do you want to marry off your sister for an alliance with franceget them to join your war to press your claim against englandtake over england
This game will become your life. You will begin to plot assassinations. Howeverif you start thinking about incestyou've played for too long.
Only game where my wife can be a pregnantdepressedpossessed werewolf. And my son married a dragon.
Became *King* of Eíre. Slept with daughter-in-law to celebrate. I became pregnant. Gave birth. My wife thinks it's hers.   10/10 Would bear my own fuck spawn again.
Formed the Holy Scandinavian Catholic Feudal Empire then was invaded by Aztecs. 11/10 would desecrate history again
AWESOME GAME   the best tactical rpg out there so far
So... I start the gameand first offI get like
I p[ayed for 402 hours. That says something. I bought this game back in 2012. It is 2016.
This is the game that you play with a friendwork togetheryou get the position of king
Paradox plaza games have ruined all other gaming for me. Now whenever I'm playing something else I can't help but thing 'man I could be playing CK2 right now'.
Fantastic game with real re-playabiity. Fun to win and fun to lose!
It's just... amazing.. I can't come off of it!
One of my vassels f**** my wifeso i imprison him and divorse my wife. I take one of the vassel's two landsrelease him
It's a good gamebut I don't think that I've fully been immersed into the game. I'm still fairly new to it though.
Amazing strategy/RPG game! So many hours of content !
This isnt a gameits more than that ! This is something like a book where you should keep it in your library. Classic
So... I start the gameand first offI get like
I p[ayed for 402 hours. That says something. I bought this game back in 2012. It is 2016.
Ah Crusader Kings II. Within the game you have an option of variously ranked people. From Barons to Emperors. More or less just marrying smart and murder. You can also seduce your sisteror kill your dumb grandkids.   11/10 Would mess up family relations again.
8 hours in and no fucking idea what I'm doing. i'm like a baby just banging rattles on the ground but stoked for every second of it.
This is a great game! I love it! I really hope that you guys make a B.C. game similar to this game! That would be awesome!
Locked myself in my room for 12 hourswhen I came out I was finally beginning to understand how to play  10/10 would spend half a day clicking buttons on a map  ---------  Became a duke in ireland Father game me his territory when he died Annexed the county to the west Poisoned by the child of the annexed counties son as revenge for keeping his father locked in my dungeon for 13 years. Became my fuck-head heir Second oldest (Who I actually liked) followed through and assassinated meleaving him the rightful heir. Country implodes 4 quick deaths later I find myself with a female ruler that nobody respects
CK2 is an incredible RPG built on a mediocre GSG. If you want a historically accurate grand strategy gameor one in which it is difficult to expandor a game about painting the map
I'm wondering if I'll ever be able to get to the end of this game...
Tons of fun playingbut you really need the DLC's for the full experience
An amazing game combining elemets of RPG and RTS games. My only complaint is that the game has so many DLCs.
evil power trip the game
I'm 60 hours in and I have no idea what i'm doing but this game is amazing.
Amazing game with tons of strategic dept.
10/10  Would bang my cousins again!
Chinese version badly neededman!!Do not underestimate the number of steamers in Chinamkay?
Lost countless hours to this gameit takes hold of yougives you endless role paying ability and then kills your fav char for his inept son. Over a 1000 hrs on this game
Be Jarl of Svitjod (basically sweden)  Need a fuck tone of gold to create Sweden  Thinks 'Maybe raiding Scotland could be good'  Send 2500 men oversees and hope for the best  Land in this fuckfuck  King instantly agressive  Bro what the fuck  See tiny army of 300  Thinks it will be easy  Oh how easy it was UNTIL MY DUDE JOHN NECKBEARD GOT CAPTURED  Okay okay time for damage controll  This dude wants 145 gold  I got 10  Brain.exe no work To cut the story short after 10 years and the whole of Scotland in ruins I could pay back  Returned with a 5 gold profit  got 50 presige tho  10/10 Would be captured again
8/8 brother died in a mysterious accident involving a volley of arrows.
Fun and good game. Just too much DLC. It would be nice for Sword of Islam (ability to play as a Muslum) to be part of the main game.
Excellent gamethe intrigue is amazing. You can blob countries or spread your dynasty and see how your family builds an empire. Only downside is many things that should be in the game are hidden in various DLC.
A hell of a gameif you like to take your timeand conquer the world. And everybody loves that.
Has a huge learning curvebut once you get past itit can be quite fun if you ever dreamed of being nobility.
Started as a County in Ireland. Now control all except Ulstersome of WalesCornwall and some of Scotland. Probably my favorite game of all time!! I'm a massive Civilization fan and when I found this
still learned more about history than in school  11/10 would flip off history teacher and tell him that the pope had many affairs
Do you want to marry off your sister for an alliance with franceget them to join your war to press your claim against englandtake over england
The way the load/save game system works is terrible. They don't explain some things in the tutorial which kind of screwed me over in the gamehaving to start over because of these things isn't very enjoyable for such a long game.
This game is perfect! I love this gameBUT the DLC's are too many and cheap! And without them the game is boring...
I am the great great great gandson of William the Conqueror. The year is 1259. Foreign peoples arrive from the West. Aztecs? They conquer Iceland and Brittany. 12/59 would face a European genocide again.  Edit: add 2 more greats
Best world domination sim ever
5 hours of my life has gone by..in minutes it seems.... Its was like I was taking part in the first series of GOT!  I just played the tutorial... but that had enough   I started out as King of Leon.. (cant remember any of their songs) with the lofty of ambission to get married and make sure I had an heir. At the age of 28 which seems to be getting on in years (what was I doing prior to that?) I had a vast array of beauties to choose from.. it seems getting on at over 30 meant that my chances of conception were reduced so cut out this demographic rather quickly.. this also meant I could not act like Sunderlands johnson and invite over a few 15 year olds to see the crown jewels.. the heir was my goal... so ended up marrying a 19 year old Dane who wanted no more than for me to buy her a murderous vicous taloned golden eagle.. she loved me for it...  Next step was to expand my empire but also take a vacation at the same timeand Grand Cannaries seemed the perfect choice for a spot of work and play. My chancellor left a few months early to check out the beaches but also managed to conjur up some trumped up idea that I had a claim to the islands.. everyone bought it and the next thing I know Im off down to Grand Canaries for a 6 month boating trip and a touch of seige thrown in.. My vassals were not too chuffed as I had taken the boys down with me for the trip ..trying to get 2500 men into the local clubs was a logistical nightmare..  Anyway to make up for it I sent off one of my vassals to take control of the Islands.. he was so grateful that almost immediately he started up a faction for independence.. obviously wanted the beaches for himself...  On getting back I learned that my brother had fallen asleep at the helm and I had a right to claim his lands.. of course my army was a bit tired from their recent boys adventureso decide the only decent thing to do was to assassinate him.. interestingly his wife was a rather willing participant in the plot
I love these kinds of war simulation games. This is a very good game
My Bzyantine son in-law blinded my daughter (his wife). So I fuck?? him off enough to raise his flag in rebellionwon the resulting war and imprisoned him. I threw him in the deepest darkest hole I had (the oubliette) and let him rot for 8 yearswhere he died a maimed

Good game if ur autis...I meansmart.
A mysterious elder warrior with japaneese accent taught me martial arts in novgorod... after I paid his ridiculous booze tab in the tavern where I found him
Almost 300 hours inand I still learn more about this game. Grand strategy with RPG elementsit tells history as the result of decisions by unique individuals
Would be a good game if I could load into it :/  (Get EU4 not this heap of ****)
BEST GAME in Medieval Politics Economics Social Simulation EVER!! STRATEGY AWESOMENESS00/10! XD
I spent almost 700 hours playing this game and I feel like every time I start a new playthroughnew stuff happens: - Start off as the count of a tiny territory in Brittania realize a few generations later your late grandfather on your mother's side was the king of Poland and his son had no heir. Have fun spending the next decades crushing the rebellions of angry polish nobles who won't accept the fact that their new ruler is a Britonand a damn good ruler at that. - Become a master conspirator and send an annoying rival to prison in order to assassinate him and marry his daughter afterwards. Head-desk repeatedly as the man dodges EVERY SINGLE fuckING ASSASSIN you send after him. While he is in prison. For TWENTY YEARS. - Spend three generations fighting inside your own kingdom for dominance
Iron Man Mode  -Took Ireland  -Conquered parts of Scotland  -Had 7 duaghters  -7th daughter was demon possessed   -String of murders in the castle  -Woke up with a fork in my eye before dying  -7th daughter ended the game
As of yetI am still to lear how to play this game so I am a bit of a noobbut I still like this game and I recommend it to someone who is a fan of political intrigue and strategy
**This recommendation comes with a warning...this game will kick you in the teeth and ask you to say 'thank you' for it.**  Don't go into this game thinking that you are playing a countryyou are playing as a dynasty(familybasically). I always find myself playing as William the Conqueror and destroying any armies I face as I start conquering England.  I would love to take my time and conquer a holding in every county
Good gameDLC's are like 'Hungry Hungry Felhound'.
very analyticawesome and very challenging game as well
-Sired Ragnar Lodbrokinfamous Vikingand diead of old age
Too much DLC that is just fluff or major game changes for the sake of changes. Like the conclave dlc. Which turns every kingdom into the BEmpire. Which means that you have vassals who have 'power' and there for if you dont bow to their whims they will rebel. ALL the time. It cannot be stopped. The game only gives so many spots for power. All the slots filled up? Too bad going to nag and rebel anyway because you didn't bow to my 'Power' The only ONLY way I found to deal with this problem is to build up a massive pile of gold. Which isn't fun. Not to mention that before the conclave DLC vassuals would just go 'King who has been ruling for 40+ yearsthis 0 year old should be in power.' THE fuck? I have not played this game since Conclave DLC and I do not plan on playing this game again. I dont know who Paradox is making this DLC for either the money probly or they have their head so far up their  that they think that their fuck ideas are the best things never but ingoring what their players say.
become king of ireland start taking over counties in wales to create the kingdom of wales one more county left before i can create the title some small county which i can easily destroy with my army declare war the guy is an ally with the roman empire roman empire agress to help get absolutely destroyed by an army of over 20k people I commit sudoku and quit 10/10 will get fuck? by the romans again
Probably one of the best real time stratagy games I have played other than the Total War games.
As the Byzantine emperor i had an affair with myselfwhich resulted in me becoming pregnant and having a fuck child having me as both the mother and father. Twice. Second time got found out by my wifegained the traits a known sodomite and a known incestual adulterer. 11/10.
-Started out as Avar count in Carpatia -Magyarok arrivesthey invade my liege -Declared independenceswore fealty to Magyars -Year by year
So complicated!
I have played Paradox games for over 2500 hours - EUHoIVicky and I love them all. But I just can't seem to wrap my head around this one. I like to build empires
Started out as a fuck?? vassel to the kingdom of northumbriaworked my family up through the ages to eventually become king of englandmy last remaining heir was born an imbecile and ugly (totally not through incest behaviour)
I have never killed so many children
I couldnt start it.When i did start it it crashed. It did that 10 times. I wanted to kill myself. It started and i played it for 10 hours. 11/10 would kill myself again

Do you want to play a game based on politicsbackstabbing and incest? Do you want to conquer Europe and everyone's bed chamber? Well look no further than this game!
I tried to unify Irelandinstead I got invaded by Aztecs. 10/10
Love this game!
suddenly gay. gets usurped.
Fun game to play with friends :)
this is what ?????????????????????? in medieval times must have felt like
At just over 20 hours into Crusader Kings III consider myself but a baby. There is just so much to the game. I figure I could put 200 hours into the game and still not have a full understanding of what I am doing. Of course that is okaybecause learning how to play in games like Crusader Kings II is most of the fun.
I used to feel positive about this game. It is a lot of funit does have a large amount of depth and is likely the best example of consistent and varied emergent play you can currently find in almost any game. There are a few problems however that have made me change my mind on Crusader Kings II. The first is the fact is that its brokenness becomes more and more apparent as you play onand while the insane bugs can be funny at first
I swear to Godone day Im going to beat the Tutorial .....

I bought this Game thinking I'd get the hang of It butI still dont get it I'd like to play with othersif you'd let me join...
Start a game playing with my friend as neighbours. 100 Years Later. End married. Buy game.
Would be pretty great if half the content wasn't locked away in overpriced dlc.
Good Game  Would Die Randomly Again
11/10 would conquer world as an immortal horse again.
Have you ever had deviled eggs? They're so goodI just keep eating all I can. This game is like deviled eggs.
i can sex my brother and have kids with my neice. 10/10 would praise ahura mazda again.
Start as a lowly independant count inbetween Norway &amp Sweden  Get picked on by Norway Swear fealty to honorable Swedish king to get revenge on Norway Random guy elects me as heir to Sweden I nominate myself so that I become the favourite Swedish king has an 'accident' I become king Same guy who nominated menominates himself He murders me  10/10 would play game of thrones again
Pay to win.
Hours upon hours lost to this game and I don't regret a second of it.  One of the few games that does DLCs correctly
One of the best strategy games ever!!! Plus you can be pagan which makes it even better.
More addicting than crack cocaine.
439 hours In and I just rage quit out of my first Ironman attempt.  Back to playing Ireland.

More addicting than crack cocaine.

I married 5 women and killed them all for the next. I died of a fever 12 years of King.  My son married 10 womenand killed 2 of his children for fun. His rule went on for 32 years until he died in battle.  His son now rules the kingdom. So far he has kill 2 wives and 1 child for The Blood God.   I'm so proud of my Grandson.
Crusader Kings II is a deep look into the medieval worldwith strategyrole-playing elements
I love this game to bitsbut after the last patch it's almost unplayable... The game crashes every other time I try to save or loadforcing me to keep having to restart again... Really hope they fix as soob as possible... :-(
Great Game Only play this game if you are not weak minded.. Its a Strategy Game not some Bs Age of empires.
I have spent 450 hours playing this yet i am yet to actually play a full game. I think that might speak to how enjoyable it is - though I may constantly resetI always come back to it.

Do not let the interface and learning curve scare youthis is one of my top 5 all time favorite games. It always keeps me coming back for more.
Paradox Games are always a little intimidating. The sheer volume of information and possibility attracts mebut scares me away as well. They tend to have very steep learning curvesbut the reward is a rich and nuanced historical experience.  Crusader Kings is much more focused
Monday 8 p.m. - 'Okaylets test it... Hmmm.' ... 12 hours later: - 'I'm hungryI should go eat something and go to bed.'  Notices that it is tuesday at 8 a.m. then goes back into the game.
My PC could not run itA pity.
Frankly speakingloved it!

This is my fav multiplayer gameNot many allow you to -Blind your friends and castrate their infant sons -Assassinating my friends pregnant wife -Sacrifice my friends families to the Pagan gods  -Seducing my friends wife and giving her my lovely Russian Babies -Demand unfair terms all the timeplay your cards right and they will have no choice! -Switching religions when my friend initiated a holy war on me -Stealing from them when I was the steward -Next time
This is a good strategy game i highly recommend it but paradox should go easy on dlcs
Epic strategy at it's bestcouldn't reccommend it anymore highlyspent hundreds of hours playing this champion of a game.
Great game very involved and they are always adding new stuff to keep the experance fresh. You can go deep in to the details of the life of your kingdom and breed useful servants and go 10yrs in 8 realtime hours or go thru the life of 4kings in the same time but it just depends how deep do you want to go quickly gather a rag tag kingdom taken by hired merks or a well fortified small kingdom built over a long period that can embaris a kingdom 2x it size in the art of warit is up to you.
I swear to Godone day Im going to beat the Tutorial .....
If you enjoy running a country on a more personal level and making decisions on how it will benefit your nation and familythen you will enjoy this game. Plusthe game of thrones mod for this game is incredible.  9.5/10
Great grand strategy game
Took over the Byzantine Empire through Succesion as a Norse Character. 10/10.
Started out as a fuck?? vassel to the kingdom of northumbriaworked my family up through the ages to eventually become king of englandmy last remaining heir was born an imbecile and ugly (totally not through incest behaviour)
I have never killed so many children
This extraordinary masterpiece is perhaps one of the best games I have ever played. The game lets you control a dynasty in medieal Europe in a game that spans centuries. Each character in the game (of which there are hundreds) have their own skillstraits and ambitions which creates unique histories everytime you play it.
Oh dear... what can I say about this game? What can outdo the hundreds of hilarious reviews already here? Nothingso I'll give my experience just today:  At 62killed my next in line son because he was insane and infected with syphillis. My entire court hates me afterwards until the pope offers me a way to repent my 'kinslaying ways'. Ruler dies
Took over the Byzantine Empire through Succesion as a Norse Character. 10/10.
Great grand strategy game
I can't even survived one playthrough...
where too beginthis might be one of those game ill never put on the shelf or hide inn a box. It might be abit confusing 2 learn at the startbut once u get to know how the game works you will see the vast options you have. Roleplay urself 2 death
If you like hard learning curbsgreat chances of failureand incest
It's ok.
It's pawsomeyou can have 69 wives in mods and you can marry your kids ) you fuck child molester MOOOHAMED
From the Makers of DLC Universalis Paradox the Greedy Harlot brings you a NEW slew of DLC's to ruin your day. Don't buy this crap.
One of the best strategy games I've played. This game however become slower as time go. Hopefully the patch that comes with 'Reaper's Due' will fix it.
One of the best titles ever created. Could not recommend less. Buy itand make sure to buy the DLC especially as its on sale now. You might think you're an independent knob you do not need no DLC just buy it. Brings alot more flavour to the game and makes you want to play it over and over again.  Buy it.
Turn based fun. I bought itI don't feel like I wasted money. You buy it and see if it is true.
I only joined the Pope's ill concieved crusade so I could throw all the nobles in my kingdom I didn't like into a horrific middle eastern meat grinder.  You can't lead a saxon revolt from inside a Syrian dungeon.
I bought this game not knowing what exactly it wasother than my friend's review which 'Its an Amazing game!' Played it. Loved it.  Already 6 hours in and still alot to do.  Becoming a King is pretty complicated but its fun.  Just like what my friend said.   10/10 - I can't wait for the other DLCs to go on sale!!!
My PC could not run itA pity.
This game is my number one favorite gameit just has so much replay valuethe plots the raiding the fighting

An amazing Strategy game based on fedualism. Everyone who loves Strategy will love this beast.

In depth and fun. Different DLC offer different styles of play.
Great game. very addicting. One of the best when it comes to Grand strategy games. played for hours. wish i had more time to play this game.
I conquered all of Northern Ireland only to be killed after a plot on my head by my wife. My only son who turned out to have brain damage then gained all my rights and proceded to make 3 children with my wife. Those children then plotted to kill my dumbass son and now all that work has gone down the drain as my 3 grandchildren fight over the land.  10/10 Would realisticly simulate the Middle Ages again.
Yet another masterpiece from the lord and master of the grand strategy genreCrusader Kings II plays at the same immersiveaddictive pace common to Paradox Interactive's flagship titles. CK2 provides a slight but appealing departure from PI's other well-known titles of this genre in that much of the focus is on individuals rather than economy

its good
Its a fun game with a steep learning curve.  Edit As of conclave the game has went into questionable territory. It's not a terrible expansion but surely adds some Why mechanics.

- Friend and I start a game (both of us have very little knowledge about playing) - Decide to start in Sweden  - Friend picks king of Sweden while I make a custom character who is the leader of Gotland - Named him Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and give him a black coat of arms with a white norse ring pattern on it - Start the game and don't know what to do - Friend says I should become his vassal so I do - Decide I wanted Livonia and declare on them - I only had 500 troops and they had 1000 so I lost the battle - Went back home and tried to ask for white peacehe didn't accept - Decide to go with seduction strats and start going after the wife of the Livonian king - Have 5 children with hercurrent wife thinks they are her's - I suddenly get imprisoned - Turns out my friend sent my character to go spy on the Italians and they weren't too happy about it - I ask them to give me a better cell and they move me to my own house - I then get small pox and measles - Somehow I lived and managed to pay my ransom of 70 gold - An Islamic docter shows up so I hired him and about 5 minutes later an event about him popped up - He tells me of the wonders of Islam and I decided to go with it - Gotland is now an Islmaic state - I lose because I didn't have that DLC  10/10 would become the leader of Gutnish ISIS again
I really want to like this game. I doI really do. But I just don't. Maybe I just don't get it? Maybe I spent too long trying over and over with the 'be a small duke in Ireland to learn the ropes' suggestion. Maybe one of the dozens of goofy DLCs would make it more palatable for me.  I think it's just that the game experience winds up being extremes in terms of things going on. I spend years sitting and waiting for things - getting a false claim so I can start a wargetting enough money accumulated to afford a war
The DLCs can all be bought on sale for just over $50. If you think that's badcheck out Rimworld's DLCs.   http://store.steampowered.com/app/367682/
Most unpleasant game with greediest publisher and overpriced dlcs Hate it and addicted
I Still have no idea what I'm doing.
Most of the reviews for this game are not reviews at all. They are nothing more than all 10 of the fanboys of this game posting their in game happenings over and over. This game has an interesting conceptbut it is not user friendly. The extremely steep learing curve was an immediate turn off to this game. If you enjoy reading and clickingreading and clicking
The DLC for this game ruins it. This is a good gamebut the amount of 'nickle and dime' dlc is ridiculous. The full game now costs almost a couple hundred dollars. That is entirely too much for a video game to cost. Even waiting for a 75% sale the game in full is still $40that's $40 for a game on sale for 75% off.   Also
I don't get the popularity of this game. For something rated 'Overwhelmingly Positive'I was not at all impressed.  The game has a horribleclunky interface for you to manage your kingdom
So much some new information... The Game is hard for new player's familiarization(for me). I think game should be more attractive for beginners.
unless you buy all the dlcyou are basically locked to central europe
It's fun with friendsbut it also feels like I've paid money for a 90's shareware demo or a free mobile app. Right out of the gate it's advertising DLC in gameand to add insult to injury
Its as in depths and as rewarding as a well done spreadsheet. I like the idea of the game but when it comes down to it. Its sword and spreadsheetswith a massive focus on the sheets. If you want to rule the world tab at a timethis is the game for you.
Tried getting into this gamebut failed due to lack of timepatience and a not really well explaining tutorial
This game is pretty good. I've probably spent about 3000 hours in the game (most outside of steam)but now I just can't defend it anymore.  To be able to acutally play the gameat the current patch
14.99 for new campaign... 5.99 for the content in that campaign... Decent game but wtf Paradox... Thought you guys were cool this is worse then CODCivilizationsand Total war combined....
This game has been hailed as a masterpiece. It offers an incredibly deep experience of medieval politicsintriguewar and the like.  I
Buy a game without even having acess to some of a basic game features for 40 euros. Or buy an acutal game to be able to use all it's aspects and actually enjoy it then. For 145euros.
Cost of game : 270 kr. Cost of DLC : 1392 kr(separate) or 1059 Kr(in a package). Be aware of how small a part of the game you buy when you buy the 'main' game.
I wish there was a meh option...  Crusader Kings 2 is honestly one of my favorite games... but its not worth itI played it for free on the weekend deal and still felt cheated. this game is 3 years old now and for some reason is 43$and the main version is extremely restricted... Why can I not play as a muslim or a hindu
Text size too small. In a game where reading is such an important part of playing the gameyou would think they would make the txt readablebut not so much. I have to lower resolution down to the lowest setting in order to play the game
Great ideas but boring implementationdense game systems to figure out without excessive reference to wikisetc.
My character (Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire) died because of an mysterious accident. His successor was an 8 year old boy. The boy (still 8 years old) became the pope. 10 ingame days later the boy committed suicide.  After that 'odd' event i decided to kill every one of my vassals with my new successor (after the 8 year old boy it was a 44 year old fart) and successfully won the game with more than 470K Troops left.   XD/10 -would mod the game again.
WARNING: Developers likely to update and ruin your saves when they release DLC content. If you fail to watch the fourms for notices and manualy revert the patch before you load a game then all your hard work is gone. You'd think 'Oh I can just turn off auto updates then' But NOthat opiton is removed toosorry they don't care about customers. DO NOT BUY.
good gameBUT THE DLCS- suremusic and portrait packs are ok
tldr version: Just as complicated as paying taxesalmost as fun!   It will also cost about the same tooat least if you don't want giant buttons saying 'Hey
For 3999you too can experience the de-syncing first hand! Buy today!
Probably a nice game in there somewherebut i couldn't bring myself to search for it.  Menu bugs Wall of text everywhereright from the start Tutorial is pushing me of.   As a school kid I would have forced myself through I guess. Bragging rights and all... But today this game repells me somehow.  Feels a bit sad to review like that
good gameBUT THE DLCS- suremusic and portrait packs are ok
why so much dlc!!!!
The font of the game is impossibly small. It was clearly designed for older monitors with much lower resolutionand the graphics and text are sized by pixelsmaking them vanishingly small on Retina-class displays.  I'd have to lean close in
I Bought the crusader kings II collection for 100$ and it keeps crashing at the first loading screen and this irrates me greatly. i would like there to be a patch for this bug.
I know that there is a fun game in here somewhereprobably behind all the insane DLC. I think the setup of this game is greatbut I feel that the player has too little control
IT IS VAREE HAD
At first this game looked playable and I love in depth strategy but this game was exhausting just to try and learn. Give your uncle this titlebla bla bla. When can I club a hooker?
Crashes and crashes Game seems amazingbut it crashes constantly. I have followed the few steps to repair it and that made it startbut did not stop it from crashing. Would love to play it
This game takes ages to learn how to play however once learned it is amazing. Combined with the sword of Islamold gods and sunset invasion DLC's I have enjoyed playing it. This game is basically a mixture between civilisation 5 and total war games in my mind however it is more focused on the personal side of ruling an empire.
if you like to play the simsthen you will love to play the sims deluxe. both very good games and this also a good game. sometimes you know it can be a little be anoying but sometimes its good aswell yes.   i would say if you like to play olden days gamesthen yes this one is for you. if you dont then probably play something like cod4? or maybe like battlefield or need fo speed.   if you like it
This game is alright. I played a couple of times - nothing major.
Great gameunfortunately more than 40! DLC. No thank you.
Would be SO damn entertainingbut it's HORRIBLE. Don't buy it!  The no-dlc Vanilla game keeps CRASHING. I tried to play with 4 friends and it's crashed 3 times in the first hour! We tried some fixes and guides on the internethoping it would help. Well it helped some - SOME -
I bought the collection for $50 and this game is a joke. Nothing like other paradox IPs and I played for ten minutes too long so steam wouldnt refund.  Tried againand just cannot fathom the interest in this game.  ohyou can marry your child and then stick them in jail after they are pregnant... /sarcastic voice  This game is good for youtube people like funhaus to make fun of.
game makes no sense im not sure what im supposed to do and the tutorials dont explain enough...
This is a more political version of Civilazation 4 and as we all know politics is where the fun lives.
It's a shame what paradox do to their games.
I love this game. I loved the first game. The gameplay can turn hours into minutes and minutes into hours.   But the DLC model is ridiculous. AI in the game use the mechanics which come with the DLC. For you to use ityou got to payalot. I understand it cost time and money to put out these expansions. I understand the people at Paradox need money to buy food and diapers and DLC's for other games on Steam. But there is a limit.  For example
Ok gamenot fun to playbut enjoyable to admire the depth of it.   Way to hard on graphics for something which should be based on tactics
If you like this gamethen so be it. I'm not really a fan because i never get any time between wars. I never know who is going to attack me and who hates me. I had a guy declare war on me a minute and a half after i started 1 game which was ridiculous. I didn't even get a chance to set up all of my councillors. I loved the original crusader kings better because it was pretty straightforward and considerably easier to understand. It wasn't by any means an easy gamebut it was fun because i didn't have to spend a bunch of time sussing out what happened after the smoke clears between the 2 armies.
I've never once finished a game of ck2. I just get too engrossed in the role playing aspect of the game. Here's hoping I'll someday be able to export a game to eu4.
It WAS very enjoyable game UNTIL the stupid dev introduced the latest DLC 'Conclave'. This Conclave completely ruined this once epic game and pratically rendered it unplayable. The latest patch updateswhich brings the idea 'infamy' from 'Conclave'made the pope
Ive played this game a lotprobably too muchand I cannot recommend this game as is.  A while ago this game was pretty fun
good game but the dlc is fucking obnoxious. costs 100+  to actually play the gamenot worth it imo.
Game constantly crashes. Can't recommend until it's fixed.
CK2 just bogs you down with a lot of considerations over long and slow-paced games.  Ultiimately it doesn't provide enough enjoyment per time investment.
Pros Great conceptsgreat ideas. Cons Poor implementation. Buggy UI. Intermittant crashes.  This game was praised to be Game of Kings the video game. Its not bad but I would not go that far by a mile.
Unfortunately I cannot recomend this game as I have only able to play six hours of this game before it ceased to workwhich I later found was because the game engine this game was created in does not work well with any laptop computersIf you play on a laptop DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
I have nothing against the game itselfmany people enjoy it. But I do have issue with paradox and the fact they ban anyone who has even the slightest criticism against them. Do not support these Devsthey are bad for Gaming and release half finished games and expect the community to finish them with mods
This game should not be this difficult. I am in learn senario mode and the easiest learn how to attack a country via fleet combat is all but impossible because my army is 3500 people but my fleet wont combine correctly to take them. Yes I hired all the merc ship companies the senario gives you and raised my vasal fleet levies. I think this game could be a great game but the simple mechanics are just too obsecure. If i have to google and youtube game mechanics during the learn senario portion this means you have design gameplay issues
5/10  I can't abide to put less than 5/10 because Crusader Kings II is still a good game as a whole. YEtwhile I love games from Paradox interactive (Hearts of Iron/ EU/ Victoria series) I found this game too complex to be fun - even if its not as hard Victoria II. The mechanics are a bit shaky and the hub/interface very unfriendly - without mentionning the aweful tutorial. One advice: go for Europa Univesalis IV insteadits the same developper
This game's learning curve is STEEEP and could really use a civilopedia. Almost as bad as DOTA but once you have overcome it (by watching people on youtube play it) you'll find that it is a rich experience of cunning and intrigue. Be sure to get the DLC though you can skip the Aztec one because its dumb.
Game itself: Greatuniqueand exciting gameplay Developers/Publishers: MONEY
I don't even own this game and didn't play it on a free weekend but still can make a reviewnso i'll give it 10 points
Chock full of annoying bugs years after its release. Paradox is terrible at quality controlwhich is frustratingbecause this is otherwise such a great game.
This game kicks so much  they have to import colons from other countries to meet the demand. While it may look intimidating to a newcomerlearning how to play is just the beginning of your dynasty and one of the best gaming experiences you could have ever asked for. Buy it. That's itthere's nothing else to say.
shuhdup and take my money!
yeh its good lol
this game sucks
The games WAY to complicated to me.... I don't understand what it wants from me........... It uses these OLD WORDS.... WHO DOES THAT??? AND WHY WOULD SOMEONE DO THAT???
Heavy is the head.
I had an affair with my wifes sister who is also my my first cousinbut its okay she had an affair with her uncle.  10/10 who knew incest could be so fun.
milking the DLCs a bit but apart from that a great game.
its alright
I have a tiny fuck?this game requires a horse fuck to enjoy to the fullest.
It's pretty good.
So I'm minding my own duchy in Norway when suddenly Harald dies and I got voted as king. What the?   And then Sweden promptly declares war on me for 'tyranny' with his 6K+ army. When I have 3K+ troops and the worthless vassals of Limited Crown Authority gave me a total of 1K+. Really Norway? Really? You little fucks are too busy squabbling for territories and titles to defend your own homeland?
there are negative reviews for ck2?
U no wen a games good cuz u fin urself stk betwen a rok and a deep blue ssee wher ur force wher too make hard decsions like 'Should I personally murder 3 50-person dynastys to the last manwomanand child
Looks pretty interesting but to be honest the game was so overwhelmingly complex that I couldn't really ever see myself learning it. Refunded.
tfw you marry your cousin and your child inherits 1/2 of Hispania
there are negative reviews for ck2?
The worst game ever. The interface is nothing short of terrible. The hints do nothingwhat a waste of time. How about it comes up with a real hintas in click this obscure icon instead of the big image for wife.  Simply terrible
i played the demo
It's pretty good.

This game is one of the most boring things I've played go buy Civ 5
Installed but cannot play. When launched only the map with no buttons to push to start the gamemultiplayer etc Please help!
This was a really good game before they screwed it upespecially the Vikings era. If you play as Viking prepare to have few moneyfew soldiers
tfw you marry your cousin and your child inherits 1/2 of Hispania
If you have never played a Paradox game then this is the place to start. If you havethen it's still worth your time and money to own it.
hundreds of years of inbreeding. 11/10
was the best game ever BTW if you want a free 25$ steam gift card no servey or any thing except for going to this link below  once 8 people enter it will give you all steam cards first 8 to win good luck  http://freecode.steamwalletgiftcards.com/?id=34643

Fantastic gamejust don't expect to win it.
Game is meh. I just hope I'm eligible for a refund.
It's Aight
its nice
I FOUND THE EXPEL THE JEWS BUTTON
Absolutely Brilliant.... Even though i have no idea of what to do.... but still i will give this game a 10/10 :D
Well executed game. This is kind of a game of culture.    There are so many things you can doinclude combat.    The best part is what you can do significantly impact your dynastyand other's family.  Relationship
Do I recommend this game?  I don't know. It's the first game I've spent almost 50 hours inand I still understand nothing about it.  Overly complex is the first quality that comes to mind. Good or bad? I have no fucking idea.
Had to pay to be a Muslim. 9/11
Like almost all PDS gamesit's one of my alltime favorites. This game is fantastic. 10/10 would lose title again.
Crusader Kings II play as glorious Malcolm III of Scotland Wife dies some 25 years into the game 'fuck this need me a new fuck buddy' has 8 legit sons tho courtier event shows upsome random qt I don't even know go into her chamber and give her a good tumble 8 months laterturns out I got the courtier preggy mfw it was my son Prince Duncan's wife

Modernassassin signing off for the last time.if you wanna contact me send me a message on steam.
toss me ck2
This game is amazingBut alot of good modders are taking down their mods sadlyBut I do reccomend this game
This is totally fuckt. I cant even choose non christian countiries because ? need a dlc which is more expensive than the game. So this is what the game industry became
very difficult menus and sub par tutorial
make ck III free to play plz :P
i dont even know what the game is exactly so im just gonna recommend it
Playing as a kingI married a clearly pregnant woman. Only a few days latermy character apparently found out about it
worst game ive ever paid for. wont be doing it again. knock off of total war...sucks
This game is seriously tight butt-hole.
its a bit hard to get to grips with you will need to watch tutorial videos and visit the wiki more than once but its fun theres alot of dlcs you can buy so more money out your pocket you dont get that much unles you get all the dlcs so alot of money so i say only ever buy it if its on sale
This game is a mess. Although I know what I am supposed to do generallyit is very difficult to get a feel for HOW to do it. The tutorial as well as the demo game are quite poorand the user interface is super unwieldy. I want to like the game but every time I give it a try I walk away feeling disconcerted and frustrated. I did go through this with Civilization IV to some extent but I got over it fast. Not so with Crusader Kings 2.   The game has great music though.
Do not buy this game. Unplayable at purchase and Steam refused to reimburse and then threatened to terminate my account. Quit using steam for a couple years as a result.
This game gives me a god complex so very different from most peter molyneu games. this games has some of the best features in all gaming but it does have an extremely large learning curve much like many Paradox games
This game would probably be pretty fun if i spent hours learning how to play itbut after watcing youtube tutorials and reading tool tips i felt tl dr and gave uptoo high a learning curve
Crusader Kings II'  PhD. History 98/100 Smarter than all our professors combined.  Nonetheless ethnocentric... it is hilarious in a darkgenocidal way. Makes 'Hamlet' look normal.
Very in depth strategy game. You can't just declare war for no reason. The AI is great at naval invasions. It's like civilization with brains.
Buy me csgo skins thank you much
Inprisoned the wrong baby  10/10
goty 1107 A.D. fuck?
The game is fun but not great.   Single player is 8/10 easily  Multiplayer is 5/10 .... because it only works 50% of the time Modding is a nice idea but again 5/10.. it only works 50% of the time Game Speed is marathon mode on civ 4.... 5/10 takes 3 hours to pass 10 years  I've spent quite a few hours in EU3 which out of all of their strategy titles is the best to date. I can play multiplayer still to this day without desync (CK2EU4). Modding it is easy if I want to create new scenarios and most importantly the game speed can be adjusted to appropriate speeds for those slow decades.   Really I can only recommend for fans of Paradox or grand (slow) strategy gamesotherwise you might not enjoy this title.  It was a good effort perhaps CK3 will fix my complaints.
one of my top 3 favorite games
If anyone wants to gift me this game they would be a top bloke
Spend hours looking at a map in glorious graphics straight out of 2003. Partake in exciting feudal politicsranging from arranging marriages for your feudal lords to changing laws with little effects. Watch as history unfolds itself on your mapincluding changes in demographics and political borders. Spend 100's of hours learning the bare basics of the game
Like Skyrim without guns
One of the best games there is!  The feeling when you realize your only son is mentaly unstablesiclyand seems to like more boys than girls. Yes
This is a cool game. You can play as King Authur and berry your sword into a stone.
great gameone of my favorites.
Wish there was a better tutorial
Buy Crusader Kings II Collection  If purchasing for yourselfyou will not receive an extra copy of: Crusader Kings II  Is this paradox being cheap or steam? A company being this cheap makes me not want to support them anymoregreat game though.
It's okayI guess.
Fantastic game! Complex... real complex. Once you get over that learning curve you'll have a blast! 9/10.
This looks exactly like EU IV. EU IV is better (if you dont mind 90 bucks of DLC).
berry nice
sucks so bad I want my money back.
I couldn't point-and-click :c
Gettin' ladiesmoneyland and servants doing everything you say
Best game everhands down. Complex but easy to learnchallenging but fun.
Definitely a challenging gamebut extremely fun once you learn how to play it. If you are a casual player and are dissapointed by losing then I wouldn't recommend this game. But if you are a very persistent player who does not get discouraged or disuaded by defeat then you will definitely master Crusder Kings II. The game itself has many paths to victoryeither through diplomacy
I opened up the menu. It was the most beautiful menu I have ever seen. The in depth menu system is so complex and intuitive that It hurts my mind. Best game I have ever played in my life. I intend to spend another 3 or 4 minutes in the menu before I complete my full review. I am very reputable. 19/10. Greatest game ever made on planet earth ever.
10/10 medieval warfare/strategy/incest simulator.
Its a good game. One where you can marry cousin to cousinkill your children because you want toGo mad and make your horse your chancellor
Can cheat on your wife. 10/10
Mehit bored me too much
Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this son of York And all the cloudsthat lour'd upon our houseIn the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
If you like being able to have kids assassinted and political espionage (and thats just the base game) then this game is for you. It's not so much based on warfare (although you can focus on that aspect more intensely if you desire to) but the relations and event that can happen within courts and with royalty.   10/10 real good royal political simulator
This is probably my favorite video game. It has a bit of a learning curvebut once you get over it you can take over the whole world.
This is the worst game I have ever loved. What the hell is going ooooonnn?!?!?! 8/10
I know a lot of people who swear by itand it genuinly looks like a fun game if you can get over the learning curve.  Unfortunatleyas with most of Paradox's grand strategy games. The UI was cluttered and frankly
A great way to waste hours
this game is so fuck that it is good
A quick story  Started as Bleddyn of Powys make buds with king of Scotland marry his daughter after my wife died early on start claiming lands and bringing wars to the sheep shaggers in Wales become king of Wales Bleddyn dies leaving my 15 year old son to take over and his twin sister: Ben Dover and Fanny Fart decide to use claim on Scotland Take over Scotlandeasy as hell become king of Scotland  come of agedecide to have some fun marry sister
This game makes me feel stupid for not understanding how to play it. Would feel stupid again.
I haven't played enough to give a full review.
this has to be the best waiting for claims simulator i have ever seen like damn  adventurers are cancer
Aside from questionable DLC policy and some stability issues this propaply as close to perfect as it gets. Succesfull conquest inevitably lead to stronger vassalsthat solves a bit the snowball efect so common in strategy games.
2nd best Paradox game next to EU4
Great game!  Too many dlc's. At this point tha game costs about 145. It´s just absurd to pay this for a game!!!
My friend told me he liked tough strategy games like Civ 5. Oh how I laughed.
the king... of new york city... alex... the LION!!!

Its good
This is a gigantic game. I love it as I do my double major in biotech girlfriend. And am terrified of how much more I have to learn to stand on her level. Same here. So much depth so much to live. BUT ! If you like fast and easy : stay away. This is for the thinker not the Rambo man.
I've never been so happy to have a sononly to kill him later.
I love the depth of this game. It has so many features so many things to do- it's like i'm in another reality.  And you can play it with so many different ways... Love it  AnywayI recommend this game if you want to forget your world and want to lead a royal family with the desire to be more influent and shape the world has you please.
I got this game when it came out after playing CK1and 4 years later still playing it. It's great its still being supported also. Kudos to Paradox and the fantastic game that is CK2.
It loaded to loading sounds and crashed
good gameBUT :  VERY expensiveand...   NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT AT ALL !!!   last week everything worked fine
It's a pretty nice RPG.
The game is interesting but it's riddled by greed from the autors trying to squeeze money from player with every little change trought DLCs and with bugs.  For instance (amongst others) there is this outstanding bug in Mac for more then one year where the top of the screen gets a black bar and pushes the content down making the game unplayable. After one yearthere's still no fix for it.
A flawed game. I enjoyed it for a while but the more I played the more I disliked many of the mechanics. I felt there was not much scope for interesting stratagies and it felt as if I was just making the obvious desition every time.
Killed my whole family. 10/10
Really really addicting gameso many different scenarios :D
I had a great relationshipa good joband many friends before playing this game.   Now I control the Russian Empire.   10/10. Would trade my entire real life goals for Russian Empire again.
Really enjoydef recommend. 4.5/5 stars.
I swear I'm not addicted..
Very heavy paywallGood game.

Thumbs up if you love this game :-)
Best game out there
Good but no Brian Boru
No longer a gameCrusader Kings II is now a content delivery system. Pushing £100 for the DLCand that's not contenting all the comestic and audio packs
The DLC span is miserable. Very complicated hard to get into. But if you wait for a sale (Esspecialy if you plan on buying any DLC) and can patiently learn to play this game via tutorials or youtubethen this game is by far one of the most in depthhilarious strategy games out there.
its good
OMG I have been playing this game from the begining all those years ago. And I can't wait to install the lastest DLC.

Just play the fookin thing.
Just buy it
I've played a lot of this game offline.  This game is more of a personal quest for power (and keeping it) than a war-game. There is so much in it to keep tabs on (who likes/dislikes you... who do you want to like/dislike... who do you need to like/dislike?)  Keeping your Dynasty alive is your main goalexpand if you can but if you die without a direct heirand thats the end of your game.  In one game I played a Saxon chief

If you look in the encyclopedia under Grand Strategy you will probably find a Paradox logo. In my opinion Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis are the best grand strategy games out there.

I executed a bunch of people backing a plot by my brother to have me assassinated so my sister (a vassal) started a faction to dethrone me so I tried to imprison her but she openly revoltedcausing a civil war. My dynasty ended whenafter about a year of fighting
i had a history test yesterdayi didn't studyinstead. i played this   got 100
bend the knee you fuck?
I bought this so i could castrate people.
After 4 Years and £140 worth of DLC Later Im still playing this damn game.  Send Help.   I had to get a job to afford the DLC/10
Probably one of the best video game I've ever played... Richintensedeep
A 'Game of Thrones'ish type of strategy game.
One of my All time favorite games. It will suck away hours of your life and keep you smiling for it. Easier to show than explain:  A whole lot of Crusader Kings II play hours crammed into was it a relatively short vid. Tried to keep the bits in the vid relevant and entertaining.....Love this game so much and did my best to make it work:   https://youtu.be/RaySzcz8wlg   For full screen and eventually playthrough please visit:    http://www.youtube.com/c/LittleMacscorner

I love strategy gamesthis game feels like a chore to play!
to experience the full game you need a ton of dlc and by a ton i really mean rajas of indiathe old godsthe sword of islam
Cuckolding the kings of Europe has never been easier   Which is why I can't recommend it until they rebalance Way of Life and fix the AI
Fantastic game overallwith $220 worth of dlc needed to play the full game on top of the $40 you already payed for the base game.
Font size are not configurable and way too small. Since it's a very text dependent game and that it burns my eyes to try and read that just makes it unplayable.
0/10 Mongol Faces Pack
I would not recommend this game to many peopleI can definitely see where the fun comesbut dumping hundreds of hours into a game
I found this game overly complex and hard to navigate from the start. There is no in game tool bar guide to help you learn the basic movements let alone even attempt the more complex ones. That is unfortunate because the content is excellent as is the story lines you can evolve. Also a BIG drawback for me is all the DLC's and added material you MUST BUY to play effectively with others or solo. I do not want to be forced to go to YouTube to view other peoples' play and hints. I will not buy this game....
Game of thrones without a proper 'game'.  You must buy a dlc to play your mouseand another dlc to press 'a' button on your keyboard. And don't forget about breathe you can't breath unless buy this 20 dollar dlc.
not much to docompletely over pricedno game content
WAY TOO MANY DLC'S. Let me start off by saying don't let my 0.6 hours fool you. I have many more than that invested into this particular game. It's when i turn around to support themI get a smack in the face by the palm of DLC's. With that saidI understand a few DLC's here and there to support the continuity of the development of this awesome sandbox. I realize that its the only way for the awesome developers over at Paradox to keep implementing fresh ideas to this game and its engine. The idea of DLC's take this games potential of growth to another level. I see
you need all the dlc's to play the game more than 1 day
I want a refund
very costly for DLCs that should be free (great deal if sale is on)
Jesus christ this game {no offense to christians}. I can see why some people like this game but it is not for me. The tutorials are crapI play quite a few grand strategies so I did not have too much of a problem but damn those tutorials. The UI is also not very good so that does not help the game. The RPG aspects are minimal and over the course of my game I did not feel attached to my character. The battles are inferior in every way to Europa universalis 4so if you like alot of battles then forget this. Management and tech in this game is a joke compared to EU4. This is a decent game but EU4 does nearly everything better except that Crusader Kings 2 is the more personal game and some people argue that that is better
Found this to be hard to get the hang of.
This game is a great idea that is very poorly executed. Would love if someone else took a stab at itbut there is literally no comopetition at all. If you want this kind of gameyou have one single choice and this is it. I would still not recommend it.
The game has been seriously broken for almost a monthbroken as in the AI cannot declare war! the company show little haste in addressing this issue. I would avoid this game until the developers stop messing about with it and leave it in a fixed state!
This game is hard to pick upI imagine if you have played very similar titles from the same company you might enjoy it but I found the poor tutorial and steep learning curve made this game unenjoyable - I felt like I was back at uni learning 3 year calculus  FYII love strategy games
I wanted to enjoy this game but I just couldn't keep up with all of the superfluous dlc the company are continuously releasing.  I refuse to support any company who operates in this fashion.
My opinionNot a very fun gamealot of lag impossible to start the game Don't get! you could spend a bunch of money on other games
Maybe if I were still a teenager and didn't have a life to throw away on the insane amount of stuff to read and click on to do anything in this gamethen it would be fun. This isn't just a micro-management game this is nano-management. It's insanityand it would probably be nice if I didn't have to sleep. I regret buying the game
This game sucked. Very bad instructions on how to play.
I really like and enjoyed this game but along with a lot of frustration cause bugs and some mechanics. No place to write it all down here if someone want to find it there is a lot about it on forum. Overall game is fun and worthy to get. But where come to terms of time you will spend in this game and money to make it proper (by buying DLC) it's not worthy anymore. Prices of DLC are RIDICULOUS and amout of them also. Some of DLC bring bugs which aren't fixed even after few months after release. You don't have to buy it all of course but u will stick to christian nations only with limited options it's playable sure but in long term boring for me. So now - NO leater complete pack yea.
Crusader Kings is too expensive and confusing.
Unclear tutorialmessy UIit has very good mechanics and gameplay
Difficult to figure out how to play. Lacks any good tutorial or help
Patched out murdering your children 0/10
A game whose difficutly comes from its interface designrather than the strategy at its core.
I tried to figure out the game. I obviously failed. I'm sure the game is greatit wouldn't get so much praise from fans after all. But if you are new to Crusader Kingsstay away. Unless you want to devote hours and hours to the game just to try and figure out how to play it. Only buy it if you have an iron will and steel determination to figure this game out. The patience and learn curve is insane. The tutorials are mundane overwhelming and complicated. New players
Was to confusing to meI spent the whole time trying to firgure out how to play.   Would not recommend considering the abundent of other strategy choices out.
Watch outwe're dealing with a new EA wannabe over here.  What next? 'Save and Exit To Main Menu' DLC??
Hard and Boring -Plays as Holy Roman Empire -2 PEACEFUl years pass by -5 tiny provinces delcare independence -Gets rekted even though we outnumbered them 2 to 1 -The war for independence apparently stops for no reason saying that I won the civil war as clearly in the war I had -28 war score -Ragequits when 1/2 of the HRE rebel
After forcing myself to uninstall this game countless times only to give in and hastily reinstall it I have learned three things.  1. Crusader Kings is literally a drug. I love the feeling it gives mebut I hate everything that it has done to my life.  2. If I invested a tenth of the time I spent playing this game trying to build a life for myselfI would be a millionaire with 2 kids.  3. I fucking hate the Mongols.  Do not buy this game.

I really enjoyed playing this game. It is truly a unique experience that no one else has done before. I have well over 200 hours playing this game howeveri would not reccomend it. The base game has about 20 % (even that's being generous) of the total content of the game. You need to pay for DLC simply to play as certain factions which in my opinion is fuckt considering the base game is already $40. If you notice the price of the game along with all the DLC it amounts to roughtly $160. Charging your customers simply to play as another factionor getting the ability to customize your character is nothing more than the work of a bunch of greedy fucks who are milking you dry for content that should have been in the base game and not sold as a DLC. It's understandable to charge for add ons that extend the campaign years but this is absolutely ridiculous. You can't even own retinues without the DLC
Crappy DLC policy. Thieves.
The hundreds of hours it appears I've spent playing this game are the hundreds of hours I've spent on the launcher trying to get it to work. Do not purchase.
Crappy game without dlc
Since the Charlemagne DLC was releasedCKII will no longer launch. I have not dowloaded the DLCand so I have no idea what if going on. Not recommending until the issue is fixed.
This game doesn't know the meaning of strategyParadox should've sticked to Magicka.
i managed to fix the game myself no thanks to steam or paradox. if you like troubleshooting game errors and program issues by yourself then get this game. if you like games that work as they are when you purchase themthen you probably want to spend your money on a different game
i love my dead gay leper dwarf son.
I found this game pretty fuck -
Not Much to do.
Ive just bought the standart-gameand downloaded it. But when i got into the loading screenit wasnt showing fullscreen
really good game. but too much dlc's and random factors. good luck is more important than a good strategy
EhEU4 is a phenomenal game (... at least until the latest patch) Perhaps Crusader Kings 3 won't be a time sink. There's as much strategy in here as baccarat. Perhaps if they changed the map--showing alliances at a glance and notified you of actually important events. The fact you can't marry (form alliances) because of nebulous 'political concerns' is annoying to say the least.  It seems Paradox has a habit of allowing for certain strategies and then patching out their effectiveness. At first glanceyou think 'well
Good gamebut need buy more DLS...
My personal favourite stategy game
I had high hopes for the game! Made by a developer I likeand a theme I usually enjoy!  Those hopes were crushed under the weight of... waitingreally.  I recalled Crusader Kings as a bit slow paced
Incredibly boring game of Menu simulator 2012. If you enjoy a game based entirely on nothing but menus and random events that you have little control of this may be for you.
This game is absolutely impossible. I've read guides on the easiest way to start and still get stomped on. You literally wait and wait and wait and your armies get no bigger and you get stomped on by whomever you make a claim on.  Also buggycrashes on load screen. If you exit to main menu and go into a new game you can't click on land or units. Crashes often while playing. Not worth $40+.
the add on packages are way over the topthere are so manyand they aren't cheap.   Luckily
Takes forever to learn. Billion menues and systems in place. After you've figured everything out the game turns out to be incredibly shallow and you can barely do anything except go around and kill stuff and wait for fuck to happen.
Cost WAY too much money.
This is a great game. If it doesn't crash on you. Which it does every time you play it. You advance through the game until you come to a crash. Every time. And the worst part? The logs are a joke! Nothing is there to give you a hint why it's crashing. This is totally  unacceptable ! With 2GB GeForce GT740 and 5GB  FREE  RAM it's simply unacceptable!!! I wish I never payed for this $#%*!@.
The best simply because it has no competition if it did have competion then it be a differnet story.  This devolper has no one to compete on the gaming market with this type of game therfor what kind of review can i give it?  Therfor im not giving it a review as it has nothing to compete with therfor no reason for review lol.  Its quite basic game that lacks charector traits to management of your kingdom is very simple and blend...the dlc whoring is wrong as everything you have now in the game which equal to like amount 40 euro without any sales i mean normal price plus game about 80 euro + is insane.  Again they got no compettion so they do as they like.  Without mods even with all dlc's is pure fuck as there are so very little charector traits to events to building and custimization and having your own kingdom is very little very blend but with mods this all changes.  The CKII ++ mod the modder if im not wrong has now join or was part of Paradox not sure but that sure helps it out alot.  But again it still lacks charector traits to events that lead to a boring repeative blend gameplay where in the end your feeling like your just playing to have best charector with best breeding and expend to expend and managing your kingdom as it turns into a empier and your family to have best stats and expend by troops which combat is simple (very little events or terrien wise to weather is imporant but the combat in the end is just random dice with very little player interraction.)   So yeah hmm the mods like game of thrones make it amazing tons of events tons of things to do which brings me to the thing what have the devs not done more and why are all the dlcs (which by the way i feel were pre planed years before they came out for marketing aka money cow fuck?s) why were the dlcs that are now out not in the original game that came out?  When the game came out it was worse then Crusader king 1 as it had nothing but bugs and nothing new but graphics...with coming dlc's that are the cost of a brand new game LOL came year by year which should of have been free or part of the game when it came out as they are basic game mechnics that should of have been when crusader kings 2 came out and not some graphical new game engine port of crusader kings 1 wih pre planed dlcs to make the game into what it s now lol.  The only dlc's that did changed anything of crusader kings 1 is the vikings and mulsims no as you had a mod that made them playable in crusader kings 1...and they should of have been playable from the start same with religion to othrodox upgrade to retunies this was in crusader kings 1 and crusader kings 2 should of have had this from start or for free when they finnished it for a price tag of 50 euro you are gettting half game lol. now 40 euro normal price.  The india to hordes dlc is fuckt as this game is crusader kings 2 which is sequal to crusader kings a game that is about playing a crusader king in the crusade era meaning crusader kings 2 should of have stood to what its about and expended the game mechnics to its game core and concept not gay  india and mongols horse fuck that should be a seperate game.  Now if they created a offical teamspeak to community for multiplayer for crusader kings 2 along with tourments and prices and a profile actual profile for this game then the dlcs india to horses and moslims would of have been all out good and fine as it brings actual real human enemies not dumb ai yes for me the ai is dumb in most cases it does not know what its doing and cant even mantian even now after three years cant mantian a empire or a small kingdom or move its troops without getting them attriuitioned killed by bigger army oh and gold yes the ai to this day if it has 400 gold lets say and you declare war well there not going to buy merceneires to defend there kingdom that they can easly win as that 400 gold can grant them a 40% advantage to the enemy attacking them and putting the army together instead it does not buy fuck or it does but they just attack or dont go together and getting fucked in the asss over and over where you feel like your playing expend farmvile with some family farmvile of charectors that you breed with best breed and no events no story no historical imersion nothing of that sort will you meet in this game or actual diplomacy to planing nothing.  How i said they have no competion in this type of game in gaming indurstry meaning they dont give two fuck? and do as they well.  With Steller coming out soon a space therme crusader kings with europa universalis in space that we the community have been askign for so long time might be good but it be good you know why?Because there is no other game like that type in in the gaming indurstry meaning no compettion therfor it be the only type of game of this type in space and everyone will be cumming over it while the black sheep will say eh nothing special and just wait few years for full game haha dlc cow fuck?s will stay dlc cow fuck?s only if you outlaw it or if they have competion in the market which would force them to create full games at release or with upgrades being free and actual focus on the game not a product that is like a book with very little love put into the book that makes it like reading some blend boring story but it be okay because the book is the only of type of book of the books therfor its okay. I say no its not and i dont even play it no more because its plain out boring and the multiplayer is nonexensting there is no motivation to it no statisitcs no community beyound and nether is the devololper.   THe current dlcs you can all have active if one has them the HOST which is god but there is almost no one playing and if there is then again you play then save then play and not enough and no statitics no profile no lobby no community so what they invested the gaming company into making moslims to india and horses to pagans making them useless as the ai is shti the ai is fuck and ai is fuck and the game is blend boring playing single player because of it and the events to story to historiy mersion to player choices to events are lacking therfor its a boring farmvile expend breeding farmbile boring  lame  game.  If they done what they done and put the focus also on multplayer creating a community a with player profiles like the game raceroom racing expereice has and put what that games has put into there game then all would of have been fine.  But with zero focus on multiplayer and the zero focus on in the single player what i have repeatly mention it creates a dull boring farmvile repeative boring game that you play once maybe two times as you cant believe how dull boring repeative no player choice nothing how i repeatly mention above is.  SO you go to mods well you find out that the mods are amazing like game of thrones to Elder scholls that create amazing games and you play them and the amazing mods and maybe even add some amazing mod to the orignizal game but there you find the same old fuck that the ai cant use it does not know how to use it and again it will become boring so you go to making up your own house rules so you can play on the same ground as ai or start role playing it but figure out there is no actual game role play in but farmvile expend to fuck and the ai is not competive enough and multiplayer is nonexietent how i repeatly said above so you revert into like i have.  Craeting your own commmunity to provide players with the means to play together if for pve to pvp to being together and providnig them the tools teamspeak to forums and calaender the managment to know each other to play together to make contests well they dont use it because A its not main steam and the company the devoleprs dont give two fuck?.  SO even if 300+ members to another group having over 1500 i think like two thousand members well it does not do fuck as the game devolper has to do it themselfs and then shineon.
I really want to like this game i honestly do there is so much cool about it howeverThe lack of interaction and tutorials dosen't let me enjoy this game
I've recentyl bought this game... But i cannot play for 15 minutes proper game due to random crashesruntime errors etc... And i cannot find any usefull advice for fix. I try 4 times reinstall the game and vcredit++ etc.... I strongly suggest do not play this game until they fix the crash issues...
First things firstthis isn't my type of game. For the reasons i'll list belowI don't recommend the game. However
i love this game a loti have a pirate version for more than 2 years before buying in the salebut i must say some reasons that i pirate it and why i bought it too: 1- i live in brazil
i advise people to get medieval 2 total war. crusader kings 2 just sends you into the game no tutorial or not an easy to find one so you don't now to play nor what the objective is
If they ever put the base game itself and all of it's dlc into one gameand charge a far more reasonable 20 USDthen it would be worth it. As is
IF YOU PLAY FEMALE OR HAVE A FEMALE RULER IN THIS GAME YOU WILL NOT BE TREATED EQUAL TO ALL YOUR MALE INFERIOR fuck??S THAT ARE BETTER TO YOU JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LARGE VEINY fuck THIS IS fuckT. THE DEVS SHOULD GET OVER THE MISOGENY AND PUT FEMALES WHERE THEY BELONG ON TOP OF THE COMMON MALE HEARD
keeps crashing on loading sound regardless of what I do
This game has a learning curve too steepthat the tutorial barely explains anything. This game is justbad
Wait stop do not buy this. There are so many things wrong with the game. They try to trick you into buying all this stuff but it dosent work. The unit packs are badly made and they value it. To just advance you have to by the dlc. They dont allow you to play any of the non christian characters untill you buy the dlc. 2 out of 10
I truly cannot recommend this game any less than I am about itthough I would like to try.  It is highly inaccessible and deeply unintuitive. Most of the positive reviewswhich I admit are in the majority
This game is poop. I want to kill stuffnot read long texts and do boring stuff like marriage
Just get Civ 5it's what you really wantanyway. I managed to get a huge pack on sale so I got all of the DLC for like the price of a normal game
Not as good as the first one.
Fun for a bitbut terrible military strategy piece makes it no fun for me at this point.
How much money have you spent to watch/read Game of Thrones? Think for a few seconds - Then buy this game. Did I forget to mention that there is a Game of Thrones Mod? My bad.
hi guysI love this gamebut the newest patch killed it:( When you conqueror a land you gain aggressiv Points and all other lands build a coaltion against you. This isn't so bad
I spend more time arguing with my vasssals and putting down rebellions than I do doing aything else this new conclave addition has completely changed the game I would like to see it made optional but until then it is far too tedious and seems more like a chore than a game at the moment.

Why i stopped playing Crusader kings.  A myriad of reasonsthe first and foremost being: waiting for 60 years to fabricate a claim. And i only get in in wartime with my coffers empty.   Not just in one game or playthroughin one after the other. After all the DLC
This game is aweful. How are there so many good reviews? It blows my mind. I enjoy strategy games but I tried to play this one for an hour and after the hour I just had a headache and have accomplished absolutely nothing. There is no guidanceno objectivesnothing. You are stuck just clicking buttons and reading pages of 'hints' that don't even help you out. I honestly have no clue as to what to do or where to go in this game. I was so excited because I really do like historical games like this but with no guidance and an extremely complex interface this game gets two thumbs down.
It's not finished yet.  This game is entertainingbut still too bug-ridden to recommend right now.   If Paradox can fix all the CTDs then maybe I will flip. Here's an idea Paradox: how about putting some error-checking into your code instead of just unceremoniously crashing?! You might want to think about it....maybe?!   You have mod support but no error checking. Absolutely brilliant.
Money stealing devs witholding content in DLCs and witholding content within the DLC in DLC Content Packs. Disgustingespecially the portrait packs.
I love this game Best game of all time
Very menu-rificwhich is forgivablebut feels rather unintuitive and quite cluttered. A lot of things to keep track simulatiously. Feels like Medieval War 2
Reading is hard
As a fan of alot of Paradox Interactives games i figured I'd enjoy this one too. Unfortunately I found it kind of dull and limiting. It might be unfair though as EU IV was my first love.
I don't know why this game is rated so well. I bought it on sale for 75% offand it was still a waste of $9.99. The tutorials are simply awfulteaching you nothing valuable about the game itself. And the learning curve? You may as well go for your PhD in this game
Does not appear to work correctly on my computer. (Alienware Alpha)
The game UI is really poor and hard to understand. The tutorial does not help as it is quite bad. I gave up after 30 minutes. Would not recommend this game.
It was laggyand I have a good computer.  Like I have intel hd graphics-first generation by the way  4 gigs of ram.  core i3  I have the best computer in the world and I cant run this game
I find the game slow and boreing plus the tutorial is crap cause there isnt one nothing to help learn how to play!
Tried the tutorial... after clicking around and not getting any guidanceI uninstalled. Guess 8 minutes is my threshold for no information.
I started the gameI stared at the mapI clicked a few things nothing happened
I downloaded the game for free and tried to play it after playing it for a day or so and then it said i needed purchase it. And when i tried to purchase it it said i already had it in my steam librarybut it still doesn't allow me to access it.
i think i should go for stronghold crusader 2 than play this strategy gameits to hard for me
After pouring about 2 hours into CK2I still have very little clue of what it is about. Whole UI is a mess..
To all gamers of all games (not just CKII): Stop whining about DLC's! It is really tedious and giving thumbs down just because of DLC's is so childish (well I know.. lot of you are kids). You don't need to buy every DLC. And if you don't earn enough to buy a game or DLC it is not the fault of the game.  Now to the game. I can't say much. Bought it (with all DLC's )) but played just 12 hours. I'd love to get in to it but it is quite difficult. I guess it is a great game but it demands too much effort (and time).
awesome game love it
Still cant play CK2 on windows 10:(
Would rather play Europa Universalis.
One of my all time favorite games.
Just get EU4it's what this game would be like if paradox took the time to turn this into a half-decent Grand Strategy game.
The most CONFUSING thing i have ever played. I bet its an ok game but i was just amazed by the amount of stuff i had to do and watch for in order to not loseso much stuff that it was not fun for me at all but frustrating. so unless you are willing to spend alot of time trying to learn the things this game has to offer then fine but just saying theres alot of stuff this game has for you to learn.
This game is unplayable on a UHD monitor. The user interface is sub microscopic with no way to change it. Unless you have an old sub-HD monitor lying aroundgive this one a skip.
Haven't played the completed game yet as waiting for the dlcs to be a reasonable price.
Don't waste your money. Years after release this game is still ridiculously buggy and essentially unplayable on the big screen. Fonts cannot be read at 1080p without hurting your eyesand they cannot be changed or enlarged. I installed 3 UI modsof which one addressed the message windows
fun game but all this DLC you have to pay for ... 75% of it should be included with the game... Im shocked they didnt have DLC for volume and graphics options aswell...
brillant wene it worked it worked on windows 8 then crashed and whouls'nt come back I get a blanck screnn on xp and vista I don't have windows 7 so it was the biggest wast of money ever!
Bought the collection assuming i would get everything for that ridiculous price. boy they sure do fool you by putting all of those terrible useless dlcs in it to make it look like it inludes everything. base game isnt even worth playing and their collection doesnt include most of the big dlc. cannot reccomend at the current price point. the 2% of this game you can play for 40$ is almost playable. i think all of the dlcs would be amazingly fun but getting ripped off by their 'collection' isnt very fun
Why the UPPDATTEEESSSS!!!
It's very very hard to get the idea of the came and it's concepts down pat. I haven't played much of itbut I can tell you it throws more and more at you every moment you get on top of things. Has everything from sort of raising a child to ruling a continent. Not sure about mods and DLC but it's still a very hard game. Honestlywould not recomend unless you love a challenge and love stratagey. I would recomend you have a good idea of history and it's ways as well. It helps a fair bit.
Best game ever every update/dlc makes it better everyone should buy this plus eoin dunlops sister is a cracker xxxx
One second in I already gave upI still dont know which one is my kingdomi r8 g8 if you want to fuck up your head m8
First of all I will say this. I think this is a great game. I like the mechanicsthe settingthe atmopshere (great music imo)
I cant really explain it but this game is infuriating in all the worst ways. I dont know how people can stand it. Alsoa good half of the characters/realms in the game are dlc. Consistently had a bug which caused me not to be able to claim certain strong claims.
It's an interactive atlas like most Paradox games of this genrebut this game has the added benefit of playing the Sims. 11/10. Best game I've seen since I watched Nekopara.
Croatian citys misplaced -rate from me (i mean wtf Dubrovnik in serbia)
good game but disapointed that it has so much dlc. Its annoying to find out i am missing certain features i see in game. Other than that pretty fun game.
the hell is this dumb crap
disclaimer. didnt bought the gametried on the free week.   this game has so many things going on...its so complicatedso detailed
This game is so good I might even write a serious review for once. (Not like people read those anyway and instead prefer 10/10 it's okay IGN's paid reviews.) Pros: It's fun and maybe even immersive. Seriouslythat's it. Cons: It's simple. Casualeven. You don't need to put any effort into it - even as a lowly count you can easily make your way to emperor in 50 or so years. When you fuck up
Overly complicated and not very fun.
.
How do you play this game
after nearly and hour of incest and spreading syphilis i decided to execute everyone in my close family  i then attempted to conquer europe with a broken family tree full of fuck childern and inbred monsters  then i started playing crusader kings 2the game seems alright   7/10
Most people write game reviews with ridiculous stories and 99.99% of the time it doesn't happen to you. Well in Crusader Kings 2 these things from the pope turning your son homosexual to fucking every women in your court will happen to you at least once...
Interestingbut hard.
This used to perform quite well on my macbook back when I bought it in 2012. I tried to come back to this recentlystill using the same machine (with 4x the ram actually)it's hardly playable now
So much random stuff can happen in thisit's great!
To Go Forward In Tine= Free  Go Back In Time= £9.99 Like If You Want Free DLC
I am terrible at this terrible game. Its terrible. Buy it.
Yeah she goes hard
Two years ago my father diedand with him went the loyalty of the vassals and most of their men. For two long years I've rallied what little men I could into holding of the constant viking attempts to burn everything I love to the groundwhile simultaneously dodging the plots of my relatives and close allies. Two long years of recovering from the debts of my father's failed war with the threat of massive viking invasion looming overhead. After two years the realm finally begins to see some stability and promise of a future without vikings. Today I turned 8.   10/10 would have a man made out of me again.
Played as Hungary -get married -game glitches out (due to a misinstalled mod). I get all stats (diplomacymartialintrigue
Bought this game awhile ago and enjoyed it immensely. Thought about playing it again 'cause I haven't for a long time. 50 new DLC packs I am too intimidated to play. Thank you Paradox.
Always crashes in the loading scene !!! i couldt even play !!!
I bought the Collection Edition on a 75% off sale beacuse from what I've heard from reviews and my friendsyou'll need a good bulk of the DLC to fully enjoy Crusader Kings II. Best $12 I've ever spent on a video game. The game is very addictingmanging your kingdom
Once you get past the steep learning curve (and read up the wiki) you'll find one of the most complexyet rewardingmicromanagement game of all time. DLCs may be expensive but they go on sale fairly often.
Only for autistic people.

Completely bugged game. Allies do not attack. They freeze in their spots and enemy army wipes them outadding to their score.  These developers must be the only potheaded swedes in their region couldn't find another reason for their carelessness in game design
So much random stuff can happen in thisit's great!
To Go Forward In Tine= Free  Go Back In Time= £9.99 Like If You Want Free DLC
Crusader Kings II is a game that I recommend because: - is a method to banish boredom - is a strategy game - have trading cards  Enjoy!
cant play cause crashes every 5 years or so on auto saves and if not that it crashes when i save the game
this is a fun game but the new dlc horse lord mess up my campan that i play on for a year now. I am a merchant republic my heir has 1100 respect and the my vassal has 600 resprct and if i die the vassal with 6
Constant glitches and crashesparticularly when trying to save. Have never finished a game all the way through to the end due to hard crashed on certain years.
This game was extreamly fun for the 6 hours i played it. But other then that the game is one huge buggy mess. I think the main thing that has caused me to not play is the fact i can not play it. It refuses to launch and i have tried all known fixs. None have worked.
-1
It's possibly one of the most annoying and difficult to learn games I've ever played. If you want to play a game about conquering Europe then go get Medieval Total Wae 2
I murdered my 2nd son so my kingdom wouldn't split in half when I die.  11/10 Would murder children again.
Tutorial is broken and can't be completed.
way overly complicated with a subpar tutorial. there doesn't seem to be a way to easily learn the game before being overwhelmed.
The reason why I got this game in the first place was because of seeing the screenshots and hearing the stories of the adventures you could end up having in the game. The game ughthe game has its moments but as much as it pains me to say thisthe game is just innately flawed and broken that it takes away any fun from the positive aspects of the game.   So what are these positive aspects then. Well the aforementioned adventures and stories you can have. I distinctly remember in one of my multiplayer sessions the legendary scandals and rambunctious activities of King Arkantos and Duke of Lancaster. Playing spy against neighboring kingdoms and engineering the fall of empires. It was a jolly good time
Be very careful with Paradox.   I bought this gameand now Paradox has changed the EULA.  They now require me to either   a) delete the game that I had paid and never play it again b) ALLOW THEM TO SPY ON ME FOR MARKETING PURPOSES WHILE I PLAY THE GAME THAT I HAD PAID  They had gone full-Microsoft obviously.
Tutorial is broken. Will not go past where you unload troops on the northern island. Has done this seven times in a row. I am done.
This game is THE best example what happens when you have an awesome game and then the developers attempt to milk it with DLC to the point of ruining what made it wonderful. With the introduction of certain DLC (biggest offender being Conclave) a great deal of what made the game fun was tossed out the window. Extremely sad :(
At some point it's down to clicking through the people finder to identify vulnerable heirsand that's not fun.
I'm not sure what anyone sees in this game. It's complete tedium. 1. You cannot have a standing army and declare war. 2. Your battles last for yearsbut you have no control of strategy.  3. Most of your time is spent trying to make your court like you by bribing them.  4. To advance in personal skillsrandom events appear and you are allowed to click yes or no. 5. Tech advances make no apparent changes in the game but take years and years to achieve.  I've wasted money and time playing a ridiculous game. Don't do the same.
Not really that good without all the DLCall said and done.
Game has a lot of depth if you have the time or patience to learn it. You'd like this if you've even an inkling of interest in history. PersonallyI couldn't get into it
More like DLC kings because Paradox just wants you to fork over money for their subpar DLC that should already be in the game.
I am unable to read any of the menus or text in the game because they are too small. There is no option to increase the size of the font. Forum posts suggested a mod but the mod causes a crash to desktop at start. The game is unplayable to me as it is.
just crack it if you really want to play it that muchits not like paradox bothered to ever make the multiplayer actually functional or anything
Honestly I have no idea what is going on in this game or how to play it. I have spent quite a bit of time trying to understand what I am supposed to do. But I'm still really confused. The tips don't really help at all... Sorry I just cant recommend it on the simple factyou cant just pick it up and play. If I knew what the heck I was doingI would change my review.
I have no clue hw to play this game. It super confusing
long windedconfusing and too much going on. The writingbuttons and GUI are too small and I tried to get into it but I just couldn't and having to right click to confirm actions is just stupid. This has the potential to be a great game but it tries too hard. So glad I played it for free and didn't buy it.
Crusader Kings is the single most infuriating game I have ever played. My friends and I only wanted to have fun but our eyesthey bled.
This has to be the worst game ever....
fucking shitty game is sooo not worth it
I really wanted this game for a few years now but after playing it during a 'free 2 play weekend' I changed my mind. It's not as great as I thought it was nor does it even come close to the Total War Series. After seeing there's no naval battles or ways of preventing the enemies from dropping off armies on my land via ships it's not worthwhile. Also so many things are limited which can only be accessed via the DLC which I refuse to waste money on. Just because a game releases DLC that took no effort in making doesn't mean it should raise the individual game's price.
This game is so boring
The game is really good overall but the facts that this game has no Unicode support and the only up-to-date localization is English make me think that 40 for this game is a bit too much especially when updates and new DLC are constantly relased for this game.
A quick look at the paradox forums will tell you that this game is in perpetual beta hell because Paradox keeps release DLC's without properly testing themeven old bugs from two updates ago are still there. Now the game has gamebreaking bug like AI not disbanding troops during peacetime.  Don't bother with this game if you are not prepared for bugfest.
Played it for a couple of minutestoo much history
This game is so boring
Excelent game if it doesnt crash when you savedespite never having problems in game. No exuse for the cash grab DCLs for the most minute of changes. Please fix the save game problems paradoxif im lucky i can save rarely (if started the game) but whenever i do CRASH.
Crusader Kings II is everything I should like in a game. I've been playing civ and shogun in the 90stabletop CoSims and the board game Civ in the 80sand more recently loved discovering Paradox' Europa Universalis IV (which is flawed but still an incredible game).   CK II
Good:   + Historical Context + Roleplay Possibility... ...but broken by lack of graphic design (sold as DLC) which breaksdown immersion   Bad:  - Tutorial Essentially Broken (still in 2016) - Unintuitive User Interface (UI) - Lack of creativity in graphic design (Graphics sold as DLC) - The game core is around character interaction but character portraits are DLCs - DLC for music in game? - DLC for Unit Packs?   DLCs should add something extra to the game here the DLCs looks like are got cut out from the main game to be sold as DLC
dont buy it it will crash
Unplayable due to ludicrously small interface size which apparently has no options to increase or remotely alter. I tried mods and settings on windows itself but these either did nothing or made it crash. Then I realised I had spent half an hour just trying to get the game into a playable state and it simply was not worth the effort. How any competent company can release such a badly designed game is beyond me. My eyes are still hurting.
I'd rather fill out crossword puzzles than play this game.
Wellthe vision of this game may be not bad and of course it looks good from 3D View.   But like all games which have in common with medevil times it has very many mistakes not just out of tactic perspective but aswell out of the historian view.  For Example Lithuania was the greates Nation from 1300 till 1400then something called Russia doesnt even existet since 1789
I do not like the game because i do not know what to do. I do not recomend this game to people who doesn't understand complicated english.
I feel like this is an amazing game but as I dont have 2 months to devote to studying guides on game mechanics and interface concepts I am unable to enjoy it. I may be an idiot because I really wanted to like this game but it played more like a video that paused to tell me how badly I was doing every ten minutes and then proceeded to continue giving me messages I didnt understand and flashing colors that meant nothing to me. This game is like the cockpit of a 747 passenger planeIf you wanna learn all the buttons and fly it you can have a good time but if you sit down expecting to understand everything immediatly you're gonna have a bad time.
Wow! Steep learning curve and some very strange game mechanics ! Its like the fun has been subtracted from this title no wonder its 75% off! Avoid!
I find it impossible to recommend this game mostly because of how I am treated on the forums every time a buggy release comes out and people ask 'where is the quality control' then the army of moderator backed fan boys comes and insults you and if you dare argue back the nazis moderator bans you for 'trolling'. Not the guy who told you to go 'f' yourself no he's off to insult the next person with dissenting opinions with no consequences. High inital investment in paradox games makes you chase the dlc hoping for just another dlc for them to finally fix the gigantic problems they design into the game from the beginning. DO NOT BUY.
I played this game for a few hours one day and I never figured out how to play it. The tutorial was all over the place and of little help.
This game is absolutely horrible takes forever to do anythingand you need a reason to invade anything and when you start they set a lot of other territories equal to those around it. So if you attack then your most likely are gonna fail. It's boring and overly complex when all you want to do is invade those around you.
Welllook at my playing time and compare it to the positive reviews. I played 6 hours and still have no idea how many possibilies there are in this game. I guess you need 20 or 30 hours to begin to enjoy this game and i am sure then it's one of the best games there are! BUT - i don´t have this amout of time to pump in one game. So i have to say: Don´t buy itif you don´t want to commit to it.
You can tell this was made by some nerdsbecause the UI is atrocious and they put Wikipedia links in everybody's profile.
way too confusing a game and the tutorial is not very helpful no wonder it does not sell
Multiplayer is completely broken and unplayable do not get this if you're looking to play with friends.
To much DLC
waaaaayyyy too complicated. It would take me all day for a week to learn how to play this game. It's got the complexity of Total War x10.
Tried playing this game during the free week trial. Kept getting run time errors whenever I launched the game. The only available technical helpand place to ask for such help is locked away in a PRIVATE forum in which you have to have purchased the game to have access too. Outrageous.
This game is just god awful to try and play. The tutorial is simply too cluttered and ultimately useless in trying to explain how to navigate the various menusthe concept is unoriginal (blatant clone of total war)and overall the game mechanics are either so cluttered that you cannot reasonably understand what you're actually doing or either so unresponsive that the time spent trying to move troops would've been better spent watching paint dry. This is a terrible game. Glad I played it on the free weekend cause this is not worth the money at all.
Way to complicated. No really good help or in game tutarial. I spent two hours trying to work it out and still no wiser how to play it.
the poor mans europa universalis IV
Not playable - cannot see the menu on my 2560x1440 monitor. Impossible to change resolution - no menu. :-(
What type of crap is this. Can't even figure out how you play
yeah nooo.... dont know how to play it. lost i think/when my first leader died of ageI gave up.....
the base game feels very limited not a ton of content for the price. i really dislike that a lot of the more intresting factions to play as are dlc only. dlc every where i cannot support a company that choses to use buisness pratices like this. should of been called dlc kings
The game is one hig bug I cant even play normal game. Also there is no wat to acces your save files.
dont buy this gamei took one weekstill can't fix the crash
This game is as fasinating as watching paint dry. It is not user friendly at all. To make it even moderately interesting you have to pay out of the ears for DLC for every detail.
MAN fuck THIS GAME I CAN'T EVEN fuckING PLAY IT AFTER THE UPDATE! IT WON'T fuckING LAUNCH NOW AND IT JUST STARTS TO CRASH WHEN I USE THE DLC I fuckING BOUGHT! SO fuck THIS GAME FOR fuckING DO THIS TO ME AND fuck THE PEOPLE WHO UPDATED IT! fuckING DUMBASS fuckfuckfuckS.
The worst. Not fun at all.
Ok I ve been playing it nonestop for 9 hourI find the game is avarage. You can read the good parts of game at comment sectionhere are the cons:  - You have to pay for DLC which supposed to be in game already! I mean: different factions
A amaing game! but chinese playersU have no need to buy it. because no chinese bags!  that's a perfect reason for us to support pirate! sryP
What is going on? Reading stories about people playing the game is sadly more interesting then actually playing it. Go play something else.
I recommend getting a different paradox grand strategy game.  After 400 hours of this game and 1 hour of the EU4 demo I'm convinced that this is my least favorite paradox game. Many mechanics can be abuse you can bribe the pope to give you a gift for more moneyyou can chain-arrest courtiers to take all their moneysometimes you will randomly banish a couriter for 10k gold

text is unreadable on a large screen
Way to much work to be fun for me. You micromanage everything. Marragewarfunds
I object to having to purchase an e-book in order to get content. I purchase every singles DLC as soon as it is available for this gamebecause the game is excellenteven though I feel Paradox knickle and dimes me like crazy
I'm surprised they didn't try to sell the main menu to me as DLC.
Played Israeldestroyed because there was no USA. Typical!  Iran deserves nukes/98lack of North Koreans.
I really dislike the new dlcs. Game is way to easy now. I use to love this gamebut now I just hope they make a ck3 so they can get back to the basics of it again.
Nice game of family and politicsbut the huge drawback and reason I don't play is because the biggest nation will have the biggest army and always win the war. Number of soldiers is everything in this gameas opposed to actual history. So no point playing as a small nation - boring
i dont know what i am doing
Rip my 150 euros :( A friend said it was a good game. I but my brother in prison and murderd him at the start. And pepole hated me for it wonder why!? Then i made a child. And prisoned him and killed him aswell. Then i died but i was such a nice guy. Oh well nice quality though
I'm sure for people who've played all the preceding titles created by this team find this interestingbut for folks coming from the Total War franchise and other Strategy &amp RTS gamesthis is just overwhelming and even boring. When the tutorial feels like you're taking a graduate class in memorizing interface options you know it is just a mess.
Dont buy or download. Crashes at load screen and ALL of the 'solutions' posted online do no work. Have not been able to play game since purchase.
wtf I can write a reviw even tho I don't have the game? lel  welp  do I recommend it ?   YESSSSS why ? the fuck I know I never played the game
i don't even own this game
Not much here to do. Boring.
Lags too much to play
fucked my sons wife Comitted suicide Son became the King of Ireland Got fucked by england  10/10 Would get fucked over by england again
cool idea... but not a fan of the implememtation...
Pretty much thought it would be age of empires... Nope...
I had super high hopes for this game. Alas I cant read a single word on the screen. The font is beyond tiny that you need binoculars just to read the land description or menu options.  Ive tried the better read modthe gotchic font modand the large toolbar mod and none of them seem to work on the description or menu texts or any at all that Ive noticed. If they some how have a font scale in a later patch. Ill definitely be excited to try this game.
I feel like this game was a bit too complicated for me and I didn't like the formatting.  Sorry if anyone disagrees to my opinion (I saw this had very positive as a average review rate.)
The game crashed and I spent 20 minutes staring at my desktop before I realised it wasn't the game.
Its fun
its okay i guess
All the DLC's and paid updates are making me unable to enjoy the game.
its ok i would give it 62/100 its good becuase its a great grand strategy game and i dont like it becuase its to confusing with town many feature's and things. but overall i would recommend it.
fuck
Complicated doesn't mean better. You have to pay for most of the fun options and it does not give you any real clue as how to playleaving you stranded. I prefer the original.
fuck after the update always crush on loading
All the DLC's and paid updates are making me unable to enjoy the game.
There has been no official Chinese?bad!
.
Here's a game that I wish I had the attention span to get into. It's far too deep for someone like me to enjoybeing that I'm always distracted by my screaming kidsor busy life.  That being said
my character was 'easy' they said  in about an hour of playing I ripped my country in two with a civil war (nobles apparantly don't like rules) my son attempted to kill mefailedand joined france after I tried to have him arrested  i like it
Incest Simulator 2016  It's a good game go get it and make yourself the most overpowered character in the game.
ActuallyI've enjoyed this game pretty much until today. To be more specific - until the moment when Steam had me install the update. It crashed my save -okok
50 cent played this i pluto
Revoked my brothers title of vassal and banished him. Later made him my steward.  That fuck knows his place now.
That thing DOES. NOT. WORK. on some computers.
lotta the dlc is just texture packs and as i play this game on my microwave and dont need texture packsits fine. just be ware there is a 20-40$ extra cost inr required DLC. so wait for a sale or dont buy.
Crash Kings II* But fun if u have patience.
Awful gamewasted $40. It manages to combine the lack of response time of a fast paced game with the boredom of a slow paced one. The tutorial also does not explain what it wants very wellyou will have to just wait for it to move foreword to catch up with where you are regularly

ParadoxI've triedI really tried.... but your games are just so tedious and boring. CKII ranks up there for me as the second-worst game in my ownership. EUIII is the first
I really want to love this game. The intriguethe adventurethe complexity
This is a buy-to-pay piece of garbage. good gamebut you cant play in 2 times without dlcyou cant play 2/3 of the nations
Among the numerous Paradox strategy game series'this one certainly isn't lacking in the content department. Character creation allows you to do what you will with any given starting characterfrom making ugly weak dwarfs to brilliant strong madmen. Count to Emperor
you can be muslim  well not exactly you have to pay money  to muhummed  allahu ............ akbar allaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh taaaaaaaaaaaakkkkkkkkkkkkbbbbbbbbbbbbbiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrrrr INSHA'ALLAHU AKBAR
OkParadox update policy makes me mad after all.  I could understand meaningless 'faces/music' minor DLCbecause they are like donation. The game is 100% playable even without it. But their indifference to bugs is unforgivable.  After any new major DLC release the game receives bunch of bugs for everyone
All i can say is the DLC cost more than the game.
I'm too broke for all those DLC's
Nowhere have so many been micromanaged by so few.
DLC: The Strategy Game
Screw you Paradox. I shelled out a ton of money buying the content pack for a copius ammount of extra cash and you cheap me out of half of the signifigant DLC? What the hell? You're really going to do that? As someone who has HOI4EU4 and Stellaris I'm frusterated and appalled. You're going to cheap out your fanbase for some extra cash? Disgusting. This is rediculous. Screw you and corporate Sweden and this bloody monitization of everything. If you're reading this DONT buy the content packmost of it is extra skins and other BS and not actual DLC. Buy everything seperately. Could be a good game
You think this is a deep game? Nountil you play some hours.   You think there is strategy in the game? Nothere is only numbers. You got the numbers you win.  You think you can start with a little kingdom and become an emperor? No
any game that crashes on start up obvouisly shows that the developers need a few slaps to the head to realign their brain
Very DetailedVery Engaging and the Quintessential History Buff's box of tissues...  Howeverwithout a more detailed and easier to get into tutorial for first timers
I would say this is a great gamelike the ideathe intrigue
just buy it 
Not for the casual strategist.   I've got hundreds of hours into the Total War gamesand I picked this up under the mistaken impression that CK2 would be a similar experience. I was completely wrong. After about 15 minutes of gameplayI realised just how different the game is
This game is realistic and therefore very hard. Perhaps too hard to be a video game. On a small chancethe King dies leading his armies. Wellyour dynasty just fell apart
This game has a great premisea good ideaand dlc that folks wanted to expand the game.   The game itself has decent tutorials
GAMEPLAY:  4/10  STORY:  Make-your-own-history  ONLINE:  Availiblebut unplayed  The game had much more depth than I expectedand that is it's downfall. The tutorial is absurdly long and if you make it through without it glitching
SteamOS/Linux version crashes in under 5 minutes every time I start a new game.  Unplayable.
It's as glitchy as f**k. I wasn't even able to get into the actual gameplay. For the first few daysthe game would crash upon the opening loading screen. After restarting my computer twice and waiting a few daysit finally worked.   I got to the main screen and started the tutorials. That didn't work out either. Windows or pop-ups kept appearing for less than a second and then disappearing
fuck ass game. dont play it. it is soo bad. i do not recommend this game.
The game looks amazingbut will not run on my computer. I have a high end gaming PC and every time I try to load it up it freezes.
way to hard and complicated... i just tryed the game and found it way to complicated... thank goodness i didnt buy the game!
Far to confusing. Not much is explained even after playing the training campain several times
fuck your dad and kill your sonbut in real life
its too complicated i cant even do the tutorial
PROS: + extremely interesting theme (769 to 1453) + great wealth of historical information (personsdynastiesprovinces
The game looks so aweseme that I had to buy it and the DLC. The problem is that it is the hardest to learn game I have ever seen in over 30 years of computer gaming. I just can't grasp it but I wish I could.
If you want to brood again and again about why things won't work that should work and about what you can do at all - then it's your kind of game. If notthen not.
dude i dont even know how to play this game so i cant say crap.
Bugged peace of fuck
Bought the complete editionbut it was´nt even complete at the time of purchase.   DLC policy is horrible and the game with all DLC isnt worth the cost. Never purchase unless at least 80% reduced price. Thats when you will get a fair deal.   The game itself (with DLC) is worth between 20 and 50$depending on how much you like the genre. Watch out for the savegame converter however
This game is unplayable! in single player the first thing it has you do is click on part of the map...  and then something is supposed to happend or suposed to be clarified... but it nothing happens and nothing will get qualified  so after about 10 minutes randomly bashing any keys and clicking every damn location on the map and getting really fuck??.... something weird happens and the whole map changes...  It wont tell you what the fuck just happened. and basically you are allready suposed to know what you are doing before you even start the game...   funny thing is there is no guideno start up helpno info...  so basically what the fuck are you supposed to do???   I Don't Know  and well after 15 minutes staring at some map I was totally done with it     The best thing you can do with this game is UNINSTALL!!!
I spent the later half of the night playing this game. It's a terrible game. On a scale of one to tenI would give it a one. Everything about it sucksexcept for the depth of the game play which is incredible. This is one of the worst games I have ever played
To be honestI don't really recommend this game if you aren't into strategy games. For meI tried it but I didn't really like it. It was an iteresting concept
Pile of fuck. No idea what to do. Try suggestions at the top? OK. Can't do it not enough prestigecan't do it not enough money.  Garbage waste of money
fuck??unstable game. Feels like it's in early access.
not impressed so farcrashes on launch every time
Do you enjoy staring at tiny icons marching back and forth across a static screen? What about clicking through various spreadsheet like pages and sliders? Then this game is for you!
A good game in itselfbut... the DLC. Too muchtoo fast. Literally every month
Way too complicated. A better tutorial is needed.
This game is so hardcore that I turn it on and turn it off and play Civ 5
The only good Paracucks game is one that is no longer being spammed with new DLCsand that being said this game is currently garbage.
I was an Indian Buddhist and I ran a small nation within a kingdom. I married the Raja's only son in a matrilinear marriageturned out he had a son from another woman. Killed the son with exploding manure. Husband found outleft to go to another country
i cant play this really all i can do is scroll around and do nothing
Damnthis game is soo confusingI don't know what the hell I'm doing most of the time while when I first played Rome: Total War (when I was 8
Not great! 0/10 im bored as hell... total waste of time 'don't even try it'
Extremely steep learning curveand overly complicated. Not worth the timeor the money.
Extremely steep learning curveand overly complicated. Not worth the timeor the money.
after 20 seconds ingame all the buttonsoptions are responsabilities got to me and i had to ALT+F4. This game is hella scary!
I was having a really nice time playing CKII until a new patch broke my savegame. Countless hours of play are gone. If you want to get similar experiencethis is definitelly game for you. Otherwise stay out.
I launched this gamesaw the user interfaceand threw up.  Not really
This game is great. Really excellent. Much better than FEZ.
fucking paradox and their sheckle hoarding ways
The best part of this is the A Game of Thrones mod available. I never played the regular game so I know nothing about itbut the mod is awesome if you like the books/show.
Wellthis was a disappointment. What looked to be a really awesome period piece is absolutely crippled by the designers forgetting about one small piece of the puzzle - the player.   I meanwhere do I start in my description of their failing to care about the player? How about the tutorial? I could describe how it's broken up into needlessly small sections with 'basic' being an overview of each subject
Played this game for 500+ hours. Only buy this game when its on 75% saleand even then only if they have fixed the recent mistakes they made their their DLC Charlemengewhich basically makes playing The Old Gods boring as fuck.  Do not spend money on this money grubbing company that sends out $16 DLCs that ruin the game.
Please research the game VERY WELL before you make a final purchase! This is one of those games that can be very overwhelming and confusing to learn. I played for 5 hours straight... And pure frustration has led me to pursuit a refund.   BEWARE!
These game is hot fuck! 6/9 Times I played it I literally cummed on the screen!
Don't understand how people can claim this is such a great game. I've tried to understand this game for hours. The tutorial is atrocious and barely even farts on the surface. You have to look up wiki information for hours before you know what anything is or does.   You will have armies of 12k soldiers losing to armies of 8k soldiers and you'll have no idea why BECAUSE THE GAME DOESN'T TELL YOU fuck.   You'll try to take a county from your enemy but it won't be turned over in the peace negotiations and you'll have no idea why BECAUSE THE GAME DOESN'T TELL YOU fuck.   You'll be staring at a plethora of numbersstatsdecimals and have no idea what any of it means BECAUSE THE GAME DOESN'T TELL YOU fuck.   I have been stuck on one county for who knows how long despite having occupied all the territories around me. But I don't even have the option to offer peace so I can attempt to gain the counties in the negotiation. Why? I don't know! BECAUSE THE GAME DOESN'T TELL ME fuck!@!$@$%$@^#^$%  Then there's the DLCs. Like 9
This game was fun when it started but in my personal opinion they've ruined this game over the years. Now its just a tedious slog of unrelenting disastersyour vassals will revolt constantlydoomstacks of rebels will spawn out of nowhere
Guys game became unplayable I can't run it anymore after past patches despite the fact that it used to work perfectly and I've not changed anything in my pc all solutions online didn't work for me and support won't do anything unless it's recognized as a bug. Don't waste your money and get another game.
You have like 10 things to doe.g. become a pilgram or tax the jews. Combat consists of watching numbers on the screen go down. Total war series is much more enjoyable
It's not that the game was broken and frustratingit was just boring. Got it in a humble bundle with Terraria and tested it outonly to find that it was one of those games that throw way too much information at you at once and go way too slowly. Personally I prefer games that have a faster pace
Heard lots of good things about this gamebut this is the least accessible game I've ever playedit seems impossible todo
This was a great game until the patch was released. Now it just crashes to desktop... a lot. I think I discovered what the *paradox* is... the patch totally fucked it up. It will probably be another 4-6 months before another patch is released. Avoid until fixed.
literally the dumbest fucking game ever created and i wish they had steam refunds when i bought this garbage
I loved Europa Universalis IVfigure'd I'd give this game a try. I honestly don't like it. 4/10
How can a game of such complexity not offer a thorough tutorial at the beginning? Almost impossible to learn the basics. No thanks.
FIX YOUR fuckING SERVERS  MAYBE IF YA PULLED YA fuckING THUMBS OUT OF YOUR ASSESAND FOR ONCEJUST fuckING ONCE
Last night gave EU4(after CK2)one more tryand then remembered why chose TW over 10y ago.Original wargames were hexagonal wartime(usually WWII)campaigns with top down view and squares with two letters(for navy&ampplanes)or different symbols(for land units)No close-up for viewing unts!That+small teritories to conquer is HOI downgrade.Pure conquering with therral tactical thinking contemplating couple versions of moves in advance(more like chess)ensuring supply lines and logistic(like in real war)Without diplomacytrade and technology were given from history dates like in CK2 and EU4(but in EU tutorial sent columbo in 1495instead1492.Won`t even think for real playing)TW is so evolved that trading
Do you like learngin TBS micromanagemeant games? You will love this game.  the rest of us shouldn't bother - lack of tutoriallack of guidance of any kind.   So very many optionsand you can't fgure them out easily.
Game is fun. Too much DLC.
Total shitnessutter fuckfuckopened it up and it opened the Minecraft Technic launcher like wtf is this
I've played over 6 hours of this gameand I still haven't the slightest clue as how to be any level of talented in this game.
what the fuck do I do?
dont buy this game crash crash and close by it self if u know how to help pls help
The game has issues right from the get go. Difficulty with resolution. On my Lenovo 1920x1080 res. Yet this game with the same res is settings is about 4x larger. The launcher starts in the bottom right corner and wont move. Very disapointed. Cant even play
wtf is this confusing thing they call a game?
Dont buy doesnt workpretty much every game works on my computer this one does noti tried clean reinstall and verified integrety but couldent get past loading screen 0/10
I don't own this game.
If you like reading endless tooltips only to be more confused than before this game is for you. User interface is the stuff nightmares are made of. Play Medieval II Total War and save youreslf a headache.
Mani really really wanted to like this game.. I installed it  The font was too smallI added a mod to enlarge the font.  Font was still kind of small. I tried to play anyway.  Game crashed trying to do 'new player' mode. The forums said to turn off the mod.  I turned off the mod
so i dont know how to swich it to english because its in german or something so i have no clue how to play it i need to know how to play it for a full and better rating 1 out of 5 stars sorry
A somewhat dry turned based strategy.  I found I couldn't muster the patience to learn this game. The game literally gives you no direction as to what you should be doing in game.  Perhaps some other time.
was bought as a gift played it once....i dont play board games on a pc thats just....idiotic and fans that play need to go outside
cant really get into it if you are new to this. the tutorials are even more confusing and half of them didnt even work. if you are a true hardcore fanwilling to spend 100+ hrs to understand the game (wich is clearly NO FUN BUT WORK) this is prolly ur game.  or if you are autistic.
Spent a day trying to resolve start up crash issuesfollowed all advice on forums still not working. Submitted a ticket for a refund. Buyer Beware.
Have not enjoyed. The campaign map is aesthetically dull and the gameplay is essentially like a board game simulator but without humans to play with and with added annoying interruptions. Possibly just not my thing.
opening sequences look goodtutorial not so goodmy first impressions are positive If I could only work out how to play it!
non-PhDs need not apply.
overall game play are ok
it was very confusingand the ruler u could be was randomly generated and they were very ugly.....
This is a complete joke of a game. There is no help given whatsoever. You just start the game plonked with a map of Europesurrounded by a hundred tiny buttons and tabs and expected to make sense of it. I've tried looking for guides on how to play this gamebut found nothing of any help whatsoever. What do I do? How do I attack and conquer other countries? Why do I constantly get popups of losing battles
great idea but very slow to start and takes way to long to learn the concept/ basics.
idk wtf is going on in the game and i'm not the type of person who will do research on the internet just to understand a game.
I'm sickand tired of dynasty/family game makers thinking the feminine game concept of dynasty/family games is for menand doing these things of not allowing Queens to rule
Warning: RANT  This is one of the worst games I have ever played in my lifethe dullness of it's interface and horrible tutorial will only be the beginning of the nightmare you will encounter. The worst part - It is impossible to understand what is happening and why it is happening.   From my experienceyou will spend most of your time looking at a map without anything happening
Too much going on in this and not enough clear help either. Medievil so much better
Worst experience with bugs since 'BattleCruiser 300ad'
For a total newbiethis game is a complete disaster. A rubbish tutorial that turns the entire game into a click fest. I really tried and even watched YouTube videosbut the only thing 'Grand' about this game is the yawn it gave me after 10 minutes. This game is a perfect example of 'too complex' mechanics that make no sense.  Newbies beware - Crusader Kings II will crush and destroy every bit of 'fun' you had hoped for. Don't be tempted.
I like strategy games some of my favourites games are XCOM (old and new)FTLCommand &amp Conquer. So I was recommended Crusader Kings II. But you will only like this is if you really really really like stragegy games. To me
Worst Game Ever... doesn't even have any hot babes in it. Need more Duke Nukem.
Absolutely awesomereally great gamebut with awful DLC policy. It is just a DLC hell. Don't buy it
I don't think this game is 'bad'but I personally don't like it. It is by far the most complex game I have ever seen. There are so many factors and variables that I can hardly even know what's going on. When I open a new gameI just go 'WOW that is a lot of crap'. The GUI is insanely complex and there are so many buttons I spent about an hour just trying to see what half of them did. I still don't know what a lot of them do. Just beware
I played this game for 23 hours and still couldn't work out how to play it. Does that mean I am fuckfuck?
AVOID this game unless you want to spend a lot of time being frustrated. The game play of Crusader Kings II is terrible. The AI in this game is unrealistic. Vassals who can only generate a few hundred men when they are supplying armies as an ally will have a few thousand if they revolt against you. It makes no sense when you look at the level of development (i.e.none) within the revolting counties. Most of them don't even have a level one market to generate the wealth to hire a large mercenary army or have developed militarily to have a multi-thousand man army. Another frustration lies in the lack of coordination capable between your personal and vassal armies. I lost multiple conflicts just because a vassal army would not join my army at the very moment it could have made the difference in a battle. The AI is seemingly set up to work against you at every turnincluding the succession to a new leader. The concept of a multigenerational game is potentially great
I only played it for a day and i know nothing about paradox games. But i have no intention of changing that. This game costs 150 euros. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY to get the whole game. You either do that or you get to play version where you can't do half the stuff. Thats kind of funny but also frightening. Seriouslyend this DLC fuckt.
FirstI bought this game solely to play the game of thrones modand I had a blast playing with it. However after the latest patch it has become unplayable. Looking around the internet I was shocked to find that there were so many bugs like this that I could not find a solution to the specific one I had. I cant recomend a game that does not work.
Because of serious crashes which occur every 5-10 minutes this game is unplayable right now. Devs recommend to not use the latest patch whithout patching the game on their own. The crashes seem to disappearif you buy the DLC 'Sons of Abraham'. But I never buy a DLC to be able to simply play the game.
I Like EUIVa lot in factbut this political game is boring as hell.
Not worth the money.
This game is too hard for you. Try ityou'll see!
If you like games that are overly complicated that are in depth with insane amounts of dipolmacy you should get this.....  Personally - I don't like that kind of game - so i'm giving it a NEGATIVE REVIEW
Let's take apart the gameplay. Is it any good?  [PLEASE PURCHASE GAMEPLAY REVIEW DLC]  That was it for the gameplay. The combat is the weak pointbut...  [PURCHASE COMBAT REVIEW PACK]  The politics deserve a part of their own. They are the most important part in CK2 and should be looked at throughly.  [PURCHASE POLITICS REVIEW DLC]   I think you get my point. This game is blatant money grabbing milk cow for DLCeven more than The Sims franchise is. This is 3 years old. Sims 3 release in 2009 and this has MORE DLC.
This 'GAME' is spreadsheet simulator 2014. I hit the plus key thirty timeswonand uninstalled. BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.
The tutorial is so simple and rubbishin game hints are useless and the overall replayablity i think is terible....dont waste your money.
This is a mess of illogic and broken dynamicsnot a game. It works only until you play it as the developers intended itif you go off that path you'll be punished with unrealistic consequences.
If had done my research on what kinds of games Paradox makes I would have never have bought this game. This game has a large learning curve that you have to go through to make it you dont lose early. IF your the kind of person who is willing to spend more than a few hours just learning the game then I would say give it a shot. But even then the game will screw you over with some random roll during a battle at makes you lose 300 troops making you lose an important battle and making wonder why you even thought buying this game was a good idea.
is this a game or an excel spreadsheet???????
boring
Just dont by this game. Its a complex game with complex rules that changes everyday. I bouth this game and after a few hours playingwhen it starts to make sense to methey change everyting. Like the assassination button
My brain not good enough to understand how complex this game :
BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Make a decent tutorial for the game at the beginning. I'm not reading pages and pages of crap!!!
this game is more paradox trashyou get half a game and are forced to pay out the  for the rest of it through the most fuckt DLC cash grab fest of any company.  Make no mistake this is not even really a gameit is a random event simulator where you do not really have any control over what actually happens in game.  This is the most frustrating over designed peice of crap i have ever played
where are the fightswere is the excitement of gaining a countytried to play it and failed
No dank memes in this game. At first I thought there was one pepe in italy but it turned out to be a pope.   0/10 needs more pepes
a difficult game to get into. there is a a lot of information to absorb and just when you think you got it allthere is more. plenty of details and I don't mean graphical. If you love historyand you read about it all the time and love it. You may like this game but it is not for everyone.
I dont get all the positive reviews. I spent 6 hours messing with this gameand couldnt get anything going. Maybe it was a bug? but unless I was a kind I couldnt do anything. I would get marriedthen sit there for 20 years and that was it. I couldnt use chancellors
Can Ibe honest? I bought this because everyone says it's so greatbut it's the only paradox game I actively dislike. I just can't get into it. Might be just mebut you never know.
Overpriced so hard.... This game is so damn expensive. Nobody wants to pay 159.99$ for fucking DLCs. It's ridiculous this game is way too overpriced and should only be 30$/w DLC. When I buy a fucking game I want the whole fucking game not just a part of it. To do that I gotta pay fucking 159.99$ gotta be taking a fucking fuck it isn't worth it at all!!!!
Fun gamebut really? 160 dollars for the whole thing! Thats an outrageous price! They already make you pay 40 for just a simple demo of the game. Not worth the money unless you have a lot of money to waste. However if you have so much money why are you wasting your time playing video games. So overll just dont get it.
9/10 Would be assassinated repeatedly again.
Nice game. I should say yes this game was entertaining but its drawbacks are so critical.   I watched roughly two hours of tutorial guide at youtube because I could not understand how this game works through in-game tutorial game. I am not from English speaking country so most of my friends are not good at English as much as I do. That's the main reason why I regretfully thumbed down this game. Besides the language problemtutorial system is generally too poor compare to complicated system of the game.   Second reason why this game really sucks is that there are too many fucking DLCs and the fact that they are still making it(LOL my ...) This is almost disgusting. I spent 9USD for the main game during weekend bargaining. It does not take me so much time to realize that the main game itself is not even a half of the game.   This kind of 'qunatumnizing' of a game marketing strategy is clearly a harm and threat to reasonable and trustworthy game market. It simply does not help make people buying games and keep them away from pirate market. I wish Someday and somehow Paradox realize this fact and start make some real games.
It's a good game but completely unplayable if you're playing on a TV and you aren't prepared to sit 6 inches from the screen to be able to read the tiny text - and this game is almost entirely text.   Normally that wouldn't put me off the gamebecause normally you'd be able to do something about this problem yourself. For some reason howeverthere are no options for scaling the text or the UI
i fell asleep on my keyboard.very boring.
I dont get all the hype. The game does not impress me at all in any of its segments. First seems deep and engaigingends up shallow and boaring.
THIS NOOB ACTIVE I WIL NOT PLAY THIS I ALREADY HAVE IT
Attempted to explore this game during a free weekend trial and soon discovered the tutorial was broken due to a known bug. Spent about 8 hours trying to learn how to navigate the rather opaque interface before giving up in frustration. I might try playing again the next time the game is available for free to see if the developers have fixed the tutorial.
It crashes at startgreat game for 40 euro
I have no idea why some people like this game so much. It is frustrating and most of the time you have no idea what is going on. It has a huge learning curve whichquite franklyI can't be bothered with.  Started game as William the Conqueror - invaded England - for some strange reason Harold
dont you just hate when you have to read 10 books to play no sorry its more than 30 books\\
So confusing and not worth it
I do not own this gameI played it for free. It might be a good game when you learn how to play it but it is not a game you can jump into. It feels like a homework assignment. I dont even know where to start with it. people tell me it is amazing if you give it a chance. I dont have 10 hours to give a chance to something. I feel this style of game is out dated.
Critic: As I start the game the first thing I have noticed was that the game was not completenot complete? you say... yes not complete because we have to pay for the complete game with a lot of DLC's. I have played for 2 hours straight and I didn't understand a thing in the gamehow the game works etc. ...  Rating - 31/100  Conclusion: So... No... I'm not recommending this game to you guys unless you want to pay more than 150$ in DLC's and with no understandable gameplay.
Game is fuck. DLC Music of every fuckin g nation ever for only 19.99$ would you like remodelling aswell? that will be 10$ more sir. Oh wait you wanted to faction in the game which wasnt announced as playble? Tough luck... unless you'd be willing to part with 20.99$ more? :)   Game is extremely boring as it is.  fuck gamefuck dlcfuck paradox..
Ever wanted to handle the boring side of the Roman Empire? Me neither!
This game is way to complicatedand if you are used to TOTAL WAR gamesthen you have pretty much done it. And also
this game really awesomei dont understand at alleven when try tutorial
Nearly everything you click on requires DLC.
this game really awesomei dont understand at alleven when try tutorial
complicatedslowsome parts are better than civilization but still needs simplicity. Tutorial section is not helpful enough. and also over priced
Bought this game because so many people gave it an awesome review. I'll be honestI had high hopes/expectations. Those are taken away right away. The game works off a randomization routine. As a programmerI sadly understand how they wrote it and thus are not impressed but using a random number generator in combination with a cute/stupid description of events. So prepare to be amazed by the same thing as a slot machine. Ok now for the true pros and cons:  Pros: Could be fun if I sunk hundreds of hours into it to understand the developers convoluted way of making games. In fact
This game is complete garbage. I've played 29 minutes of loading flags and then it locks up. I've tried the forum suggestions and made it past the flag loading once. I have a intel i7 with 16gb ram win 7 64bit and gtx770. not my rig just a crap game.

Whenever I play it it never loads ):
I've tried to play this game two timesand in both it crash at the loading screen.  10/10 would crusade again.
The whole system of this game is hard and not understandable. It just throws you in there and gives you almost no directionsand thats in the fuck tutorial. This games graphics arent one of the best toobut i could live with that. Also it's quite overpriced
it was too hard to understand and i diddent like it all that much. :( liked the idea though.
This is not really a game just more of a ideait's a good idea but an idea. Negative:  -The combat doesn't exist it basically makes battling noises and says You win/lose. -Don't get this game if you don't want to spend hours of searching how to play it correctly. -You have little control In the game everything is either simulated and or done by AI. -DLC Simulator. -Basically a Board game. -Ai is pretty dumb (AI not attacking when I basically right next to them and they could easily win) -HUD is very confusing kinda just splattered everywhere.  Positives:  +Lots of events +good graphics +Great Historic Knowledge. +Great content in game (if you get dlc's)   This game would be amazing if they actually made a combat system (which the player has to do actions etc) and made the game less annoying to learn (as theres about 20+ tutorials to understand all of the game which can take many hours)  For now though Not recommended.
At that point Pdx should really stop advertising their games as historical.
This game has an extremely poorly designed user interface and tutorial system. Do not waste any money or time on this game. After eventually learning the game from a friend I spent several hours (mostly boring hours) becoming the king of Walse. Have concured Walse my King died and instead of my heir becoming king of Walse he gave away all the land I had just spent my hole afternoon concering to his brothers. What. The. Hell. Biggest waste of time since Dark Souls II. Once Paradon have leanrt what 'design' is let me know.
I I like the idea of grand strategy and allbut this game just doesn't have enough engagement in it for me. It's very hard to tweak my economy without having worry about a bunch of other things that game arbitrarily hangs over my head. Sureit's realistic
Boringslow and overpriced at any price. Avoid it as if it were cancer
F your review
Get Europa Universalis 4 instead.
The tutorial is too damn fucking long that I rage-quit without completing it.
The whole game is horrifically overly complicated and RNG basedto an unreasonable extent
Not saying that the game has no charm but not even 40 minutes in and i was so over whelmed with all the text pop ups i had no idea what i was doing and i was going through the tutoriali wanted to punch my computer screen
Tried a few times to get into this game but each time I try I'm baffled by the tutorial and I decide I have better things to do than sit around for hours just to learn how to play a game that will take days to play.  I'm sure it's great and all so I'll still give it a thumbs-up.
this is the worst game i have ever played hands down clunky wierd interface terrible music bahhhh i was hoping for some historical strategy i got a big irritating mess.
this game sucks fuck ballls
Game crashes repeatedly on load screen. Cannot recommend
crusader kings II?more like Boring game II.Game reall boring everything lagswhen game is loading it always stops and closes and everything i hard and boring.Dont buy this game!!!
bull fuck defeat at every turn nothing goes your way one sided AIachievements brokenis real fucking weak and trashy
DLC buttrapeovercomplicated gameplaytotal waste of money just for the single game. every maniacal plot
The multiplayer game is so buggy it makes it unplayable. The game forces you to do so many weird thingsfrom having to restart multiple times because of 'game version' problemsde-sync problems and annoyances like having to fill in extra fields like description and type...I mean forcing me to fill it out? C'mon guys. Not to mention the 100+ dollars you have to pay to get the DLC....but NONE of it works consistanly multiplayer. DO NOT GET THIS GAME...unless you're playing alone and only then if it is 75% off or more.
I cannot in all good concience recommend this gameit is the only game I have rage quited... the interface is confusing and so overly multilayered that by the time you've found what you are looking for you've forgotten why you were looking for it. While the grahpics look good they do not make up for the tediously long and boring gameplayand the frustraing tier upon tier of unnecessary micro-management makes this a most unjoyous tedium
this is a really good stategy game and i would normally reccomend it HOWEVER there is the issue of DLCs so first of all im a bit enraged that ruler designer and customization pack are seperate DLCs but most importantly YOU CANT PLAY THEOCRACIES if paradox made a DLC where i could play as a theocracy(ex. hashashins) i would be happy but until than i am upset with this game
235$ for a complete game with all DLCs ... just let that sink in for a second ...
Most times you wonder if playing is the best term for what you are doing. Boring game.
I've played 8 hours of this game and I still dont understand how to play.
i already have this game. it's called Europa Universalis...
Very bad interfacecouldn't find START button for 10 minutes after choosing king.
**Removes Assassination.** -10/10
Totally great! - I wrotewhen the game was realised.  Butthe this changes some times
Best game everthe tutorial will make you go bonkers. Truthfullyyou got to like read and read for one whole month before you know how to play this game. Not user friendly to new beginners.
its fuck
Game was hard to figure out lot of reading. i never figured out if I could control the battles. i think girls would like this but I dont know.
This is quite a trivialas to how I am able to make a review on the product I DO NOT own... waithave I ever bought it? No
Not entirely sure how I came to own this. Humble Bundle perhaps. But let me tell you something. I'm not paying £178.20 to play the full game.
Great gamebut it's DLC dependent and that DLC is severely overpricedup to the point where it might be unaffordable to some.  It's not worth it
Crusader Kings II (CK2) is a grand strategy game like no other. If you want a game in which simulates leading a varried set of nations of the pastboth great and smallkeep on searching because Crusader Kings II fails to create such an experience.  After becoming a bit familiar with the CK2's shoddy interface (which will have you clicking like a madman to find the information you seek to decide what actions to take)
The Dark Ages might be drawing to a closebut Europe is still in turmoil. Petty lords vie against beleaguered kings who struggle to assert control over their fragmented realms. The Pope calls for a Crusade to protect the Christians in the Holy Land even as he refuses to relinquish control over the investiture of bishops - and their riches. Now is the time for greatness. Expand your demesne and secure the future of your dynasty. Fill your coffersappoint vassals
After not even hour of game play regret set in. Boring. Wish I could get the money i wasted back. Save your money guys!
This game is for those that enjoy 'Death-by-Detail' type games as this game most definitely fits that description. In my youth I would have sat around for weeks with my game manual and scoured every page until I had this figured out but now days at 46 .... not so much. I do not want to say it is a bad game but I do think they could have simplified it and streamlined it. I have been gaming since the days before video games and I haven't seen a game this in-depth yet. This game makes Civilization 5 look like childs play. So my basic breakdown is this .... if you are the type that wants to play a world conquest type game where you buy armiesfield them and attack/defend with them w/o alot of hassle as to where they came fromarmy upkeep or the allegiances those troops hold ... skip this one. On the other hand if you like worrying about all the minute details that would have been involved in the historical context of fielding an army
I've played this game long enough to know what it's like It's basically a game that has to many dlc's and paradox are just looking for money out of the game They've stripped it down to bare bones for the original and expect you to pay money for stuff that should already be in the game It's a really good game it's just the fact of paying money for something you should already have with the game is my problem
I sincerely hope that the format is developed because the concept and potential of the game is so damn brilliant but the GUI just isn't really there. The icons are confusing and all look like eachother. Butas I saidthe concept (basically sandbox-strategy) is MIND BLOWINGLY good. So
I really wanted to love this game. UnfortunatelyI can't.  Pros: - Very detailedfocuses on a lot of features in the medieval world. - Interesting take on things: you don't control a country
This game will have you squinting at the screen wondering why it takes 10 months for find a fuckfuck?? for your general's daughter to marry. I wish I could return this
WTF? What a bad game. There are no anime cat girls. SMH  0/10
I've heared a lot of good things about this game and have many friends who like it. But the tutorial was lacking and because of that I was never able to understand. I'm sure it's a very good game but it has a bit of a high wall of entry. Unless you want to do a lot of experimenting or some better online tutorials you may want to consider something else.
An unrealistic and overly technical political simulatorbuggy even at this late stagewith extremely weak military aspects.   When you aren't inexplicably 'forced' into peace due to a 'war score' percentage
If you've never played a Paradox GameI honestly don't recommend this to you.  After 8-9 hours of playtimeand equal that studying walkthroughs and tutorials
I am a Mac user (Macbook Pro) and I have had this game for about two years and have played it a lot. I originally bought it based on the recommedation of a friend who had it for PC. When I first opened it it the graphics were clipping so badly I couldn't play it. After a few patches were released I tried it again and really got into itbuying a bunch of DCLs. When the 2.1 patch was released it changed the game enough that I could not longer play old saved games and I lost game I'd been working on for 6+ months. Supposidly on PC you can go back to the earlier version but this does not seem to be possible on Mac. This made me pretty upset and I stopped playing for a couple of months. I just tried it again to find that I can no longer chose which DCLs I play with due to a problem with the launch screen in the Mac version and that the game is now so slow (possibly due to graphics 'improvements') that the game is more or less unplayable on my system. This is a great game but I would never recommend it to a Mac userer nor will I ever be buying another Paradox game again. HonestlyI will do my level best not buy games through Steam either. If you can't offer the same quality of product to Mac users just don't release for Mac.
Crusader kings 2 is a fantastic game provided you can get it without steam somehow. I was only able to play the demo and loved it so made the fatal mistake of assuming that i would get what i paid for if I bought the full version. Every second of 'game time' i have logged so far has been either trying to download the game or fixing what steam has fucked up on the rest of my computer these people are the scum of the earth. They dont care as long as they made their money which is a shame for Paradox and every other reputable company who gets duped into a partnership with these fucks. The game described is fun but I get to play the 'steam game' which includes runtime errors and migrainesnot anything amusing. You don't need to only have compatibility with the game like you would in a reasonable universebut with steam itself which is a roll of the dice. And guess what if it doesnt work and their fuckt fix doesnt help
One of the most boring game I ve playedat first It sounded interestingbut after managing to become King of Ireland
this game is hard to understand....needs more rules to explain what everything does at the start of the game...i played for 20 mins just guessing what to do and eventually gave up.
It's always sad to see such a cool idea ran into the ground so hard.  Crusader kings 2 does not feel like a game. In factit's hard to defend as a game when you spend more time watching your computer screen blankly than participating in any kind of strategy or diplomacy. This is so you can desperately watch a map that looks like a boardgamequestioning why you were ever given a functioning cerebral cortex just to waste it with this fuck
An awesome game for people who love to spend hours just trying to figure out how to play the game.
The staggering amount of DLC Paradox games have nowadays is downright shameful.
Very new update forces you to restart a new campaign. Newest update will not allow you to save you're game unless you restart it new. So there goes 50 hours wasted??
Far to much DLC
You need to attend a fucking college course to be decent at this game. I meanthe tutorial is superficial compared to the amount of depth and mechanics of this game. I really like deep strategy games (+300hs into civ5)but the amount of things to learn is so massive it just makes the game absurdly long and difficult to master. Not recommended.
I found this too hard to get into and the tutorial was unclear about things
I am sure that this game is very good once you have mastered the game mechanics and the user interface.  From what I have seen this game is heaven for every hard core strategy fan with a lot of time at hand. Managing a dynasty over the centuries with combatdiplomacyintrigues and much more should entertain you for month.  And this is the reason
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS FULL OF BUGS. If it were not for all the bugs I would love this game. However you can only get achivements in Iron Man mode. This mode is a huge fuck?. Everymonth you play through lags outas it saves. Even if you have an SSD drive it will lag out for quite some time. After about 100 years or so your game will become unplayable. For example when the Raj Expansion came out they released it with a huge bug revolet risk bug. By the time you hit the 100 year mark half of all Indian counties had a 50% revolt risk. This resulting in having to fight off between 3-8 revoltes at the SAME TIMEforever. Saves also inexplicably become corupt. So kiss all your work good by.
First off I must saythat I love this game and most Paradox games in general... that said they also have massive DLC issues. While buying the base game in itself is not that expensive Paradox tends to keep making new content about twice a yearwhile it's very nice and adds replayabiltiy it brings about three major problems and one minor one.  1. Every year you will spend $30 bucks. 2. Not buying it means the version you are playing will introduce features that make the game feel off as new mechanics are built around content that is blocked off to you. 3.As the mechanics change so do a lot of the rules
Don't buy this game. It crashes and steam will not support it
Too complicated and UI is poor. you'd be better off getting a romance of the 3 kingdoms or a civ game
The game looked like it might have been fun but after some time playing itI never figured out what the point was. Really sucked since I was really hoping to enjoy it.
I would recommend this IF I COULD PLAY THE GOD DAMN GAME!!! Every time I try to run itit gets around 60% done loading and then crashesevery single time. luckily I got it on sale
Steep learning curve. When finally somewhat mastered still pretty boring. Also de-syncs alot while playing over LAN/WAN.
I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME OR ANYTHING ON THID RIP OFF CO SITE. THEY TOOK MY MONEY AND THE fuck DOESN'T WORK! THE TECH SUPPORT IS NON EXISTENT AND IF YOU DON'T PLAT AT LEAST 5 MINUTESE YOU DON'YT GET TO REVIEW! GUESS WHAT///?????// I CAN'T GET THE GAME I PAID FOR TO LAUNCHMUCH LRESS RUN 5 MINUTES..........WARGAMES. SO I COMMENT HERE.........I WANT MY MONEY BACKCROOKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do not buy this game.   Even if you know how Europa universalis works and enjoy that game. This game is nothing like it.  You cant fight and take multiple provinces at once. You dont own the provences yourself your vassels controle them. they give you almost no troops. and they rebel every year ingame. Progress in this game does not exist. Your army is too small to fight and take an entire country over even if you have 20 more provinces. I played this game on king level (easiest) and still achieved nothing.  If You liked Europa Universalis 3 go to the 4th one. Don not buy this game. STEAM TRADE THIS GAME FOR EUROPA UNIVERSALIS 4 ON MY ACCOUNT PLEASE . (They have the same price.)
Crusader Kings 2 isn't fun for a guy that enjoys a conquering-type of wargame. CK2 feels like a medievil relationship game (like Sims almost) instead of a conquest game. The game has too much drama/detail/minutia to be fun and sometimes being complex for the sake of micromanagement is not a good thing. I could not get into this game at allespecially since the map has no option to see your holdings other than diplomacy mode which changes as soon as you click it. I like 'big picture' games with country vs country...this is like a lifetime channel game with only a lite emphasis on warfare and has way too many characters I don't want/need to care about. The depth provided is overwhelming and stupid...simply overkillboring and uninteresting.  If you are a fan of the HOI2 (DH
This is without a doubtthe HARDEST game ive ever played. There is a MASSIVE challenge. You dont get 2 months into the game without someone trying to steal your throne. It is BRUTALLY hard. Even if you play as the Holy Roman Empireyou will STILL get fucked in the . I can understand a challange
Family history simulator
Great concept and a well rounded game engine and AI (pretty rare these days). But game is a drag and it seems that I spend all my time arranging marriages and killing off family members - why the sole heir would find it worthwhile to rebel is beyond me.
An overly complicated and boring 'game' that creeps along at a snails pace. After viewing strategyguideswalkthroughs and watching many lets plays i am still unable to have fun with this game. I feel i must air my ill feelings regarding this 'game' because i paid £30 for itand so far i have not even begun to enjoy or even understand it. Also
Its scary when people plot to kill me 0/10 would not play
Do not buy this game. Too hard to understand and complicated. Buy only as it is your only game to play. You will spend a lot of time on it and will still not understand. Tutorial is a joke! Don't waste your money.
Honestlygame may be good down the roadbut from playing hundreds upon hundreds of games... I would say unless you have the time (alot of time) to learn the gameplay
Sucks fuck. Much Crash. Very Cancer. Such wow. Hungarian blames me for the game crashing because he's a black fuck?
Well lets start off from my experience from the start it's fuck i hate it this one time i actually did really good and my entire family magically dies. (note without warningit was probably a fuck?? glitch) its fuck did i mention that oh and it looks like fuck and the battle system sucks hard fuck
confusing as fuck
A must have for every white nationalist on tumblr.
Buggy interfacelackluster gamingjust...can't even begin to recommend this 'game'.
I am never able to play this gamesimply because I cannot log on to the server. No instructionNo guidance to follow. How come this kind of rubbish is on Steam? Do something
This game is seriously complicated. I played through the tutorialsand got introduced to a crap-ton of control panels and stats. I also watched about 30 mins of lets playand tutorial videos on youtube before jumping in.   When I went to start my first game and dip my toes in the water I started as someone in Scottland. I literally could not find a single thing I was suposed to do. I figured out how to unpause time
I really like the idea of this gamebut the learning curve is a bit steep for me.
By all reports this is a great gamebut paradox don't seem to support disabling DLCat least on linux. So after buying it with DLC
Crusader Kings II has great potential as a RPG empire builder (not a strategy game per se). Unfortunatelyit fails to live up to that potential. As a strategy gameit never made the cut because the warfare system makes CIV-V seem sophisticated. Essentially
What the hell is going on in this game? I don't even think that I've found the 'next turn' button. No idea. Needs some kind of a ... pacing system. 'First you start with your one little city. Then you get one character. Then you get one country. Oh lookthere is a neighbouring country! Let's say hello!' Something like that.
if it worked on my mac it would get a thumbs up its a good game its good on the pc but it crashes upon start up in mac dont even get the menu screen just crashes as soon as i click play
suck fuck
When I first saw CK2I wanted to have a new taste of strategy. Not a classic TW 'Kill 'em all' Style. Not a Victoria 2 huge learning curve style. NoI wanted a complexed game
Game is great. In theory. Howeverit comes with absolutely soul crushing habit of corrupting and destroying your save games.  Plenty of people complain Steam and/or Cloud has irritating habit of making things malfunction every time game is patched. This(apparently) happens despite auto-update settings you have.   I personally didn't need a patch to get my game broken. Everything worked great. For dozens of hours. Then my save got corrupted for whatever reason. Sought help from game's (awesome) community. Their consensus was that nothing can be done.  Game is enjoyable. Just keep in mind there is absolutely no reason to assume your save won't break sooner or later.  I have no idea what caused my game to get broken. -  No idea how to avoid it. - No intention to start a new gameblindly hoping PC gods smile upon my save.  It feels likely the problem is less fatal if you don't play in Ironman. Since not playing in Ironman is impossible for people with any chest hair at all
It's not a bad game and doess capture the difficulty of desigions of kings and queens. I didn't acctually like it becuse it was to compliacted and it felt like being in a history lesson than playing a game.
multiplayer takes either modifying your router or downloading a 3rd party software package that doesn't work! WORST $40 i have spent
I have been trying to enjoy the game (I have no extensions)but I really don't see where the 'depth' everyone is talking about is. The game revolves around the interaction with other characters. But in my opinion this possibilities are limited and repetitive. There is no real military srategyand all you have to do is to manage your relationships with people. But this isn't exciting at all. You start a game and you have to get all you familly married (can be up to 10 people). You just browse all the characters in the game to find the best ones
Its too complicated.
i cant recomend this game cause its to steep learning curve and unless you sit trough a lot of heavy tutorials you are not going to understand what your suppose to doi didnt.
Almost as fun as filing my taxes.
What in incredibly dull and cumbersome game.  Impossible to get the hang ofgreatly lacking in tutorial and almost devoid of any fun whatsoever.  Unless you are a strategy purist with great amounts of time on your handssave yourself and steer clear of Crusader Kings!
You can't help but have a lot of mixed feelings about this game. It looks good it runs well and covers a period in time that isn't very well known but still interesting. Unfortunatly the learning curve for this game is larger than any other game I have ever played or seen. Its extremely confusing at first. Everything you do takes forever to accomplish. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong but it is near impossible to conquer other lands even though you obviously won the battle for it. The worsed part is that a lot of the game requires DLC. There is over 20 pieces of DLC and they are all overpriced for the little stuff you get. Some of them should have been in the base game. All in allif your into the grand strategy try Hearts of Iron 3Victoria 2
I don't even know where to start. Let's start here: I do NOT say the game is bad or anythingit is actually a very good gamefun
I don't usually write reviews for games. Howeverthis game is horrible. I feel when one is looking for Strategyone is not looking to see how to breed an empire. I feel the interface is overwhelming and horrible. Not very intuitive
I don't understand the hypeit's basically a lesser and mideval version of Civ V with frustratingly perfect timing for AI interventions on your plans. While the game is fun at timesit is a massive time sink that leaves you mostly unfulfilled in the end. If you could pick it up with all the DLC for 20 bucks then I'd reccomend
This game is unplayable and a waste of time and money. That might seem harshbut it is what it is...Take it for what you willbut I had high hopes for this game. It's exactly what I wanted in a game. Did my research. Read the reviews. Which are all pretty good. Then got the game and tried to get through the tutorial. For the last fifteen years of my life I've been teaching people how to save lives. No joke
This game is terrible. It is extreamly complicated and does not tell you how to play the game at all. In the time it would take to learn how to play the game I could go learn a forign language or play through 20 much better games.

It gets highly boring after a while. They need to add into the gamebut not as an expansion because they are money grabbing fucksthe option to play as the Pope or other religious heads. I am sick to fucking death of paying more money for things that should've already been a game feature. But the game itself is good. On the account of their money grabbing ways
Personallythere is too much to gain at onceand possibly it is my fault for not looking for a tutorial
do a fuck load of nothingtry to make your kids not fuckfuck but they become hunchbacks anyway gg 10/10  reccomended if you're boring
I am addicted to this game. I LOVE IT. Strangely thoughI find it odd that you don't really DO anythingjust micro-manage your demse
If you are a European History buffyou may enjoy this gameas apparently the time periods and their applicable rulers are true to the real world.   Otherwise this game will not strike you as enjoyable. The reviews and their ratings are based on a very specific genre 'European History Simulation'
Gave a Jewish guy landKingdom became infested with Jews Everytime I dropped a penny it disappered  Too many Jews Kingdom was over run Kingdom became Jew Land Jew Land calling Holy Wars Jew Land spans from Ice Land to Sri Lanka All people without jewish nose was given a Gold Star They were rounded up and beheaded  Lesson of the day: Never give a Jew land or you cause a reverse holocaust
This game is very disappointing. Sureit is complex. Sureits got a lot of variation. I'm not going to knock it for its complexity
What garbage. Had to get a pirate version just to get the game to work. Paid copy still crashes at start up everytime. Paradox is a company ran by useless cuckolds
The game is spreadsheets+waiting. I tried for four days to like itbut the damn thing is really denseunintuitive
A good strategy/management game with interesting mechanics and adequate visuals. A must-have for Paradox fans and game worth consideration for anyone else. Issue is that this game is pretty obviously stripped out of features to include them in DLCs - as you can no doubt seeall DLCs cost twice as much as the game itself. Which is a practiceI for one
Book the game. Also incest simulator. Not for me personally.
I still don't know how to play this game.
i have two things to say about this game first of all they could at least make sure that it will run when you click the play crusader kings buttoninstead of telling me there is no input supportedif that was not bad enough i couldn't alt tab
its a piece of poop
high price
At ten or so hoursI really do not know much about this game.  But that being said here is why I am not playing it anymore.  1) The gameplay is loaded with excessive jargonrules described with jargon and reasons stated in jargon. The rules and gameplay never attempt beyond cursory explaninations - if you even get that
After the 2.0this game tends out be a very exhausting process and not fun after all. All the cons list here are based on ironman mode game experience.  1. Massive revolt &amp title claimers &amp expedition troops. One count revolt usually ends up with a troop for 6k or even up. This number does not make any sense comparing with most levy a count can hold (typically 1k). Most of the duchies fail to defend such a revolt as wellwhich makes the game really unrealistic and tedious. Not to mention those claimers or expedition forces come out of no where and sunddenly siege your capital with 30k troops.   2. Bad War Negotiation Score. After been defeated to 97% or even 99%
This game is something you love or hate. When I bought it I thought it would be like total war but it is completley different and I just can't get my head round how to play it. The pace is slow and basically you are staring at a map waiting for alerts to pop up where you need to make a descision and I found it difficult to work out what the best descision was.  Overall I never got drawn in enough to put in the effort to understannd the complex gamepaly mechanics and I imagine most people will be in my situation so unless you are sure that this is the sort of game that appeals to you then leave it well alone.
boring
this game lets you play pagansmuslimsAND republics! THE NAME OF THE GAME IS CRUSADER KINGS NOT JIHAD MUSLIMS! AND THEY ADDED A COMPLETELY OPTIONAL DLC THAT ADDS IN AZTECS WHAT THE HELL PARADOX  man all this optional dlc that you have to pay for is really ruining this game!!!!!!!  eurabia/10
Wanted to like this grand game  Wanted to not find it a boring struggle wanted my money back  wanted to curse the computer game gods for tricking me into thinking i was getting something good.
What a crappy game...   'Click on the map to select a character' it says after selecting single player game.  20 minutes later I still havn't figured out how to proceed after selecting character and I have clicked on everything I could find and used every key on the keyboard.  Only way to exit the game seems to kill the process...  It can't be right that I need to google how to use a game like this when I am a very experienced gamer and software dev.
it sucks
This Game sucks... every time you playeverbody revolts against you and you cant stop them. I can never get more than an hour into the game without losing. I have played countless other strategy games and been able to play and win thembut this one is so bad.
This game is so drawn out... The tutorial will not explain practically anythingcombat takes 1hr to move troops onto another region another 3 days just to take 1 city unless you run the risk of loosing 5000 troops to a mere fortress of 900 men by sieging the castle. You can get a 100% victory in a war against another player only for the computer to state...sorry war was inconclusive... I just raged quit after playing for 6hrs to take control of 3 regions. You can never please anyoneoffering gold doesn't work
It failed the fun test for me - I just could not find a way to enjoy the game. Combat was lacklusterpolitcs were distant and soulessand at no point did I feel like I was doing much more than interacting with a pretty interface on top of a spreadsheet.
No point in buying thisit's a DLC Cash Cow nothing more. The optionsas with all Paradox games are over stated and not deliver. Play something else
Quite possibly one of the most infruiatingly dissapointing games I've ever played. 3 hours I've played this and never again will I ever touch the 'play' button. Heed my warning with great cautionI haven't 'played' for 3 hoursI've sat on my fuck
This game is legitimately the most confusing game that I have EVER played. I thought it would be like Medieval II and CIV5 mixed yet CKII is nothing like those two extraordinary games. I give it a 2/10no overarching goalincredibly confusing
If you like tefta idlingyou will love this game.  It's boring as fuck :)
Basically total warbut for autis for smart people.
It's too complex. I can't even figure out what to do to get started. While some will like the excruciating detailit makes it virtually inaccessible to people who don't have someone to guide them.
As a fan of the totalwar gamesI thought that this would be right up my alley. I got bored after a couple of hours. It is boring. Do not buy it. It's just a text-based game on a pretty map. Pretty awful.
Paid $4.99...got what I paid for
Awesomely complicated. Little to no walkthrough. Even on steam sale its not worth it!!
dis geam is bad. why wud eye waunt two pla geam on mapi haet hitory clas. no gunsbad grafics. just get cod u noobs 0/1000
Pretty fucknot funtoo many dead peoples ok?
This is without a doubtthe most boring game I have ever playedand new players will be completely lost. I spent several hours going through all the DOZENS of tutorials
too old  +soundtrack  -very long loading times
this game is bad because fuck
Nope.. Nope.. Nope.. Nope.. Doesn't worth so many money.. 4 real.. you can get other game 10x better than this.. xDDD
You cant go to war without reason and it takes a real-life forever to distinguish yourself enough to march if you not a major nation like England. Your wasting time with this one.
This game is absolutely horrible. It's boring... it's impossible to figure out what to do... the tutorial lacks anything resembling tutoring...  This is one of the worst games that I have ever played. It is way to complicated to and micromanagey to try and learn and I love Europa Univiralis (spelling?).  And to top it offSteam/Valve will not refund you purchase for this game. Sobuy at your own risk.... this was a waste of time and money.
lmao this game is for nerds get cod ghosts insted it is good it has guns and brown people that arent islam
One of the most boring games i've ever played.
too slow to paly hated it
My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to himIf you ever want to see your grandchildren graduateyou have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28
This Game Sucks!!!!!!
how can i write a review when i dont have this game rettards
A summary of my first experience of this gameFirst character unites most of Ireland then dies and leaves a genius of a son behind to finish the job and become king of Ireland. Then out of nowhere his scarredmentally challenged brother returns from his marriage in France to kill the king and seat himself on the throne
It will ruin all other games for you but its worth it
Truly amazing game! Takes some commitment to get intoas it is very complexbut having spent more than 100 hours playing
Greatest medieval RPG/simulator ever. Stronghold comes close but lacks content
CK 2 is my first grand strategy game. The following is my impression as a new-comer. CK 2 is a sandbox strategy game setting in Medieval Europe. First it might seem very daunting because of the interface and overwhelming information. After a few hours you will start appreciate this masterpiece of strategy games. You might spend many teeth-grinding hours planningand the unpreditable death of your leader turns your whole plan into a pile of manure. The fickle nature of this sandbox game trully engages strategy game loversand keep me on my toes. Crusader King 2 definitely brings stategy game into another level and makes itself stand-out from other conventional strategy games.
ITs a beast of a game. simple enough.
The first time I played this gamemy son wanted to assassinate methe land was wrought with smallpox
I lived a very quiet life as a simple man. I owned three territories and had 1 vassel. It was a good life. My first childAngelI named her because I was going through tuff times when she came. Then I had my other girl Emma
Very cool game!!
I haven't played this game very much. It takes some getting used to since I've put almost 75hrs in EU4. These games are great to play and very fun. They also have a good amount of challenge!
Nice game!
This is a fun game that will give hours of fun. It gives a unique style of warfare compared to the standard standing armies in other parodox gamesand an interesting dynastic dynamic.
My Grandparents are older than my parents  11/10
You have probably heard by now that Crusader Kings II is a 'sleeper' hit. Know what that means? That means a game nobody cared about while it was being developed but which caught on because it was just that good. That starts with a good engine and Paradox's Clausewitz 2 engine is about the best strategy game system available. When you add to that content...reamsjust obnoxious great gobs of content which Paradox still produces for this game 2 years after its initial releaseCKII is a no-brainer. Buy it. Buy the complete edition with gobs of extra fun stuff. Get in there and rule.
Started in the in 1066 H.R.Erebelled in 1068Formed Germany in 1090
Deep and powerful game. Would play again.
Spent a decade hunting downimprisoningand executing every last member of the family of a nobleman who had dared irritate me
One of the greatest games ever madeperiod.
I just could not get into this game but I shall keep trying...
One of the best games out herehighly recommendedmuch replay value
May very well be the best strategy game I have ever played in terms of just plain fun for a history nerd like me. Even if the multiplayer is tedious to get going it is exactly what you would want from multiplayer in a game of this genretaking away nothing from the singleplayer gameplay but simply adding more players to the mix. Fantastic and numerous dlcthis game is definently one of my all time favourites!
Clearly for serious stratagy to invest your time in.
I have played over 2000 hours of this game. I am still playing it. It's just that good.  There is no higher recommendation that I can give.
Pretty significant learning curve but if you can get into it it's a lot of fun. Massive time sink though and can get repetitive towards the end of a saved game.
Excellent gamejust my kind of game
This a satisfying and well balanced game that has a very good risk/reward quality to it. I recommend it to anyone who is looking to spend a good 8 - 10 hours a month with some high quality strategy.
Crusader Kings 2 or CK2/CKIIis a one of a kind game that you ust can't find elsewhere. It's fun and challenging. CK2 is also very expansive in that it's playability is very long ensuring you won't loose interest. Besideswhere else can I play as the glorious and powerful King Boris of House Draskovic of Croatia? 40 years and into the third ruler of the dynasty and already I've inhierited Leon and expanded into southern Italia and the Umayads of Espana. And yes
Keep going back to this game. Awsome.
fucking awfulmy life is ruinedit's all i want to do ever.
Yet another game in which I can pretend to be George.
Played over 700 Hours.......   Still counting
Initialy I was very sceptic about that game. As a great fan of Paradox games - especialy Hearts of Iron series I wasn't sure how combination of Grand Strategy with a bit of RPG will work. I was affraid that in game like that complex and time consuming planning and preparing future moves can be uselless just beacuse of random event...  But having some free time I downloaded demo version - and that's how my viev on Grand Strategies has changed. Since then I spent hundreds of hours playing Crusader Kings II and I can recommend it to anyone - doesn't matter if you need long complex startegy game or just looking for some fun - I think that you will find in that game something you may like. Just give it some time.
Never before has a game inspired hatred for a medieval kingdom.  10/10 would curse Norway again.
cool game
Watching other people play this game is even more fun than playing it yourselfbut still really fun on your own!
My life is gone this game ate it.  Easily one of the best grand-scale RTS's there is. The game is full of warintrigueand
An absolutely stunningcomplex and historically accurate game by the masters of grand strategy Paradox Interactive.
It's a very complete gamei love itreally.It is pretty hard to handle the game at the start
Best incestmurderand holy war simulator around. 10/10
Don't let the time on this account fool youI've had this game for several yearsand this is by far one of the most entertaining strategy games you will ever play.  You will spend 100 hundred years plotting and planning
Very addictive and very fun 10/10
Killed more children than I'd like to admit to. 10/10
I forget about a prisoner for 58 years in my dungeons. One of my barons whose family was given lands thanks to the friendship of our forefathersimprisoned his wife for some 20 years on the ground that she was a suspected heretic. He still managed to make 6 children with her. The Pope was even more wicked than my later father so I had him killed and managed to place someone more of my liking in Rome. Two of my sons hated each other and almost spent some 30 years trying to kill the otherwith fire and blood. My fith wife
Okthis game is awesome and Paradox actually knows how to do DLCunlike Kalypso with Tropico 5. I will warn all new players that this does have a learning curve
This isn't a video gameits a drug. 10/10 would get addicted again
Incredibly fun gamehilarious out of context. Learning curve might be too steep for somebut it's worth it.
Became emperor of Byzantium. Murdered Orthodox Head of Church five times. Slept with cousin. Killed pregnant cousin.  11/10 Would kill again.
10/10 best pyscopath simulator
Incredible sequel to an incredible game. Everything I expected - a unique style of gameplay in which fascinating storiesdrama and emotional connection emerge seamlessly from the nature of play - even though your characters are produced by your whims and the RNGyou will love your charismatic heir to the throne and despise your scheming
With most great games you play them for a while and think they are amazing but finish them within hours. With Crusader Kings II they have taken RPG to a new levelby adding major and minor decisions your character could be a Norse pagan from India or a Zoroastrian from Kent. Although the DLCs may be rather pricyI can say easily that the major DLCs all add notable (and perhaps more importantly: every day) additions and improve and randomise your gameplay. The one thing that makes all Paradox Interative games and especially CKII great is that they have no true aims
Go from a lowly count in Frisia to being king of DenmarkLithuaniaPomerania
A thoroughly engaging game with great replay value. Always some interesting twists and turnsand is an interesting alternative to Europa Universalis.
Marries into the Byzantine EmpireNorwayDenmark in 1066 as Navaraa... finds out in 1200 you've inherited all of them.   10/10 would play again
If you ever wished that you lived in feudal timesafter playing Crusader Kings 2 you opinion will changebecause now you know
I'm very disappointed how this game runs under Linux and FullHD 15' display. The font is totally unreadable and icons so small that I can't properly see them. This game is not ready for 1920:1080 resolutionat all. I regret the purchase..
One of the better grand strategy games I have played. Tons of DLC. Nothng like plotting to assassinate your neighbor to claim their title!
My son hates me because I tried to murder his wife who was my lover because her stewardship was terrible and so was his. I diedhe took the throne and was promptly poisoned. I blame the wife.  10/10
Such an impressiveimmersive gamecapable of creating great stories.
Just awesome in all of the ways
Love itnothing as fun as killing your own children and plundering the coastal churches as a viking. Besides that beeing able to creating all of the known kingdoms and empires is amazing. Dont forget to marry out your daughtersgot to love that political power play.
Family was never so fun!
Began a game as the Emporer of The Latin Empiredie of illness 2 weeks later. 10/10
I wasted more time in this game than I could afford. Deeply engrossing.
Best wine poisoning simulator I've ever bought.  11/10 have every DLC ever
By farthis is my favorite game that I have on Steam. Controlling a dynasty along with all the intrigue that goes along with itis very enjoyable. Before
I've sunk far too many hours into this to give it anything but a positive reviewand I don't think I've even begun to scratch the surface of what's possible in the game. Tons of DLChundreds of different starting points
I love this game. Lots of variation and 'winning' can be whatever goal you set yourself. Right now I'm attempting to create the Empire of Scandinavia from the pagan roots of Finland.
CKII is a challenging but immersive strategy game that focuses on building your dynasty through a variety of means. Replayability is unlimited and once you get the hang of itCKII is very enjoyable.
Killing my brother for his kingdombut being found out and then getting killed in battle a week later by pesky peasants and then have all the kingdoms passed to my final brother in less than a month in game.  10/10 Would play again.
Quite intimidating at firstbut after you've mastered the steep learning curve you'll discover this game is amazing. You'll spend far too long searching for suitable matches for your children and equally as long trying to preserve your line in the best way possible.
Highly addictive. Great medieval simulator.
Great game
123.4 hours and counting. Seems about right. What I've done with that time:  Restarted 100 times. Determined that Ironman is a lot of fun until it's not fun and then FU. Lots of incest. Killed siblings. Parents. Uncles. Aunts. Peasants. Expelled the Jews (a few timesbut only if I owed them money). Converted to Judaism. Made Norway a Jewish nation. Spread the Viking Old Gods from the mediterranean to the Pacific. I may or may not have gone on a pilgrimage and then joined the crusades and determined that the Caliphate is not to be trifled with. Other thingsI forget. The only thing this game doesn't have is a gentle learning curve.
If you overcome the scary learning curveyou'll feel like the King in you Castle. Or the Emperor. Or Duke or Countif you like an even harder challenge.  This game is a perfect mixture of empire management with a side of economics
Phenomenal depth of strategy. But I want them to fix the export tool to make it compatible with EU again!
Didnt play the expansions but the game is legit
Hands down one of the best games I have ever played. If you want more of an accurate idea of how much I love this gameI have bought almost every DLC for CK2 and EU4 (made by the same company) and would continue to do so just to support them. I love these 2 games so much I would not care whether they were on sale or not. They deserve every penny they recieve on this game and all of it's DLC. I have easily dropped $100+ on this game and regret not a single penny of it.
Excellent game with a ton of replay value. While the game is good with just the base gamethe DLC adds a ton of content and is worth the price. This game does have a steep learning curvebut if you're willing to get over it
This game takes a good hour of reading to learnbut I cannot describe how ridiculously fun it is once you've done your homework. I'm not even very good at this gameand I enjoy it no end
I only have ab0ut 90 minutes of play time and my sister is trying to usurp my throne and and i had to tell my wife to stop supporting assassination plots from my brother. 11/10
This game is by far the best game I've ever played. It may not be for everyone since it has a steep learning curve and takes some determination to figure out. Once you do though its amazing. I've played for well over 1000 hours so far and I'm not bored of it yet. I highly recommend it.
If you like strategy gamesthis will eat your life. Buy it. Buy it nowtoday while it is on sale!
I became Emperor of the world. The game is more about people then the countries. Incredibly fun and addicting. Learning curve is harsh though. 500+ hours for me :] Try EU IV as well if you like CK II.
I....can't....stop....
Crusader Kings II' is a grand strategy game by Paradox Interactive and is one of the best in the genre (see also 'Europa Universalis IV').  Crusader Kings could be described as some kind of 'dynasty simulator'it effectively puts you in the shoes of a member of a family of your choice: EmperorKing
If you've ever wanted a Game of Thrones-like game based on intriguethis is the closest thing you'll get.
Learning curve is absolutely ridiculous. There is so much depth to this game it is unbelievable. The true king of all strategy games.
Amazing and complex game. If you like real hardcore strategy games you won't be disappointed by it.
Buy this game. Then Download the Game of Thrones mod. You will not regret it. But your girlfriendfriendsand family will. This game is so epic.
Crusader Kings II is fantasticalthough the amount of DLC and the cost of getting it all is not exactly ideal. If you enjoy medieval politics and throwing boatloads of guys at each otheryou will like this game.
I am sure this is doubtless a good gamebut it is not for everyone. On the plus sideunlike Hearts of Iron
Highly recommendedgreat strategy &amp gameplay.
One of my most played games. Both simple (for a Paradox game) and complex. Simply wonderful if you like large scale strategy.
Fantastic strategy game. I enjoy this much more than EUIVas this game has more RPG elementsin that you are looking to extend your personal dynasty rather than your impersonal country. The DLC is not necessary
Bit of a steep learning curve interface-wise early onbut a little perseverance and it is loads of fun - machinating your way to the top of the dynastic treean assassination here
Let me tell you a story of my time in Crusader Kings. So I'm playing this modded (simply because I want to raise my home-county to glory) in a mod that means that every county is independant. After a small amount of time I had become the King of Cornwall- ruling over CornwallDevon and Dorset. The next county on my radar is Somersetbut because their armies are stronger than mine- I'm not exactly very popular with my vassals- so I ask for help from my father-in-law
Along with Europa Universalis IV one of the best strategy games i've ever played.
Had an illegitimate daughter out of wedlock at the age of 16. Married a woman a year later. Found out that my wife had an affair with my illegitimate daughter. Arrested and executed them both.  10/10
Don't let the almost cliff-like learning curve put you off. Once you get the hang of itit's quite engrossingespecially once you start delving into the murkier areas of plots
Great game1/10 would buy again.
Like most peopleI play games to relax. I've now realised that having a three-year-old child killed so that you inherit their duchy is very relaxing.
THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!
Had the perfect king to rule.  He died of poor health leaving his 2 year old son in charge.  3 civil wars erupted at the same time.  Muslim Caliph declares a Jihad for my kingdom. 10/10
SImiliar to EU3 but with 110% more inbreeding.
I've played this game through bloodsweatand tears. It's like being stuck in a relationship
Played this game a little bit. It was cool
Saw the Byzanthine Emperor fall in love with himself and give himself a good tumble   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=247178625   10/10 Would sneak intoo own room to make love to self again.
I still haven't figured this game out completelybut it's been a lot of fun trying to figuring it out. If you want a strategy game with some depth it's worth checking it out.
Had this game in my library for about a year but thought it would be too much to get into. Boy was I wrong.  Now basically taking most of my gaming hoursand enjoying every GoT-style minute of it.
Good job I dont have children in real life otherwise they would be midgetsimbecilesdeformed
There is lots to do in this game and it is one you could spend hundreds of hours playing. You can play as a mighty king or a lowley count and work your way up the hierarchy with scheming and warfare. Approval ratings of other characters to yours and eachother are interesting as you will need to ask your vassals or fellow nobles for help from time to time and its nice if they like you. If they don`t like you or worsecovet your title they could be plotting to assassinate you. If you hold a certain amount of land in a de jure title like irelandwales or a duchy you can create it and become its lord. This provides goals for you. For example i tried to become emperor of britannia by holing 80% of the british isle counties (little provinces that the world is divided into). War is rather simple as all you need are levies that you can force out of your counties population and a few good generals then send them at the enemy. However you do need a casus beli or something to justify your war which can be very hard to obtain. Diplomacy in this game consists of plots agains other characters
This is a wonderful game. Excellent depthcontinuing support from Paradox Interactiveand almost unlimited replayability. 10/10.
One of the best Paradox games every created  10/10
A whiz bang gamebut it's just an exercise in randomly generated experiences. Funbut there really is no strategy. You may pick the best of everything and then end up with an heir who lacks in... well everything. Still
Lunatic king passed a law declaring all forms of violence illegalgot assassinated. 10/10 would recommend
epic grand strategy gameperfect for passing time
Family murdering simulator.  10/10
Crashes a lotbut being king of Ireland sure is fun.
This game is amazing and don't let the DLC scare you away.  Vanilla brings hundreds maybe thousands hours of gameplayand with all the DLC it brings you up even higher.  It was only 4 people making it full time and right now only 1 person is maintaining and making DLC full time. They sometimes bring in other people to work on small things but mostly on 1 person at a time works on it. That is why there is a lot of DLC. Just that it's almost 3 years old and new content is still getting pushed out is a sign that this game is worth the price.  I definitely recommend this to any RPG and/or strategy fans. If you don't want to fight warsthen don't. If you want to be a tyrant then do it. Possibilities are endless.
It is the first gamewere my character has appointed his horse as chancellor.   Hoping my old but good regent suffering from lunacy will soon diein order to let his ill son inherit before he die in order to pass the kingdom on to his oldest daughter with some wonderfull stats  One of the best games
This game is really a lot of fun if you are a European history buff. The amount of data and detail is pretty impressive. It is also probably one of the least complicated Paradox titles out there.   Keeping in mind that this isn't really a 'conquer the world' type of gamebut rather a game where the goal is to spread your dynastydon't be too disappointed when the size of your realm ebbs and flows throughout a whole game as long as your bloodline is still spreading.  There is an incredible amount of DLCs and some really good expansions as well. Unfortunately
The game requires a considerable amount of time investment and a plan. It's very difficult to get into but it's extremely rewarding. I've logged over 350 hours on this and I find it phenominaleverything about it is very well doneit's immersive and there is quite a lot of strategy. Some plans take over a century to hatch. I know there's a lot of jokes about incest and murder and that can definitely happen
It's great.
RightCrusader Kings 2. This game is a masterpiece of a grand strategy sandbox. You play as the head of a medieval dynsastyand must guide your family over the centuries towards prosperity and glorly. I will attempt to describe the game without going into the complex game mechanics
EA parked a truck full of cash in my garden so this is a good game.
Awesome gamevery very complex but its fun. I still don't understand anything
Great game :)
Not a lot of time spent but I love it!
Very good and modabble gamevery enjoyable. And with Way of Life DLC it is basicaly Incest Simulator 2014!
Best children killer simulator 2014 10/10 would kill again
The King of Britian's firstborn son was already marriedso I had to settle with marrying my daughter off to his secondborn. Assassinated his firstborn with a manure bombbut a drunken priest who was in on the plan revealed my name. No one did anything
Definitely one of the best gameever.
Best medieval European nobility incest and patricide simulator ever made.
As i write this reviewI've had the game maybe about a week and a I've already put 30 hours into it. It is completely absorbing. If you need fancy graphics to escape from realitythis is not your game. If you want depth
Awesome game. You get so much worth for your money.  Only downsides are: A single game takes very long (depending on how well you are doing ) So many optionsso many new DLC's. Just takes too much time to try everything out
The learning curve for CK2 is unforgivingand the tutorial isn't much help. Howeverwhen you get past that
Crusader Kings is an amazing and immersive RTS style strategy game that focuses on Lineage and not combat. I found the game extremely challangingdetailedfun
I love this game. That being saidParadox needs to stop being a bunch of greedy suits. The amount of DLC that should be included in the vanilla version or at least the expansions is deplorable. It's constant money grabbingand it's honestly way overpriced content. The game is very lacking in the graphical department (However still amazing) as are it's DLC packs consequently. $174.99 regular price for the game and all the content? That's flipping ridiculous! I know this isn't the only game to do it and some cost even more
Literally endless possibilitiesexcellent replay value. If you're on the fence about this gamejust buy it
Want to fight off hordes and hordes of pagan warriors? Check. Wanna be a dwarf who impales things in his spare time? Check. Want a pet dog? Check. Wanna collect concubines from all over the world in a mad quest to make the eight? Or twelve? Or thirty-nine? Or however many kingdoms were randomized across your unique world through its own trip through medieval time? Then this mightiest of mighty games is for you.
Fantastic game. Immersive. Easy to lose hours at a time. Your spouse will be angry. Your kids won't understand. But you will have fun.
I've had this game for years and I'm constantly coming back to it. Every playthrough is different. I've tried the Game of Thrones mod and it's fantastic as well!
I've had to uninstall this game several times now since it ends up being the only thing I do. I am huge fan of sim games with well tuned micro managment andwhile this game was overwhelming at first onceonce I got the hang of it I could not stop playing. You can role play or strategize as much as you want
Deceptively complex and as addicting as Civilization 5 for methis was my first entry into Paradox games. The most difficult task upon starting the game was figuring out all of the menus. There are layers upon layers of complexity buried into the micromanagement you can wield over your domain. If you really want to know how to game the system you should talk to Iron.   If you have any inclination to play simulation type games be prepared to lose a weekend because there's no clear stopping points or friendly reminders to take a break and look at the clock.
moral ambiguity personified
My favorite game to datei have about 900 hours [ayed pf CK2 and i assue you it is a very good game. Includes lots of indepth medievil role playing and the enjoyable ablity to change history for the better. You can play as any nation in the game to a certian extent. The only downside is if you want to get the full game then you will want to get quite a few dlcs (Allthough reasonably priced). I would highly recommend people to get this game if they are into medievil stratergy or roleplaying!
74 hous inand have started getting used to the game mechanics.  Managed to found the Hispanic Empirewhich spread all the way to Poland. Would expand again.
Best and most realistic incest simulator on the market  10/10 would buy again
1. Make rediculous ruler 2. start as small duchy with only one province 3. grow large 4. best king dies 4. sons a fuckfuck 5. open rebellion 6. kill everyone 7??? 8profit   10/10 would murder everybody again
The tutorial has too much reading for me to play this gameim definitely missing out though.
An absolute no-brainer for all history and strategy fans ! While most strategy and grand strategy games give you the opportunity to 'incarnate' a countryor a god-like almighty commanderin this one you are a dynasty
I played this game for six hours and all I can figure is I am too stupid for it. I played through the tutorialscanned the wiki pageset it to easy and chose an easy kingdom. I got destroyed and I have no clue why. The learning curve on this game is really steep. Only play if you are smart... and I mean really smart.
SoAs King of England I did not want my kingdom to be split between my heirs due to being unable to change my succession laws. So I imprisoned my 5 year old son and then executed him leaving me only one heirnow when I die I get to keep my whole kingdom. I Love this game! It's like Total war but with more strategy and less battles. Perfec t10/10
This is the best game I have played in a long time.  First of alla bit about meso you have a perspective. I am 32. Long time gamer. Started with Commodore 64 during pre-teens
Decent game. Haven't really gotten into it yet.
In shortan excellent game for lovers of grand strategy. I have no gripes whatsoever with the large amount of available DLC since even without itCrusader Kings II provides hundreds of hours of gameplay with the DLC vastly complimenting this just when you think you've worn the game out. I still haven't even touched The Republic or the Rajas of India because I've not felt the need to yet! Though I'm sure those expansions are perfectly worth the price since Paradox always delivers top notch content in every available form. Even the unit packs are a nice touch for a cheap price. I'd recommend this game to anyone who claims to be a lover of strategy or history.  10/10 from me.
One of my favorite games. It's a very difficult game to pickupand once you do it is a very slow gamebut totally worth it if you like it. I think of it something like Civ on steroids. Best part is that it is much more focused on people rather than countires like it's sister historical simulator Europa Universalis. Overall it's a very slow and methodical game
great game. I would recommend this game to anyone!
It's pretty rare that I ever religiously play a new game because I am enjoying it so much and even more rare that I actually pay for DLCs (especially cosmetic ones). I'm far from a completionist and will typically buy a game I really enjoy like Shadow of Mordorplay for 15 hoursnever beat it
I got a fuck daughter from my other fuck daughter whose mother was my sister. then I married my son to my smallest fuck daughter to marry my son all as a french king. They started to call me the Holy.  11/10 would incest again
Great game - machiavellian in its toneand wars are not to be rushed into. I really enjoyed the Game of Thrones modtoo!
one of the best games ever so much fun
If you like mapsthis is for you.
Do you enjoy having a social life? So did Iuntil I played this game. If you enjoy deep strategy and feel that your social ties have become a bit too pressingbuy this game
I been playing these game practically for hours sense i got it. i been playing for so long that i forgot what day it is! Haha...Get these game its Seriously Great it satisfy People alot of you want a good rpg Strategy game and if you want to play something new
A simply amazing game. Probably the most accessible Paradox titleCK2 comes from a totally differentpersonal perspective by making you the head of a family rather than the head of a nation. As much as I love Paradox games
Had some cousins in the Byzantine Empire Worried about them pressing more of my cousins claims and taking more of my land Killed off all my cousins in the Byzantine Empire Found out that I didn't need to kill them in the end  10/10 would wrongly plot (and succeed) to kill their cousins again
weekly reports from my spymaster of another member of my court wanting to kill him.... lived to be 57  10/10
Became the greatest knight in Christendomson was the Devil's Child Seriously an amazing gamenot only teaches history but strategy
Lots of depth and replayability. Definitely recommend it if you've enjoyed other grand strategy games by Paradox or if you're interested in the history of the middle ages.
My son was awesome til I saw he was gay. Still gave me a grandson to keep the blood line going.Had spy master that was amazing and turn on meHad an empire and after I died it broke apart.I have to say for a game looking at a map and numbers this is amazingfun and just time consuming. I'm trying to get all the dlc so far what I've gotten enjoying
Created the Kingdom of Taurica with 'peasant leader' count of Lower Dniepr (after the maghyars left)reformed Tengri religion and adopt feudalism with his heir.  PS: I'm sorry about my Englishbecause I am not a native speaker.
Absolutely stupendous for players who love historystrategyand/or intriuge.
Love it! If you ever wanted a CIVot Total War with a deeper sense of human relations and diplomacy this is your game! It is incredibly deep allowing for forging of friendships and alliances and of course military conquest.
It look a little time to learn the basics and not get run over not long after the game startedbut once you have an idea of what you are doingit is hard to put this game down.
I got a general who got every single sin before being posessedgetting the voice of satan and having a dream of jesus teaching him some mean military strats. 10/10
Good game. Interesting to play. 9.5/10
Was a count in France. Wanted to own France. Killed my brother so my mother could take over as dutchess. Killed my mother so I could take over as duke. Married my son off to the king's daughter. King isn't popular. Removed kingmy son is king. I am king. I am France.
Excellent gamewith an incredibly detailed politcal involvement great strategy game.
You can just lose yourself in this game so much things to do and the mods for it are amazing! I reccomend the Game of Thrones mod as well
After you learn to playits basicly crack. to help you learn how to play itwatch Quill18 play this game.
Its a great game! Although very complex like Paradox's similar titles. If you are really into medieval timesget it! In additionits super fun when your around your friends and having a good ol time with it. I seriously reccommend this game
In case it isn't obvious from the number of hours I've playedI really like this game. A big part of this is the politics side of nation building. For exampleyou can't just declare war without a reason and people won't like it when you do. War is there but not in the depth of something like the Total War series. There is also a lot of court intrigue that it pays to keep an eye on or your continent spanning empire will crumble into civil war and other nations will snap up your provinces. Paradox do s a great job supporting the game with heaps of free content
My crazy Norwegian king was strolling through his kingdom on one fine evening and came across an old forgotten village whos inhabitants worshiped the old ones. He chose to believe them and join in their ancient rituals and incantations. It all led to him saving the world becoming a godslayer and being found naked and half-drowned on the beach.     11/10 Amazing game!
very good game far better than i was expecting is a must buy
Fighting and shagging. Haven't seen so much back-stabbing since Julius Ceasar.
In shortawesome.
There's some stuff that I'm not overly thrilled about with the new patches- vassle limits are the big one- but overall I love this game. I think that the sheer amount of time that I've given to this gamealong with money tells what I thinkbut if you need it writen out
Totally worth the money! If you don't like politics or complex gameswellthis is not your game. But if you like intrigue and you know that war is fought not just on the battlefields
Play this game. It's super addictiveunless you have ADHD.
Awesome grand strategy set in the medieval period from 1066 where you can play as Duke William of Normandy and invade England through to 1453 and the end of the 100 year war. The game sees you take on the role of a dynasty ranging from a small count in control of a county through Dukes and upto Kings and even being proclaimed emperor of a lage empire should you be victourios and conquer large swaths of land. Your job is to make important decisions as said ruler which either improve your charaters personal traits or leave a dark stain on yoru hounor and prestige. The decisions involve arranging marriageschoosing who educates your children and future heirsForging false claims on other realms and titles to expand youe empire
Played for about an hour... then watched a few youtube tutorialsand I still have no idea what I'm doing... in the tutorial of the game. The tutorial is not at all helpfuland the learning curve is really steep. I have a feeling I would like this game
Had a genius daughter as the heir she died and my 'slow' son became king 10/10 awesome
I can generally jump into any strategy game and pick up on it after a few errors. I fully enjoyed all of the KOEI series games and SSI from back in my youth and more recent the CIV/Colozination games. This game however is not that case. It looks interestingthe reviews praise it but I just cant get into it or find the &ltend turn button to see how the game/map evolves. I am thankful that I didnt pay full price and didnt buy in advance the DLCs for it. It reminds me of a game from my youth that had 300 pages to read like a sim to play. I could read a manualIve tried the tutorial but I felt it was vague in places as well.
Really good and I find myself thinking about it even more than I've played it. It also helped spark a revived interest in history (which was supplemented nicely by listening to the Hardcore History podcast).  Don't worry about the cost or whether it's on sale or not - if you like the game at allyou will spend dozens or hundreds of hours on itso the initial cost will be nothing compared to your time cost.
FineEXTREMELY detailed game. The learning curve is massive. If you're a casual grand strategy gamer (perhaps an oxymoronbut I digress)
I love this game. This is a unique perspective to a game. Instead of most games where you follow the perspective of a nationclan - or some other large sprawling entityyou following the perspective of your -dynasty-. This game focuses on the process of building your family name through bearing children
Simply marvelous! You will discover new mechanics and details every time you play. Are you a female ruler and want to add a new duchy to your lands? Among other possebilities you can seduce the popeyes the popeand when he is your lover
If you're looking for grand real time pausable stratagy game then look no further. In fact if you're looking for a stratagy game then look no futher. In fact if you're looking to waste large quantities of your life then look no further. By far the most immersive and enjoyable of Paradox's games. The mixture of role playing with empire forging is a winning combination. The intrigue is fascinating in no other game do you murder your heir to make way for your other son just for him to be assassinated by his wife a week later. This added to Paradox's expertise in creating games based around conquering and war has created a unique game which just has to be picked up by anyone with a passing interest in the stratagy genre.
PROS: +In depth diplomacy and family/dynasty management make for an incredibly deep game +A true grand strategy game that spans across generations  CONS: -Expansion can be tedious -Combat has limited depth  HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR THE STRATEGISTS OUT THERE!!  As for the Total War fansit depends on the aspect(s) of total war you enjoy. Myselfthis game is everything that Total War has been missing. I couldn't imagine if this game had the depth of combat that Total War presents with the intrigue
So I was a VERY rich and powerful duke in southern England. Holding 2 duke titles. I had married my brother into the royal family giving him a strong claim to the throne. I thought this might come in handy some day but that flame burned out when he got an STD and died. So anywayone day the King (He was a bit of a fuck this one) stole one of my titles as duke which really fuck?? me off. So I took a stand and declared the king a tyrant. I raised my troops to war in the name of my nephew as he inherited a claim from his father. With my money paying for many mercenarys and my personal troops we won the war within 3 years and my now 10 year old nephew became king and I managed to get my title back. All was swell for 6 years until my nephew went a bit crazy. he beheaded Duke York which started a rebellion. I went and raised mercenarys again and my own troops but was crushed in battle by a vast horde of York men. In battle I was captured and put into jail. Without my help my nephew was defeatedjailed and executed. With an heir born of incest my legacy was doomed. I later died in prison.  I'd really recommend this game but one small fuck up
One of the most addictive games i've played in a long time. Can't stop playing!!
Over 100 hours inI've still just scratched the surface of this game. The 'one more turn' addictive quality of Civ has kept me up far too late more times than I can count. This is my desert island gameeasily.
Great game
Excellent gamehours of Game play to be had and endless opportunities for some epic mods. 10 out of 10
Decent game just be prepare to learnsuffer and sit through some fuckt - just like real life.  10/10 realism FTW
wish you could change clothes. everything else is a++
Good gamecomplex game-play.
The game is rather involved and hard to learnbut enjoyable to play. So many different possibilities means that it doesn't get boring.
I had to think a while on how to start this review. Ultimately on how to compare it to other games. I think the closest it relates to are these bullriding games on fairs and in amusement parks. It is not a matter if it kicks you of its back. But when.  Crusader Kings lets you assume a role as a feudal or tribal lordking or even emperor from medival europeafrica or india. You can play christians
10/10  A real time strategy game that triggers 'one-more-turn' syndrome.  As far as I am concernedthis is the very best grand strategy by Paradox. It is diversereplayable and accessible - you don't have to be seasoned veteran of grand strategies to enjoy this masterpiece
This is a great game for people who enjoy strategy games.
The best incest/murder/GameofThrones simuletor there is.    This game has all that is needed to fulfill your megalomaniacal desireswith all dlc you can raid as a viking in all the capitals of europeto conquering the world as a muslim calipht
It will enable you to answer questions in history and geography with a kind of knowledge that lesser mortal beings will never be able to achive.  10/10
Fanstastic grand strategy gamemore into politics than most games which is nice. I hope you enjoy all your fuckfuck gay cousins starting wars and getting all your troops killed.
This game might throw a plague at the wrong time or make the Holy Roman Empire declare war on you right after a crusade but that is what makes this game funif you have a friend or multiple to play with then it is even better i have a few minor complaints like you cant just declare war and win you actually need a Reason but i guess thats for the interest of not having the entire map under a single banner.
I would love to recommend this... Just because it's Paradox Interactive's game. The historical accuracy and especially the complexity of this game are completely above any understandable levels but noDO NOT  touch this scam.  The core game costs something like 20 currently and definitely isn't worth any more than that.  Want to play as a muslim country?  BUY A DLC $$$  Want to play as a republic?  BUY A DLC $$$  Want to play as a theocratic state?  BUY A DLC $$$  Want to play as a tribal country?  BUY A DLC $$$  Want to play as an orthodox country?  BUY A DLC $$$   Want to actually have any of the content   WHICH ALREADY IS IN THE GAME     un-fuckING-locked!?? BUY A fuckEN DLC!!!    That leaves about 4 different large countries and their fuck?? governmental hierarchy to play as if you don't buy the DLCs.  If you still really want to play this and maybe already own the game and only a couple of DLCs but you'd like to have the rest of them (obviously to unlock the content)buy a bundle with all the DLCs and the game
Hi  I dont know what to say about this game.  I made lovei have babiesI have heirs
Great game that has so much replayablitly.
After yearsit's still interestingaddictive
A highly Complex game that can help you learn European Warfare and Diplomacy throughout the famous Medieval Era. With Religion to Marriage changing your allies and calls to warthere is never a moment to rest in the adenture howeverat times it does seem to move a bit slow. There is a big difficulty of learning how to play the game. I've logged over 20 hours on this game and I pretty much dont know a lot. And the tutorial doesnt really help that much
Start out as great Makedonian Byzantine emperor. Expand the empire and try to bring it to its former glory. Succeeding. Get 'the Lionheart' on the end of my name. Die peacefully leaving the empire rich and glorious. Son comes along. Everyone hates him. Constant rebellions. Constant war. fuck. All vassals vote my heir to be this fuck from the east. Die. Family gets fuck?? on and demoted to 3 counts. Rebel and fight til you are utterly destroyed. Heartbreak/10
This is the best game ever!! I invested a lot of time in this game and still didn't do all that's possible. I can recommend it to everyone who's interested in an strategy Game that is really complex.
If you're a fan of 'Game of Thrones'The Borgias'Rome'
YOU WANT THIS GAME! IT SHALL RULE YOUR VERY SOUL! Building a realn to rule everyone has never been so easy!
This is a very fun game! But there is an issue with the age of vikings dlc. every time I am one of the viking lords in england the game crashes...
Want to conquer the world? Wellyou canat least a portion of it. Start as a count
it is a good game but becaus of the steam community bacht i am going to not recommend but it is the e best
good for fans of staring at a map for hours
If you like Grand Strategy gamesthen this is how to do it properly. This game is an immense Medieval Political strategy game - sounds terribleI know
One of the best games I've ever had the pleasure to play. A classic for generations to come.
I tried to seduce my half-sister. When she spurned meI made her fall off a balcony. 100/100 metacritic.
Intricateaddictive gameplay with just enough paced rewards to keep you playing for hour on end. One of the few Real Time with Pause games that have given me the 'Just one more turn' syndrome I associate with CivHoMM
Do you enjoy ensuring the sumpremacy of your family throughout EuropeNorthern Africathe Middle-East
The most awsome game in the history of games. I already gamed upto 3.000 hours and thus saw a lot of gameplay. I also bougt all DLC because they are worth the money.   If you get passed the first experiencewich is mostly boring and backstabbing. It is the best gaming experience ever!
played as a countdie in an instant. good thing.
Cautiously recommended. Like other Paradox titles it's big and complexbut does reward persistence. If never done a Paradox grand strategy title I suggest getting Hearts of Iron 2 or EU3 first to see if you like it. Both oldfinished and fairly cheap
Every new expansion pack brings fresh opportunities for moral degeneracy. I spent almost 600 hours staring at a map. Sometimes I color the map. Sometimes the map explodes into different colors and I get really angry. I killed my newborn because he was a threat to my firstborn. I imprisoned a vassalremoved his eyesimprisoned him again
it only took my 8 hrs in this gamewhich has probably the biggest learning curve ive ever seento figure out how to start
Fought with a guy all my life and then died when he finally got to press his claim. Gay son with a club foot is ruling well in my place. 10/10 would behave incestuously again.
Fantastic gamedevs had made the best strategic game ever ! Better than Europa Universalis III and IVwith a lot of incredible DLC. Thanks !
Just bought this yesterday. Absolutely amazing.  I named my daughter after my girlfriend. When she came of ageI accidentally married her (matrilineal succession) to a hunchback. Real-life gf got so fuck?? when in-game her started having little hunchback babies. Eventually I had the hunchback husband assassinatedjust before the Vikings and Muslims of Spain double-teamed me into oblivion.  10/10
44844would be usurped by my uncle who happens to be the Orthodox Patriarch and executed in prison again.
50 hours and still on the first dynasty...steep learning curve but lots of fun.
For some people there may not be enough action and things may progress slowlyhowever it makes up for that in it's deep character development and politics. You can quite literally go from being a count in some dust-off county to being the savior of the worldor the Anti-Christ
Stick with itread some tutorials and you reap the rewards. This is the game I've probably played most in my lifeit has a huge scope and is incredibly fun.
Loving it.
Marry blood relativeskill close relatives.  This game has it alL! 10/10 would kill my brother again.
This is a great Paradox game. If you're looking for something more casual than Europa or Victoria this is the game to play. It's still a great grand strategy with tons of fun political based gameplay yet it retains the Paradox Grand Strategy style with massive wars and the importance of global politics.
i really don't know why people are so obessed by this gameit's boring and unbearably slow paced.
Crusader Kings II is an engrossing game with a steep learning curve. Howeveronce you get the hang of itthe game is well though out and no game plays the exact same way.
Very indepth gamepretty revolutionary very fun to play. MANY glitches and with Ironman mode these are permanent game destroyers.
Great game that provides all the intrigue of Game of Thrones while providing the pace of... a reading of Game of Thrones. Its hard to explain a strategy game centered around character development without calling it an RPG--which Crusader Kings is notbut you can't help but feel like you're playing a novelized RPG. This game is not for those who want a quick 30-minute fixbut rather those who have hours at a time that they need to blow.
Rule your land. Tax your subjects into space. Marry your relatives. Murder your rivals in their cribs. Paint the map in your favorite color. Bribe the Pope. Imprison your brothers. Pilliage the english. Go on a tiger hunt. Tumble Charlemange. Found the Lords of the Sky. Declare pants illegal. Conquer Russia. Grant Russia indepencence. Conquer somewhere warm. Convert the heathens. Imprison and sacrifice pesky missionaries. Get military advice from Jesus. Explode inns with manure bombs. Ohand I guess you could go on a crusade or two if you're into that kind of thing.
Incredibly detailed and thorough. Took me a month to get through a full game because I can't avoid trying to min max everything. Definitely a 'whoahow did it become 3am' type game. Combat is a little opaquebut the real game is in the relationships
WARNING: THIS GAME IS HIGHLY ADDICTING AND WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE AROUND!!!
One of the best games I've ever played. I refuse to stop playingever!
Idk what the fuck is going on
It will steal weeks of your lifein a good way.  very in depth strategy that only get's more detailed with each expansion giving you different factions/government types/era's etc  probably not much more DLC left to comeso a great time to try and grab it as a bundle with everything included
I really want to play this more... but my life takes too long!
The most detailed and complicated grand strategy games I have played. Freakishly attictive once you learn how to play it. Paradox once again show that they know what they're doing with games like these. Kind of a medival version of the Hearts of Iron gamesbut the diplomatic system is considerably richer and more diverse.  + There is a game of thrones modand it's really well done
if you like politicsdirty politics (like sneaky killing your brother becouse he may be a threator your hair becouse he is fuckfuck) and expanding your realm from a county to a empire
I have played computer games for close to 30 years by now and this may be my favorite game of all time. The combination of grand strategy with RPG elements and the constant development of new content from Paradox makes this very replayable.   If you are at all into true strategy games then this is a 'must play'.   Two words of caution though:  1. This is a time sink to a degree that can only be compared with Football Manager.  2. If you are unfamiliar with Paradox games then prepare for a steep learning curve. But hang on! You will love this gameI promise you.
Fantastic grand strategy game. Not for the faint of heart.
Very difficult to emphasize what a masterpiece this game is. If the Europa Universalis series is the ultimate in Empire micromanagement simulationsthen Crusader Kings 2 is the Role PlayingDynastic version
Great game!
Being very well read in medieval historyI was first intrigued by this game as it offered an immersive approach to feudal law and politics. While many rts type games allow city/empire building and detailed battefield controlCKII provides a rewarding experience from the necessity of developing and maintaining dynastic bloodlines.  The necessity of developing technology in order to unlock building progression helps maintain a realistic evolution of your demesne. And while many games allow attrition to become an achilles heel
Greatbut you must buy quite a few DLCs to make the game great
I like it the same way I like other Paradox grand strategy: I love history and immersing in its settingsthe same as I love a good fictional world. Running a dynasty is definitely an interesting perspective on medieval Europeand even though I just don't play it that much so far
Honestlyit's a very difficult game. I restart very oftendue to being killed off or destroyed. I can never seem to keep my vassals under control. I am always looking to kill someone for something. But I love it
hard to learnbut very fun when you get to know how to play
This game has a very steep learning curvebut ultimately is the best strategy game I've ever played. The mods available for it are super diverseand the Game of Thrones mod is insanely creative and fun in of itself. 10/10
I could write something really long about my conquest of Europe.  Or I could just tell you to buy the game
This game is a piece of art in a sea of games it stands out from all other's what will you choose that is up to you i like pie  9999999999999/10 would play again
Soso good. So goodin fact
Should be renamed incest and genocide simulator 10/10
steep learning curvebut ones you learn it can be a lot of fun
This is an absolutely fantastic game. If you love any sort of strategy games you'll find yourself immersed in this one. Combat isn't greatonce you're in battle you're helpless to affect the outcome. Other than that it's an amazing game.
This game is a lot of funexcpecially if you have a general interest in European/Middle Eastern/Indian history. The game is quite difficultbut hasn't been unpleasant to learn. I still feel like I'm finding my way
The game is interesting for those who enjoy intigue and plannng their next move five steps ahead. Its very close to real life and the trait/inheritance features add extra depth.
One of the best games i've ever played. 100/10
Great strategy gamethe only thing that's wrong with it is that the multiplayer is rather buggyplayers will unsync and the game will crash. Other than that it is the best strategy game I've ever played.  10/10
I have always felt like I was a decendant of a despot. Now I get to play one!
Currently the most enjoyable game I've had the pleasure of playing. At first there's a lot of trial and error involved. It can be difficult to get the whole feudal paradigm of medieval Europe. Normally in strategy games one is used to be some sort of an illicit and unseeable god-like creature making decisions and having the gameworld react to them in a hivemind fashion. This game really stands out because it actually places you as a locatablealmost real life character inside of a world full of other people that will react to you depending on your actionsstatus and traits. This simple novum ends up defining the entire gameplay in a very appealing and unique way
10/10 would incest again.
10/10 restored my noble heritage and made the scanadivian empire! GLory to Carl!
This game is truly epic. I have played for nearly 200 hours and I still havent beat the game(multiple replays!). I have managed to hold two Imperial titles thoughEmperor of Britannia and the Holy Roman Empire starting with one territory...  This game is truly unlike any other game I have played. When I am in the middle of a game and turn it off for the eveningI dream about it... It is unreal.  If you want to spend your nights conquering the world one territory at a time
I didn't think playing as a savage from the dark ages would be anything more than a noveltybut two hours later I had just sacked paris and gotten a huge prestige bonus from capturing a french princess as a sex slave. After making his way homemy character sacrified the Bishop of Notre Damn to Woden and spent his loot erecting a stone to brag about it.   So yeah
I can't say anything that hasn't already been saidJust buy this game if you like the sound of it.
Truly an amazing game. This game has a simple concept that is amplified by the challenges of maintaining an Empire. 10/10 would play forever.
The only game I prefer over civilizationtrully brilliant stuff.
Why can't I get off these boats
I have played only a tiny amountbut I am absolutely addicted. Build your dynastyplot against your competitors
Married a Byzantinian girl to my sonhad an affair with her. Son diedkilled my wife
great! my character is gay and don't have any son. so game over
Great game
My favorite game of all time. I've put a couple hundred hours into itinterupted only due to schooland even after the vanilla game had lost its luster for me
Crashes on Startup.
Great game
A good game and time consuming. (it took me a week to learn all it's basic optionsand I still frequently visit the wiki) I have nothing bad to sayexcept for the many DLC's
Hands downone of the best games I have played in 26 years of gaming.
Great Game
I turned to this game after my despair with the current SimCity. I had played the previous SimCity games for thousands of hours and looked forward to putting the same kind of time and attention in to the new game. As you may know SimCity was one of the worst disappointments in the history of gaming. I learned a good lesson about waiting to buy and reading reviews from itbut I digress. Though CK2 doesn't give you the same feeling of accomplishment as the old SimCitiesit does give you scale and complexity that you could never hope to surmount
CK2 is the best strategy game i've ever played. it is funcomplicated and very challenging. it can be a bit stressful sometimesbut that makes the game more fun because when you figure out a way to solve the problem. the tutorial is not that good if i were you i would just look for a video to teach you. Another problem i have with it is that paradox split's its dlc into smaller parts to make more money. Some of the dlcs are way over-priced so get those on a steam sale.
The game of games
With out a doubt one of the best games I have ever played on the PC.
One of the best role-playing grand strategy games around!
This game is without a doubt my favorite of all time. No game has ever everever! Brought this much emotion out of me in my life. I cried at the end of the gameand at the end of both DLC campaign add ons. The soundtrack is amazing
Great game as long as you're willing to put some time into learning and failing.
Probably one of the best game I ever played! (9/10)
Really good gamelove the intrigue
Incredible grand strategy game with an entirely unique approach. The downsideof courseis that it takes about 2 years to figure out how to play it. By the time you finally understand how to play
This game would be a masterpiece if they didn't cheap out of the combat system.  Who wins the fights? Whoever has more numbers. If the numbers are eventhen a terrain bonus may be in effect and decide the outcome. This sucks cause in history and other gamesyou can have an army outnumber 3 - 1 and still win with clever tactics and luck.  To summarize
Really great game and the mods add even more to it. The constant updates are mostly quality but ocassionally break the game or change the gameplay a little bit too much. Overall thoughexcellent
Went from Count to King of Ireland but character died too soon to change succession laws. Had too many children. Will murder brothers again for the throne.
Awesome strategy game!
An other win for Paradox Interactive...
Awesome. Like Crack
Great game.
Amazingin-depthawesome. Suffice to say that it is almost as much fun to 'lose' in this game than it is to 'win'.
Hours of playtimeso addictive. Helps to be a history nerd
Addictive game not quite a strategy game. You more or less steer a house thru the ages. Whether you end up as king or not is up to you.
Looked at the comments and seen how good the reviews we're which made me want to buy it. After getting it i attempted to start the game but it crashes with a runtime error anyone know how to sort this?
I just bought this game and i'm already loving it. The only bad thing about this game is that I didn't get it sooner!
Great game to lose many many many hours in.
I fucked my sistersired an incompetent mongoloid that brought ruin to my entire carefully-constructed dynasty after my liege diedand was never able to fully recover. 10/10
This is an excelent strategy game for those who want an experience that is totaly different from your conventional strategy title. Rather then taking control of a faction/nationyou take a more personal role as the head of a noble family and after you dieyou control your heir. So it really dosen't matter what happens to you politicaly
I've played a few Paradox games and I must saythis is a perfect starting game to get into their particular brand of Grand Strategy. Its slow pacedsimple
Simply fantastic. The feel of rising from a lowly countto a dukethen to king
The collection does not contain the full contenteitherway it looks like this game is nearly out of beta and could be ready for release in the near future with the grand epic master emperor edition digital deluxe 100% uncutted edition final release thnx for the $$
Really cool gameit used to crash a lot but i updated it and now it's fine.
please stop breaking your own gamethx.
I have played this game for over 1100 hoursI regret nothing. 10/10 would do again
If you like grand strategy games centered on intriguepoliticsdiplomacy and war. Then Paradox will not disappoint.
Best game I've ever played hands down. There were a few minor flaws in the game at launchbut the dev team releases patches and expansions so regularlythat the game is all but perfect now. Very difficult to get into at first
This game is great for in depth play. The game is most fun when playing with cheats for Casus Belli so that you can fight the wars you want without having to wait to develop the cause.
This game is an addiction.  There's the strategy element of trying to take over the world pinky that's done really well. Very classic Paradox strategy game there.   ...and then there's the for giggles element. Like trying to take the count of someplace in Backwateristan and turn them into a duke or gain enough guile and power to kill somebody off. It's that kind of scenario where things go bonkers. It's like the Sims Medieval edition with family trees that can go shooting off into some really weird directions. Infightingpoliticsheck even a portal to hell opens up. Why not?  This game has so much variety and open endedness it really is what you make of it.  However there is a STEEP learning curve to which I can only say 'Go watch some youtubers play it and it may inspire you' because the tutorial for me was basically useless and my first playthrough of the game ended in frustration after several hours of crapping out in the tutorial (that's what happens when you take a tutorial and add a random number generator to all the characters in it). Months later I came back to it and got hooked.  Highly recommend it
It's crack cocaine
Probably the best game I've played in decades.
Chiswick......fresh horses!
I felt like playing something different from my usual staple of games.  And after hearing a great many things about this CK i have it a try and bought it on a whim during the latest sale.  To say that I was regretting my purchase after a few minutes into the game would be an understatement.   But i pushed on tru those multitude of buttons info-screens and the assorted whatchamacallit. and discovered to my horror that I was actually having a blast playing a evil-fuck of a king.  ( till the Viking came and razed my little kingdom to the ground.)  Turns out alienating your close allies is not helping...much.  Anyway. I find myself really enjoying this gameeven though it is not my usual fare.  It is a clear recommendation on my part. And since paradox is periodically churning out great content i think this one here will last. Ohmust not forget to mention the huge Mod-Community. Which is awesome. With lost of content.   Would Evil again.
Started with an attempt to conquer Irelandas all the guides say to do. My ruler decided seduction was a great focusand screwed his way into every royal bedchamber in the north. Wife wasn't pleased
Favorite Paradox game to date. Mods expand games value far beyond the base game.
Gavelkind succession springs lotta randomness in to the game   the Rajas of India .. DLC _/\_
Awesome interface artvery well done
My son married the princess of a warring nation and they successfully plotted to assassinate me. 11/10
Bloody addicting
Only played the game a littleseems pretty cool.
sacked venice restored the roman empire fathered 20 children gave no fucks  10/10
This game is dope.
Not much can be said about Crusader Kingsat least not without conversation spiraling into hours and hours of fantalk. Because if you can stand Paradox and its grand strategiesyoull love Crusader Kings II. For good amount of people
Expel Jews Make money
If you want to mess with history play this.
So the first time I playeds thisI was like what? No Total War style battles? Lame. Never played it again. Seriouslywho can spend hundreds of hours on this?
This game requires a lot of patience and strategy. If you're a history fan and like strategy games then I would certainly recommend you check it out. It's also fun with mods such as Crusader Kings 2: A Game of Thrones.
I was staring at the world map for 20 minutes... dunno what to do... Uninstalled it... Will try again some other time when I am in mood... Wanted to love this gamebut it seems it will take time to get to know this game.
You can pull off a Jaime Lannister.  And there's a GoT mod too.
Was King Harald '' Hard Ruler '' Yngling of Norwaygot syphilisbecame a lunatic from fever
Started a game as a lowly count in Southern Germanyslowly building up territory and allies. I did some pretty bad things like murdering children that may be a nuisance to me and taking money from the Jews and then kicking them out of my land. Finally decided I wanted to be a King so went on a war campaign which I just about won at the cost of having most of Europe hate me. Had half of Western Europe under my control and was about to press my armies into France when I was attacked by Italy. It was only when I was in such a dire situation that I thought it would probably be better to just commit suicide that I realised I was literally Hitler.  10/10would Reich again
A decent gamethe main point of this game is the grand strategy and politics of the world. It is a RTS though honestly it seems like it would play out better in turn based fashion. Still it makes you think of the personalities of the different individuals involved and makes you appreciate the politics monarchs have to face.
10/10  Built a empire under the vice grip of a dynasty. Some russian dynasty came over to fuck them up and became new top dog. As i plan my returnsome armenian dynasty comes over and fucks them up and then a greek dynasty does them in. Then out of nowhere a dynasty that started out as a barany and now holds 4 kingdoms and is now the heir to the empire. At this point i say fuck it and just sit back and enjoy the show from holland.
Great in-depth character development and strategy on the ruling aspect
When the multiplayer works this game is great. The multiplayer often doesn't work.
Totally not for me
I recommend this game to anyone who really enjoys strategy gamesbut i warn youit can be complicated as a newer player and you should try to learn as you get through the game instead of giving up early
Best strategy game with loads off interesting history aspects. dramawarand lots off role play. be a king and do as a king or as a count and so on &lt3 love it ! in hoc signum vinces )
This is the most enjoyable strategy game I have ever played.  CKII is a real-time strategy game set in medieval europe. Most of the gameplay revolves around expanding your country through warsmanaging your vassalsand manipulating a wide array of random events influencing your family
At this momentI CANNOT recommend this game. Paradox has developed a nasty habit of releasing buggygame-crippling patches and DLCs for the last year.   The game is currently broken. The AI cannot declare war most of the time due to a bug introduced in the most recent patch on 17 Dec 2014. It is 7 Jan 2015
Another excellent grand strategy from Paradox. This one is a bit more RPG like and strives for more imersion into the actual lives of the Counts. KingsQueens and Emperors you play.  Can be annoyingly hardor maybe I just suck
doesnt actually work ...... i have the specs . this sort of problem shouldnt happen its only 2 years old
On my first attempt:  Wildly trying to increase my goldprestigeand piety (remarkably difficult)  Oldest son becomes a monk (unfortunately
What a strange and ridiculous game Crusader Kings 2 is. A fair warning right nowto anyone thinking about buying this gamejust be aware this is NOT a casual game. This game requires a lot of time put in to learn the mechanics and systems. You can and probably will make terrible mistakes
Great gamealthough very complex and with a lot of hidden things the game doesn't tell you.   1) Keeping your vassals liking you is what gets you taxesand lets you pass laws. Herego intruige boosting events such as
A delightfully realistic recreation of feudal dynasty-building.
If you could mix CivilizationThe Simsand Role play altogether it would be this game.  It is almost like a medieval simulator
A great gamebut a real time-suck. Perfect for what it is. Absolutely wonderful.
Although CK2 has a pretty steep learning curve (although not as bad as Europa Universalis IVI think)once you figure out what you're doing it sucks you in. It's the only game where I've turned to a friend and said
Allows you to ship Richard the Lionheart-sama with King-of-France-kun
Game ended when I went my wife died and my kingdom went full Muslimwtf. 10/10
-Played as Byzantium -Tried to crush the Muslims -Got rekt -Managed to capture the 6 year old heir to Abbasid -Got a option to castrate the boy  10/10 would castrate a 6 year old boy again
One of the best Strategy games I've ever played. Complete turns the whole empire builder concept on its head. A very different experience from anything else you've playedin a good way.
If you're reading this reviewthen you should buy this game.
DLC is also excellent and adds a lot of gameplayas well as depth.
One of the best games I have ever played
This is now my favorite stratergy game of all time. Highly reccomended!
At its core this game is a truly in depth and beautifully executed simulator of being an utter fuck to everyone and everything.

Can't beat this game. Its awesome. But every hour the game glitches and bugs out on me. No reason whyso very hard to play. Game gives a error and I am using Windows 7 Ultimate.
10/10 i can fuck my sister
First let me saythis looks like a great game and I reallyreally
Taught me how to kill infants and annoying people with cow dung. Best. Game. Ever.

King Wielislaw 'The Great' of Poland was pretty great he fought in the crusades helped stamped out paganism in christian europe brought peace and security to the Kingdom of Lithuania all his vassals loved him and he had peace and prosperity throughout the realm.  Then his son took over after his untimely death due to illness.  King Sulislaw 'The Bewitched' took the throne in Poland with his brother taking succession in Lithuania. This was not good for the man who practiced all 7 deadly sings regularly decided to become a sodomite shortly before taking the throne was receiving messages from god and actively practicing all known Catholic heresies regularly through his life. After crushing his brother under heel he decided to form the Wendish Empire taking the crowns of Lithuania Poland and Pomerania under his empire. He was a cruel man but a just man. He stomped out any known plots in his land and always released his prisoners from custody........only to give his dastardly spymaster some game to hunt by plotting to kill them later. Sulislaw was an evil terrible and cruel Emperor who nows has a claim on the Holy Roman Empire England and Scotland due to strategic marriages of his sisters. Unfortunately he died in bed before he decided to run roughshod over Europe. Did I mention he was a genius?   Pros of King Sulislaw: -Affairs with male Mayors Barons and Counts throughout the land -Messages from god -Told the pope to fuck off when he asked for too much money to atone for his sins -Ability to attack the Holy Roman Empire and England due to hereditary claims -Being a part of every Catholic heresy in existence at one time or another -Live til 62 years old  Cons of King Sulislaw: -He died  666/10 would sin again
Your heir is elected to rule the throne. Your heir inherits the throne. Your vassels join an independent faction. Yeah makes sense. Thanks paradox.
Simply the best game I have ever played in my entire life... I think
The game looks greathowever for whatever reason i load up the gameplay it for 10 minutes and it crashes. Every
I start a gamebecome a badass King of Ireland and then the developers release new DLC that changes the game in such awesome cool ways that I have to start again. Every time. 8/10  The soundtrack's a little repetative.
Hours of funplotting and conquest. Money well spent.
When I get boredI track down the remaining descendents of families who slighted me threefour generations ago and murder them. Usually I murder the children first
I enjoy the game but I cannot ever get my land owners to built upgrades on their own. I even tried a non-iron man used charinfoplay blah blah and gave each land owner $1
Only in this game you can become the fat and proud gay jewish King of the Irish. yes/10
Great gamelittle hard to master but once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy. My only complaints are I think the DLC's should be cheaper andit's difficult to raise money in game without cheats....
This is an amazing but difficult Grand Strategy game. The learning curve for all Paradox games is steepbut this is by far their best game so far. The first that I have ever played that makes it impossible to own the entire map without throwing in some gay mechanic.   The AI is superbthe grphics are nice enough to live with
A great game to let your imagination run wild in. I would recommend it wholeheartedly!

Is it worth the price? Look at the logged hours of positive reviews. Pretty sure that is a 'yes'.
I killed all my brothers to bring back all the titles my father heldonly to die soon after leaning on the balcony and falling off. 11/10
lost a war to a 6 year old 20 years later tried to imprison her 5 year old son. he escaped   10/10 will let it crush me again
Very excited about this game. Spent already 50+ hours leading the Ludowinger's to kingship of Pommerania...  Mainly I like this because I was not fully convinced about EU IV and this appears to do right what EU did wrong. If you hate Europa Universalis then this will not helpthough.  In comparison to EU: + less insane combat outcomes (or make that less complicated combat) + no fiddliness with military access rights + can meaningfully play as any level of small vassal + less impact of technology (made you fall behind in EU for lack of monarch points) + more interesting decisions regarding heirs + must work hard for alliances but can also break/disable them for others  I guess some players might be annoyed by having less combat (and less optimization for it) but more politics and securing proper marriages for your offspring.  At the moment this might be my most favorite game. (Also liked Civ 4Skyrim
Crusader Kings II was very good when it came out on the market. Then Paradox polished it and made it shine. Now it's probably one if not the best Gran-strategy game ever made!  Nowto compare it with Europa Universalis IVanother best Gran-strategy game
from what I have played it's fun who knew england owned denmark not me thats how I ended up marrying my sister and having inbred children luckily I died a few days later.  it's a fun game but I honestly did not know how to play it at all the tutorial helped to a degree but just playing the game you will pick stuff up.   I now run a Game of thrones mod and just love it I will marry the mother of dragons    one day
This is the best historical grand strategy game in existence. Truely a masterpiece.
Very good. Incest simulator. Win win. Must buy.
this game is fun but its hard to get use to the polticis
Hands down one of the best games I've ever played. It takes time to get a grasp on this game. After that this game is awesome. The expansions have made this game balanced and complex. So many sleepless nights because of this game. Just a little bit more...
Incestmarriagewar
Has a bit of a learning curvebut if there's a game to get you hooked on grand strategythis is it.
Played for half an hourjust getting into itand it crashes. Looks like it needs to be updated for Windows 8.1. Please do it soon
Where to start. The game is extremly addictive and very fun to play. It has got a steep learinig curve but once you know the game it should go swimmingly. Some of the infomation is a bit confusing and DLC is a big part of the game but it is definetly a must have for those who enjoy grand stratergy.
This game is one of the best of all timefor me. And i have to say for me because a lot of people are going to not like this game due to its immense detail lack of action and learning curve. If you like the grand stategy genre than this is the best and if you aren't sure this game is in depth look at my play time and i have not got any DLC
Great stuffI give this game 5 incestuous fuck babies out of five.
A medieval political simulater that is vastcomplexand loads of fun. Assassinations
A treacherousgreedy Catholic Patrician and Holy Roman Elector was teaching a class on Pope Innocent IIIknown heretic.   Before the class begins
Best game of recent memory for me. The amount of replayability and ways to play is staggering (the game of thrones mod is amazing)I have a hard time imaginging a future where I feel that I have played out this game. It took me a few hours of messing around to get a feel for this game and how it works but it was worth every bit of effort. The fun of this game to me isn't achieving a goal or 'winning'it is more the act of figuring out how to get there and adapting when things go wrong.
I can't get enough of this game
This is not a game. It looks like a game... you play it as you might do with a game... everyone else will tell you that it is a gamebut it isn't. This is a story generator. This is an interactive historical simulation that is not interested in making some sweet little balanced ride that paces itself to entertain you for a while before you eventually win.  It might be boring. It might be unfair. It might be complicated. It might make you unhappy. That's too bad. Wellcome to the reality of the middle ages. If you had been in a position of influence back in the days of yorewhat might have actually happened?  This game takes effort. Enjoy!
Excellent family murder and incest simulator
A game that just keeps getting better and better - One of the most immersive strategy games you will find
Really enjoy the gameeasy to mod.
The ultimate 'Murder your nephews and steal your brothers Kingdom and wife' simulator.
In a toss-up between the Europa Universalis series and this oneI would say that this one wins out a present. CKII is by far the most intricate and well-designed strategy game. If you like the cloak and dagger political intrigue of Game of Thronesyou will really like this game. The depth with which you can develop your dyanasty and each character within it is unparalelled in any strategy at present. There is still a lot of room for Paradox Interactive to develop interesting new expansions to this game and I it won't soon be swept under the rug like so many other strategy games are. The replayability of the game is what makes it so addictive. I keep coming back to it after each new strategy game I play and find that this one is the one that keeps me hooked. Try it! TRY IT!!!
You've changed the world. Christianity is over. The Viking Empirethe Great Fylkirate of the reformed Norse Faithhas long since sacked both Rome and Constantinople
Medeval grand strategy at it's best.  Still getting to grips with some of the games nuancesbut the complexity is a good thing! It allows myriad different routes to success!   Wether you want to be a merciless Viking plundering the rich from the frozen northa European noble fighting to carve out your dynasties slice of the world
So this game may have taken over my life and i'm still terrible at it
Absolutely Epic in scale and with nigh unlimited amounts of depth and replayability CK2 is the kind of game that can consume your life if you let it. It really captures that 'just one more turn' aspect that makes CIV games so successful but in a real time game. It definitely holds the spot of best strategy game in my steam libraryits difficult enough that a hardcore gamer can feel like he has truly earned each measly County in his patchwork empirebut still remains accessible to those unfamiliar with this style of game assuming you are willing to put in the hours.  However this game is not for the faint of heart
burning witchescleansing heresy and even retaking the Holy Land...this game got it all! 10/10
Great Game
Great game if you're interested in feudalism and politics. It needs a gold edition thoughsince the dlc is great but all together not worth $100+.
Very fun would recommend. Just wish there wasn't so much DLC and more of it was added to the base game.
I only had one county left before I would have had complete control over Ireland. But unfortunatelythe king of Scotland had other ideas. He got the Pope to excommunicate methen attacked me
Pushed off a cliff by my son. Died. Played as my killer.   10/10
Far too addictive.
This is a fantastic game! It can be pretty daunting to the new playerhoweverso I suggest watching some tutorials on youtube. The ingame tutorial isn't the best
Best chivalry game I've played to date44844
An excellent game with a very steep learning curve. It is unlike any other game I've played before or after purchasing. Also includes the excellent Game of Thrones Modand is the only game that can truly give scope to the scale of historical and fantasy epics.
played it a little bit. s'alright.
A must have if you want to play a game where there are no rules on how to rule and plenty of crowns to adore your head!
One of the most complete game when it comes to ruling a country or an empire. It is vast and complexbut when you get use to all the plotsrandom event
I never realized I liked looking at a maps so much.
Great game. Can not explain how awesome it is to be killed by my own family members to be setup as a puppet by my regent who then spends all the country's wealth on courtiers and blow.
So much fun. not kind to beginners though
Like Civ or Rome Total War without the combat. More enticing than it sounds.
Great game. If you like open-ended historical simulationsthis is the game for you. Don't expect amazing graphicsbut you will get amazing detail and nearly unlimited options. Every game is different. Don't forget to export your game into EU4.
Mixed Review - not for everyone. The key thing to understand is that this is more a *simulation* than a game. It is incredibly detailed and open ended. Your most likely problem starting a game will literally be having no idea what to do or what your options even really are.  I must confessI love complexity (I've a doctorate and read technical papers for fun)but the barrier of this game has been too high for me to do more than peruse its systems. It's incredibly dense and not organized for easy access.  That doesn't make it bad -- far from it -- it's quite impressive
I could go on about how killing innocent people(who just happened to threaten your power) is the biggest joy of this gamebut there's more to this game than that. While it takes a while to learn the basic mechanicsd and how to play (it wasn't until 30 hours in that I felt comfortable)once you do you will find one of the most detailed strategy games ever made. Every tiny bit of land in europe can be controlled and and built on
Good if you like history and looking at maps.
Started the gameappointed my councilfound a wife
My son assassinated my other son and in turn I assassinated him. Have no more sons  10/11
This game will eat hours of your day.
I was a duke in Italy. Then we were conquered by the king of Eastern France. Then we were re-conquered by Italy. Then we were conquered by Western France. Then we were Italy again. Then I WAS the king of France. 10/10
One of my favorite games but very hard to play with a little bit of time and effort game becomes very easy.
Crusader kings 2 wasn't something I was pumped up for at first. To me it was a more complex version of EU4that was before I played. The game is more centered around people as opposed to being centered around countries. The gameplay can be slowbut who cares when you can spend your time being a homicidal maniac killing people in the name of dynastic dominence! Some things can be very hard and annoying (like your heir becoming celibate or homosexual
Gives you a first hand experience as to what Europewest Asiathe Middle East
this game is more addicting than heroin filled nicotine donuts
F**k my daughter/mother/sister/cousins etc. You get the idea 12/10
An empire-building game more focused on dynasty than armiesCrusader Kings II is pretty great. But don't take my word for itwatch Idle Thumbs' amazing chronicle of a humble gardener swept up in the intrigue of much more powerful men:  https://www.idlethumbs.net/forums/topic/8766-crusader-kings-ii-the-triumph-of-ragnar/
Great gamegreat linux supportand great developer. Its nice to see stuff getting added to the game post release like this. If you like games like this (strategy
A very nice game who let you experience intrigues and plotting a like who take place in the medieval courts.  Do nothoweverlike their other titles focus too much on war
This is a good grand strategy game. You play as a countdukeking
This is easily my favorite game. Not my favotire seriesbut hold it side by side with any other game and this one wins out. Just wish I owned a computer that could run it. All 44 hours I have clocked in this game was using my friends computers.
Once you are over the initial learning curvethis is a fansastic game.
This game has consumed nearly 700 hours of my life and I regret nothing It could consume another 700 and i would still regret nothing what I'm saying is its either a really good game or i have a serious problem
It's worth it. Especially if you can get it while it is discounted!
Those of you who love grand strategy games - this is one you will want to play. Paradox Interactive has nailed it with CK2. Add on top of it some really good high profile usermade mods (A Game of Thrones) really makes this a standout product to have for your collection.
To sum up this game: ...and I thought MY family had problems. The intricate web of liesplotsmurders and warfare entertains for days
Great game!
Amazing game. CK2 isat it's corea grand strategy game. However
its a game about how you rule a kingdom managing your legacy and make sure that your heir which you will become later has a world where good rules if not make sure you have a big bloody army to defend your throne.Go crusadingreform Rometake over europe
This game is brilliant. Its a total war focused on the diplomatic battles rather than the actual melee conflicts. You'll find yourself giving up hour upon hour to it all in the cause of furthering your family's name and growing its empire. So many different starting points from religion to culture to rank as well as all the different events throughout the game it all indulges your imagination.
Trying to unite Ireland as a norwegian is hard XD
Absolutely love this gamemakes Civ look like childs play.
Addictive strategy game focused on dynasties and medieval religous wars. brilliantlike most paradox gamesneeds a bit of balancing tho to prevent steamrolling.
Crusader Kings II is a unique experience on a familiar style game. I loved Civ 5 and the Total War games but now CK2 has its own special place.  I highly recommend this game.
One of the best strategy games I've ever played
I never was a fan of turn-based strategy gamespreferring RTS'sbut I tried the 'run-pause' Paradox style in CKII and really
This game is crazy.  Started as an Irish Dukeit was all going well. I took 2 counties and was about to get the thirdthen I got maimed in battle and died aged 34. Luckily I had a 1 year old son to continue the bloodline
If you like incesteugenics and kinslayingthis is the game for you.
Civilization meets Game of Thrones.
THIS GAME AS A GRAND STRATEGY GAME IS TECHNICALLY FLAWLESSGIVE UP ON YOUR FAMILY AND LOVED ONES AND LET IT RULE YOU
I dream about attraction values and gifting gold in exchange for a relationship bonus. This medieval politics simulator has ruined my life.
I love games with an interactive story to themand this game delivers. While the game will start up with timed scenariossuch as the Mongol invasions or the the 1st Crusade
Dont get this game if you value your time. Can be complex to newcomers but once you know what you are doing you will find yourself with hours of replayability. Murderincesttorture and crusades are just a few of the things you may find yourself doing while trying to create yourself an empire.
Fun game if it's not crashing on you.
The best way to learn everything about politics
Just an amazing game with almost infinite replayability.
The best historical genocide / incest / baby murder simulator currently available.

I played a 1000 year game (EU4 Converter/Old Gods) wherein I created the HRElost itgained it
Once my kingdom had the wrong succession type ... I killed all descendants except the intended heir ... who died at the age of 5. A bad day for my ruler because he lost his son/brother/uncle/aunt in personal union. Great game! 10/10
Very steep learning curve and extremely overwhelming for complete beginnersbut after watching some Let's Play vids on YouTube and starting an 'Ireland tutorial' game I quickly got to grips with the basics. This is a very intricate game which requires a certain amount of lateral thinkingalthough having said that the only goals - other than the absolute goal of keeping your dynasty going - are the ones you set yourself.  If you're a medieval history fan this is a must-buy. If possible buy the Collection
My life was incomplete before I had this game. Now I have something that kills a night even faster than sleep.
I was lucky enough to actually receive this game for free from a friend. He offered it in hopes that someone would actually play it. I had always enjoyed the Total War series of games and asked for a comparison to those games. Now that I am a bit more experienced with CK2they are nothing alike.  So the learning curve is a bit steep for the average gamerbut it honestly only takes a few days of constant play to get it down. The beautiful aspect about this game is that it has no goal. You make your own. If you want to create the largest empire and conquer the world
Oddly addicting. Getting into the game can be a real pain (it's clunky and complicateddemanding nearly 2 hours before you really start feeling comfortable moving through the interface). But the payoff is great. It's a story generator - every time you play crazy things happen that make for Game of Thrones-esque levels of political manipulation madness.   My first (ongoing) playthrough has me trying to unite Ireland: after inheriting land from my father and fabricating a claim to unite my first duchy I died prematurely at age 43. Not deterredI took over my duchy as one of my three sons. Some plotting got my brother's bishop to help me assassinate him to reclaim my father's land from my younger brother. Naturally my plot was uncovered

The best incest and kinslaying simulator out there.
This game is one of the best I have ever played. In addition to hours of gameplayit has been incredibly useful for learning medieval European geography.
Failed at murdering a young childgot excomunicated. 10/10
Be prepared for this game to take over your life and stop you from doing anything productive... Although it does teach you a bit about European history and geography
I've been a big Paradox fan for about two years now and I can not recommend this game more. If you want to get into Paradox games this is probably the easiest one to learnand it allows you to be a complete and total fuck too! Smothering babies is fun when you have something to gain. All you need is a little bit of an imagination and this game has infinite replayability.
Highly recommended for those that enjoy incestmurderand meticulous micromanagement. 10/10 would marry sister again.
For people that don't have neurological visual issues (99% of people) this game is a very solid and very deep one screen game. However it's also got tiny font. Lowering resolution helps however it's a shame there is no interface scaling so I can play it at 2560x1440. (God help people that play this at 4k)  It's a recommended game. I just can't play it.
Your son has syphilis and you can have him killed and fuck.
My hours on this game said it all really. Real fun game. But I recommand only buying the main DLCsthough getting the minor as part of a bundle during sales is ok tooas the minor ones doesn't add much to the game.
Tried to kill first wife with explosive manure (yes that surprised me as well)... failed. Hired bandits to do her in one sunny morning... success.  Tried to kill prospective wifes husband (who id been eyeing for 5+ years prior)his wife wanted in on the plot. Husband went to do some handy man roof repairsfell off ladder *snicker*... still happily married at nearing 60 with my mid 20's wife.  No kids so far... ce la vie. Current heir and his other siblings are a bunch of idiots
interesting gamealthough bad load times
This game is awesomeyou get to look at a huge map and your grandma tries to you kill you and stuff
I think I might actually have a problem of addiction with this game. Sure it's really goodbut maybe not that good that I should have spent 2000+ hours of my life on it - who knows in any casethere's still a bunch of playthroughts I want to try. And I have barely touched multiplayer (then again
its a good game
Crusader Kings is an AMAZING grand strategy game from Paradox Interactive. You play as any lord or lady between 867 (1066 without DLC) to 1453 in Europethe Middle East and North Africa. With all the DLC you can play as merchant republicspagans and muslims as well as the default feudal christian lords. It's sort of like an RPG Strategy game in that you don't play a nation
Quite literally the best game I have ever played. Cannot recommend strongly enough.
Love the game for the bizarretwisted tales only it can tell.
Best diplomacy game I ever played :)
Want to kill your homosexualpossed brother? This is the game for you.  11/10
An awesome strategy game!
One of the greatest games I have ever played! Grand strategy and intrigue played out across a game map and menus. Certainly stay away from this game if you are looking of action or fast paced playbut if you are patient enough to unravel the system and have a predisposition for strategy gamesthen you may find that this games scratches an itch that very few titles out today can.
The best part about CKII is how after the initial setupno two games will ever be exactly the same.
Killing family. What's not to love?
Commit religious genocide in this great game and in turn lose all faith in humanity.  10/10
Started as West Franciacreated HREdied and lost it all.  Would form HRE again  10/10
This game is like a fresh morning breeze felt next to a bubbling brook with the soft hint of lemons.
Wonderfully deep and unique strategy game. Takes a bit getting into itbut the rewards are worth it.
Highly recomended. Hard to startbut very rewarding gameplay once you get the mechanics.
If you havent heard of this game go watch a youtube video or two of it because its amazing
My ruler was poisoned by his wife after I executed her father and slept with her sister. Now I am playing as his inbreed homosexual son who believes he is possessed by the devil. 10/10
Always wanted to murder your children in order to further your political goals? Now you can!  Seriously the best strategy game I've played since Shogun II. Even without the (tons and tons of) DLCit's extremely deep and free mods only add to it.
Literally the only game I play.
You have to be a pretty big nerd to like this game. But I amand I love it. I was so excited about being able to change succession lawsand the fact that the game actually knew how feudalism worked. The game is totally strategic
This is some deep Real Time shiz.
Basically crack. If only MP worked more consistently! It's probably my favorite strategy game I love the roleplay elements that develop in playand have lost many hours of my life to it.
If you have too much free time....that's the game to buy ) Hours and hours of amazing strategy gameplay!
The depth and the insanity of Crusader Kings will consume your life. Also you will learn about property law. Cool.
The world's best child-assassination simulator ever0/10. Would kill all children to ensure that my single genius son is the heir again.
Want to kill babies without repercussion for selfish advancement for yourself and your family this game is for you! Want to create a master race of hypersexual genius athletesgo right ahead.
Absolutely amazing game. There's a pretty large learning curvebut once you finally get over that hump you will be totally engulfed in the game. It's so intricate and detailed and rewarding....I'm only just playing my first dynasty where I know what i'm doing in Italybut I can tell once i'm finished with this if i play another dynasty in a different continent or area the game will feel completely different which is the best thing. 100% recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategy games.
Entretaining gamethough you may get tired after binge-playing for a couple of days. It did have a few bugsbut
I slept with my sister and got murdered by Mongolians.   10/10 Would Crusade again.
Marriedhad a childthen my wife died. Married again
Honestly one of the best games Ive ever played. With so many options you can find a way to play to any style of strategy. Also the mod community is insane and most be checked out.
Family murdering simulator 2014 10/10
Family death simulator 2014.   Buy it.
Given the right mindsetand goalsthis medievel sandbox dynasty simulator will grant you hours of permutatable fun.  Enjoy the history
This game has a steep learning curvebut once you get past itthis game becomes incredibly addictive. I've put in over 100 hours on this game. If you enjoyed the Civilization series
Holy cow. The level of depth of this game and game flow is something akin to watching history unfurl as generation after generation of a dynasty maintains a collective goalwhich I think many medieval families may have done. Perfect for the average bloke with a God complex and a preferance for history.
great game
Crusader Kings 2 is an amazing game. Its been along time since I've played such a deep game. It's funrewardingand sometimes intense. You play as a noble dynasty
Any fan of empire building games has to play Crusader Kings II. No matter how many time I build up my dynasty into a world power (and you can tell from my hours that I've done it quite a few times)I always look forward to the next go round. I find myself taking coming back to CK II for an extra 100 hours or so in between playing other games.
Great Game!
Difficult to learn and after that you cant stop playing it! Lots of strategy in it and that makes it perfect. ( And also It's a different kind of strategyyou are controlling a familynot a whole country. )
Violent dynastic eugenics simulator. Where else can incest be considered divinemurder of children the normand selling your daughters for alliances be found? And there's country building too. 10/10
My Wife stopped loving me ...... got another 10/10
This game along with the Game of Thrones mod is a must have.
This is a fantastic simulation game.   That being saidthis isn't a game where you are the hero and it revolves around you - you play as the head of a royal family somewhere in Europeand your primary goal is actually pretty simple - survive! If your lineage dies out
Long Live Feudalism! Bribebefriendand betray your way to power. Conquer nations and build your dynasty to rival the great houses. Remake history in your image and ensure that you will be remembered for centuries to come.
Great Game
This game is amazing! I have spent too much time watching kingdoms rise and fallonly to do it all again when its over.
not as good as eu4 but worth a look in
Tough to get into at the beginningbut once you do it's addicting.
Easily one of the best games I've ever played in terms of diplomatic and economic strategyeven if the military side is a bit similar to risk. Also the 'role-playing' aspect of this game versus other similar titles like Europa Universalis is a nice touch.
The Best Grand Strategy Game on the marketI can and have played this game for several days straight. I can reccomend no better game.
If you enjoy killing Muslimswearing capes and indiscriminately murdering members of your family you will love this game. If you do not you will still love this game.
Takes a while to learn the gamebut peserverego online for help  http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/
Great Game
What can you say about Crusader Kings II? A simply wonderful and engaging game in a historical setting. Dynasty building and maintenance sounds boring until you have to deal with disgruntled brotherssons and uncles fighting over every scrap of power they can wring from you. Intra-dynasty conflicts at its very best. Think Game of Throneswith much less fantasy elements and a whole lot more politics. The best part is that every failure to keep your dynasty going will be an epic saga in itself. I cannot recommend this enough if you are interested in this genre.
fav game of all time. played plenty DRM as well. good DLClots of updates and good developers. can play super role playingor can play gamey. choose your destiny... A+ love love love.
I've probably spent more time playing this game than anything else ever. Probably more than the next few games combined. It's incredibly complicated and rather difficultbut so... so satisfying.  Consider that you're playing as a Dynasty - a family line. Not as a nation state per se. All the large expansions are worth itthough I never play as a Muslim so I could probably live without Sword of Islam. For extra long gaming
Staring at maps has never been so fun.
Remarkably addicting. The learning curve is pretty steepbut once you get teh hang of itthe game has endless surprises in store
This game is great. Playing multiplayerand getting my friends to murder my kids because they aren't good enough to inherit the throne should be so wrongbut in this context
Day 1:As you sit upon your throneyou look out the window. What do you see? You see every single person you ever gave land to armed with 6000 men each. They want lower crown authority. You crown authority is on low. Day 2: Your leader died in a suspicious accident Day 3: Dangerous Factions: Lower Crown Authority 116% Stength of Liege Day 4: I will not be blackmailed! Day 5: Go back to day 1.
have a big family them get murdered and and destroyed by Norway in only for years. 9/10
Buy this game and all the DLC.
I absolutely love this game. I'll get the bad parts out of the way first. RegrettablyI've had to revert to the 2.0.4 version as they release game breaking patches seemingly every month. I don't know about youbut I can't play a full game that quickly. In fact
This game is the true Game of Thrones. Game centers around advancing your family dynasty through warintriguediplomancy
Killed my ugly child stupid wife and shit bro
Let me start by saying that when I loaded this up and played for the first timeI thought that this game wasn't for me. Too complicatedtoo much terminology to figure out
Think you're doing really goodand you're about to take over all of Hispania? Naehyou're just going to die and have all your hardwork torn apart
Wife killed me and I found out my son was sleeping with her when I took him over0/10 will play again
Perfect time sink
This may be the bestcontinually adaptingand growing
I want to just say something witty like 'Civ V for big boys but truth be told its more complicated than that. (BeisdesI love Civ V)  They call these paradox games 'grand strategy
Fantastic strategy gamefairly slow paced but a must buy for history buffs. Very in-depth gameplay and potential to waste hours of your life!
Crusader Kings 2 is the best game that i have ever played. If you are of turnign around history i highly reccomend this game
The best paradox game to datean indepth grand strategy game set in an era of conquest and lovely backstabbing. Creating a dynesty that lasts through the ages.
Easy to learndifficult to master. It's a fun and complex game that can drain hours of your life.
As a Historian and a gamerI have to recomend this game to all who will play. Their is a huge learning curve to anyone just joing the gameI know I suffered through a lot of rage quits just becuse the game didn't explain something that well in the begining tutorial
A must get for any Paradox fan.
There's the time my king had both the 'possessed' and 'voice of Jesus' traits and kept converting to various Christian heresiesbefore he would be lovingly persuaded back into Catholicism by a family memberonly to convert once more to a new heresy.  There's the time Pedro the Careless went utterly bankrupt
Fight your way to conquer the world. Marry yourself into conquering the world. But above allfor God's sakehave lots of kids. Oh
A Legendary Game of Control and Immersion.
Boss fucking game.
The best analogy I've heard for CKII is 'the Littlefinger simulator' (It also happens to have a nice Game of Thrones mod but that's beside the point). This game is more about building up your dynasty instead of conquering your neighboring nations. Sureyou can still become a bloodthirsty conqueror but the real fun is the load of plotsassassinations
Such a pleasure to rage quit.
Well i havent played much of this game yet but i gota feelin its 2014's wow kiler.  Now we just need to get some nood mods and itll be my fave
Quite possibly my favourite game ever. As a lover of emergent narrativesCrusader Kings 2 is unparallelled in this. Equal parts CRPG and strategy gameit posits you not as an abstract leading force of a nation or civilisation but a member of a dynasty of rulers whom you play until they die
I got this game on sale and it has been well worth the moneythe learning curve is quite high but once you get the hang of things it's incredibly addictive and rewarding. It has a ridiculous amount of playback ability and with the DLC there's always new things to try.
the Game'
Very good with the Game of Thrones Mod
An excellent game that is a mix of the Sims and Civilization. It allows you to feel a much more personal connection to running your government compared to Civ as you go through a family lineage and custom each ruler via training them as children and selective breeding programs.
Such a great nobility simulation! As in its predecessorCrusader Kingsyou are the head of a family in medieval europe and aspire to great power and success. You not only play one character but every member and even take responsibility for the AI-controlled members who tend to do stupid things as to marry their cousins.
Ever wanted to kill your possessedpriest brother? No?  Weirdo.
This is a killer Strat game.
excellent hardcore deep strategy game .not easy to get into but once you do its really addicting .there is multilayer as well but i haven't tried that out
Great gameand the mods are especially interesting.
12/10 would murder entire Karling Dynasty again.
This game is like no other I've playedand I love it. This introduced me to the 4X genrewhich in all honesty is a bit too complex for me to delve into with most every other game in the genre I've tried. For some reason
You'll love it but your spacebar will hate you. Ohand don't make any plans to leave the house... Or get dressedfor that matter... Or sleep....
Well it's a really nice gamefilled with a lot of politics and you have to deal with them or it could hurt you. I do say buy this gamebut it comes with bugs that kinda suck and make the game difficult to learn. By this I mean the game's Tutorial doesn't work
I love this game it provides me so much fun with the dlc's and EU 4 its a package you dont want to miss.
Slow paced gametaking care of all things happening around the world. Take your time to check out what the IA is doing and you will conquer.  Its a cool gamebuy it if you love to use your strategic mind
Amazing gameplayed 200+ hours of this gameI strongly reccomend if you like grand strategy.
Great gamehighly addictive and I suspect even better with the DLC. Come on sale! :-)
The emergent story line is what makes this game so much fun and keeps the replay value so high. It is overwhelming at firstbut finding how the mechanics work is very rewarding.
The most in-depth game I ownand well worth the time it takes to get to know it.
I love this game. The learning curve is steep like most of Paradox strategy games but once you got itit's really addictive.
Do you see the hours of game play i have put in to this game you know what im gong to say.
Great Historical strategy gamefilled with your own family members trying to kill you and get the crown for themselves. Kill off your own family and relatives. Create plots to kill opposing Lords or Kings. Create plots to press a claim on a Lords land and then send in your Armies to take their land. Marry your family members off strategically.   This is a deep strategy game which you are always learning. I'd certainly reccomend it to anybody with patience and a love of history and strategy.
IF you like a game that is a blend of war and building and even plain back stabing for ruling you might like it i suggest if you liked settlers games u might enjoy thsi just as much
Got killed by my own son.  10/10 would get killed again.
in crusade kings LL u play as king leoniadas and it it is your dutey to have sex with as mayn womans as you can before you die of old age or comit suiced  some times people declare de facty on you and attack your womans but if you fite them hard and be strong you win and get to take their womans to have sex with  is very good game i give it 10/10 but i take away 1 point because i die early so 9/10
I haven't really played it yetbut holy fuck that looks like one steep confusing learning curve. Looks good.
There's really nothing negative that I can say about this game.. It is a must have for grand strategy players. It offers a double major in historical relationshipsa minor in military strategy and one of the most indepth games I have played in the last twenty years.  An absolute masterpiece in strategy gaming.
The only game where I've honestly considered murdering my mother because she knows I'm porking my sister while I'm taking over Ireland. 9/10 if you like turn/pause-based strategy games. It's like a super complicated and super fun Civ.
I love the soap opera feel of the dynasty focus of this gameyou can keep track of where people in your bloodline rule and be an impotent grandparent shaking your head as your grandchildren squabble over who gets to rule which counties. I enjoy looking for the best brides for all my courtiersand inviting good men into the area for my women. I haven't managed it yet
The game Medieval Total War should have been.
One of the BEST strategy game.
Seriously one of the best games I have ever playedso deep and fun to play.  10/10 WOULD BUY
This is a game that is horrible for good peopleluckily I'm not a good person. You can play as any character in historyor a custom character with one of the many dlc's
Grand strategy and political intrigue simulator. Not played anything quite like it before. It was a game that was exactly what I wanted but didn't know it. Small technical glitches and UI issues are not enough to detract from the countless hours of fun schemeingmenuveringand conquering that this game offers
Deep medeivel strategy game from paradox
Too complex to enjoy. I know some people like thatbut I found this too hard to get into. Micro managers will love this.
This is a very fun and exllently executed strategy game. Howeverit may be difficult in the begining once you get the hang of everything you can have a very fun experience with it.
A history simulatorthis game accuratly protrays the politcal landscape from 1066 to 1337 as best as historical records show. Each game is completly uniqueeven with the exact same starting point because of the multitude of decisions from each character in the game
I captured a newborn with the trait 'attractive' during a raid.  I kept her in my dungeon for 60 years as a sex slaveand then my son used her as a sex slave until she died.
I need to stop playing... I open CK2 and next thing i know hours have passed!
I cant seem to get enough of it.
Amazing 10/10 Must have RTS
I think this game is great and still love it now
Easily one of my most favorite games ever. So much time spent on itand you don't notice the hours fly by. The game is very much oriented around your dynastyestablishing alliances and relationships with other lords
CK2 is about the best game I've wasted way too much time on. If you enjoy grand strategies why haven't you played this one yet?
Beautifully designed world and interfaceextensive historical characters and dynastiesconstant upgrades and expansions
If you are willing to kill children to get powerkidnap married womenand be a 40 year old man with a 16 year old wife
Best historical simulator yet made. I've probably played too much of this game.
Some of my best childhood memories were sleep-overs playing Khan II - Clan of the Gray Wolfand Gemfire for Sega Genesis with my best friend. Afterwards I came to play ROTK 7-10 before arriving at a desert of decent strategy gamesyears later I saw this and it was like coming home.
Haven't even touched half the gameplay on thisstill tons more to dobut I totally recommend this. Super fun.
This is a pretty fun game It's hard and I'm not too good but I like it.
The pinacle of Grand Strategy on the market. Controlling the fate of your dynasty is compelling as you try to ensure your Heir survives to adulthood and when they domaking certain their siblings don't rise up in rebellion. I enjoy playing puppetmaster of all of Europemarrying my children off to the second or third in line for a throne
Love itJust love it. Managing a scrub with an ambition to become kingand actually succeeding is soooooo satisfying :) the only thing i find REALLY annoying is all those DLC's i mean unit packs and portraits... should it really be DLC? you have a super cool concept here
Easy to learn the basic and a challenge to master. I love this game and my first playthrough kept me entertained for 240 hours but I found that once I had a gigantic empire the play became a tedious cycle of civil wars rather than a ruthless march toward total conquest. I suppose this somewhat historically accurate but it was never-the-less aggravating.
Trying to be objectivethis game is not for everyone. This is what separates casual gamers into the candy crushers and kingdom builders. It takes a lot of work to be able to play it competently. That being saidthe level of historical depth is amazing. The presentation is pretty smooth
If you want a really good simulation of what medieval/feudal life was likeget this game!
Great game. You can do pretty much anything you like that fits into the timeframe: kill your relative for a titlekill a complete stranger for the sake of ittyrranise your subjects
First grand strategy game i ever playedgot 126 hrs now and its still my first game as Sweeden dukenow im an emperor of Holy Roman Empire and there is still so much to do
Omg. It's such a good game. HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG
This game made me love history. Now I'm as eager as ever to learn more about the Middle Ages. It's funstategicand educational!
Of all the games I have playedthis one is the one I would be playing if my desktop PC had not crapped out on me... and it will be the first game I play once I get it back up and running.
Spend four hours of your day to be dethroned by your mother.
Very sharp learning curvebut once you understand how it worksit's a blast. Having a great time with this game
As a gamer new to the realm of strategy--let alone grand strategy--I can safely say there's nowhere I'd rather start than right herewith my feet propped on top of my Irish neighbors and my marriages made into Norse royalty.
This game is a historical simulator. Instead of playing as a country you are a king. Although the depth of the game is crazy. There are all kind of mechanics to learn to be good but if you learn them all you will not want to stop playing the game.
Good: 1) There is no game quite like Crusader Kings II. The scope and the amount of detail is just magnificent. 2) The game manages to turn map based gaming into a game about characters and the scheems and lives. It is really quite beautiful. 3) The Paradox way of also creating new free content with DLCs is to me quite fair. The game has improved a lot since I bought it.  Bad: 1) At times human interaction is a bit too mathy for my taste.  2) Long load times and the amount of detail make it game you can't really take up for just some time. You need a good long session for a good experience. 3) The game was quite hard to learn to play. You can still do itbut certain quirks are surprising still to me at this point.

Playing CK2 is pretty much like playing the best Game of Thrones game everit just so happens to take place in Medieval Europe instead of Westeros. Extra points for mechanics being easily moddalbe via text-editor.
This game is immense and endless. I've never cracked the 100 hour mark on a gameand now I'm pushing 200 with CK2. It generates the most facinatingvaried stories and conflicts. I can't really imagine ever getting tired of it. And on top of the incredible size of this game
Sothe number of hours Steam shows is not giving enough credit to this gameas I've played it countless hours without an Internet connection. What can be said about this game? The most important aspect of Crusader Kings is definitely the freedom to play however you want: if you want to conquer the world as anyone do it
So here I ammodest count in South West Francevassal of a powerful duke. But I am ambitious. I am strong. Yes I want to rule a whole realm
When I pre-ordered CKIII though I made a mistake after I actaully got to play the game because it wasn't my game at launch.  However when they gifted me with an extra copy that I exchanged via Steam Trading for a copy of one of the DLC(Republic) I suddenly found myself invested in the game and I played many hours as republics because they were easy-mode compared to nobles due to the huge amount of gold income that you are able to get out of it.  If you are going to buy this game however I would strongly suggest to wait for a sale because alot of the freedom you will enjoy in a game like this unlocks with the DLC's since the base game only included catholic rulers and there are many more rulers then that(including republics) for example Muslims but also jews in the lastest expansion. Great game and it is one of Paradox Interactive most polished games so far with little bugs that I encountered.  They continue to also support the game for free by including most of the gameplay in patches(expect unlocking characters) so that is very commendable. But it is still a relative deep game that you will need to learn because it is still a Paradox game. You can really roleplay as a character though and you can play most people if you have the right DLC.
Every time I play this gameI think I'll only invest a small amount of time but always end up losing so much more time than I'd intended because it is so addicting and sucks you in. You get attached to your dynasty (family) and want to keep conquering and expanding your nation's borders whether it be through marriages and inheritence or more direct military or plotting.   This game is really about the relationships between characters and making the best of your situation as a given ruler and dealing with his or her strengths and weaknesses. It is very rare to have a 'perfect' character- you will have good traits and bad traitsand sometimes there will be good and bad things about those traits that aren't immediately apparent. Unless your character is very skilled in diplomacy
Very addictive grand strategy game. Also players should check out the Game of Thrones and Elder Kings mods.
A richinteresting world that provides a great historical backdrop for you to murder your simulated children in.
I had some issues with this game which are now resolved. Plus I played about 130 hours of Europa Universalis and I can say only so much. I have gotten bored of Europaof repeatedly doing the same drab things over and over. But in this game? I've been possessedbeen screwing my son
Love the stories that come out of this game. Would recommend if you like statagy or role playing :)
This game has absolutely fantastic interace and some of the most fascinating decisions I have ever encountered. Beneath the deceptively simple surface lies an interesting world of complex intrigue and midieval life. I wish armies were more interestingbut overall one of the best games I have ever encountered.
I can only recommend you to play this game. It is very addictive!
Incest and familial murder simulator 1066 shows you the full extent of family lifeenabling you to do bonding experiences sucks as: Going on a crusade together  Murdering someone together Having a feast Putting down rebellions Genocide Incest.  10/10best simulator on steam.
To keep this short.  If you are into turn based strategy/empire management gamesor just looking for a good game then Crusader Kings is worth a try. It will sneak into your every day thoughts and call you back to the dynasty that you where building the evening before. Keep in mindyou have to do a little bit of studying to get started but it is well worth your time.  Addicting
It's a mediaeval diplomacy sim. Probably not for everyonebut if you're into that sort of thing it's brilliant.
great strategy game
Let me start this off by saying that I have put 90 hours into this game that haven't been logged on Steam. I love this gamebut Paradoxplease fix your servers. I have spent so much money on this game
A lot of funrelies more on diplomacy than warfare which is what I like about it. It very much has a dynasty like system where you have to guide that family through its time as rulers of a particular region.
Horrifyingly Awesome. And it's still growing. After 2 years.
A very engrossing gamewhich can be difficult to get into initially. But once you doyou'll get hooked. The game focusses on the huge number of characters
I love this game but it stoped working some times ago. Without any reason just dont work anymore.
I really recommend this game to anyone I come across. At firstthis game was overwhelming. There were a lot of things that I didn't really understand while reading through the tutorials on my first playthough. After reading online and viewing posts of a great and helpful online community (on the paradox website) I was able to grasp the concepts of the game and have a few successful playthroughs. Beware thoughthis game is extremely addicting! This has got to be one of the greatest sandbox games out there that lets the player take control of a kingdom or county (depending on how much you want to control) and gives the player free reign on what they want to do while also giving them plenty of options to obtain there goal. Also
Started out as a Irish earl built my way up to owning all of Ireland and northern england had my throne stolen then had England claim the Irish throne and now I rule Burgundy as my son unexpected turn of events
awsome gamewith intrigue and plots.. love to kill my children so the right one gets the throne..
rescued my spymaster wife from rival rulershe immediately poisoned me on her return 10/10
This game is awesome.   Don't let the appearent brickwall of a learning curve scare you away. Its not as bad as the tutorial make it out to be.
Restore the Roman Empireconuer europe as the mongolsor just become the king of ireland only to have your idiot son get overthrown by your ungrateful vassals.
Extremely fun and addicting strategy game once you learn the basics. The tutorial isn't great but with some Youtube tutorials it's not too hard to pick up. Similar to the Civilization series in terms of being able to make time fly.
Tried this game out when it was free for 2 daysfound it confusing and hard Googled alot and watched a tutorial vidbecause i'm dumb probably :p  Anyway once you get the basics down
This game is fucking awesome! It's like Europa Universalis 3 only in medieval times! You lead not a countrybut a dynasty to greatness. So if you are under a great king and are a lowly countthen you need to first break away from the king to do much besides follow the kings orders. Medieval hierarchy simulator at it's finest.
The strategy required to be successful in this game is pretty intense. There's a lot that gets thrown at youand it takes a while to understand it all. I wish it would allow you turn on/off mechanics so you could warm up the game a bit better. But it's a ton of funeven if you end up making a bad move.
Simply epic  for deep strategy fans
A little difficult at first to get the hang ofbut once you work through the 'getting to know it' partit's easy peasey. Gotta love that baby momma drama in the game. :D
So far I've killed more of my own kids then war and disease combined.This game has helped me realise why I should never be allowed have kids.  10/10
its very confusing but it gets better and easier
After many years devoted to the Total War seriesI decided to give the Paradox games a go when CS2 was on sale. I never expected that this game would become the single game I've played more than any other in my twenty-five years of gaming. The character/dynasty depth goes far deeper than the simple character portraits alude to. The challenge of taking a simple count and survivingthen thriving
Unique grand strategy game with plenty of depth. Long learning curvebut there's no harm in learning by doing. Recommended thoroughly to fans of strategy games.
Confusing but solid. A conduit of fun if you are already liking alternate history.
The best strategy game yet. Frustrating and fun at the same time.
If the premise of this game even remotely interests youyou should get it. It is fantastic. It might seem complex at first but if you dive right into it there's tons of fun to be had. I can see myself sinking hours into this game.
Crusader Kings 2 is an awesome game with full freedom and script power. ThoughParadox Interactive manages to fuck up every strategy game they make after a year.
i have played this game for 521 hours nowand still love to play it. love this game!
and gone was that week
Words don't do this game justice. If you're a fan of complex medieval dynastic simulatorsstrategy gamesor even a medieval culture buff
Highly recommend. Excellent sandbox game.
There is no act of depravity that this game doesn't let you commit. I've murdered my wifechildrenhusband
My nephew killed me 'cause I denied him a fief twice. No heir cause my character was homossexual.  Game Over.  10/10
love it .simply brilliant
my hours says it all. probably the best game ever made so far. Definitly in the top 5
This is one of the best games that I have ever played. There is a sharp learning curveand the tutorial is somewhat worthless. InsteadI would just play the game and learn it through trial and error. Once you become accustomed to the game
Rather than task you with ruling the mapCrusader Kings 2 places the history of a medieval dynasty in your hands. Sureyou could aim for creating an empire to rival ancient Rome
Killed a whole family for no reason.  Well I'm the Emperor so I do what ever I want.  35% chance of 10/10
What a gamethis is a fantastic simulation of politics and warfare in medieval Europe. Not only thatbut the devs have shown continual devotion to the game's development and ensured that multiplayer will never be a problem. One of my favorite features is that the DLC of the host of a multiplayer game is usable by all members of that game
I conquered Abyssinia as Egyptnearly forming the empirethen i was attacked by the abbasids who took egypt from me so in retribution i killed their ruler. They attacked me again. 10/10
I just Bought it and now i Cant play it because of some res issue. Paradox PLease Deal with this as it is stopping me and many other gamers from actually playing this amazing game . The exact issue is the screen is overly zoomed in on the top left corner with no way of minimizing it.
This is a fun strategy game where you control a ruler of some rank. Each game is different with both you and the ai influences. You can even play with your friends. If you like strategy games then this is a game for you.
I've married off my daugthers to sniveling pigsI've murdered my sons for one bad traitI killed the pope for not excommunicating my neighbor.... I thought I was a decent person
I like this game. thxs
WARNINGthe game might not support windows 8..
10/10 would get murdered as an inbred dwarf 2 minutes into the game by my own wife
Probably the best strategy game out there.  It's: 1. Grand 2. Historic 3. Detailed 4. People-oriented - ala RPG  I really liked taking my small Polatsk Duchyand transforming it into a might Belarusian Empire that covered all Central and Eastern Europefrom Hamburg to Constantinople
an Arabian merchant come into my kingdomallowed them staylisten to their story
Some might not like this game because it does not have a linear approach at all. some might not like or understand history and geography. Other still might not like figuring out what to do in order to have a fun game time they'd rather be told exactly what to do and possibly even what to do in order to achieve it.  For the restthis game is amazing. Try creating the United Kingdomfreeing Spain from the Moors
Great game. This is the first Paradox strategy game I think I've played. Do yourself a favor and skip the tutorial and watch tutorial videos on  youtube.com  to figure out how to play. Even now every once in a while I will still wonder why something happened in the game. It can be a bit complicated. This game is almost like one of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games. You basically control a character (from a lesser noble all the way up to a king) and try to have your family line gain as much power and prestige until the game ends sometime in the 1300's I believe. Very quirky and funny stories can come out of this game and that's where alot of the appeal is at as well as the memorable character backstabbing and political intrigue. Very fun gamejust a little hard to figure out at first. Only complaint is that Paradox nickels and dimes you to death in the DLC department. Wish they would clean up their act on that one. Definitley play now!
Didnt get a chance to play much of it during the free weekend but it looked really interesting
You are not truly a monarch until you have a bably smothered in its crib for power.
This game is excellent for anyone who has a deep passion for deep and satsifying stratagy gamesand I recomend it to anyone who likes complicated games with a lot of matirial. Regretebley it suffers from one thing that keeps it from perfection...DLC things that should be updates are charged only get a coulple when there is a sale. total 8/10
IMO....This is the best Kingdom Building/Management Game out there. In one instance i had 2 legitimate/31 fuck children and was still plowing...anyone who has ever dreamed of controlling every aspect of your own empire buy this right now...hell buy the bundle of games because they are all top notch
This is an extremely deep and dynamic strategy game. The learning curve is somewhat steepand it is very difficult to min/max your playstyle. Very entertaining strategy with high replayability. Recommend to anyone who wants to manage an empire/kingdom/duchy/county over the course of a dynasty.
Spent 50 hours rebuilding the Roman Empire. After hundreds of years was dangerously close to completing my goal. Thenmy ambitious cousin had my 1 year old heir assassinated and within a decade a 4 way civil war erupted just in time for the Mongols to decide they wanted Georgiaall this in the midst of a Holy War
Amazingsunk well a couple hundreds hours in it.
Crusader Kings II balances realism and accessibility to create a dynamicinteresting look into this oft-portrayed era. Historical enthusiasts and the 'as-it-was' crowd can get a lot of enjoyment out of this title. While certainly not a page out of history verbatimCrusader Kings II does an excellent job at keeping itself honest. For those who dig this age of history
you will hate this game. then you will love it.
From what i have seen it can entirely be played using lines from Monty Python *I have played this before just not on this account.*
Beautiful in its simplicitybut with a rock hard barrier to entry. Once you get over the initial confusion of what on earth you're doingit's a peach of a game.
I got this game as a gift. Not very good at these type of game. So I end up guessing a lot since I'm learning and new to it. I could tell this type of game would take me a long time to learn how to play but I enjoy playing with my friend in a match. I don't know mutch about these game to begin with so I suppose I'll say the game seem stable and able to play.
Canst thou play'st thy game without thee smahing thy keyboard m'lady?
Expensive but good. goes on sale a lotso the intital cost should be cut in half if you get it. Rediculous amount of DLC (that is also expensive) that can sometimes be worth it if you're really into the game and want to play other civilizations rather than just boring Europeans. DLC goes on sale a lot as wellso buy the game for half price or better
1 years has passed... What am I doing in this game?  I will recommend this game. When someone is interestedthat person will then teach me the how-tos.
Seems overly complicated to meplus the tutorials aren't working correctly. In the Diplomacy tutorial it said to click a button that was non-clickable. Honestlyany tutorial screen that has way over 20 Buttons is more confusing than helpful. Lokks fancy though.
A vassal lord rebelled against my desicion to grant myself more power.  So I imprisoned their spousetheir daughter and daughters husband while they were sieged behind their castle walls.  One by one I stripped his family of all titles and then executed them.  I spared the rebel vassal who had to live out their days alone and in poverty.
Nice Old-Game..So mind-refreshing
Highly recommended for people who like to do lots of reading before you actually get to do something. Highly recommended if you don't mind not being able to change the resolution to work around the problem of the text being too small to read for a high-res (comparatively) laptop monitor. Highly recommended for people who like to tinker and click on tiny little things with no actual obvious way to advance the game or actually make anything happenreally.  If you're not one of these above peoplethen don't. Obviously many people enjoy this
This game is so fun. It's a lot like a Civilization and Total war mix and is great. It's also currently on sale with all it's dlc for real cheap so it is a great pickup. Also if you get this and all dlc pick up Europa Universalis IV because this game has a converter that will allow you to move your game to EU4 at the end of the timeline or any time you want.
Went into it thinking it would play like EU4declared war on my neighbors right awaygot destroyed
You can lose many hours of your life playing this game!!!
I can barely play Strategy games...this game is an overload. I give it a 10 just on the fact that its smarter than me.
Its like civ 5 but only in 1066
I love this game just the things you can do in this game is interesting.
I murder my family. I bed other mens wives. I deceit people for power.  I am murdered from a mysterious cup of wine at a party without knowing who did it.  10/10
5 minutes into the game and my brother declared war on me. 10/10
Imagine Civalization 5right got it in your mind? Now imagine people who made that game all got their masters in medieval history and smoked some crack. That's Crusader Kings 2
A medieval-themed grand strategy game.  Its all about warsplotsmarriages
Created a Viking trade republic and am still having children at 70   10/10 will play for the rest of my life
I'm really recommending this for me. Grand strategy games across a timespan of hundreds of years with the only animation being people raising and lowering their swords is not for everyone. It ishowevera really intense and complex game that will appeal to those who liked old fashioned wargames that go for hundreds of hours. If you're really into the history of Europe
Another game from Paradox Interactive but no less of their trademark massive replayability on a massive map. While this game is limited to EuropeNorth AfricaIndia (With DLC's) and everything in between instead of the Europa Universals series world map
great game for try to manage strategic empire game :)
The only game where inbreedingkinslayingreligious wars
Sacrificed my eldest son to the godsimprisoned my two brotherskilled two wives and died in a blaze of glory storming a castle. And that was just the first sitting :)
My Brother claimed my EmpireI killed him and the other brother took my Empire and killed me. 11/10
It's a good gamewith a slight taste of Civilisation to itplus
A few problems with the tutorial but other than that EXCELLENT game.
I cannot believe I have not got this game earlier. The Paradox weekend saw me get a lot of there games at cheaper prices. I looked at this recently and saw the intro video on steam. I have been laughing ever since. It is serious on the History sideyes and relives the brutallity of the Erabut when you can make decisions like imprison your own children
I liked this game and tried to buy it at the discounted rate but Steam froze - I've come back today and it is up to full price!!!
i holded a poop to play this game
Hard to learnharder to master but very addictive.
Love it
Overall one of the best strategy game there is. You have to love Paradoxand the learning curve is steep if you've never played one of their titlebut a darn great game nonetheless.  If you've never played
One of the best games I've ever played! I love trying out new scenarios and the mods are brilliant!  10/10 Would buy again. If I didn't already have it.
10/10 Found perfect woman for my ruler to marry.....turned out to be my cousin
At first I was very confused about what the hell this game is supposed to be. I've played a few of the Total War and Civilization gameswhich clearly define your purpose as the player (to conquer everything conquerable) and how to do it. Crusader Kings II doesn't clearly define this purpose. And that's not a bad thing. Once I figured out that I'm not necessarily supposed to be conquering the world mapit all started to sink in.   Playing Crusader Kings II is about focusing on the survival of your dynasty and its ownership of feudal titles. You must understand the hierarchy of titles and how ownership of these titles is passed onto somebody else within your dynasty. If you die with nobody to pass on your titles
do not like this game like most trune based stragey takes to long for me to get anywhere perfer games where in the frist few mineuts you know what your doing not games take weeks or months to complete frist story. only got because it was 9.99.
Great game!  Hoursdays and friendships pass by playing. Can't recommend to anyone.
It is probably one of my favorite games how ever I would love to be able to play a theocracy
As the king of scotlandmy wife died of the plague. I then murdered my imbecile brother so i could marry his wifewho was a strong lustful woman and a princess of france. My son by my second wife went on to become the king of france .. but i suspected that he was a fuck.. i then murdered him so i could became king of france... And now my first son by my first wife is king of france and scotland
It's a sort of strategic storyline simulator with heavy emphasis on intriguewarfare and diplomacy. You control a character who is the member of a dynastic house in the middle ages. You may start as a powerful emperor of a vast realma mild-mannered duke or count with a modest holding
Marched an army against my wife.  10/10
Great game. It's what i've come to expect from Paradox with its in depth histrorical gameplay.
Great gameif you like RPGbuy it. If you like Middle Age buy it
I was skeptical about even downloading the demoas I normally play games like COH2. The tutorial for CKII was a bit underwhelming and I felt like some of the game mechanics for the game was not explained very well. This caused me to suck on my first play through and I barely made it to 50 years. I uninstalled the demo and moved on.   Three days laterI downloaded the demo again. I had realized that this game is a game that makes you think. The tutorial was there to help you get started
I have always been a fan of Crusader Kingsand this one does its namesake proud. Worth every penny.
So much funeven with the piecemeal releases that only really made it a fully functional game by expansion 3 or 4 been playing and loving it for a while.
Very interesting and replayable game with extreemly worthwhile expansions!
Its okay I think.
The best game ever!
I learned a lot about history and geography from this game. Also I learned I like kidnapping princesses to keep as my concubines.
rob lee loves this game
How to begin? Just buy it. I promiseyou could never regret it.
Are you a count and are under the command of a king? Is your army pathetically small and weak compared to your liege? Then you can't seize his throne through forcenor can you fight him for independence. Well thenperhaps you should start a faction
Highly recommended! This game has amazing scope- both in the number of turns/years you can play and in the complexity of the game mechanics  but what makes it truly unique is the decisions you make are largely on the personal level. From defending yourself from your brother who has decided he would make a better king than you to keeping your wife happy so she doesnt join a faction to overthrow you to deciding who your idiot son is going to marry and worrying all the time that when you die the next generation is going to squander all that you worked so hard far. This game definitely makes the time disappear  one more turn becomes one more generation.
There was definitely a large learning curve to this game. Afterwardsthe game seemed relatively easy and I had a hard time sticking with one family. I am not keen on the idea that achievements are locked when you buy the customizer as I feel if you customize someone within their rulesyou should be able to use that character in ironman mode. Perhaps my biggest complaint was that it needed more depth. Although they keep expanding lands and religions
I've started as a drunken Irish Earlchopping off norsemen headsand I've ended up forming the Holy Roman Empire
The incredible amount of history in this if you're wanting to re-enact some particular historical event is incredible. Level of strategy is Marianas Trench deep.
It's definitely not for everyonebut if it sounds appealing to you at all it's worth checking out. I was on the fence about it for a long time and now that I have it I wish I had taken the plunge earlierit's a lot of fun and quite challenging as well.
THA BEST GAME EVA
Addictingespecially with the Game of Thrones MOD
One amazing game. It blends in aspects of feudal government simulation with an aspect of caring for a character. In most paradox games you just make decisions for the nationyou aren't affected by the passing away of a king or bearth of a sonbut in Crusader Kings II you are said king
Ever wanted to run an entire empire into the groundboth economically and morally? If sothis is the game for you!
One of the best strategy/historical sims I've ever played.
Fun as fuck and super addictive! Get it!
CK2 is probably the grandest Grand Strategy game I know of. You take the role of any landed dynasty in Mediæval Europeand must try (through warmarriage
The most stable of Pardox's games upon release. Not so much a history simulator as a dynasty simulator. Keeping your family happy and in order is just as important as how you deal with the rest of Europe. A fantastic game and piece of history that I would recommend to any strategy fan.
a Great Game Which Takes Time To Get The Hand Off It If You Get It Dont Expect To Conquer The World Stright Away It Take Time And Learning From Your Mistakes To Get Better
Crusader Kings 2 is probably best medieval grand strategy game (and probably unique dynasty simulation game too). It has so much more depth in comparison with Total War series (which focus is tactical battles). It has complex family relationship system and you can conquer territories in a number of different wayscreate numerous strategies to dominate medieval Europe. Constant support and regular updates is another excellent feature of many Paradox games and CK2 in particular (one of the last addons The Old Gods is just amazing and must have). If you want to test your strategy skillsto perfect them you should try this complex and deep strategy game!
Oh christ yesi've spent hours days even playing this game. Hard to get the gist of it at the very startkinda crap tutorial but once you're in you're in for yearsssss
Ive spent alot of time on this game. Too much perhaps. It produces a constant challenge and with more updates yet to comeit will only really get better. A solid 9/10.
This game is a game with a fairly steep learning curve to it. It took me several dozen hours of play just to learn the mechanics. BUT with that said this game once mastered...ish is one of the greatest story telling experiances one could play. It doesnt tell you a storybut it gives you the tools to create a story for yourself. It allows you to create alternate history scenarios where ireland unified and conquered Great Britain to push back the Aztec Hordes from Europe. Furthermore it is a game about peoplemore so than places. You are not managing an empire but instead manageing vassals that control the empire. If you have watched Game of Thrones
Deep and complex but still an easy way in the grand stategy genre. although I prefered the EU series over this.
The best murder and incest simulator currently on the market.
Crusader Kings 2yet another game that will scare off the uninitiated. The tutorials tell you what each thing doesbut really
Murder your brothers mothers sisters and children. Take over half of denmark then give it all to the king of England! A game for the whole family Crusader Kings 2 is filled with twists and turns thrills and chills you'll laugh cry cheer and dance every time you sit down to play you'll set out on a magical journey through mysterious fortresses and shadowy banquet halls. It's like having a Dark Age Farming Village in your Home! Crusader Kings 2 because even kings sometimes need to brutally dispatch their 2nd cousins.
I have so much fun with this game I love the feeling of pimping my daughters of to some king and then enslaving some Welshmen I seriously recommend buying this game.
Scheming plotting taking part in great crusades and starting wars oh and poisoning your fucking hunchback son just because he doesn't fit the spotless family tree of yours. The perfect game if you want to constantly twirl your mustache and laugh maniacally.
This is a Paradox Grand Strategy game recommend to people who don't want to enter the even more complicated Grand Strategy games they release. Not for the faint of heart.
Want to bang your sister? Want to kill your brother for finding out you were banging your sister? Want to kill your neighbours so that the incestious spawn you birthed with your sister may have future lands and titles? Then this is the game for you!   All joking aside. If you like being overwhelmed in a grand stratagy game this is one to pick. You will be completely lost for hours until you get a good idea of what your doing. The graphics are goodreplayablity out the wallmusic is fantastic
Crusader Kings II starts off as a game with variety and confusion. Tutorials are difficult. As you choose a bookmark and a character to play and start to very slowly learn about the things within the game how it works.   Slow-learner maybe but it took me about twenty hours or so to grasp the main idea of the system and from there i've managed to learn small things one at a time which would later turn out to be very beneficial during gameplay. I have absolute no difficulties with playing any character now. The game smells of brilliant plotting war system and splendid land system.   The game also has two incredible mods that are worth checking out: A Game of Thrones and Elder Kings  It is a game that will keep you until your last breath.
This is the greatest PC game of the last ten years.
One of the best games from paradox yet! This game has allowed me to fullfill huge amount's of gameplay and huge amount's of crazy and varying playthrough's. Each time you start the game you are unaware of what might happen this time around. Although it is not the easiest game to learnit fills this hole by allowing satisfieng gameplay. You can get really in depth with your charachter and role playing within this game. Every decision you make is not only efecting your kingdom but the world on a scale never seen before. Thousands of charachters fill the world providing a scenario that literally equals millions of different play throughs. The DLC's are highly recommended as they add very different and exciting oppurtunities within the world. But DLC or not this game is definitely worth buying. The only gripe I would have with itis it seems to be very easy once you have the hang of it
Fantastic grand strategy game. Be prepared to be ruthless and cunning to get what you want. Acts are only dishonorable if they're discovered!
I absolutely love the level of detail provided in this historic simulationbut it takes some abnormal strategizing that will only come natural to you if you're a huge fan of political intrigue. Conquest is largely about connecting familial bloodlines and then designing plots to ensure your family house inherits provinces via warsassassinations and religious ordainment. It's a tough nut to crack
High level strategy at its bestno tactical play here its all about political intriguemarriage alliances
Brilliant gamelove it! In my opinionif you took the battles from Total War and the Campaign style from this
Easily the most engrossing fratricide simulator available.
I think that this games is a great grand strategy game at if you like (or love) the genre you really need to get this!
This is a stellar game that has given me some of the best moments I have ever experienced in gaming. Even if you have never played a grand strategy game before I urge you to put in the hour or two of hard work required to learn the mechanics so you too can experience the plottingintrigue and family violence that is Crusader Kings II. The expansions all add quality features and a Game of Thrones mod is also available.
One of the best games ever. Case closed.
Wicked gamejust takes a while to get into
Crusader Kings II is a greatsemi-addictive real time stratagy game with an enjoyable RPG element added into it. It is a great experience to propell your family forward through Medieval nobility. It is challengingthogh certain characters are much easier than others
One of my fav games of all time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The best family murder simulator I've ever played!
If the amount of hours I have spent of this game is not enough evidence on how much I have enjoy this gameI would argue that this is perhaps one the best games out there.  The endless replayability (I've never had two games play anywhere close to the same) along with the lack of protagacentrism (where events are purely driven by the player) creates a vibrent world where the back stabbing politics is not confined to your own court.  Also the fact you can have an equally enjoyable game playing as the count of Schwyzwith that rivalry over that annoying count of St.Gallen
Amazing gamewould recomend to anyone interested in strategy games
If you like Civilization type of games and RPG's. This is the perfect combination for you. Someone made the perfect video about it to demonstrate its greatness.  http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/02/22/why-ive-spent-over-260-hours-in-crusader-kings-2/?ns_campaign=article-feed&ampns_mchannel=ref&ampns_source=steam&ampns_linkname=0&ampns_fee=0
I love this game with an endless passion but I would like some more help navigating laws like kingdom inheritance as well as stat system for a characters own combat as well as there martial skill
One of the most immersive gaming experiences I've ever had. This is Paradox's finest work so farand that's saying a lot.
Europa Universalis Lite' would best describe this. Don't get me wrong thoughit has some unique features to it. Awesome gamethough I think the initial asking price ($40) is pretty steep. Still
a bit of a learning curvebut once that is hurdled it can give lots of enjoyable moments as far as the game updates and patches gogreat improvements
One of the finest video games ever crafted. Not only is it fun and entertainingbut like Kerbal Space Programyou will find yourself more educated than you were when you started playing.  You need to spend 5 to 10 hours just learning the game
This game is one of best strategy games. You will need some time to learn all the mechanics but then you will love it.  There are so many ways how to improve your empire (or county) and expand your dynasty.   Real masterpiece...
One of my most played and watched games. It leads you though all of european history in crueltrue and sometimes even hillariously funny ways. It s not only fun in the singleplayer and can freely be modded thanks to the steam workshopit can also be a great mulitplayer experience. you can come together and build an alliance against the great forces of Europe or can can slave all our friends
Hands down the best Grand Strategy from Paradox Studios. Take the reigns of a medieval kingdom and guide your family for a period of 400 years. Fight in Crusadesregional wars and also civil conflicts. It's a delicate balance trying to keep your VassalsForeign Leaders and the Pope all happy at the same time but doing so is well worth while.
Pretty fun gamethough it has some massive bugs in regards to workshop items either a) not working or b) stopping the game from working.
Amazingly engrossing dynasty simulator. Kill family members to ensure the right succession! Marry your ambitious daughter off to a 'friend' to sew discord! Yay!
I absolutely love this game! I started in the Old Gods as the Byzantine Empire and restored the Roman Empire and then some. I am still working through this game and I love everything about itespecially the randomly generated events. You could play 2 seperate games with the same character and both games will be different.
A really fun game. Jump into the medieval age at any date from the Invasion of England by William the Conquerer to the Hundred year war. You can play as any Christian(Or muslim with the right expansion) ruler during these times and build up your dynasty(Or make your own with the right expansion)! This game is focused more on politics then fighting. Will you assassinate your brother because you want his land? Or maybe throw your heir on a churchly path becouse you want his brother to succed you? Will you obey the pope when he command you or will you make an Pope of your own? You can rise to rule the world and then see it all crash down around you leaving you with nothing to rule.
Whether you are interested in becoming kingkilling your brother or marriage itself this game will let you explore those fancies. It is up to youthe player
A great gameoverall. Strategicly it can be very hardor it can be reasonably easy (although the unexpected should alaways be expected). One of the greatest strategy-RPG's ever made
This game is definitely worth playing if you like strategy games like Civilization.   It isn't something you can just pick up and playit takes a while to get into as it is very complex with lots of depth and the tutorials included aren't that helpful. There's a lot of information online which helps though. I've already put quite a few hours into the game but feel like I'm still learning how to play it. I think it has good re-playability as there are no set aims and many possible starting points.  Essentially the aim is to ensure your dynasty survives. Sounds simple but it really isn't! You can expand through wars and clever marriages and the occasional assassination but always have to watch out for people plotting against you as untimely deaths and rebellions can seriously spoil your plans.  So in conclusion it really is worth a trybut it might be worth waiting for an offer as it has been in bundles before.
Excellent game that I've personally put 158 hours intomainly mods which is CK2's main core which I love to play. It has such an awesome Modding community and the developers support this behavior. So if you ever get tired of the vanilla gamedon't fret
Very fun game. Become any CountDukeKing
I have played this game for over 1000 hours. It is amazing.
Murdered all but one of my prodigyturned out that son that survived hated me and assassinated me. Gave all most of my land to a noble who for some reason also hated me and rebelled with most of my land.    100000/10
Very fun and detailed grand-strategy game set during the medieval period!
I often find myself killing all of my children so the best child inheriets all of the land... only the strong shall survive  10/10 would murder my heirs again
Had the perfect plan to conquer England. Found out my wife was sleeping around. I became hated and my dynasty fell to pieces after I had all my children murdered. I had to be sure...  10/10
I have enjoyed this grand strategy game quite a bit. It could use a bit of work on making the interface a little more user-friendly. But the detail and nuance of the game are just delightful. A title for the more patient among usbut extremely rewarding for those willing to explore its mechanics. Alsothis game is a must-have for any student of history.
I imprisoned my sonbecouse he didn't like me.  10/10
I never thought managing relationships could be so fun.
Restored the Roman Empire to it's former glorythen I was mudered by my stepsister who was in love with my nephewand I would do it over again. 9.3 Backstabing Relatives out of 10
This is a fantastic game i can play it for hours and not even know it. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves strategy and having a lot of fun.
The Game of Thrones modseriouslynuff said.
Horribly slow paced gamesteep learning and and over abundance of uneeded information. Not worth anyone's time...
who woud not like assassination thre bother
Very Boring
Great game. You Kill Baby'simpregnate your sistersmurder your unwanted sons
Invade France as Brittanniahave the kingdom of Skottland existor even have Denmark own Austria
TLDR: Removed Romuvans337 end date for rajas of india/10 I started out as the humble kingdom of Poland. I sat around doing nothinguntil I realized that I had a higher calling. My job was...to remove all of them damn romuvans up north (not remove kebab). So I did that. I realized that this was not enough. All pagans had to die for their beliefs. And so king Boleslaw the bold of poland soon became Emperor Boleslaw of the Wendish Empire. Then...I died. And everyone hated my heir. After cleaning house a bit (these assassins are amazing) I continued my conquest of northern russia and scandinavia. Then a little button popped up. 'You can press a weak claim on the Kingdom of France.' One war later
This game is really boring if you didn't read the tutorialbut really fun if you did. 10/10 The money paid is worth it!!!
man i cant even get the damn game to work ...keep getting a c++ runtime error when loading sounds
This game has a high learning curvebut when you get into itthere is no finite amount of hours you can spend playing it. It's also a game that leaves you with crazy stories. 10/10.
Amazing gameI can't stop playing. Considering you have to keep your dynasty goingit's surprising how much your dynasty can be your own worst enemy. The amount of times I've had to wage war against brothers who have raised hosts against me
This game ruined my life.  92746835987523678489646538898536539602/10
Amazing game probably my favourate pc game. but im quite fuck?? that i bought it 2 days ago fo £30now its on sale for £8f*** you steam.
Favorite game right now. I HIGHLY recommend it.
Buy this game! If your looking for a game that let's you handle a family dynasty over hundreds of years and choose their life decisions this is the game for you. Anything can happen in this medieval strategy game. You'll spend hundreds of hours delving into this game and you'll enjoy every minute of it.
Createbuildand try to sustain your dynasty in Europe
Very intricate but rewarding game. Highly recommended for all strategy / medieval buff.
A fantasy intrigueempire building game by Paradox Interactive. This Swedish compay will always have a place in my heart.
Thought I had a lot of things. Moralssense of honor and dutyand free time. Have none of it now
An addicting RPG with a great amount of depth. Great replayabilityand the setting is something I'm very interested in.
Got this game for free for a couple of daysneedless to sayI was blown away. I didn't get to play that much but the attention to historical detail and the fidelity to medieval history/combat/economics was absolutely outstanding. Be prepared to get sucked into learning this game if you like it
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ALONE. IT'S THE SAME PRICE AS THE PARADOX GRAND STRATEGY PACK WHICH CONTAINS Europa Universalis IVHearts of Iron 3and Victoria II.  Still a great game
This is the type of game you pick up cause your friend tells youor it just looks neat then before you know ityou are stabbing your uncle in the back to try and gain that one bit of land so you can send your armies on a grand march across finland to stop those vikings from raiding your lands after you made an alliance by marriing your sister off to some tribal leader in the north
very nice strategy games :D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzNjTBRJNzo   This is what the game looks like!
Even if most of my games end because of an event cause 20k of men to attack me for no reason I still keep on coming back to this game.
Gave it a good gobut seems overly complicated and the tutorial probably needs more information. If i wasn't a veteran of RTS games I definately wouldn't have got any of the mechanics.  Overall though if your a veteran looking for a challengeits a good game. Newer players beware of the overly complicated mechanics.  5/10
The only military units you are able to create are units levied from each of the territories. When you use the levy functionyou only get a couple of hundred (maybe couple of thousand if you're luckyand control a faction with large territory) of units. It's almost impossible to defend your territory against attacking enemies when you've only got a couple of hundred units... and they have multiple thousands.  Not only this but the interface system is overly complex
Amazing grand strategy by Paradox Interactivecertainly worth a try if you're into similar titles like Europe Universalis and Victoria yet beware that it differs quite from these in matter of mechanics. The extra DLC is also without doubt worth itbeing able to create your own ruler and change medieval history is simply grand.
CK2 won't make any new converts to Paradox's particular brand of grand strategybut it is very good for what it is. If you like the Europa Universalis series and its historical spinoffs and cousins (VictoriaHearts of Iron
While it has more of a learning wall than a learning curveonce you Kool-Aid Man through the wall it is a glorious game. The AI tends to be rather aggressiveyour vassals are prone to Song of Ice and Fire-style shenanigans and intrigue
Very addicting. A well done and mostly historically accurate High - Late Medieval game. One of my favorites.
Is that really how many hours I have spent on this game? I think the hours prove just how mind-numbingly interesting this game is once you finally understand how to play to it. Learning curve is big butunlike Hearts of Iron 3 manageable and worth it.
This is a seriously fun game. Paradox has created a game that discards their usually staid formula in favour of son killingsister weddingand family inbreeding fun which now spans a half century of more. More than enough worthwhile DLC to sink your wallet and keep you entertained for days at a time.
so i played this game then i stopped. During that period of time i later came to know as sleep i broke out in a cold sweat. Deep philisophical questions plauged me such as: 'if my wife is a lesbian how did she give me syphilis' some time later I awoke with my hands still clutching my mouse only to find out that satan had cured me of the great pox and rewared my suffering with a greater percentage chance of plotting to kill my grandson.
this game has a very steep learning curve. it is well worth the time it takes to learnfor the game has much to offer.
44844easily the best incest sim on the market
Epic is so overuseddatedand just plain awful to use
Great indepth strategy game. Focus on the family is as important as the nation you cantrol. I recoomend watching a tutorial online to help get started.
One of the most intracate and deep games I've ever played but extremelly captivating. Advise you to go see some Let's Play in Youtube from Aruba or Quill18 (for example) and get to it
Crusader Kings 2: It's Game of ThronesThe Gamein the real middle ages. Backstab and incest your way to victory!
lets me crush the usurpers 10/10
Crusader kings 2 is a very hard but great game! It is a strategy game but at the same time a RPG and if u like either of those genres then just buy it!
I am the best kingI keep sleeping with maidens and sent my kindom in a spiraling bankrupcy.
Fun game with a deep political aspect. Requires some patience when it comes to learning about the actual game style and progressbut if you can master that part you will be rewarded with an unique strategy gaming experience.
I've had more fun with this game than any of the myriad grand stategy games I've played over the course of my entire life. If you're new to games like Europa Universalisit might take a good 10-15 minutes to get used to the pace of this game as opposed to other strategy games (don't be afraid to use the fast forward button often!)but once you do... There's such an amazing amount of depth to this game it's astounding.  The bittersweet fun of building a dynasty off of a single noble couple and watching how the tendrils of your bloodline spread throughout the medieval world is something that has never
I had my bodyguard break down a door to frighten teenagers playing a strategy battle gameand then beat them at their own game. Repeatedly. When they still hadn't gotten over my entrance.   Would win again. 10/10  UPDATE:  Had illegitimate daughter mentored by a nun who turned out to be a witch. Child became 'Voice of Satan' and I awoke in the middle of the night to find her sitting on my chest with a dagger through my heartending my dynasty thanks to the succession laws.
I murdered both of my brothers to claim their kingdoms and then my pregnant wife to avoid a succession crisis while creating the Empire of Hispania.  10/10
Ironicallythe greatest 'Paradox' here is how such complex and unwelcoming game can be so appealing. The latest update provides something for people like me who are new to Paradox gamesa hand holding in depth tutorial allowing you to actually play the game and receive prompts as you do so.  CK2 is rife with tiny tabs
Very hard to start with and get intobut once you get over the humpyou wont play any other game as much.
Absolutely fantastic game for the fans of the genre and a great thing to get into if you enjoy or study history. It really does help!!!  Fantastic release from Pradoxcontinually patched and updatedfeaturing interesting DLC that does not spoil the game if you choose not to buy it.   Thoroughly recommend this legendary title.
This is another storming strategy game by Paradox. Dont walk into buying this expecting your usual type of 4xstrategy fare.  You play this game from any point from 1066 up to the end of the middle agesbut not as a country as you would expect but as a charecter (Either duke count
Flawless medieval politics simulation 10/10
Great game but having said that...  The DLC in this game is some of the most blatant money-grubbing I have ever seen. The majority of the DLC is stuff that should have been put in the game for free. For example the unit packs. The unit packs don't add new units in the sense that Total War-type unit packs (CK2 is not this style of game). They just provide a slightly better-looking model for the units that already are in the game. At $2 eachthese are a ripoffas each changes the unit models of only a single culture. I would say a reasonable price would be $2 for a bundle containing all of the unit packs. Incidentally
Extremly fun gamePLAY AND RULE§!
It a mix of grand stratagy with micro mangment. You are not the country you are play as. You are the ruler it sounds obvious but if you have no more family you lose. If you want to play as a country buy EU4if you want to manage a country with 100% of all dlc and no bugs buy Vic 2.
Great Game!
For methe magic of this game is that every action i take has so many variables feeding into the outcome that I can't remember them alland it makes it feel real. CHAOS THEORY!?
An excellent choice for anyone with a love of strategy gamespolitical thrilleror murdering babies.  If you've never played a Paradox Grand Stategy game before
I can see its appeal of a 'grand strategy' / country ruler type of gamebut its complexity is overwhelming for me personally.
I'll just let the devs say it best... (courtesy of Waldetoft)  'Storm the winter shores of England // Fa la la la lala la la lan. Loot and pillage with your warband // Fa la la la lala la la lan. Celebrate the glorious battle // Fa la la la la
massive and fiun gamesteep learning curvedont enter lightly
Fantastic game. I love the depth of strategy and the intrigue! Highly recommend to anyone who likes strategy games!
this game is really fun i like it when we can get our own vessles but the badnews is that i don't know witch is my land
This game is like crack.  It has an incredibly steep learning curve in the beginningbut you'll never find it so rewarding to move up from managing a single county to a never ending state of war trying to keep your kingdom together...but heavy is the head that wears the crownand massive is the time sink of this game. I love every second of it.
Never before have I been able to wed off my parapalegic son to a rival dynasty in order to weaken their biological purity.  Nver before have i had an affair with my cousin or mother in law. Never before have i conspired to depose a king then his allies. Never before have I told the Pope to effectively feck off. Never before has Britannia been an Islamic Empire (contrary to what the media may have you believe).  Takes a while to learnbut its hell of a lot of fun :D
Definitely the most gripping and polished Paradox game I've played. Immensely replayableand constatntly growing/evolving/changing. Sometimes that's a bad thing thoughas Paradox doesn't update their manuals (and the game in it's current form differs greatly from the manual).
Totally and wholeheartedly recommend this game if you like deep and thoughtful (and funny). One of my favorites.
This game is awesome. I don't want to call it 'complicated'but rather 'detailed' there are so many detailsand there is so much to keep track of. It takes a while to get used to and understand everything
Crusader Kings II is for sure one my favorite stratagy gamesmainly for the very addictive gameplay.  It is pretty min-maxy though so if that is a huge turn off than I would look elsewhere. While once you learn what is going on it is very fun while it has a pretty steep learning curve for people who are completly new to paradox games.  10/10 would kill children again
Good game for exercising your barin and having fun
This and EUIV toke up most of my time the last year or so. I never played anything so adicting before in my life. It looked super boring when i first saw itbut then i stuck with itand it has become my favorite game.
This is a fantastic titleworth the praise it's been getting. This is a dynastic simwith a sprinkle of high strategy but don't expect this to be a military sim. Grab it!
At the time of writing this review I've spent twenty-five hours trying to grapple with this gamemy longest stint ending when my French duke died and his lands split among his three terrible children after the promising first son died. Funif you like being tricked and bamboozled while attempting to figure out how to gobble up your liege's land without getting a knife in the back.  Still haven't figured out how to unite Ireland.
This game is about being the most horrible person possible in the name of creating a strong hereditary dynasty. It is very engaging and the story writes itself as you play.
Crusader Kings II - Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Murder and Incest But Were Afraid to Ask  We all have the urges - to marry your motherblind and castrate your fatherkill your brothers and take your sisters (all of them) as concubines - I certainly have those urges
This is the first game I bought on Steamand I love it. I admit I haven't played it much since the recent update but I am busy with university work. The first character I played (using the ruler designer DLC)Geralt petty king of Dyfed (place in Wales)
One of the worst German translations ever )  But still one of the best strategy games ever...after a little time of getting used to the interface...
Before the DLC and Modsthis is hands-down the best game in it's genre. With the addition of the DLC and Modding communitythis game is in my top ten of all games. Purchase with confidence. With just a little time invested (a learning curve
9hrs in and I STILL don't know what I'm doingbut it's fun. At firstI was trying to follow a tutorial for beginners
Got trained by mister Miyagi. Garak teach me to be a spymaster. Robin and Marion joined came to my court. Jesus tell me to made a new relegion. My niece was the reincarnation of Sataneducated by a witchand got forces spawn directly from Hell.   TLDR: 10/10 would kill all my inbreed family again.
Definitely an addicting game. A word of cautionhoweverthis game is extremely difficult to master and takes hours of gameplay to even become functional. If you aren't willing to do a bit of experimenting (and failing
Game of the Year 2012 IMO -- Fantastic game with a top notch community.
In singleplayer this is the best global-strategy game in the world. The developers really hit the flair of feudal politics - much fun to play.  For Multiplayer the mechanics are far to deep. So there is no fluent game because your opponent has to look two minutes for the best woman for the marriage of the third son of his aunt... If you are looking for that kind of game in multiplayerbetter take 'Europa Universalis IV'  anyways: Very good job Paradox!
An amazing game with plenty of fun features to get any history enthusiast interested
Simply one of the best games that Paradox has ever released. My only gripe is the way Paradox releases the DLC. It goes without saying that the expansions to the game are almost necessarynot like Civ 5 necessarybut the depth added to the game is astounding. But for me the portraits and the clothing and unit DLCs really make the game for me. I like seeing the dynastic shields of historical families
WARNIG. This game is not for the impatient and not for people who want to deal with taking about 2 hours to learn the game. BUT once you have the hang of this game it will be one of the most unique and fun experiences ever in your gaming carrier. You must try this game!
I love this game so much! Once you learn the basics it sucks you in and you almost never want to come out. Thouhg maybe I shoudn'tI always use the custom ruler creator because I like to be myself and run Finlandiathen I work to try and stave off the Russian ethnicities.  For those players that are neww and get lost easily
If you want an overcomplicatedextremley difficult and unforgiving gamethis is it!  In all seriousnes
Crusader kings II has limitless potentialThings will never turn out the same wayfrom caliphs converting to Nestorian and dragging the muslim world in choas
This game is VERY niche- hardcore strategy and great for medieval history buffs! I don't know how multiplayer workssince I am a solo-gamer usuallybut will keep you ENTRANCED as you contemplate which women you want to steal from other kingdoms and how to manipulate noble houses and other nations against each other.
I havent played any of the other Paradox interactive grand strategy games.   But having said that i really loved crusader kings 2. The tutorial is very lacklusterand it has a very steep learning curve. Howeverwhen you learn the game it really unfolds. You have to really play with all of the games mechanics to win your wars
Buy it. Mod it. Love it. The most approachable of the paradox grand strat games with an array of excellent mods. Seriouslybuy itget the DLC
Very fun game! I spent hours just to have my kingdom fall..... I do not regret a thing.
I've played over a 1000 hours trust me it's good (if your willing to pay for DLC thoughonly problem)
Grand strategy classic.
1
This is a very intensedetailed and interesting game that will capture your dreaming side. The way it seamlessly integrates your character into the history of so many dynamic situations that evolve around you over game time....it's mind boggling. I recommend this game for any childteen or adult that wants to learn about what it could've been like in ways ...leading a country near the end of the middle ages to the Victorian age. Get this game
The best grand strategy game ive ever played. Anything and everything these Dev's touch is gold.
This a boss  gameno lie. This game fuck? on all those  boi Total War and Civ fuck?.
The best strategy gameever!
Have you ever wanted to kill your wife so you could marry your cousin because she had better stats and you figured the chance of a inbred baby was low enough to warrant popping out some cousin babies? Well step on up and join the revolution. Control a countyduchykingdom or empire while learning words for old laws like Gavel-kind and Primogeniture. If you have 100s of hours to spend on single rounds then you will be pleased as punch to dive into the most complicated and intricate kingdom ruling game ever invented. Ever play Civ and wish you were forced to micro manage even more? BOOM
its ok i guess. maybe it did be more fun if i had the dlcs.
I have 600+ hours on this game. This game has very high replay value.
This is the most amazing game ever.. :D
#5 on my current list of 380 games in terms of playtime
its a bit hard getting to know all the features of the game played for 6 hours still havnt figgured it all out yet but its so fucking fun to play
Had a son who married my niece and had five kidsi excommunicated him imprisioned him killed all of the incest babies and murdered his wife before executing him 10/10
My playtime speaks for itself!
I've only played 6.2 hoursbut it took me about 4 to understand the very basics of the game. The tutorial helpsbut its boring.   It's fun to see things transpire
Convert norse king to Islam on advice of concubineEngland is now ruled by Muslim Vikings.  50/10would convert again :D
The learning curve on this HIGHlike REALLY high. BUTand that's a BIG but (Hence my beautiful Upper case lettering) if you can get through that what's waiting for you is a deep and engaging game. It is simply amazing.
I liked Crusader Kings Two due to the fact that it has a very slow learning curve. Every day it seemed like I learned something new that made the game even more spectacular. I would reccomend this game for very patient players who like a challenge.
The historical depth alone is unrivaled. Add in a Song of Ice and Fire mod to the mixand you have countless weekends of thoughtful delight at your fingertips. May require some studying and effort to adust to its mechanicsthough.
Every duke rebelled and proclaimed independence 69/420
Dominating the Pope as a Germanic Viking Warlord? YAS!
Most Addicting game I've ever played. I certainly haven't even cracked the surface of this epic game. Make the investment
Hands down the most enjoyable strategy game I have played since AOE.
10/10 would become fratricidal sexual deviantmarry my cousinand expel the Jewry again
Great gamei find it a lot easier and more enjoyable to play compared to the other Europa Universalis games. Only thing with this game and the EU games is they all portray open gamingyet they are all sadly still scripted
Was good while free until I had to pay 49.99 to keep goingnot amused. 9/10 IGN
Warning: 'One more turn' is the most told lie of my life. Exclusively by myself to myself. This is a 'One more turn'-Game. My major problem isthat there are no turns. I have no idea how and when to stop to play. And what lies to tell myself about it.
Lovley Game
This is the best computer game ever made. Not because it has good graphics (it doesn't)a pre-made storyline (nope)or twitchy action pewpews (hah!). This is the best computer game ever made because it gives you the tools to build your own story in a compelling
So much going on hereif you took the time to learn everything about itthe game might be enjoyable. The scope of what you can do here is amazing
Thoroughly addicting. Very deep and immersive grand strategy! Took me awhile to get the hang of it but once I did I can't stop playing it! I even find myself dreaming of how I'm going to conquer England while at work..CRAZY! 9/10!
Alrightthis is a bit of a wierd game for me to review. Let's start with explaining what the game is like. It's a geo-political historical simulator / real time strategy game. In layman's termsit's a game where you rule over some dudes. If you've played Civilization
My fuck son killed his fuck son to get to the throne of England. 11/10
I really liked the game and fun. I enjoy most of the game aside from the fact that to play the full game (like muslim players and before late middle ages) you must buy all the DLCs it is annoying because they include these players and maps in the game menu. But once again without these DLC the game is still fun and enjoyed.
Ehnot bad during the F2P period.
One of the best game i have played there isnt anything you cant do moded or not moded 8/10
Nice gamemuch better combat than eu4 and much more intriguing character wise than EU4.
I have wasted too many fun hours on this game. It needs to stop being addictive.
After being suffocated as an infantbecame my 6 year old brotherbeat multiple rebllions and stabilised the county with no help from my regent
By far the best game i've played. Extremely funand i just can't explain how wonderful Paradox Interactive made this game. Simply genius.
Grand strategy where you play as a dynasty more than a nation. Politics and characters play a large part in the game - often marriages and plots are a better way to go than focusing on warfare.
This game is pretty good.
The fact that winning is not so straightforwardmore for deep thinkers if you decide to play seriously. Very enjoyable and addictive.Excellent game.
Times I've given up playing this game = 43 Times I've completely uninstalled as I will neverever play again = 6 Times I've come back to it = 44  It's just like that...  Great game. Hard. Wish I was better. I will get better.
Takes some getting used to and time to understand it but really good game.
Hard to learnbut worth everything when you learn it. It's so amazingI was in doubt the first time I saw it
Crusader Kings 2 is one of the largest games I have ever played. I managed to get this game on sale for like $15 and I'm blown away by the amount of content. Everything is so deep and complex. I could write pages and pages on just one of the many aspects this game has to offer. If you didnt already knowthis is a massive RTS/Turn BasedGrand Strategy game (set in medieval times of course). You are kinda like God but in the sense that you are Santa Claus in the movie Elf with Will Ferrel. You can pretty much do whatever you want except you need people
Crusaders Kings 2 is a strategy game including a bit of roleplay. Indeed you control the decisions of your charactertry to improve his statsmarry him and breed him to have the better offsprings. Your ambition: make your dynasty the most important
It is a great game. If you are like me you will have a hard time at first but you will get used to it. Other than that the game is good if you like history like i do.
Phenomenal game. Amazing depthgameplayand scope. Its hard to get into but once you do you'll be sitting here like me
OkayI got this event where strange people ask me to join their sect of the ''first gods''. I accept. Laterthey ask me to come and to perform a ritual. I accept Then motherf**king Cthulu began to appear! I kill him (don't ask how) Gain deicide trait.  10/10 Would kill gods again
Families! You can't live with them. But you certainly wont survive without them. 'Can I have a fief of my own?' 'NO Goddammit!!!' *Sigh* Here comes another rebellion.
This game is EPIC! I love the challange and depth this game provides. It is easy to loose hours upon hours into this game without realizing it. To be able to survive and have your dynisty endure is no easy taskbut thats what makes this game so awesome. No matter how small or large your house/country/empire getsyou will always face new chalanges to keep you on your toes. My only disapointment
This game has taken over 135 hours of my lifeand I don't mind...  Howeverthis game is far from perfect
Created the Kingdom of England. Got a fuckfuck son. Lost half the country to the pope. And had rebellions everywhere  I r8 8/8 m8!
This game is really solid as a strategy game. what I particularily like about it howeveris playing as a specific person rather then some disembodied spirit of a nation like most other grand strtegy games makes the whole thing feel more personal and real.
CK2 is an amazingly complex web of personal intrigue. First finding out how to simply play this game may be a challangebut one well worth the effort. If you want a tutorialtry checking out Northernlion on youtube. Despite the learning curve however
Played as William the fuck0 Minutes into the gamehe decides that he wants to build a flying machine
I think the best part of this game is the feeling of immersionof being just another fish in the pond. Sureyou can rule over Europe
Digital crack. No beter way to describe it.
I used to have a lifefamilykids
An amazingly well-thought out grand strategy game that's bound to kill days off your life if you allow it. In Crusader Kings IIyou'll forge an empire that will either survive long enough to be legendary or simply crumble into the forgotten parts of history. In CK IIit's quite clear that the focus is on creating/maintaining the legacy of your kingdom and not world domination as a result
145 worth of DLC  Would probably be more interested in buying all this if I'd bought it at launch
The only grand strategy game truly from the ruler's perspective.  Epic feudalism simulator.
Played the Free to Play for 6 Days Deal for the full 6 Days! Love Marrying my Court to Suiters that like to be Married. Alsolike how everyone has Personality Traits. Like how you can Educate your Child to become or not become their Parents' Personalites. All I don't really like is the Runtime Error that can happen in-game. I get a fairly good Game out of this gameanyways. The Game lasts for about an Afternoon
within the short span of 3 hoursi killed 8 wives and assassinated the pope and two different kings. i committed fratricidepatricide
Played during the free trial periodon the fence about buying it - just seems high price of $40.00 for a 3 year old game that still has some bad bugs to it.  The Good: Very immersivelots of historical accuracy with the game. The diplomacy / spy system seems more efective then in games like Total War and Civ. The NPC's are complex and react to what you do based on their own vices/virtues. Manageing armies is pretty easy
This is a very good game in that it asks you to push buttons you never thought to push. Wish there was more interaction in the battles but eh if you do your weddings right you'll be birthin great generals and princes in no time.
Playing as the Byzantines.  Play Emperor character as a complete Cassanova.  3 wivesa dozen lovers5 legitimate
Very in depth and complicated but rewardinggreat game in all but has steep learning curve dont expect to get good fast.
Decent game if you can get passed the near hair ripping frustration of trying to learn the damn game. Tutorial doesn't offer muchif anyhelp. I ended up just watching YouTube tutorials. Beyond that though
If you like plot game. this is the good one
I believe that this game is among the best stratage games. The first time I playI was absolutely attracted by the fantastic map including the whole Europe and part of Asia. In this gamewhat the players should do is not only to conquer the world but manage your own house as well. As a game reflecting the Medieval Era
love the gamehowever mods and dlc wont work with my copy anymore
Out of all the breeding simulators ive played this has to be the best.
great game
I love this gameit seemed complex at first but once I got how to play itit was absolutely smashing.
Love it.
I played on the free weekend My experience was magnificentI prefer this to Rome Total War 2...  The depth is amazingso lifelike. I recommend this game
Funand very addicting. You can murder your way into every throne in Europe! And Africa! And then go invade Asia for good measure!
I have had it for like 3 days and already played 40 hours
Always diffrent every time I playvery enjoyable give it a chance!

played it for months and still love it
Dude how the fuck do you play this game?
First objective in tutorial is to get married. All top candidates are your cousins.  10/10 Would inbreed again
Well when entering the tutorialactually having pompts woould be helpful.
Wordy and confusing. doesnt even give you the satisfaction of watching medieval knights go fuedal age with morning starys and lances on each others a$%es.
This game takes several minutes to load. The tutorial does not explain adequately how to choose an ambition &amp once the tutorial is finished the diplomacy &amp presevering your kingdom becomes harderthere seems to be no way to balance generating income &amp building a decent sized army. CK2 also autosaves frequently &amp locks the game for several seconds. I do not recommend this game.
Downloaded the demo.. looked at it for about 15-20 minutes.  There comes a time when a game just has too many buttons and info screens to look at.  This game looks like the opposite of fun.  In factit looks like work... more work than sitting in an office doing paper work.  So unless you're the kind of person who likes having 100's of different info screens to look at and 100's of different numbers to look at. I'd stick with Total War for your Epic Conquests.  This is not a game. It is a half-fuck? attempt to make you feel like you actually have to take on the responsibilities of someone who's trying to run a country and all the red-tape that goes with it.  And if you can get past the red-tape portion of the game. I suppose it might get more interesting... but I'm not going to put in that kind of effort. Life is too short to spend it on a game like this.
Just... Great.
The only game i know where you can go from owning just Dublin to somehow creating the Kingdom Of Jerusalem all while handling traitorshorny lovers who happen to be your brothers wifeawesome story events that shape your character
Just bought this game after checking out all the rave reviews. Have spent 3 hours trawling through forums attempting to find a fix for whatever problem won't let me even launch the game. NOTHING WORKS !!! I can't even get on to Paradoxes forum to ask for help. This may be a great game but currently my £29.99 feels wasted.
I like the game logic and running as itr runs quite well on my PC but I would also discourage people from it as it is a real pain stuck in ur fuck to learn how to play it. Watch some vids and tutorials and it should be ok  6/10 :)
very fun and very hard!!!   P.S. watch out for what charachter you play!!!
This game was advertised as Free to play and purchasable at 75% off until Monday 10pm PST. It seems that at noon PST that was no longer the case. It is unortnate because i wanted to buy the full packagebut I will not do it at $160. Maybe next time there is a sale.
The first time I played it was only free for a day...played for 20 hours.  This game starts a little slowbut but once it gets rolling and you learn what you're doing it is really rewarding.
I honestly have no clue what's going on... I just kind of click things and wait for my son to get assassinated because I made some random guy mad.  Seems like fun thoughjust no idea what I'm doing.
Loved this game. Kind of annoyed that none of my dynasty ever turned gay.
After a year i finally have half of norway under my control. I go to the top of my castles tower and enjoy the view of my kingdom. It looks beautifulespecially on a clear brisk day. Oh waitwhats that in the distance?!?   Leaned over to far and fell to my death!   Great game! :D  10/10
Yesall the yes.
I had a five year old child murdered for a piece of land in Bum-fuckIceland. Killed my baby brother for a juicy slice of iceland then had an affair with the young lady destined to be his wife. Watched 10 crusades for Jerusalem fail before Jerusalem became the capital of a HereticMerchant Republic....  10/10
Black King of Scandanavia
kept me interested for hoursso many different things can happen
Create a empire from nothing and a ruling family from a low born. The options are endlesshighly recommend this game!
A decent and complex game.  7/10
Before even playing the game get the old gods DLC. Start of as the jarl or king of Ostlandet and take over all of norway in 4-5 years. Have about 8 sons and not 1 daughter. I die and my sons split the land. Slowly retake and solidfy my kingdom after 4 rebellions. Take over all of scandnavia my son only son inherits and is killed by a rankless courtier.  50/10
Formed Germany Had fun
Great game! Steep learning curve but don't be intimidated!
Ever wanted to rule your own kingdom? this may be the game for you. What this game has going for it is excellent playability as with most games in the series. The only major problem is that you get nickled and dimed in order to unlock all factions and playable scenarios. Do not buy this game unless you are buying the full pack.
Overral a very complex game. But it lacks a LOT of details unknown in the beginning. The controls are a bit messy for some actions and it takes some time to get the hang of it.  But would recommend for those that are in-depth strategy loversso to speak.
I've now Imprisoned and executed 3 cheating wives and their vile fetusesthis has to end soon.... I'm running out of Piety! 10/10
i dont own this game. volvo plz
THE fuckING TUTORIAL CRASHED!!???!! then it says raise an army and fleet... and load the army on it. and you fucking cant. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.
Pretty complicated at firstbut if you watch a few tutorials and get your head around it this game is pretty fun!
Is your heir a homosexual? 1. Have him frame for an accident. 2.Have him captured. 3.Have him castratedblinded and than hanged. 4. ?????? 5. PROFITYOU ARE A KINSLAYER
Brilliant gamemade even better by a Game of Thrones mod. Well worth the moneyand well worth getting the mod.
10 hours in...... If this was real life I would be burning in Hell for sure.... Nothing better than gaining the trust of everyone who loves and all the people you rule over.... Then in just a matter of an hour formulate plots to murder all of your legitamate family members.. Impregnating some random fuck? and puting the entire future of you kingdom in the hands of some fuck son of yours....
I'm writing this after my first full playthrough.  It took me while to decide whether I should recommend this game or not. The thing is CK2 is a great gamebut it is also a heavily flawed game.  The game struggles with it's mechanics. Generallywhat is fun about CK2 is not supported by it's mechanics. You will find it extremely irritating to play your dynasty without slipping into an min-maxing mode. It's not really that min-maxing would be required
one of best games
To much DLC costs like 100 something dollars on a 40 dollar game but really fun
In this game you will learn the truth about your country hestory  Recommanded game 9/10
Difficult to get intoor so I initially thought. Turns out what 'bugged' me the most was an actual bug with the map and resolution. Got over that with a fixafterwards began trying to play and was extremely bored. There's very little that made sense and even less to do aside from war. I like the basis of the game I enjoy strategy games from mid 90s up til now but this one for as hyped as it was sold to me
Very good game with complex mechanics. Learning it might seem hard at first but watching videos on youtube helped me understand the basics
Why yes I do want to marry my neighbors and then steal the land from under them!
I just tested it over the free weekend. It's a really good game and super fun once you get into it and understand it ^^ However I think the price is very high for a 3 year old game. I'm not going to buy it for that reason. If you don't have a money issue and really like in-depth character building and medieval strategygo for it!
Not a choice for whom have following traits Slothfulcontentwroth  Must buy game if you have following traits Cruel
For years I have played strategy games like Total War and Civilization. I always found that the games were focusing too much on aspects like combat or citybuilding. I played Rpgs and found them too easy to Min/Max or too restricting with their story. Games kept moving away from the little bit of fun I could create and I had nearly given up. Then I found Crusader Kings II.  People are right to say the game has a steep learning curve. The game is hard to learn and almost impossible to master. CK2 doesn't hold your handbut it doesn't slap it away either. It's more like it looks at your hand and then turns away and keeps doing it's thing and you can come or not. Thats what makes the game so fun. The world itself is living and breathing and you just happen to be one part of the larger picture.   What I find fun about Ck2 is that I set the goals and objectivesand the game either allows it or messes it up so much that I set an even better objective. The game will not tell you what to do
Wife #1 only birthed me 2 daughters and didn't want to F* after 30. Figured I'd do something nice for a change so I bought her a falcon and she was all smitten with love. But her chaste side didn't like the lover side so she got REALLY upset at me for trying to get her into the mood. Divorced her a$$ and married her off to some nobody in Siberia.  Wellnow my new hot blonde wife from Norway -- she's a wild one. Gave me two sons and a large enough army to take down England.  Best second wife ever!
Never had so much fun marrying people since Sims. Alsomakes games like Rome TW seem like child's play. Hours of fun. Days and weeksactually. Highly recommended.
Prepare to spend hours. Great gameplaygraphics and historic content.
CK2 is the best strategy game I've played in a very long time. It has unlimited replay value to go with it's insane depth. Definitely worth the buy.
Played as Ragnar Lodbrokhad much fun until i got hit by a seagull
THE strategy game if you enjoy the 'Middle Ages'. Plenty of cultures and perspectives to choose from. The DLC's really enhance the experience. It's really satisfying to see a dynasty (and nation!) grow over the centuries.
A very immersive and addicting game once you get past the steep learning curve. Then againthis game makes complete and utter failure a whole lot of fun.
First things firstyes this game has a TON of DLCI know. However none of it is really nessisary to enjoy this game and this is by far one on my favorite games. It's just.. so damn engrosing to just pick some random duke in the middle of europe and just try and make due with all you can and even try to grow your power. There will be unexpected pitfall to all of your plans and some times they can utterly ruin you
This is a good game. It is certainly not graphics intensive. I often leave a game running in the background while I work on school stuff that accounts in part for the number of hours that I have spent playing it. It's also a complex game. It may take some people a while to get into it. The reason that you should buy this game is the quality of the gameplay. This is a cross between the SimsCiv 5 and the Total War series. Mostly the Sims and Civ 5. I cannot imagine a better simulation of governance in feudal EuropeAfrica and Asia. It also fits in well (I hear) with other games that are made by this same dev
In one playthroughI managed to assassinate my own inbred character...... 10/10
After finally getting the hang of things I reallly like this gameit's everything I wanted CIV5 to be. There is an unfortunate side effect of time traveling howeveras I find myself several hours further into the future each time i play it.  Loads of expansions I want to try now
Fantastic strategy game. Learning curve is a little steepbut lots of fun. Just wait until the Isle of Man is the sole bastion of the Kingdom of Jerusalem or Norway become part of the Holy Roman Empire. Alsoif you can make your fuck son the Pope
founded the empire of Britannia banged my gay son's wife to he found out and assassinated me.  10/10 would bang son's wife again
Ok... Lets focus on gameplay... a bishop killed my wife but the pope would not allow me to imprison the bishopso I created another popekilled the bishop
I have really enjoyed the game - to the point that I have purchases almost all of the expansions and the sequel game Europa Univ. IV - it's really been great.  The depth of the game is amazing ... it's really powered by the legacy concept and managing and expanding your influence through marriages and in game events. The only realy draw back that I have com eto is that I wish I could get a little more out of the combat portion. You really don't have much effect on the outcome of skirmisheswhoever has the most troops generally winsit would be nice if there was an option to oversee battle strategy (atleast for those battles led by your ruler) - but other than the limited combat portions it's just a really fun game.  It has multiplayer capacity but I would not recommend it - it takes forever to play and just really doesn't move at the same place - but as a single player sim you really couldn't as for much more.  9/10
Medieval politicsschemingplotting - Game of Thrones in the real world pretty much :)
The most in-depth medieval simulation availablewhich is as to be expected from Paradox.  The only downside is the learning curve is absolutely MASSIVE.  The basics of the game are relatively easy to understand and graspbut to be successful
This is one of the best games iv ever played no more to be said 10/10
Just great game. More that 160 hours on it (on my second account).
My advice is for the first game or two you play be patiant and persever. For this game can be alittle complexand before you no it one minute your the Emperor of Constantinople the nest a duke with a couple of counties. Which is what haoppened when I first played. But after that is up to you what you dotry and become an emperor from count or try and take over the world or reverse a historical situation like make islam a minor religion and return the Zoaroastrains to the rightful lime light. It is entirely up to what you want to do so make your mark of history.
good game for the lovers of the genreit will be a classic paradox gamepretty complicared Ai but after few curses and retries u get the hang of it.But pretty expensive another wihlist item....it will b value for money
Extremely good grand strategy  Select whatever countdukeking
Great game! Rajs of India? wow. You guys planning to add in Eastern Asia yet? China in this will pwn
Love it.
i chose being a tribal pagan leader and got a wife and two concubines i am now happily living my life as a 53 year old with over 70 kids the dream of 100 is real
for the first 138.1 hours it was really good but then it started crashing on the loading screen and wouldn't let me play the gamebut yeah this is the best family simulator out there
Started a new game. Attempted to create an heir with toasty hot intercourse. Died with a 10% chance of my heart being unable to take the strain of my efforts.  10/10 would die of sex agian.
To anyone who loves strategy games with a lot of depth I highly recommend this game. The only problem I have with this game is the amount of cash you make seems low. I have around 100 hours in this game at the time of this review and that time was split pretty evenly between two different saves I have of two different dynasties. This is a great gameit does have a very steep learning curve but once you get the basics down this game is a blast and incredibly easy to sink a whole weekend worth of time into. Great game I give it a solid 9/10.
Family hates me.  My wife tried to kill me after I imprisoned my sonwho tried to assassin me. A fuck of minewho I sent into exil after he demanded several times to become the next ruler
Crusader Kings II is by farone of my favourite games ever. Sure it has a steep learning curve and sureit may have a lot of DLC
My gripes: I've never played a multiplayer without a crash or a desync. The tutorials are terribleand take up way too much time. The learning curve is a steep slope and then a slightly less steep slope. Basic featureslike character customization
I've played this game a little bit. Seems pretty good. Gonna start playing it more seriously.
This Game is addiction simulator
0/10 Hunting dogs but no cats. Dogs have no conflict :(. Dogs aren't playable.
I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a new challenge and a fresh face on civilization development/strategy style games. The game is addictive! It's got masterful battlesfun eventsand an awesome modding community that always keeps things fresh and allows for near infinite replayability.  The only two cons I can think of is that the multiplayer is really janky at times
250+ hours and just finished a first campaign without any DLCs. If you want a game to distract yourself for hours and hours without doing muchthis is the best one you can get!
This game is perfect. One of the best strategy games ever. As a medieval history buff the history is flawless and the gameplay is flawless.
By the grace of the HeavensParadox has bestowed upon us a gem. A pure gem.  Confusing enough to keep you lookingbut not so much
Really funreally in depth and details game but can have a VERY steep learning curve. Once you learn what youre doing it's hours of fun as you conquer your way across the old world. Focuses more on roleplaying and developing your character and familyas opposed to action. You don't command the armies or individual troops
At first I was completly lost at trying to figure out this gamebut now that I understand it I can't stop thinking about it or playing it. I would punch a baby if it was between me and this game.
This game takes some getting used tobut once you get the ball rolling it just keeps on going. This game has so many possibilities and all I can say is its f****** awesome not to mention the attention to detail that the developers really put into this game is a plus for history buffs everywhere (like me) BIG THUMBS UP
Amazing game for people that like to role-play medieval characters. The game of thrones mod is also super awesome and you should get it now!
A must for any true stratergy gamer. Excellent value for money in that you can replay an almost infinite number of times and it will never get stale. If you find the Total War series overwhelmingly hard or complex this isn't for you though.  A vibrant modding community also exists for this gameso even if it does somehow get stale there are still ways to keep things fresh.  Unfortunatly the cost if rather insane £30 for the basegame and WAY too many costly DLC packs. If you get this game make sure you get it when its on a substantial offer. Alsodon't be frivolous in buying the small content packs
This game is awesome and with updates continues to get better. The learning curve is sharp and the lack of any type of real tutorial makes it hard but it is also part of it's charm. There are much more in-depth and well written reviews than I am going to give but get past the learning curve. What you will find is an amazing experience that will throw you for loops and have you creating storylines in your head. This is Games of Thrones!
The normal game is  amazing however  mods such as AGOT   are even better.
why does it cost so much
You really owe it to yourself to play this game. It's unlike anything I've ever experienced. For beginnersit's a bit daunting. But once you realize what's going onand the game is all about YOUR choices rather than you playing some scripted program
This is a great game! Love it!!
One of Paradox's best.
Accidently got my king in a matrilineal marriage. Had three kids before I realized that my game would end on my kings death. Imprisoned my wife and children. Executed them all. Re-married. Had 4 kids. Life went on. 10/10
Quite possibly the best strategy game I've ever playedand I've played Medieval 2 to death. The Medieval era is one of my favorite genres of strategy gamesand I honestly think that Crusader Kings 2 is what Medieval 2 WANTED to be.
My genius King loved by his vassals was assainated by a duke with 100 relashonsmy succsesor made Joffrey Baratheon look like a saint and within 5 years 3 civil wars broke out.   10/10 would be betrayed again
Not sure why reviews of this game still happen. It's stupid good.
I have exams to study for... fuck it. Probably learn more playing this anyway.
s'alright...
I unified the Scandinavian territories then died of an infected wound from a hunt before my wife could give birth to a child that wasn't mine (charinfoI ain't having no illegitimates take my dynasty).  Then I played it with the GOT Mod and died of greyscale.
Very fun and i'm able to run in on my laptop
Definitly getting hooked on this game. It's pretty awesome.
Absolutely one of the best value for money purchases I've made in my gaming timethe amount of hours of entertainment to cost of the game is great.   The thing that puts some people off is the amount of dlcbut if you factor in the amount of flavour they add into the game it's generally worth it.   Definitely reccomend.
Bought for myself and for a friend. My friend immediately gave up because his wife never gave birth to a sonso he lost all of his territory. I'm 31 hours inI still have no idea what's going on.  10/10
Quite possibily the best medieval strategy game ever made. Strategic marriagesassassinationsmilitary conquest
This...  If you enjoy Game of ThronesMedieval HistoryThe Crusades
The game never ceases to entertain me at my most bored moments. The amount of time the game consumes is much beyond any game I have ever played before. And that's just for one single game from start to finish. When a certain game claims to have 'hours of gameplay CK II provides weeks and months if you truly wish to finish a single game.  The only two downside is the sheer number of DLC's and the costs and the extremely steep learning curve. The costs are well worth it for me and the learning curveI believe is mostly due to the complexity of the game itself.  The intrigue
I Don't even know what to sayITS COMPLICATED  INCESTINCEST EVERYWHERE WAR
u strategize for years to take over the worldand then your imbecile son inherita and ruins it all. what a rush!
Love diplomatic gameplay of Total War serie but hate RTS? Play this diplomatic game which span over 300 years of crusade era.
Very good and entertaining.
This is the game that keeps on giving. It's a European sandbox of epic proportions. You'll follow a dynasty from it's roots as an x and work to fight the rival y until you've made a name for your house to span the histories.  x = ancient trading republicmongol hordetribe
On the orders of meBrian mac Brian Ua Briainthe Petty king of Mumu
I have never hated and loved a game so much. The depth of Crusader Kings II is astonishing. With any level of difficulty and a MASSIVE world. Not to mention its home to the best Game of Thrones Mod out there. This game is a must buy.  This is definantly one of my favorite games on steam  Pros - You can marry your sister - You can have kids with your sister - You can kill your wife (who is your sister) - You can marry your child to a family member and then marry their child.... - You can now form your own Kingdoms/Empires - Hilarious events and situations. (Like having a gay king with no kids whos trying to get with his wife who has 'lovers pox' - Supports multiplayer - Amazing Replayablitiy  Cons - Odd crash now and then - Multiplayer can become desync'ed which can cause a headache - Updates can corrupt your Ironman save file =( - Gavelkind Succession  Overall a great gamehighly suggest buying.
I love this game! It is everything it promisesI can't stop trying to build a Scandinavian Empire and kicking the Christians out of Europe. I haven't done it yetbut I love trying.
Unless you already spend an inordinate amount of free time staring at a screenI would advise to steer clear of this one. Use the time to work on your thesisor music theory
great game. Its hard to understand at first since its so complex but once you understand ittge game is amazing.
If you want a game that has unlimited gameplay possibilities while still retaining core strategy gameplayCrusader Kings II is for you. This game still has 2 more years of planned expansions in the future until 2016 according to the studioand the modding community has yet to slow down.   10/10  Crusader Kings II is a Paradox masterpiece
good but to many DLCs
I gained the depressed trait and had the option to kill myself.  Arteh was also cuckolded thrice within the space of two games.  10/10
Watched someone play this game on a lets play channel. Fell in love with it. The basic graphics are fine because of just how deep this game gets. Reminds me of old Nintendo Romance of the three kingdoms games with rpg elements and randomized games. No two games are the same.
I think I'm finally getting the hang of the game.
Complete fuckt. As much money as I have spent on this gameand it doesn't even want to launch. How doesn't Steam have a phone service to deal with this stupid crap?
WARNING: This game will consume your life!! You will always be tempted to play just a little longer in order to see your last machination come to fruition. But heymy life is hella boring so I'm fine with it!  For my first playthroughI played as a Portuguese noble and founded the Hispania Empire after years of struggle. A tip for new players - The Iberian Peninsula is a hard place to start because it has muslims and different catholic realms and the whole situation can shift very quiclky but it is a nice (yet brutal) way of learning the game.   So really
Crusader Kings II is one of the best grand-strategy games ever made. It achieves its goal of portraying the epicness of medieval rulership without losing focus on the small intrigues that made the medieval age so interesting.   It fits different playstyles: DiplomatWarmongerSpymaster
Dont Trust Steam^ i have about 600 hours in this game  Base game is ok but breaks with every other update.  Buy it for game of thrones mod.
Best game to play when you're smoking pot.
Brings out the worst in every onegraet game.
At first it's all 'Wha?' because it's not about managing a nation and all that jazzbut managing a dynasty who manages a nation (Or your holdings). It emphasizes family and alliancesmurder plots to those rat fucks who try to press claims in your land and forging bonds through marriage so you can call in a 800 pound gorilla to a street fisticuff brawl. It's about securing your place in history and not losing your holdings to a fracturing kingdom upon your death. But it's really about what you want to do with the nation you choose. There's no real end goal and that kind of freedom takes some getting used to. But...  Do you want to be Emperor? King of your own fiefdom? Be the patriarch of a family who calls holy wars or is a conqueroring fuck?? that constantly calls wars? Do you want to chill on what you got? Do you want to marry a gorgeous duchess who upon her untimely death that was definitely not a murder plot by your hand bequeaths you her land because you were her heir and you had no kids but she was a vassal to the Kaiser of the HRE and then because her lands are now yours you are now a vassal to the Kaiser with all your previous lands?  It truly is an astounding game
Hours of playtimeendless replayability. The modding community also has some wonderful additions to an already great game.  HoweverI do not like the rediculous amount of piece-wise DLC. If you download the expansion
An amazingly engaging game.... when things are happening. On the other handan amazingly boring game despite all your best efforts to make things happen.
You won't find a roleplaying game with as much depth and intruige as this game. Plenty to do and an almost infinite amount of replayability and adventure. Deep and malicious assassination plots are dotted with bits of humor and sarcasm in such a way that it makes you giggle every time something goes wrong or out of control. If you want a challange and love roleplaying and empire building simulations this is the game for you.  (editI missed a major point and wanted to go over it and explain my reasoning)  Now some of the reviews that are negative because of the absolutly massive amount of DLC there is in the gameand that is true. If you theoretically wanted to buy all the DLC in this game it would run you up 200 dollars
That game killed my brain.
If the sheer number of positive reviews hasn't already gotten you to buy thisthen all is lost. If the price tag really is making you hesitatewait until it's on sale or just MAN UP YO because it's worth it.  This is probably my favorite game made in the last 10 years. I made this realization upon owning and playing it for 10 seconds. I'm... I'm in love.
Pretty fun gameonly spent 200 hours learning it. Now I can begin playing.
Good Game that has no no real goal and is more about weird fuck that could happen than here is your victory state.
I had 10 children in 2 years... 10/10
Conquer France from your brother as a Islamic King of Englandall while marrying your cousin and having a son that becomes the spawn of Satanwhile formulating your plans to convert to Zoroastrianism.  Crusader Kings II has to be one of my favorite games of all time
I played it  I didn't understand how to play  Then i thought screw it and tried  Now it's the best.  This review still isn't helpful.
Trying to figure out the game. Constantly starting and restarting the Norman conquest of England.  Hour 12finally took England. And then the Nords took England from me. Game Over.  Restart. Took England. Married my daughter to King Duncan of Scotland. Formed an alliance to take down the Nords. Sued for a white peace.  Now the vassels are uprising because I'm a tyrant. Oh well. Squash their rebellion. Throw them in Prision. Strip them of their titles and banish them.  Ohnow I'm a tyrant. More rebelion. More prisioners. More titles revoked.  I'm pushing 60 and England is an elective monarchy?... Time to kill my rivals.  Almost 70 and my son died a mysterious death. More rebellion but a chance to revoke dutchies and place my few friends in power.  Pushing 80 but my grandson is set to inherit the throne.  85.  88.  Finally. Death at 89.  Now my vassels are uprising because I'm young and weak
I've been playful with my review for this game in the pastbut not today. Having put more time into Crusader Kings 2 than shows on my Steam profileI can say I have finally reached what I believe to be a good thought for the game in question.  Pros of CK2: 1
Good gamegood graphics and lots of expansions.
Like Dwarf Fortressthis is a game about manipulating electronic homunculi who have their own hopes and dreams in a complex simulated world.  Unlike Dwarf Fortressthis game was made by people who understood that you have to be able to learn to play a game in order to play it. It comes with helpful descriptions of the relevant rules that pop up when you need them
BEST GAME OF THE LAST 3 YEARS
Amazing and complex game! Does suffer from late game performance issues though. Still 9/10!
If you like the idea of a role playing real time strategy game this one is for you. A real world historical strategy gamewhere you create a dynasty and then try to survive in till the 1400's. The entire game is based on objectives you set for yourself.. You can try to rule a single Dutchy for the entire gameor try to become an emperor and control vast areas. Restore the holy roman empire
Too much DLC. Vanilla game sucks without the DLC. Best bet is to pirate this or at least pirate the DLC.
This is by far the most addicting and entrancing strategy game I've played since I was introduced to the Civilization games back in the 90s. As you can see I've spent many sleepless nights worrying about my dynasty and I've still only experienced a small portion of what the game has to offer. I've been well pleased... I plan to pick up the additional DLCs as they go on sale. I *might* have even learned a bit of history in the process. :-)  Awesome game.
I fell in love with this game from watching people play it on YouTube. When I bought it I learned it was really hard. I don't play it much but my wife has spent a good amount of time learning it's itricacies. In the end it is an amazing game that I wish I was talented enough to master. Have fun but be prepared for a challenge.
Great strategy game. The best of our times.
The character this game brings to strategy games is refreshing. Can be hilarious at points with rich plots made by your choices. If you like strategy games this is a must for your collection as its in a class of its own. 10/10
Awesome gameeven if I don't really like the battles in iteverything is automatic. But you have so much else to do ! Say farewell to your social life !
The main aim of this game is to paint the map in your favourite colourover all the other weaker colours. (feel free to make your own aimsbut don't let your dynasty die out or lose all your county holdings.) It's not that simple however... This is medieval dynastical politics afterall.  (a.k.a Sims + Grand strategy)
Absurdly complicatedbig on historical accuracyand yet lots of freedom to do whatever you want!
Awesome game. I just finally bought all the DLC due to the Oct saleinstead of dropping 200 bucks I spent only 50.  Broke/10 would buy when on sale again.
Absof*ckinglutely brilliant..
good strategy game all maps of old kingdoms and empires liked !!!
Honestly one of the best strategy game EVER!! They made it an unbelievably complete game with endless possibilitiesthe only thing that it does need is the player's fantasy and than it can reveal a gameplay beyond imagination.... I highly recommened it for hardcore strategy players!
These fucks earn their money
my experience in crusader kings so far:  -Dont know who to play as or what period -Decide to play as Rohanaa small nation located on the southern tip of sri lanka -start with an army of 21000 men -im also at war with an empire in mainland india -divide my forces and soon conquer most of sri lanka -feels good.jpeg -marry my sister to my son to insure that he produces only the most royal of offspring -speed up time so my i dont have to wait for my royal heir to be produced -sped up time to much -within a second armies sweep in to sri lanka and dsetory my kingdom and i could nt react in time  11/10 would try speedy incest again
I click buttons and it lets me have sexual relations with other peoples wives.  10/10.
Started out as a one Norse county ruler.  Invaded southern England.  Took over CornwallMerciaWessex
History has a exciting and morbit charme. Play this game and you will understand the actions of our ancestors by being thrown into they're shoes.
I thought it was like Europa Universalis IV. I try to conquer territories with no luck. I don't even know what I am doing or how to play it. Super awesome game 10 out of 10 (10/10)
This is one of the best game i have played.  It can take time to learn the game. bet what fun it is. If your having hard times learning the game like my. do the same thing iand go to youtube. there are some great tutorials there.  Im playing the game with all the DLC's.  Now i rule the scandinavian empire. Greet times.
I've spent 300+ hours playing this gameand I'd spend another 300+ hours playing it some more. Tired of the base game? Those sexy total conversion mods add even more fun to an already appealing game.   Glory to Byzantium.
This game... It's hard for me to describe. It's incredibly interestingfunbut brain smashingly deep and slow paced. I'm just going to be frank with you. This game
stuck on the first level :/
Very good game! Started playing it after many hours in EU4and IMHO it surpasses EU in depth of the game world. Managing your dynastyrole playing as a drunkard
The only game where killing your over ambitiousinbred clubfooted son with a lisp is okay.
I love this gameI have poured over 100 hours into it with no signs of losing interest. For me it is the wide variety that keeps it interesting. Tired of playing as a european king and abiding by Catholic ruleswhy not play as a Muslim Sultan with 4 wives. Or maybe you just want to be a viking a raid everyone else.   Of course this style of game is not for everyone. If you are not a fan of slower paced strategy games then this game is unlikely to hold your interest. Similarly if you don't care about history one aspect of the appeal is removed.   Finally the DLC issue has to be addressed. Yes there is a lot of it and yes certain game mechanics that I think should have been included in the main game are packaged as DLC. My recommendation would be to buy the game and DLC when it is on sale. I picked up the base game during the summer sale for about $20 and I just recently picked up most of the DLC in a package deal for about $25. So if you work it right you can get everything for about the full price of a new game.
So much time given. So much fun had.
After you play this game (with all of major DLC of course)every other game will be a slight disappointment
AMAZING!!! Only one problem... I DONT UNDERSTAND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
many hours gone down the drain crusading for 'pope BANANAHAMOCKLOVER the 3rd'  +rep for everything
This is an incredibly complex game. If this is a pro or a con is up to your preferences.  This is grand strategybut focused more on intriguemanaging your vassals and expanding your dinasty than on simple tactical combat or just building units and upgrades. It is sometimes more like a simulator than a wargame. You can choose how much micromanagement you want to do or how much you want to 'roleplay' your ruler. It is a very open experience - it doesn't give you a simple 'victory condition'
Pretty deepbut is worth putting the time in :)
great game
I assassinated a 3 year old.   His 1 year old brother assassinates me in turn.  10/10 would do again
Game of Thrones the video game with real world nations
Great game until you accidentally give all of your holdings to some random person threating to blackmail you. Then it sucksand makes you never want to play it again.
- Count of Santiago - Choose seduction focus and proceed to seduce every single woman in the kingdom of Asturias - Everyone in the courts start to contract Syphilis from my sex crusade  - Have to gain the stressed trait just so I can maintain 13 lovers - An army of fuck spawn soon arises ready to spread my dynasty - Kings wife has my baby but thinks it's his - Proceed to marry my first born son with my illegitimate daughter - Proceed to marry any of my other fuck children with my own children so as to purify the blood line - Im assassinated in 6 years by a priest  10/10 would force my children to marry each other again
Overwhemingly addicting
It's just bloody brilliant
The buggiest game I've ever played! :(
Honestlythe Game of Thrones mod for this game is the PERFECT GoT game.  The game itself is fantasticas well.
Wowthe depth of this game is like no other of it's type. It's a steep learning curve and I'd recommend reading/watching some tutorials as the in game ones weren't overly helpful. Once you get to grips with the concepts you can easily become addicted and lose hours of your life to this game.  The brilliance of this game is in concept and gameplay. It can be spectacularly frustrating and there is no guarantee that something that worked for you in a previous game will work again. You have to constantly adapt your approach to the situation around you. Let's be clearthis isn't total war
It`s a interesting game. The biggest problem I have had with it is that the tutorial is broken and so you will need to learn most of the game either on your own or using the internet. It takes a while to masterbut what else could you expect from a grand strategy game? I have not had the time to master it but I have liked what I have seen so far in the 3 hours I have spent in it. I would reccomend it to any fans of the genre who have alot of time to sink into it.
Couldn't possibly be having more fun than when I'm screwing my sister and killing our children in Crusader Kings 2.
CK2 is probably the best Paradox Strategy gameand the in-game aspects are just amazing.   Pro's:  - Best political system - Highly tactical gameplay - Best decisions - In-depth trait system - Huge map - Stunning DLC's  Con's: - Losing hundred of hours in this fantastic game  This game is one of the best purchases you can makeand it only cost 10 with (Steam) sales.
Funbut pleasefor the love of god
Quite simplyone of the best strategy games ever made. If you want full immersion gamingbuy this game.
10/10 would kill my brother again
An excellent strategy simulator. One caveat: extremely high learning curve with little help options. If you are new to this game definitely follow the tutorial provided with the DLC's.
You knowmy friends say I'm addicted to this game. I say they're full of fuck.
Possibly the best game ever made.
Starting as a count in IrelandI built up the empire of Britannia. Then came the random pretenders from over all the worlddestroying my empire in a matter of months.  10/10 would do again
I actually learned a little bit about history through this game! I would have never known that Lithuania would take over half of Europe!
Really great game in all. But I only recommend it if you have plenty of time to kill because this game is definitely a life ruiner. I spent days playing this at a time playing smallest factions imaginable. Turning an Irish county into a sprawling Empire. Not so great if youre looking for great graphics or blood or any type of instant gratification because there is none like in the total war series. Everything is long and drawn out but all the more satisfying when you finally achieve the new goals youve set for yourself. Although it does have loose guidelines you have to abide most of the choices are made for yourself. Very restricted freedom in the best sense of the word. Politics are key and declaring war is a task in itself. This is no cakewalk and you will find yourself wanting to pull your hair out. But if you stick with it you can find a satisfying experience in this game which few games these days can provide.  9/10
its a lot more fun than you think
Hands down the most brilliantly complex strategy game I have ever played. More DLC please!  10/10
Crusader Kings 2 is a PC grand strategy game that takes place in medieval Europe from the years 769 to 1453 as of the latest Downloadable Content (more on that later). You have the choice of playing any rank of noble from this time periodthe objective being to grow your dynasty and its prestige while surviving a deadly period of history. This is accomplished by warfareintrigue
This game is awesome but thats not why im writing this.  Paradox please to not allow paid workshop mods for this amazing game.It would ruin the experience for everyone and we all know its a scam because what if you buy a mod and its not compatible with your version of the game or your dlc WTF do you do then? Please paradox do not allow this blind robbery to attack this game please i beg you! Like if you agree!
this is so awesome
24 hours of playtime after 3 days says it all! Extremely addictive and great fun! Also made me realise that when I have kids in real lifeI should just marry them off to wealthy businessmen to further myself!
CK2 is just one of the best strategy games ever !  Nothing morenothing less.
Essentially 900h in to the game and I don't even have all DLC'sso there's still tons of content left to get atand on top of all that
I can't wait for the DLC to go on sale so I can buy it all. fuckwhy did I only buy the base game instead of the whole thing during the last one?
This game is truly challengingintriguingintresting
The AGOT mod makes this a must own game for any 13th level basement dweller.
In one game I not only had to kill most of my family including my many childrenthere was also the rebellion of my many nobles and people. After killing maybe... 20 nobles in total my ruler became known as the terriblebut I still held the throne... To only be killed by my wife during the night.
Had to assassinate two of my own children because they were the most powerful claimants to my throne.  Great gamebut it may not be everyone. It's very in-depth and even after the tutorials in takes a long time figure out the game mechanics. I have almost 200 hours played and I'm still learning new things about the game. But once you hit your stride the game becomes tons of fun and well worth the time spent learning.
This game offers different way to play strategic game. I love it when I arrange marriage between one of my child with another heir of an empire :)
Hard to learn at firstbut very adicting
Warpoliticsschemes
Recommended. Recommended. RECOMMENDED.
As of this Review updateI now have nearly 425 hours logged of this game. It is immensely fun and addictive. And brings out the absolute worst in people in the best possible way. This is a game about being a tyrannical despota conniving monster who's only goal is to strengthen their family.   Every part of this game I've found is wonderful to play. The DLCs for the most part
This is without a doubt my favorite grand strategy game of all time.  -start off as a Jarl in England -lead the norse (now germanic) to conquer all of engalnd -reform the faith -band all of the norse from the germanic countries (swedenfinlandnorway
It's alright.
One of my favorite games of all timeand I'm (only) 41 hours in. That's actually below average - I think the average playtime for all the users that own the game is around 50 hours. CK2 is an addicting and complex game that provides a rewarding experience if you can get past the admittedly large learning curve.  AlsoI'd encourage you to wait for it to go on sale. I got my copy for $15 bucks on a weekend sale
5 hours in and I'm totally lost. 10 hours in andI'm still totally lost. 20 hours in and copious amounts of youtube videos and wiki readingI think I understand the basics. 30 hours in
this game Is AWSOME i would do a detailed reveiw but i am in the middle of playing the game so i will just say you can learn quite a bit from this game )
this is the only game i have found worthy enough to waste 1000 hours of my life on.
Guinea pig seal of approval.
I've always had a soft spot for strategy gamesespecially those set in the medieval era. The learning curve is steepbut once you get the hang of it
Very very very great game 10/10 would recomended MY ADVICE : don't start be king if you don't know the history or else randomly revolt will uprise
Played this game for a bit. Found it entertaining.  Probably gonna play again.
I love this game.
If i had to get just one game i would get this oneThis game has changed my life i started off playing it and got so into it i started doing hours and weeks of reaserch on the middle ages eventually i started taking honours world history in highschoool and was able to outsmart the teachers in it. now im a JR. in highschool and i plan on getting a secondary degree in collage in the middle ages. please get this game its confusing and a bit hard at first but the more you play the more you love it. PS. I know it says ive only played like 200 hours but I have a secound account that ive played about 300 hours on ive also unlocked all the achivements on that one.
most played game in my library. and still play it this day. it was hard to get the hang of the intrigue system at first but after several hours of playing you pick up the ins and outs and then you will be hooked.
Absolutely one of THE best and most addictive games that I've ever played. I have had it for a couple years nowand I always wait to buy expansions until they're on salewhich is actually fairly often if you keep your eyes open. If slowly working at building wealth
Crusader Kings 2just brilliant! A must have for any stategy fan.
I couldnt decide what to write in this reviewso im gonna share with you guys my favorite apple pie recipe Enjoy! :  Pastry  2 cups all-purpose flour   1 teaspoon salt   2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening   4 to 6 tablespoons cold water   Filling  1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar   1/4 cup all-purpose flour   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg   1/8 teaspoon salt   8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium)   2 tablespoons butter or margarine   1) In medium bowlmix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening
This is an excellent game. It is a shame that they are extortinate with the DLC content though. Look outside of steam for better deals.
My mother was kidnapped by muslims and made into a concubine. Now my muslim half-brother is trying to take ethiopia away from me. All the while my youngest daughter keeps killing all my other kidsmy courtiars keep trying to stab me in the backand I'm pretty sure my newest child's real father is my uncle.   help me....10/10
Absolutely amazing strategy gamebut it's also a great medieval nobility rpg. I bought this game in Octoberand I played 200 hours before January. In my favourite game I founded a welsh dynasty that took over all of England and a good chunk of France. Through a complicated succession crisis my 'heir' (the character you play after your current character dies) was the Welsh ruler of some Adriatic Italian county
Crusader Kings 2 is a game that I did not feel I truly understood how to play properly until about 80 hours inbut once you figure it out and know your way around it it becomes a satisfying and incredibly deep game of plottingmurdering
Weed &lt Cocaine &lt Crusader Kings II
Download Elder Kings. Become Talos. Nuff said
Great game by its selfhowever i dont know what dlc are best to buy and also has some of the best mods going
Very few games in my life have recieved the kind of attention Ive given CK2. Civ has always been the gold standard as far as grand strategy games are concerned. Ck2 is the game I turned to when I wanted more dpeth and complexity than what Civ has to offer. The learning curve was steepbut the payoff has been well over 1000 hours of fun.
No matter how hard this game crushes my soulno matter how many perfect heirs my brothers murderno matter how pale and fearful of the Sun I become as a result of my isolation
In shortCrusader Kings II is a majestic feudal sandboxthe greatest generator of hilarious medieval soap opera ever created and Paradox Interactives best title to date.  90/100  IncGamers    I totally agree on this review. Spend hours playing this game
I really love this game for not hand-holding me through the morality of doing one thing or another. I can bribecajoleclaim
If you are a ASOIAF/Game of Thrones fanyou must get this game and the Game of Thrones mod. You know that time on Family Guy when Quagmire discovers that a certain content of a certain nature is free online and comes out to society for the first time in days. Yeahthat'll be you.  Vanilla is equally as fun.   One downside to this game is the amount of money you'll have to put forward additionally for DLC. At least the majority of the pricier DLC's are worth it
A very unique game with unprecedented depth. Gives a new prospective into World Domination games. Definitely worth checking out.
I wish Civ 5 was as funny as this game is!
Hands down the absolute best game I have ever played. Countless hours of replayabilityand just like Chess it's easy to get intobut near impossible to master.
Best Strategy Game of all time!!! The only place it needs to improve is concerning Battles!!!
When I forced myself to stop playing and go to bedI stayed up all night writing notes for what I would do when I did let myself play - 'Check up on Orthodox cousins'Be sure to send Duke Ramon far away with most of his troops before revoking his title'. I thought people were joking when I heard it was the best game ever
The single best strategy game ever made if I had to pick just one. Don't let the complexity and depth scare you offget it on sale and just play a few 'practice' games and ease into all the options. You'll pick it up pretty quicklydon't try to memorize all the menus
Best kinslaying and eugenics simulator ever.
This is the only game where someone from syria could ever have a claim at the throne of england. My spymaster assassinated himself. Not suicide. Assassination.  12/8
This is THE best cloak and dagger game you will ever find. The MODS are amazingthe mechanics and game play will have you lost for house. The DLCs are really cool but really annoying since it's something like 130$ on top of the 60$ I spent on the game. NO DLCs for mebut I love the game. Awesome Work.
Almost too complicated to be funbut heywho doesn't like being king?
Very fun game and addicting.
Its a pretty good historic simulatorwould recommend it to anyone who is patient.
It's alright
44844
Excellent game. Very different from your run off the mill strat game. Learning curve is steepso thats good. Had it for more tha a year now. Still discovering new ways and features. Haven't gotten any of the dlc.
Only 40 hours on record but I have played so many more hours with the CD version definitely recommend it only downfall is some mods will disable achievements
Love strategy - you will love this game. It will force you to look not to just war to expand your empire - but rather plotting and marriage for you and your relatives. Do watch the YouTube videos before you play - took me a while to work out that I can create / usurp new titles if I control the land.  IF I have one tip for the developers - be great if you can fill the fleet with the part of your army that fits on the boat - rather than having to split the army up until it is the max size for the fleet.
An interesting hardcore strategy game. Significant learning curve becuase of the huge depth.  The worst part is getting a few days in to a game and things going very wrong very quickly and then getting even worse. If you start losing just a little bityou're going to lose a lotfast. Very frustrating.  I have a huge love/hate with this game.
I killed my own child becuase i prefered my other one. 10/10 would kill again.
From what appears to be a fairly boring game at firstcomes this amazing piece of art. At firstyou probably will hate this game
Best strategy game on steam.
This game is truly synonymous with the word grand strategy. Greatest strategy game of all time for sure.
Crusader Kings II is a complicated gamebut well worth the money if you want to immerse yourself in it
only  having played around 100h of this game it's quite hard to judge a game with so much replay valueso many great expansions and still such a basic gameplay.   do I love this game? yesfully and I'd spent hundreds and hundreds of hours more into it if I had the time. And with Paradox as a Publisher behind the scene
Now i'm not saying this is the best game out there. But its the only game where you can commit genocideIncestKinslaying and naming your child Buttz McGee only to find out that the game remembers and will name his grandson after him. And thats only in one playthrough!  So for only £230 you can buy this game and half its DLCs today!
I ruled as spanish kebab and my dynasty grew way to huge. Takfirs and killing relatives. But that did not help me. Another relative became an emperor and ruining my dynastys low decadence. Becuase of that haram camel-herder it all fell to ruin.  3 wives out of 3 wives. Absolutely halal.
Don't buy this gameit's boring and way too much complex. It will take a lifetime to become good at itso just don't bother
Number one betrayal and incest simulator on Steam.
Seriously addictive. I have not yet finished the introductory special learning scenario.
This game is the fuck.
Started in the south of Ireland. Married the Princess of Norge. Join The King of Norge in an invasion of England. Norge Winstakes all of England. Now allied with the most powerful Kingdom in Northern Europe.  11/10 would sell out for power again.
A truly excellent game of grand strategy often ruined by TERRIBLE bugs. I had to play the same year 15 times once before the game finally managed to get through January 1st without a CTD. I have to launch the game twice if I want to playbecause the first time00% of the time
Great game!
-Started as Makuria in the 9th century. -United Nubia. -Invaded and united Abyssinian Empire -Invaded Arabian Peninsula -Got invaded by Muslims -Defeat Muslims because they try to fight three major wars at once -Invade Egypt -Jerusalem taken by Catholics -I take Jerusalem from tactics -Invade Africa -Invade Morocco -20 year old Emperor invades Italy in a series of wars -Now 32 year old Emperor gets assassinated -12 year old Emperor faces rebellions from every single other religion inside his Empire -Multiple peasant revolts -Vassals revolt -I become a duke in Jerusalem -Start process all over again during Mongol invasion  This game is awesome.
In my first game (Kingdom of Castille066) my king was found trying to assassinate the King of Navarraall of his vassals hated him and rebelled
A great game with limitless possibilities and a fresh experience with every playthrough.
I was only 69 years old  I loved My Sultan so muchI had all the merchandise and movies  I pray to Muhammad every night before bedthanking him for the life I've been given  'Muhammad is love' I say 'Muhammad is life'  My regent hears me and calls me a fuck??  I know he was just jealous of my devotion for Muhammad  I called him a fuck  He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep  I'm crying now
It's ok for what little I've played it.
140 hours on recordin that timefallen to the pits of my soul in my quest for power... Even George RR Martin's sickest character doesn't have fuck on me. Incest
Formed Ireland and reversed the English Colonisation of basically everywhere 10/10
I hate this game and I want all the money I spent on it back. 9/10. It would be better if it was a finished product.
Medieval soap opera: The Game!  Also I gave my wife a great horse and she died of depression two days later. gg  10/10
Great game. Will suck you in and cause a severe lack of sleep to be a common occurrence. Good luck
For the more patient gamer .This game is a more detailed version of the total war series and feels like the next step up. So if you liked the total war games id recommend this if your looking for something more challanging however there are no live battles like in total war its just a simulation.  I also found that to get the most out of it you may have to buy some of the many expansions like the Old GodsSons of Abraham and way of life  Overall great game!
A very Good game with lots of add-ons but the mods to this game are the bestThe Game of Thrones mod has got to be added if you are a fan of that.
This game is amazingand very addicting. It's very slow moving most of the timeso you have to put several hours to get much done. The interface is intimidating at first but is actually very easy to work with and you know exactally all the information you need to right away. A lot of money if you want to get all the DLC
Crusader Kings is a very funif somewhat difficult game. You have to manage your kingdom throughout the agesand ensure your dynasty thrives and survives. Danger lurks around every corner
What other game on steam would reward you for encouraging incest?
Yesmy lustfulsyphillitic bishop is the guardian and tutor of my beautiful 14-year-old bride. What of it?
are there any updts t fix bugs i just lost an army while trying to set jobs for a couple of my council they just wouldnt bloody move I rage quit and regret it coulda play'd on i was doin ok
Pope had a sonPope-son assassinated his Pope-dadPope-son takes claim on Rome.  10/10 would Pope again
1st Playthorugh-  1. Pick Galicia because I thought it would be nice 2. Holys wars... 3. Called a pretender by one of my allies... 4. Get rekt by that guy [It last LIKE 4 YEARS] 5. Decide to just surrender and become the King of Scotland 6. The songs.... 7. Game crashes :( 10/10 Would crashget rektand have a headache again.
One of the most interesting and enganging grand strategy games I've ever played. Reminds me of Civilization meets the Sims.
I elected a horse to my small councilthen three provinces revolted just as my pregnant wife was murdered. 10/10
This is the kind of game you play for half an hour before bedand then find yourself at 6:00 AM wondering where the time went and if it was really worth marrying your first cousin so you could steal her claim to the Scottish throne.
Unify Ireland. Turn into Catharism. Wreck havoc in England. assassinated by my Catholic English wife.  10/10 would marry a princess who hates me again.
One of my favourite games. What other games let you sleep with your sister and then murder your inbred children? Only this.
Be King of Poland 3 generations later pledge fealty to Holy Roman Empire Conquer most of Europe Accidentaly assassinate Son Wife rebels Kill wife Kill Son Be 62 and marry a 16 year old Rebellion Castrate rebels Watch as Scotland invades Iceland Invade Scotland Son is King of Scotland Son rebels Castrate Son Aztecs Invade France is now Aztec  11/10 would break history again
The best incest simulator of the last decade.
This game has taught me how to wincestannihilate entire families within decades and has successfully destroyed my social life.  10/10 would crusade again.
If you put the time into learning this game you will find it infinitely rewarding
Game's pretty good. Huge timesink though
Crusader Kings II is a game of understanding political intrigue and being capable of sustaining it through your bloodline. This game feels incredibly completeand that is without any additional DLC or mods added (of these there are plenty butalas! I haven't the time to give). The makers of this game did a brilliant job of thinking out elements of economics
Very fun game. Manage your dynasty and spread your influence across the medieval world. Build your holdings to provide you with a larger army to crush your enemies. Maybe even get the demon possessed spawn of Satan elected as the Pope.
10/10 would play againto prove it i have 1000 hours played on this game. If you like grand strategy and this time periodyou will probably loooove this game
Imprison lots of people.  Chop their balls off.  Make the throne an oversized beanbag chair stuffed with you-know-what. Imprison them again. Gouge their eyeballs out. Put their eyeballs where their nuts used to be. Imprison them again. Ransom them for money. Buy mercenaries like crazy to conquer neighboring provinces. Imprison them again. Execute them. Get overthrown for being an absolute tyrant.  Totally worth it.
Good game. It tastes like chicken!
Those who like strategy games would like Crusader Kings 2. There's quite a bit of strategytactics involved in the intrigue and diplomatic systems. There's also the religion system in which you would use to your advantage.  On the other handfans of war/battle strategy games might be disappointed
This is an awesome grand scale real-time strategy game. It offers a huge map with the whole of EuropeArabia and parts of Africa and Asia. The playable timescale ranges from the 8th to the 14th century. All those available times and areas mass up a large number of playable characters high and low (from an emperor to a count) from any ethnicity or religion.   There are two main goals in this game: liecheat
I decided to play this instead of going to my own graduation.
This is the medieval eugenics simulator. If you don't want to become the God-Emperor of Mankind whose dynasty controls all of EuropeNorth AfricaAsia Minor and even India... then you have no ambition and I will conquer you. Breed a dynasty that will never die
I've spent so so many hours on this game and it was all well worth it.  This game is phenomenal.   If you're a medieval history nerd like moi or just love strategy games in general than you gotta try this game out!  9.5/10 you won't regret !!
In my most recent gameIthe Doge of the Most Serene Republic of the Fylkirate (and Fylkir of the reformed norse faith
Created Spanish Matriarchy. Brutally used crusades to expand into the Iberian Pennisula.  Eventually conquered all of it and then North Africa.  Ended up with most of the East up to IndiaRussia and a bunch of Poland. This game is insane. Abitrary score out of 10.
As you can undoubtedly guess by my hours invested into this game I know some things about CK2.  All I can tell you is it is a mix between an RPG and a 4X strategy game.  IncestWarIntrigue
It's super awesome.
Was gonna put some meme about banging sisterspillaging christianscrusading heretics
In the past few days I've killed my brother after he decided he wanted to be Kingwaged religious war against neighboring non-catholic provinces in the name of the popegave my eastern holdings to my 17 year old son who will one day be King of Poland
Easily one of my favorite things to boot up and play when looking through my list. I'm a history nerd with a fondness for the medieval periodso the ability you have to mess with history is awesome!
Loved the complexity of this game.
It's alright.
The Game of Thrones mod for this game is one of the best video game mods ever and is easily the best Game of Thrones game available. That's worth it alone.
Such a fun gamebig learning curve but you will be killing your brother's son and marrying your daughter off in no time to secure your title.
An amazing game. Once again Paradox did it. I definitely recommend this game to all that like strategy games. One of my all time favourites. Those swedes sure knows how to put an enjoyable game together. Paradox is surely one of my favourite gamedevelopers. They know their s*** May the company last even after 'doomsday.'  Steep learning curvebut heythat's what makes their games so great. So much content to learn and master
A fascinating Dynasty management gamewith a very heavy focus on politics and intrigue as opposed to resource management.
Very nice gameif you download extra mod Game of Thrones it's just awesome! :D
If you haven't played a Paradox game before: Crusader Kings II is a fairly good introduction to the grand strategy genre you don't have to conquer the worldyou don't really 'win' the game. You essentially play from the point of view of the dynasty that controls a historic geographic area...I say that instead of 'country'because you can play as the leader of a individual county or district
Great for history enthusiasts!
slept with a dudes wife. he got mad. dueled him. he died. married his wife. had a kid. kid grew up. kid became next king. fabricated claims. took over fuck. got a lot of prestige. slept with a dudes wife. he got mad. imprisoned me. i died. son inherited. fabricated claims. attacked dude who killed my dad. imprisoned him. killed him. married the chick my dad was sleeping with. she was like 40 but i didnt care. she was hot. gave her some good tumbles. GET THIS GAME. GIVE THE WOMEN TUMBLES.
History and noble dynastiesneed I say more?  Events are interesting and funwar is challenging (and rewarding!) and being able to mess with European nobles
Best game to spend ton of time in. No matter if you like it easy or hard. With cheats or withoutyou still will find it cool to grow your dynasty and crush your enemies.
You should get this game if you like RPGs or Grand Strategy (or both)
One of the best grand strategy games of all time. Crusader kings II is complex and at times rage inducing but a joy to play. With many major expansions and start dates and various other things you will have alot of playtime if you want it.
Crusader Kings II is a grand strategy gamewith all the intricacies and complexities that a Paradox game implies. Compared to other Paradox titlesit is relatively easy to grok the basic game mechanics
absouloutely sick game so much mmmmmmm
Over 16 hours of gameplay and i still don't know what i am doing and why i am playing it.  Great game.  11/10
Such a difficult game! Makes you use every single part of your brain. It is not for those who are lazyyou have to make your choices carefully if you want to get anywhere. Fantastic game I have been having a lot of fun even if I am struggling quite a lot!
In between seducing every woman in sight and fending off Miaphysite Revolts against meI make time to blind my illegitimate half brothercrusade against filthy infidels and spending quality time teaching my son the true meaning of rulership.   The game is brilliant
Like many others I got this game to play with my friends and we have sank weekend after weekend into this game and i wouldn't have it any other way. Greatest strategy game of all time. Playing is winning and there is SO much playing to be played
Great. You can't rampagelimits belligerencebut really gears up on the nobility bloodline stuff.
I converted to the Cathar heresy while Emperor of Franceproceeded to convert every single vassal and family member to the heresykilled my own son
I like it. To elaborateit's a game where you live the life of a medieval lord. You rule over your vassalsclimb the ranks of nobility and f*ck. No joke
Reading Dune made me want to play this game. Playing this game makes me want to watch Game of Thrones. Watching Game of Thrones... again makes me want to play this game. It's unique. Try it and you will never feel the same way about feudalism.
As someone who has out 600+ hours into CK2 I can tell you that is one of the most best and enthralling strategy games out there!
A very long but enjoyable game.
As the philandering chief of Slesvigmy ruler seduced and impregnated a high chief's wifewho claimed the b@stard as his own. A generation later
I used to have a genius and strong heirthenmy weak infant daughter sign a pact with Satan and kill him!
One of my favorite strategy games of all time. If you like historical strategy games and are okay with setting your own goals in a sandbox game. You should be able to get hundreds of hours of pay time out of this game.
There is no other game like it unless you're already playing another Paradox game. Play it. It's fun.
Crashing and no multiplayer?
Crusader Kings 2 is yet another amazing title by Paradox Interactive. Beyond the scope and scale of the gamewhich is epic and immensethe attention to detail and long-term investments which are evident in this title (and subsequent expansions) really set it
Decent enough game.   Would give higher than 8/10 if Crusader Kings addiction had not ended my marriage.
Best game everplease release more expansions.
The Game was amazing. Intill you run into the classic road block 'you cant play so and whant unless you got dees dlcs' this game is rather empty without them. and the price is just to rich for my blood. 5/10
Great game
Amazing gameIMHO.  You get to play as any (landed) character of choice and have to abide by the feudal laws of your realm. You know that when you finally get to rightfully rule the lands of your nationyou will be the law but for now you are a subordinate. You plot and scheme
try not to fuck your cousin simulator 2015 11/10
Who knew Feudal politics could be interesting!
This is my first Paradox game and I really enjoy it. It is one of my most played games in my steam library so far. I have probably played more than my time suggests due to crashes (playing on a 2011 macbook pro). The game is confusing at first but that is something that I think makes it so fun. There is always lots to learn and there is a very supportive community. I strongly recommend this game to people interested in medieval era conquest/strategy games.
I went to Igor's chamber and gave him a good tumble  69/10
Probably one of my favorite games of all time. I have over 800 hours logged.
I castrated and blinded two of my rivals. I named my heirs FrasierRussell Brandand Magneto. I secretly had a child with my daughter-in-law. Basically
Fun and complex! Requires a bit of imaginationbut it certainly does allow for some ridiculous stories to come about every single playthrough.
i played as almafi and made a successful trading empirethen i fell to a holy roman invasion. 11/10
very good has tuns of stuff to do and is worth it for the amount of hours you get out of it
It's not everyday I can be the king of Swedenand marry my son to the Byzantine emperors daughter. To only have said emperor assassinatedto ensure the ownership of half of the known-world to Sweden. War is a waste of time in this game
Created character as Count of Yorkhad 6 childrenall sons died of disease
10/10 would play a zoroastrian and seduce all my family again
awesome game finally done learning after 100 hours
Did Only buy this for the Crusader Kings II Middle Earth mod. mod doesnt work. LOL 10/10 Will buy again.
amazingalmost endlessly replayableDLC add great value
Got into the game knowing nothing except that Ireland was the easiest place to start. Picked whoever is in charge of the Petty Kingdom of Mumu. --Got married had a daughter. --Got my son married to some woman from either the Norge kingdom or the Navarra kingdom I forget. --Five years and seven grandkids later I declare war and try to unify the Petty Kingdom of Mumu --Rebellions going on everywhere else in the British Isles so I want to expand to get stronger --My allies refuse to join me --Go to war anyway --King of the Petty Kingdom of Mumugets beaten by a nobody who has 200 more troops somehow --King gets sick  10/10 would lose a war to a nobody again
Do you like brutally murdering babies? Do you like having affairs with a humble 583 women at once? Do you like castrating people for wanting a fair rule... *cough* rebelling? Do you like having to buy a fuck?on of DLC? Then CK2 is 4 U.
perfect aryan simulator  10/10 would make super aryan Kraken family again
It's a great gamewith so many outcomes and being able to change history.... Its a great game over all
Just another normal day in England094. I'm busy grooming my sonRobert
Honestlythis is one of my favorite games I've ever played. Steam say 400 hoursbut it's probably 1200 hours or so. Beware: This game is addicting and will make you want to learn history and all about religions of the world. Also the only games that will interest you are games that are difficult to play.   I would highly recommend this game and please BUY it
Very complicated but is fun when you get into it
10/10 Would crusade againbut watch out for the Byzantine Empire they cut your eyes out.......... my poor spymasters oh well send him back again.
10/10 would marry aunt to heir again
its okey
This game is the fuck
This game makes me question my humanity
Complexhardrewarding and fun. It's pretty much Game of Thrones: Medieval from the perspective of a strategy game. Intrigue
Honestly the best strategy game I've ever played. The level of detail is amazingand there are so many aspects that you have to consider when you make your moves.
This is recommended and very strategic. Go for it you got nothing to lose.
I won't deny it: it's one of the best game I ever played. Problem is the price. A lot of core parts of the game have to be buyedbecause DLCs does not add flavour to the gamebut are a great part of it.
Would recommend this game if you like destroying your friends dynasty by making him marry your ugliest and most disabled children.
Be a great game if it didn't freeze when loading sounds....
Had a daughtermarried her to heir of France. Grand-daughter becomes Queen of France. My wife dies when I'm in my 50's. Married 16yr old Princess of Aquitane. Had only son and heir with her. Son is now heir to Ireland and Aquitane. Married him to Grand-daughter. Becomes Emperor of IrelandFrance and Aquitane. Incest-born children insane and evil.  10/10 would Lannister again.
There I was48the Strategos of Nikaea in the Byzantine Empire. In my youth I had been weak
Best game everyou can play as anyone and do anythingit is my crack.
Never seems to bore me!! Excellent game.
It seems like a lot of people really like this gamebut I didnt. I've played for around 17 hours according to Steam and I still have no clue what to do. I've read quite a few guides online but they have not really helped. I think my lack of understanding is why I dont like the gamebut it's kind of ridiculous how much effort I have to put forward to do anything in this game. I guess for some people that's the appeal and I probably should have tried the game before buying it. Oh well easy come easy go. I'm giving it a positive review because though I didnt like it
Literally one of the best games ever made.
Daes Dae'marthe Game of Thronespolitics... Crusader Kings 2 is all of those in a dynasty simulator. You will do terrible things
This game is better to play with friends for the awesome senarios to happen. I'd love to play with anyone. None of my friends have this game :/
Crusader Kings II is one of my favorite gamesbut it was not love at fist sight.  The tutorials do a great job showing you how the game workswhere the stuff to click on is
THIS GAME IS THE fuck?
It's alright.    On a serious note. The game is a ton of fun. Steep learning curve though.  Great Mods for different tastes  Was able to Restore Persian Empire and Marry my sister/Was able Invade Westeros and Marry my sister 10/10
I was so engrossed in playing I didn't realise I had reached the last stop of my train trip and actually started heading back.  10/10 would definitely do a double train ride again
I bought this game some time agopossibly yearsI have made several attempts to play it but have found it impossible. I have looked at the manual
The most wonderfully complex game I have ever played. I love the periodhuge fan of total war but this goes beyond.   I have to admit I was initially put of by the way this game looked. Howevergameplay massively makes up for any graphical simplicity.  I cannot recommend highly enough!!!!!!
An entertaining game. After owning and playing it for over a year I recommend this to people who like long term strategy gamesdiplomacy and historical based gaming.
Text is incredibly small. Completely and totally unreadable on any laptop screen. For all I know the game may be funbut know you can only play it if you have a giant monitor or amazing vision.
The best game I have ever played !  10/10
Another great game by Paradox Interactive. But don't play against friendsby the end you may not have any.
This is a game for those who like to planto think a lotits not a normal RTS game
Didn't like my liegethe Caliphbut didn't want to be caught plotting to kill him
Too complicated for me. With that being saidthe complicated nature makes it funeven if I cannot understand a thing. If you like strategy games
So much fun...befriendbetraymarry and backstab your way to glory!
Crusader Kings II is an amazing game with a deep and intricate political system.    Firstly---
this is the best strategy game i have ever played.
BEST GAMES EVER TO MUCH FREE TIME
For those who enjoy intra-family politicsfeudalismand the occasional plague
I have a cunning plan: I am going to build the Blackadder Dynasty (after the Rowan Atkinson period sitcom Character). and after 200 hours of playing thisjust now have I thought about doing that.
After many failed marriagesmurdered mistresses and the death of his only sonthe Byzantine emperor possessed only female heirs.  During the celebratory feast for his final marriage
Who doesn't want to have accidental inbreeding in your family?
Every now and then I'll load this up and lose myself in an incredible tale of murdersadulterywar
By far my favorite strategy game. I've put nearly 500 hours into it. It's a really in depth simulationand you should all buy it.
This game has a very steep learning curveand the interface can be frequently frustrating as you try to figure out how to do the actions you want to do. That saidthe game is very ambitious and ultimately makes good on the hype surrounding it. This a great game for fans of duplicitous double dealing
Probably the best game on steam
Crusader Kings IIHeadache Simulator for the first 3 to 6 hours until you learn the game and an epic romp to medieval politics and a medieval family sim for the rest of your gaming life! This game is Amazing! The learning curve is pretty steepbut once you learned how the game works and all of its nuances you will hardly notice any difficulty playing it. It is one of the best games I have played in recent memory and the price when I purchased it was more than the fun and gametime I have received from it.   If I will recommend any game in Steam
I had a two hour long fuck?? after I imprisoned and banished my son after he murdered his brother  11/10 would fap to banishment again
I can't stop playing.  Help
as usually this staregy game and historical
Without a doubt the most complete Grand Strategy game I have ever come across. This is probably my favorite game in all of steam and really has limitless re-play value.   One word of warningit might have you questioning your soul as the game continues. I was cutting the tongue out of a rebellious vassal after having previously blinded him and removed his fingers when I realised exactly what level I had stooped to to keep the peace in my kingdom.
Amazing gameImmersive and very addictive. 10/10
Look at my fuck?ucking hours. 300 that is. Or was at the time of this review. Buy it. Great focus on characters and character development. Military needs a lot of work but other than that this game is perfect. Really just money.
Amazing game... it's basically a Game of Thrones simulator.  Buy it in a pack together with all of the addons. They add so muchyou buy like 3 games for the price of one!
Incredibly deep and addictive game. Fans of medieval history will appreciate all the historical detail that's been put into it. The only improvement I'd suggest is a more detailed 3D relief rotatable mapthe current one looks a bit too cartoonish.
Be an English king conquering all of Western Europe. Become the Caliphate of the East and the West. Plot to gain powerwealthwomen
In under 4 months I got 500 hours on this game.    So yeah there's not much to do.
Love this Game!!
im not qualified to make a good insightful overview on any game really. but i can say dat dis game gud (most especially with all dem dlcs). reasons?  played as saxony in charlomenge startfast forward 300 years and my difficulty bar says -420% from vassalssheer fuck luck as well as the special wars you get as a pagan allowed me to do this- 11/10 experience killing litterally all of the christians.  played as venice in charlomenge start
Marvelousmarvelous! I give my full blessing to this game. May the Indian infidels get crushed by the good force of Gollah!
1st game: Conquered all of Europe as a Scandinavian rulermaking every enemy queen along the way my concubine. All must assimilate to the nordic dynasty.  2nd Game: Beat back the Islamic empires to restore the Roman Empire! This one was fun because of the Imperial System the Byzantine starts in  Can't wait for my next game and many more to come.
One of the best game from Paradox. Hours and hours of gameplay
- Be a tribal leader - Make other tribal leaders bend their knees - Form Kingdom of Poland - Adopt Christianity - Secure the kingdom for your children - Conquer Lithuania and Rus - Form the Polish Empire - Marry an African Beauty - Have that princess captured by vikings - Genocide the viking island from which they came (Aland) - Help your Jewish Courtier create New Jerusalem on the Jewish Island of Aland - Have your black son grab southern france all by himself  - Grant him Crimea as well - Grant him independence - Have your otherpossesed son raid your empire with his satanistic 'merry men' - Execute him - Bribe the pope - Conquer Rome and move the Holy See to Berlin - Join your father in law from Denmark in his war with Scotland - Conquer scotland - 3xScottish Revolt - Genocide the Scotts - Plant Polish Nobles in Scotland - Polonize Scotland - Conquer the rest of Britain - Finally imprison Sir Nigel of House Farage - Win.  10/10 Would alter historyconquer British Isles and commit genocide to execute Nigel anytime again
Fun grand campaign strategy gamealso very addictive.
Fantasticly deep and endlessly entertainingthis is a one of a kind game. I would recomend this game to anyone who likes history and/or stratagy games. Best in class.
This Game is simply great in every aspect I still need to play a little more to explore every aspect of the game but I am preety happy until now with what I bought so I do recommend this game for every body who simply loves strategy titles I know it's early but definitely this game is and deserves a 10/10 because it truly does offer endless replayability and virtually endless possibilities.  The only aspect of this game that in my point of view is terrible is the DLC and business Strategy being employed for this game by paradoxfirst of all I think it is the only game that offers 52 DLCs! the Collection which doesn't even has all the available DLC is 160 dollars when not on sale (trple that amount and you can buy a reasonable laptop)  now to buy all DLC separately it is 56.99 dollars on a 75% Sale (multiply that by 4 to get the original price which is $227.96) oh plus the $40 for the actual game! The DLCs themselves are full of fuck like a shield and armour for a specific nation or religion costs 2 dollars oh and they charge an extra 15 dollars just for you to play with an Indian or Pagan Faction these kind of things should be expected to come as free upgrades and background downloads (what are we made out of moneythis is just high way robbery!!!!!!!) I was allowed a certain budget by my parents for this summer sale and hence could not afford to get the entire dlc collection as I also wanted to purchase other games. so thanks to the geniuses who masterminded what in my opinion is the worst business strategy of all time and thanks for ruining a great game that I have been unable to enjoy to it's fullest thanks to you. I usually don't wtite reviews but for this game and as I am a huge fan of Paradox interactive ever since I played Hearts of Iron 2 so I had to write this maybe paradox interactive can wake up and fix this foolish problem which had no reason to occur in the first place to solve it as they owe it to us their fans and to this great game. P.S. I really hope they do not do this to their upcoming title which i am really looking forward to Hearts of Iron 4
Amazing Game! Definitely a great mix of grand strategy and historical perspective. Marry my own sister as a Zoroastrian to preserve the dynasty. lol why not.
10/10 Would be assassinated again.
Crusader Kings II is the best strategy game ever created. There's no way to reasonably dispute this.  Spanning almost 1000 yearsthe game allows you to employ nearly every strategy imaginable to propel your family to the top of the world. The journey is breathtaking. The initial learning curve is highbut once you figure out the basics everything else will make sense quickly. Read guides and expect to spend several days flailing around before you get the hang of things.  Remember chaos theory? Your starting position (geographic
The game itself suffers from an extremely bad tutorial and unintuitive user interface. I suggest watching a youtube video on how to play the game than actually playing through the tutorial.  Once you get past the flawsCrusader Kings will offer you hundreds of hours of gameplay. I've played 350 hours on this accountand another 150 more on another one. The game still has new things to offer.  As far as grand strategy goes
One of the best strategy games I have ever played. Recommend to every gamer I know
Its fun to always fun to become your lords most trusted servant and then after he dies kill his heir so your wife becomes Queen. The historical factor is a big factor for the appeal especially with good mods that improve that aspect. Mods in general for the game are good: after the endGoTelder kings can all add many hours of enjoyment.  It can be extremely slow paced at times
This game is absolutely fantasticwith emergent storiescomplex gameplay
This game is so much damn fun. 10/10
So easy to get caught up in the gradnd strategy... Many hours spent furthering my dysnesty only to lose it due to a bad marriage I arranged 100yrs ago... Thats life I guess. I cant complain that its too realistic!
Married off my daughter to a cousin...now we have crosseyes grandkids! What fun!
My insane king of Finland killed Cthulhu singlehandedly with a boatwhile his countrymen fended off a viking invasion. Then he came home and invented organized religion in the North.  10/10
Became King of England  Assassinated by my vassals because of my high taxes  10/10
The tongue-in-cheek reviews don't lie. If you love strategyhistoryrole-playing and/or channeling your violent impulses in a creative way
Okayjust buy it. You will not regret it.
rivals vicky as the best paradox game
I conquered all of western europe as a cathar duke in englandslowly replaced french culture with anglosaxonconverted so much land that catholicism is now widely accepted as heretical
They did right by making this game. A bit of a learning curvebut you would normally expect that from a grand strategy game. If you like nation simulation games thoughthis is the game for you.
Great Game!!!
Began as count of Dublin Had a son after seducing daughter of Charlemagne Got killed by my spymaster Began playing as my son Became possessed by satan Witches appear at court with armies Get lunatic trait Begin taking over the rest of the kingdom of ireland Contracted pnumonia and died.  Whole game lasted less than 15 minutes.  10/10
A steep learning curve but well worth the purchase. I found it extremely addictive and it took me several hundred hours of game play and the purchase of expansions before I was finally able to put it down. Stick with it through the learning curve. I almost gave up on it in the first few hours but decided to watch some youtube letsplay videos and that helped tremendously. If you like strategy this game is essential. I ignored it for years thinking it wasnt my kind of game....
This is one of those games where you start playingand keep telling yourself one more turn until you notice its 4 amand you have to be at work in 2 hours.  Crusader Kings II is a Grand Strategy game with a lot of depth
i really like this gameeven though im barely keeping my empire together.  one complaintexpanding your nation can be annoyingly slow and tediou
Dam another 1000h are gonna go to this one :P
Game is pretty fun butcan be glitchyslow

Crusader Kings 2 is the exact thing in my mind for perfection with the planning and all the events it is hard to get into and learn but if you give the exxtra hour you will love it. GET IT EDWARD!
An amazing experience every time you start it upindepth Dynastic rpg strategy game where the medieval world is your sandlot!   10/10
Sacrificed the Pope to Odin. Fire and Blood. Murdered three of my children. 11/10 Would commit fratricide again.
If you like historyintrigueroleplaying
Cautious reccomendationthe game has some really unique moments but it takes a long time to learn.
I don't even know how to reccomend this game. Buy this iflike meyou enjoy long
There is nothing wrong with this game.  Unless youfor whatever reasonhate great things (or the genre). The amount of detail and immersion provided by this game should make it enjoyable for anyone
I bought a bunch of games during the summer sale. I don't know why I bothered when this is the only game I play. I can't stop.
Love the 100 hour learning curve. Definitely a huge time commitment to be able to enjoy the gamebut once you teach yourself it is a blast.
Ive been playing Crusader Kings II for over 160 hrs.and I've only scratched the surface that is CK2. Honestly one of my favorate games ever. However If you dont want to invest some real time into mastering a gameand not just become good after a few hours this game isn't for you.
If you have time to killthis game is one of the best ways to do it.
Playing as a Greek/Jewish trade republic in Norway. Bad idea.   -Liege tries to revoke our title. -Fights civil war. -Wins due to mercs. -Captures King and his two sons his only heirs.  -Forces King to be Jewish. -Castrates his sons.   That's a jew move.
It's an ok game. I havent played that much though.
fuck the catholics.
I was absolutely enthralled with the it. It's like Game of Thronesbut without all the silly magic and creatures. I absolutely recommend it. 10/10
Is killing your wife and kids wrong? Well not in this gameunless you get caught! Would you like to be a Norse Pagan ruling over The Holy Roman Empire or be a gay pope ? All those things are possible in this game. 10/10 would kill my oldest son so my genius 2nd son wouldl rule the kingdom.
Amazing gamewhether you choose the most optimal routes to get poweror roleplay as each individual character you end up controlling. Works great on basically any computer
The 'when the world stopped working' mod makes this game a 12/10on it's own it's a solid 9/10.
This game is simply a masterpiece. It's my most played game on Steam (700h+) and i'm still playing it. With all the new the gameplay element added through the years via dlcit feal like it's a Crusader Kings 3. Be a viking fighting and burning vllagesgive the people of england a taste of what ragnarock is. Be a good christian and fight holy war and crusade against your muslim foe. So much more possibility avaible and even more with the character customization dlc. It's realy easy to set up a game and play with a friend or with random people. I would honestly rate it 10/10.
#1 incestbaby murderand desperately-waiting-to-see-if-my-son-survives-infancy simulator.
Best game I've played in a long time.
This game is great for stratagy lovers
In my last gameI became King of Scotland when I murdered my brothers three childrenafter which he died of depression  10/10 would commit infanticide again
It's pretty okay.
Great gametakes a bit to learn but well worth it if you stick it out.
Bretty gudfollow fedual politics and try to make sense of inheritance laws. Drive back godless pagans and teach the infidel about our lord and saviourreclaim the Holy Land in the name of our Holy Mother Church.  Paradox like to take the fuck with their DLC mongering
I can recommend this game to anyone with hunger for world domiationan interest in family dramasfascination with politics and cultural differences
All of the political intrigue of Game of Thrones with none of the real-life consequences. Simply amazing game.
My queer son had affairs with my spymaster. My spymaster tried to assassinate me. My son killed my wife. The spymaster inherited the kingdom.  Ohfuck this game!
This is a true masterpiece of a game. It's strategic depth is unfathomed. Not only do you have to plan your moves carefullyyou also have to plan for your dynasty's future. Careful thought out marriages ensure lasting alliances. War is not the only means by which one can expand his realm.
hard game to get into but completly worth it
Wait... you like grand strategy games? But you don't have this? Christ! What are you thinking!? Go get this game now!
1
Even though I've got the feeling that sometimes my relatives do not act reasonable (at least in the game)I would say that this is one of the best strategic games I've played in years. It is not the usual build up an army and destroy everything kind of game it is more about building alliancesmarrying into great houses and of course build up an army. If you like intrigues and creating dynasty from the scratch you should definitly give this game a shot. (But beware sometimes this can get really frusrating or make you mad).
1
As far as strategy games goes this is brilliant 10/10
This is the best of all the Paradox grand strategiesI've played them all and this one is the best by a long shot.
A great game with Game of Thrones mod. Ohthe epic battles.
This game is so goodit ruined my life.
Probably the best simulation of medieval politics ever made.   Build up your empiremanage your family and live throught 700 years of history.  Even if you're not big on strategygamesyou should try it. Bite through the initial hours and be amazed at what fun managing a dynasty can be.
Be warnedthis game is deepand complicated. You will be confused when you first start. A few hundred hours later
1000 hours later and no regrets. My only wish is that everytime Paradox releases a new DLC it doesn't destroy all your save files.
Fantastic game and unbelievably addicting. If you love the Total War series for it's strategyyou'll be blown away with Crusader Kings II. The game is very deepwith gameplay elements that take some time to get the hang of. But trust me
I bought this game a couple of years ago because i saw some funny vids for it.... 737 hours later and im still playing it. With all of the DLC's they keep putting out for CK2 they keep adding new and fun ways to play this game. If you are into games that are full of immersion then get this game.
Best game Paradox ever made. It's better than EU:IV and ANY HOI or VICTORIA. The only game that would challenge it would be EU:ROME which is fun too.
Brought it during the free weekend this is how my first game went: After figuring out that the Genius trait is amazing i made my son marry a women with itbut no matter how many times they had kids non got the trait. So I proceded to assassinate every child they had until they gave me a smart grandsontotal count: 15 grandkids. After finally getting the grandkid I bethrothed him to another smart kid and waited....only for him to be assassinated by my wife.  10/10  Got some of the DLC's results: Guy's wife is a witch
Pro: +deep game if you are into that (That is the only pro I will listbut I like deep gamesso it's worth alot to me)  Cons: -even with a teaching part
This game takes a lot of getting used toso many hours of gameplay will be needed to figure everything outbut overall it is a good game. 8/10
it's great fun to guide a dynasty through the ages
My uncle killed memy sister killed my unclemy cousin killed my sister and now i have no heir.  10/10 would play again
I was enjoying being the king when suddenly the mother of my 3 sons drops deadso I re-marry a sweet 16 genius new wife. The time passes and i died. I get to play as my heir but i find out that my current wife is awful so I get a speed divorcethanks to my bro The Pope
Bought this when it was on sale for $20 thinking it was a good dealnext day it goes on sale for $8.... Still a good game though.
After falling in love with the Total War franchisei started to look for something with more depth. Civ was closebut lacked in diplomacy. CK2 has everything I was looking for and then some. I can't get enough and will pick up some expansions asap.
-Be meNubian king -Married my son to a sister of the Byzantine Emperor -Son had a child of my dynasty -Byzantine emperor died with no children -Through some voodoo magic my Nubian grandson inherited the Byzantine Empire 27/10 would mess up history again
Prepare for an Imperial-sized headache as you attempt to reign in unruly vasselsstabilize your financesangle for the land of your weaker neighbors
TlL:DR VersionBuy if the base game and all of the DLC is on sale. If notstay away.  This game is in my top ten list
A Game of tacticsdangerintrigue
Really nice gameif you are strategic-type of games fan- it's a must buy!
This game is addicting. You will find yourself burning through the hours of your life making matches between your children and those of other high lordsgoing to wartrying so hard to create the perfect ruler over and over again
Murder and Incest simulator 2015.
Waitwhat day is it? And where did all my money go?  10/10
Great strategy gameonly real downside is the price of DLCs. The DLCs are pretty well priced when on sale but I wouldn't get them otherwise.
Awesome game. Buy it.
I have no fucking clue what I'm doing. 10/10.
Pagan Norsemen created the USSR. 8/8 for realism.
Really good gamelots of dynasty stuff. This review is basically so I can get the Pillar of Community badge.
Selectively bred my family tree making all the ugly ones take holy vows so they were all beautifulthey all got depression and died.  10/10
the only game out there where you can live to 100 and fight in a battle and this may sound bad but marrying your sister isn't fowned apon in some religonswhich basically makes them the Hillbillys of the middle ages
This game has a pretty massive learning curvebut once you get going it's easily as addictive as games like Civilization. I would suggest watching some youtube videos to get started learning some basic play styles.
This strategy game is very imposing. Unless you've played other Paradox games you will struggle for many hours. But it unfolds into the definitive experience for medieval militaryeconomicand diplomatic strategy. Imagine Medieval: Total War without the real time battles
Ok to kill a bit of timelacks depth and replay value
Awesome game for strategy lovers everywherei also encourage you to try the Game of Thrones modits even better with that
If you love history and historical gamesAVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS! IT WILL DESTROY YOUR SOCIAL LIFE! :)  You'll find youself stuck in front of your pc for days and daysplanning the best way to get rid of a rebellious duke or how to get the doughter of the Bizantine Basileus to marry your grandson matrilineary (it won't happen... unless is sort of 1452ish...) or how exaclty to avoid the Emperor's call to arms without offending him.  This game can be a little bit hard to learn at first
This game literally changed my life.  ...  For the bettertoo.   If you're new to the franchisedon't worry too much about whether to buy a lot of DLC. I suggest buying the DLC one at a time
its an overall good game.  if you like doing fuck while on a timer. the fuck you do might chage while time goes by.. and then its not worth doing anymore.
Started the game as the High Chief of Novgorod. Pressed a few claims against the filthy pagans then decided the best way to gain copious amounts of land was to commit a familicide. So I murdered my dadChief of Kievsplit up assets to the kids
I united the Spanish penisula under Christian rule and crowened myself Emperor of Hispania and then set out to conquer and or unite the Empires of Mali and Arabia and with that spread Christianity across North Africa bringing the Jiminea dynastie to hights they could only have dreamed of in reality.  I give this game 10/10! You can play any nobel house in mideval Europestart out as a duke or a count and manipulate or marry your family's way to the crownor start out as an Emperor in the Holy Roman Empire and try to keep your family on top against kings that try to bring you down ) The posibilities are just infinied
Amazing game...enough said.

Pros:  You can kill everyone  Cons:  Everyone can kill you
Note: Summary at the bottom of the review.  To meCrusader Kings II defines the 'grand strategy' genre. A game that starts in 1066 and keeps going until 1453 (867 to 1453 with the Old Gods expansion) cannot be anything but grandbut when that game also gives you a number of tools
I can Imprison and execute my whole family.
Raided Rome to build a university in Jorvik  10/10
10/10 would spand hour failing to set up multiplayer again
Easily one of my top 10 favorite games of all time.
Great Gamegood multiplayer optionskept me occupied for days
An emense game with hours of funthat let's you play as a peasant to even emperorduring the first to the last holy crusades. Will your bloodline succeed to the end of era or will it crumble with your kingdom
This game is actually the best. I have spent hours upon hours on this gameand I'm probably going to spend even more.   10/10  so much replay value
I killed my brotherand took his wife as a concubine... This is CK2.
Managing your dynasty during the Dark Age never was more fun.
I assassinated a man and his three preteen daughters so I could take over 20 miles of land.  10/10 Would war-crime again.
Over 500 hours and counting!
http://forumcontent.paradoxplaza.com/public/79102/Europa%20Universalis%20IV%20Flowchart%20updated.jpg   Thisbut replace Europa Universalis IV with Crusader Kings II (its made by the same people anyway!)
Wanna lose Everyone Around you? Job? Family? Friends?   BUY THIS GAME!  10/10 I regret nothing.
Learning how to play Crusader Kings 2 is kinda like getting kicked in the fuck really hard but then realizing that pain turns you on. Then about 2 hours into the game you realize you will never learn this and you quit.
I've never played a game for so many hours. I may have become addicted to it. SkyrimFalloutGTA
One of the deepest strategy games available. Has a steep learning curve but once you get into the series it provides endless hours of entertainment.
One of my favorite strategy Games ever! Very in Depthyou will get sucked in and never want to stop playing. On another noteI don't think that there are any other games that will let you reform paganism and play and play through the entire game until 1492 as a Pagan ruler. This game kicks complete !
So much can happen... and you never know how things will gono game is the same.  For Example:  Was Emporer of Hispania... King of LeonAragon
Brilliant game - bought it a cou[ple of years agoplayed for about 10 hourscouldn't figure it out and pushed it aside - now
My wife caught me cheating with my wife so my wife got mad that I was having sex with my wife and killed me 10/10 would lose Genious Strong ruler to skitzo wife again.
I have trouble sleeping because I am too concerned that I messed up somehow and my reign will quickly collapse  greatest strategy game I have ever played.
Be a feudal ruler and make your dynasty growwhile you do that you will have to keep the order in your realmdeal with your courtiers and a lot of other stuff. The only con is that there are a lot of things only included in DLCs
only played the game of thrones modand the game of thrones mod is the only thing worth playing. who gives a fuck about real politics when you can be any character in game of thrones.   10/10 best game of thrones game of all time.
I don't play much grand strategiesbut since I installed CK2I hardly play any other game. A bit expensive with all the DLCs
This game is legit my favorite game. Think civilizationbut youre playing as a family instead of a country. It's almost all diplomacy and strategy instead of 'Grab all the gold and steel.' Assassinationsweddings
Wonderfulwonderful Fuedal politics and Militaristic strategy game. You have maintain yourself as a lordyour heir
This game is very funbut it will not load. It was very fast before but it won't work. What do I do?
Strategy games aren't normally my thing but this one has me hooked. I like how I don't just have to rely on my army the political intrigue (read: assassinations) and strategic marriages help my kingdom along as well. Or notsince the A.I. works in mysterious ways. I'd certainly urge anyone to try the demo and see if it could be their thing too.
What can I say about Crusader Kings II that hasn't already been said? This game has more depth than any other strategy game I've ever played. With all the content available in the game as well as all of the DLCs and mods out therethe possibilities are almost limitless. Choose to play as the head of a vast number of different noble families from a variety of historical periods and negotiatemanipulate
I bought this game during the summer salejust the vanilla version. It felt a bit overwhelming at first but now that I'm familiar with the UI and the game mechanics it's a great game and I can't get enough of it. Right now I only have the Way of Life and Charlemagne DLCs but as soon as it's payday I'm going to buy the rest of the gameplay DLCs. I really like how this game mixes RPG and strategy. Great gamewould definitely recommend!
Incredible strategy game set in the middle ages. Lots of dlcbut none is needed to enjoy the game and most of it is just cosmetic dlc i.e. potraitsunit graphics etc..
Great game! I've already played 250+ hours.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GET THE GAME OF THRONES MOD IT IMPROVES EVERYTHING x10

WARNING! - You should have 36 Credit Hours of Antiquity era land management before playing this game.   Seriously thoughsaying this game is in depth is not doing it justice. The depth focuses more on you dynasty and ruling party then it does micro managing cities or areas under your control. If anything thing is Macro management at it's finest since you can only directly control X amount of things while the rest has to be managed by your VasselsDukes
347 hours on record and still going strong. CK2 is one of my most favorite strategy games of all timethe only thing beating this game would be Warcraft 4 or Total War: Hello Kitty.  -Game Highlights-  *Become a ruler of any country in Europe.  * Marry your sister  *Get many inbred sons who end up trying to murder you  *Give birth to the spawn of Satan  *Sacrifice the pope to Odin  *And die every single time you go on a hunting trip.  11/10 would go on a hunting trip with my sister-wife again!  PS. This game has a LOT of DLCmy advice? Wait for the Steam xmas or summer sale
My personal favorite game...   It takes a while to learn (and the tutorials are badunfortunately - I would reccomend youtube guides instead) and is very confusing at the start. Start small (Ireland is the classic beginner's start) and work up from there. Butwell
killed my dad to be the king 10/10
Thanks to a combination of great modsfantastic DLCsconstant updates that improve the game I have yet to finish a game fully from Charlemagne.... T_T     Still love it though and would sacrifice Christians as a Pagan ruler to my Gods again.
-Started out as a lowly count in Scandinavia -Brother killed me -I am now my brother -That's fine brother is way cooler -Brother is also a mean sumonaitch -I begin killing everyone who poses any kind of threat -Unify my realm under the Kingdom of Danmark (yes I mean DANmark) -Eventually I die -I become my son -I kill my brother (its a family thing) -I'm a lunatic viking that loves to fuck and pillage -Expand my realm 10 fold -Decide I want to reform the Pagan religion so I burn down a bunch of Catholic churches -I make a horse my chancellor -I burn down more churches -For some reason this makes me extremely moral -I'm so moral I burn down all the churches in Rome -I'm literally a lunatic -I think I'm a werewolf -Lose some prestige when my courtiers see me howling at the moon -Whatever they jelly I'm a werewolf -Holy fuck I find a badass stone coffin in a previously undiscovered masolseum -Of course I sleep in it -I keep thinking about sleeping in the coffin when a bunch of kindly villagers hand me a grimoire to study -Oh snap its about the Old Ones this looks interesting -I read the book and discover more about the Old Ones -One of the Old Ones is sleeping -Wakey wakey time -Start ritual to get him to rise from his subterranean terror hole in the ocean -See him -fuck I summoned Cthulu -I allow him to devour me -I am devoured  11/10 historically accurate
The Pope embraced Cathar heresy and decided it was time to start the age of crusades since Rome had fallen to the hands of heretics.  Meanwhile the norse Fylkir was concerned that old german heretics hadn't been converted in Nerikeso he sent a stern letter to himself telling himself that there'd be consequences if he wouldn't convert Nerike withing a few years. After converting Nerikehe rewarded himself by sending himself a bag of gold.  10/10
With castrationhuman sacrificeand forced concubinage all as options available to the player (depending on which religion and culture your ruler has) the (mostly) historicaly accurate options the player has in this game are far more brutal than any fantasy-based game would dare provide. Of course
Greatimmersive game. A must for any fan of medieval history.
Incest and Murder Simulator :)
My son asks me to find him a wife. Marry him to a nice Italian girlattractive and quick.  A few months go byshe contracts pneumonia. Think nothing of it.  Few months later
remade the Roman Empirethe made the Stormcloak Empire out of Germany to crush Rome. Somewhere along the way I married my fuck son named Ulfric to the princess of the Byzantine Empire. Then my wife died and I married my sons wife's sister. Later found out my son was sleeping with my wife and his wife and half of Germany and my dyansty was full of fuck children. Poisoned the Pope's wine and placed my corrupt gay priests as the new Pope. Great game if you love history and potentially making your own. Ironman mode sucks though
Despite being brutal to learnthe game is a nearly bottomless wellspring of fun things to do once you know what you are doing.
Become King of Ireland- free Ulster faction formed. 10/10 would IRA again
it's a great stragey game even when the war goal holder pulls about like 100 - 300 more men than the game said they had and it has really made me think pretty dam hard when i'm at war in game
started as a 15 year old kid ruling a tiny kingdom in northeast scotlandimmediately got invaded by my neighbors and lost my independant kingdomcame of age and got a job as a marshal training soldiers for my liege's army
UPDATE: DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEat least its Mac versionfor there is something that prevents you from using any DLC or mod you get. I repeat
It's a good game if you like grand strategy but get it on a sale. I don't know what else to write here so I'm including a recipe for pancakes:  PREP: 5 mins COOK: 15 mins READY IN: 20 mins  1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon white sugar 1 1/4 cups milk 1 egg 3 tablespoons buttermelted  Directions:   1 - In a large bowlsift together the flour
Too addicting.   I Played for 7 hours and I still have no clue how things work.  It feels a bit as 'the Sims medieval' for nerds. You have to marryeducate your siblings and getting more 'life skills'.  But thenyou can plot against others
Like the gameLOVE the Game of Thrones mod. Addictive.
Constant crases since latest patch. Onece every 2 years at least.
Its not an hour's job to learn this game but when you do....oh boyendless possibilities! I've spent like 300h playing ck2 and still have 80% of its content untouchedamazing. One of the best games I've ever played.  P.S. wait for a sale and get all dlc's - totally worth it!
This game. The stories that you create are incredible. I enjoyed the Europa Universalis games but this is a whole new thingdespite the age. It takes personal to a whole new levelin a grand strategy game.  The bad side is the interface is a challenge
This is an extremely fun and addicitive game. If you've been looking for a strategy game with a bit more to offer than Civ or total war - This is it.  This game takes a while to get intoand after 50+ hours of play timeI'm still learning However
67 hours not enough to learn how to play this game... the political manoevring is extremely complex.  I couldn't fathom running a huge empirebut couldn't build my own from the ground up.  Not sure how to proceed.  Still - incredibly detailed and strategic political play.
Literally amazingi cannot get enough of this game. The level of detail in it truly makes this game. If you want a game you can play for hours on end without the same story again and again then play this.
it asome
At the time of righting this review I'm 104 hours inand I barely feel like I undersatnd all of the nuances and quirks this game has to offer. It's a very comprehensive strategy game and you'll probably spend a lot of time letting the game play yo until you figure out how things work. Luckily there is a huge community that has thousands of hours of tutorials and LP's to help you understand what you're getting into.   I have yet to play a game from Paradox that hasn't been excellentgo buy this game if you like very complex strategy games.
Yes. Just yes. Even without the Game of Thrones modthis is the best Game of Thrones game that there is.
Awesome game! Married my ugly daughter with syphilis to enemynow he has syphilis and all his children are Ugly. Just... Brilliant!! 10/10
I recommend this game to anyone except myself.  This game has everything for a (grand) strategy fan. I thought I would like thisbut there are too many tabs with text in my opinion. There's also a minimum of action in a battle for example.
Took over the weekend and pillaged every last holding as the Mongols. 10/10 would commit literal genocide again.
One of the best games ever. Would have my familiy stab me in the back again.
The King of Scotland and England is inbredwith 4 other inbred siblings. 11/10would inbreed again
Was killed by my own mother so that my idiot brother would get my throne.  10/10
Best strategy game EVAAAAAAR
CK2 is on the whole greatbut it's certainly an acquired taste even among frequent grand strategy genre players. The game has seen so many updatesbugfixes
Over 1000 hours logged and I still love it. What more can I say?
Crusader Kings II is a masterpiece in its own right. Let me just get that off my chest.    TLDR: Complex Strategy game with a decent learning curve. Don't buy if you just want to kill things and take over the world in a few hours. This is a game for the patient detremined manipulator. If you are willing to sit back and do a bit of reading on the basicsthis game will bring you hundreds of hours of enjoyment destroying middle ages Europe (without the loads of DLC)    If you had asked me that when I first bought the gameI would have laughed. At the back of my mind I knew it was
It is a fun game and any strategy fan will love it to bitsuntil the mongols come and smash you to bits. You can ignore the dlcs if you want but some factions like the vikings are dlc only. The forums will have suggestions for what to get but you don't NEED it.
The only game you will ever need.
Where is Game Of Thrones ?
The perfect grand strategy gamepolitical simulator and all round genocide sim.
One of the hardest games I have played so far. If you want a challengetry this game.
Horrible lag after 2.5.1 patch  Fu.ck you Paradoxthe new feature is really wasting my time and patience.  The game was great until you add more patches and more sh.itty mechanics such as bull.fuck council and coalition which gives me lag.
Hardly have I played a Game so immersive and well done than CK2 ... It has the right balance between possibilities of micromanagement of your court and your family (almost like Sims) and the Empire-building grand strategy gamebut much more realistwith the right challenge and different game flavours depending on which religion or culture you are playing ...
I have been playing since Launch. And this game keeps me coming back. Never before have i had such an enjoyable experience with a game. I have 380 hrs on record and with conclave out now its only gonna get bigger.
Cruisader kings 2.... One of the most epic adventures ever toldstart out as a lowly lord of a backwater area nobody has ever herd of. Get you advisors to falsify a claim to a powerful nearby kingdom. Assassinate your way to the top and marry off your heirs to form even more powerfull alliances.   Reforge history your waycreate a blood line that will endure the ages. This game has it all but requires patiance
Awesome grand strategywith decent character development to watchholy wars and conquering your neighbours!!  Dec. 26
Things to consider before buying...  1.) Do you understand how dynasties and medieval empires work? You have too. 2.) This isn't a 'rampage with an army across the world' Civ-like game.  3.) STEEP LEARNING CURVE. It will take months to grasp basic concepts - Youtube tutorials before playing. 4.) This game can play VERY slow - its not focused for your Call of Duty crowd.  Considering those things first....this game is STILL one of the BEST and MOST REWARDING games on Steam and by Paradox.
Great game
I had to tweek the files to get them to work on my rig. This is normal for a paradox game as they have little customer service for the end user and expect you to fix their game which apparently works only on their riggs out of the box.   Besides that one issue this game is amazing. You will never run a feudal sim like this. In fact I think this is the only game which truly tries.   Some of the DLC is hit and miss. Not a big fan of sunset invasion which if you take as just a 'what if' or just turn it off completely then the game is just amazing. If anything it is too random at times. No game will ever be the same. Some things do tend to happen in the game which are hard to stop however I can saftly say I've not played a game which seemed the same to me.   The game can be rather hard but so was life during those times. You had to know what you were doing. But if you are trying to do something completely different and would like to stack the game a little or give yourself a little boost there are too many cheat codes to chose from. You will be tempted to use them as soemtimes you are just really unlucky. Play a few games completely without them to see how the game truly is.   Some great modslike the Game of Thrones mod is easily the best game for Game of Thrones out there on the market and it's free.   I am a big Civilization player and this game is not a civ gameit is a Fuedal Sim game. Buy only if you are ready to head families which control states.
I haven't played enough to know if the complexity of the UI is something necessary or if it could be cleaned up but without a doubt it makes the game difficult to learn. You are not going to watch a quick video on this or play the in game tutorial and know everything that is going onsome of this again may be the UI but it is also a complex game with a lot of mechanicsso the learning curve is always gonna be steep. I find its best to watch some basic tutorial videos and switch between that and playing
I really like this gameas you can see I'm recommending it. Butand tha'ts a very big BUT
Also known as 'A Song of Ice and Fire: The Game.'
An amazing combination of strategy and role-playing! Replayability is enormous as the options are unlimited. You set your own goals for the game. Make your family the most prominent in the workdconquer Europeor spread your favorite culture across the land. This is a long game so settle in and enjoy.
While I like the game and honestly recommend itthe negative reviewers DO raise a good point. There's enough DLC to make EA ashamed. If you want itit's probably an idea to get the game while it and its DLC are on sale.
Once you get used to the User Interface and many info screens this game is in my personal Top 10 and I cannot get enough of it! Will be getting Conclave soon and Streaming it on my channel.
It's like Game of Thronesbut real.
This game has an incredibly steep learning curve (more like a learning cliff) if you've never played anything in the Grand Strategy genre. Howeverwhen you finally figure out what's going onit is incredibly satisfying to help dictate the fate of medieval Africa
Brilliant game thats full of surprises. Carve out a Kingdomraise an heirsend the heir off to war and then panic when he dies because his brother is a halfwit. Watch your Kingdom crumble after your Dynasty founder dies
Just buy this gameand watch the hours fly...
Lookit's a nice game and allbut
Endless replayability.  Howeverif you are not into roleplaying a characterthe game can quickly grow stale. Powergaming can quickly turn you into an unstoppable country
It's not bad.
One of the best games i have playedi would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games of any kind.
Sublime gameplay. Excellent musics. Plethora of contents. Indefinite gameplay time. 10/10
Chaos isnt a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some are given a chance to climbbut they refuse. They cling to the realmor the gods
I've played this game a little. Seems ok.
Pretty Sure this game has the best player stories of any game I've ever played. SeriouslyRead the comments. They are awesome and hilarious all at once. If thats not enough for yougo play the damn game then!
This game is absoloutely amazing. Amazing replayabilty.
This is an excellent game - Paradox knows how to make a darn good strategy game.
My favourite PC game. EVER.
The best grand strategy I've ever played. The depth of the game is mind-boggling.
dlc excrement simulator: all your money edition.
Don't get this game if you have a job. When you blinkit's magically 3 am.
Seems intimidatingly complex and difficult at first but with only a short trial and error playthough (and the tutorial really does help) you can gain mastery fairly quickly. Then you discover an *enjoyably* complexvast strategy game which has seen me make Wales as superpower of Medieval Europe. Worth the price of admission for that alone.  Get the Old Gods DLC too!
It's alright. Worth sinking a couple thousand hours or soyou know?
This game is just amazingthe gameplay is the biggest difference about the Ck2this game is complex as you need to do several things to be a ruler
Too much replayability
Very deep and complex. 30+ hours and still stuck of learning scheme of this game. When i got thismy wife plotted to kill me. my vassals plotted to kill my heirs. and Byzantium claim my lands. game over   10/10 Game
I put a leader of a rebellion in the oubliette. He survived for 25 years. I was so amazed--I freed him.  He decided to lead another rebellionso I put him back in jail. 5 more years go byand he is still alive. I start a plot to kill him. His wife
This game is quite simply amazing. I thought I knew about grand strategy as a Civilization playerbut this game blows it out of the water. The complexity of the game is what keeps me playing. EverydayI'm googling something or making mistakes in the game that cause me to learn something new. Even after 400 hours of playing
Deep immersive game.   Highly recommended for strategy gamers and fans of history.
quite a good stratagey game if you are into somthing that does not focus too much on combat and war. Rather complex to get ahold of the game play at firstthough once you doo there are so many things you can do.
I sacrificed the Pope to Odin using my genetically engineered army of kidnapped Greek sex slaves  10/10
Crusader King's 2 is one of the funniest and nerve-wracking games I have ever played. Howeveryou should still wait until the steam sale to buy it. Having all the DLC changes the game a lot but stillwait until steam sale to pick them up.
One of the best RTS games ever made. Worth to waste your time on.
I thought I'd do some achievement hunting and get the one where you play as a Count and become a Duke with one character ok  So I get some marriages going build up my support and start a plot to claim the duchy of saxony as you do  After nine whole hours of tedious failed plotssweatpoachers in my land and going into hiding at least six times
Would Ravage Family Line Again  10/10
Best Incest simulator available on steam atm.
played for hours and still love it 10/10
Most people probably won't like this game at first but once you get into it though and learn how to playit's awesome.
I love the concept of this gamebut the tutorial leaves much to be desired.
Hated it.....
start as a norseman take the seduction way of life and sired 10 or so basterd sons. look at dynasty map mode 50 years later and 8 of the 10 are dukes in india. marry my daughter to the most powerful onewho is now her uncle. They have an incestriousugly child with a stutter who unites india.  10/10 would bang everything that moves again.
History nerdsGame of Thrones politic loversand nation building enthusiasts need this game! I sank 20 hours the first time I loaded it up... thats a different problem for a different date...
After almost 48 hoursI still dont know what Im doingbut it seems that the danish king wants to marry my lesbian daughter. 11/10 would buy the sequel.
Goes in fighta Wild king appersI have more skill in fighting then king
Can't say it's a easy task to secure house 'af Munsös' survival...   This game is very deepfrom murder to incest and lastly
As an Irishman this definitely appeals to me. Conquering Ireland as the Ua Briain and then slowly taking over EnglandScotland and Wales. 10/10 already.  It is a very unique gameplay as a strategy game. Instead of a countryyou control a historical dynasty and try and get them through the medieval era. You could lose your demense or titles or start off as a count and become king. There are no real objectives
-Start game -Seduction seems like a neat path -Start cucking nearby nobles -Nobles hate mebecome rivals -Use rivalry as an excuse to go to war -Conquer their lands -Cuck new neighbors -The process continues -Eventually control most of western Europe -Dub self The Cuckold King  10/10 would cuck again
Finally a game where women don't immediately spurn my marriage proposals like in real life
CK2 is a very detailed experience. It's up to the player to control his/her kingdomwhile preparing for sudden disasters like war or disease. The choices you make not only effect your current player's lifespanbut the generations to come lifespans. The game is hard to learn at first
Absolutely love this game. Anyone that is into character based empire management game will love this. I played the original Crusader Kings game and didn't care for it. They have redeemed themselves with this game!
It's pretty OK
Because I had a Lunatic traitI appointed my horse Glitterhoof as a Chancellor of the realm.   10/10 would fire my Chancellor for a horse again
I played it for only 4 hours. I have played Europa Universalis for over 500 hours. I recommend Europa universalis over CK2. I like the potential for stories but CK feels clumsy and overdone. Why put a tech tree in game if you admit in the tutorial that tech wasn't that important in the middle ages. It makes the game more complex without adding fun. Same goes for battle. Battle has a bunch of tactics and statistics that just don't add funbut makes the game harder. Lastly the UI feels a bit old.   maybe if the game was 'lean' it would have captured my attention but now i'm desinteresed by the learning curve (also because I already learned EU4)  I do not recommend because I recommend EU4 instead
IncestMurder and Betrayal have never been so interactive.
beautiful and gloriouseveryone should own a copy of this triumph in gaming. Engaginggripping and surprising this absolute masterpiece has had my undivided attention for over 700 hours so far.
I've been playing this game for quite a whileand I was buying the DLC's as they came out so I wasn't paying for them all in one go. It was $10 here$5 there etc.  It is a good game
i never played this game and i dont know how to. help
This game teaches you strategy.
Being originally a fan of the Total War series Paradox's games never appealed to mebut was I wrong! It's basically a trade-offyou don't get the epic rendered battles
G8 M8 would R8 8 out of 8
some rare bugssome things I wish they'd improve or done better but I'm not complainingmore than 250 hours of game play time and I still like it and feel like continuing :)
73 Hours in 0 achievements unlocked because Iron Man doesn't allow ruler designer. Bang your hot sister ?/10 would gain 50 pounds again.
An excellent gamethough it feats heavy gamers that love to learn mechanics.
One of the best Grand Strategy there is on the market in my opinion have amazing gameplay where you can start as a small count and bind your Empire buy your military force or if you are into scheming you can scheme your way into your kings court and kill his whole family proclaiming yourself as his successor. This game have a lot of expansions that will keep you entertained throughout long time!!
I have only played this game a littlebut i'm liking it so far!
I was fucking with my son's wife. She went pregnant MY son was born They tought my fuck was son of my son  10/10
Simply a masterpiece.  I play CKII Plus packwith ALL the DLCunder the Beta version and its the most stable i've seen the game.
A behemoth of the RTS genre.
Made Pictland the greatest Empire of all times.  10/10 would spend 100+ hours in a single save again.
Very goodin-depth view on medieval politics and troubles of the time. Especially with DLC's
Started in Donegal Had largest empire in world India had Irish culture Mongols burned it all 10/10 would recommend
Addictive as hell. My first real campaign is at about 45 hours and 80% done. If that gives you some scope.
Basically you will get no where without the tutorials.Other than that it is a very deep game to immerse yourself inif you have the time.Very absorbing and informative.
I've enjoyed this so far. Was fully overwhelmed at the startbut after watching Arumba's Tutorial Series on YouTubeI am much more familiar with all the basic mechanisms this game has to offer. It's a really great depiction of the feudal system in Medieval times
destroyed my vassal because he refused to attend my feast. 7/10 would play again
Get the game of thrones mod right away. This game is amazingIve wasted too much of my life on it. Its the game of thrones game i've dreamed off. So much depth and choices you can makeits incredible. It was a bit confusing at first considering the depth of the game
It's interesting how lands far away from your own experience their own chances and changes. In one gameyou may notice a king's untimely death. His kingdomnow under the rule of his too young son
Easily one of my all time favorite games. I loved the dynasty building and world conquering in this game.
God wills it/10
Steep learning curvebut once you learn you will love this game. Recommended for strategy fans.
A really great game. Outstanding. Nothing more to say. Invade? Oh yeah!
Was an evil (satanic) english king who invaded the holy land with an army of witches and loyal serfs. Only to die beside them in an absolutely epic battle at the gates of jerusalem against thousands of angry muslims. usually i dont review games but seeing as how this happened a year ago and i still remember it is testament to how awesome this game is. Oh ya and my the king in question was named Conrad how badass is that?
Extremely funhighly addictiveand the vast variety of options for the player ensures a long life. Overall
This game should also be called 'You Monster!: The Game' because you will do a lot of horrible things in order to establishexpandexpolit
*england attacks me* Me: Wellcome to ireland you can take all of the north but touch the south *Heavy Breathing* I'll murder you......
Probably my favorite game of all time. Words can not describe the fun this game brings.
My son married his sister and then proceeded to ruining the empire I built for him. 10/10 game.
The learning curve is incredibly steepbut once you figure it outthis game is really fun.
I love this game. I played the base version of the game for a long time before I bought several of the DLC at a large discount during the summer sale. If you are worried about the additional cost of the many DLC'sperhaps wait until you can get them on sale.
Very steep learning curvebut after that it's incredibly immersive. The UI is a bit clunkybut endearing
While this game may look intimidating and old at first - it is lots of fun when the ball starts rolling. I have played roughly 200 hours on this game (offline + online) and without a doubt is one of my favorite games.
Very fun and challengingI love this game. Easily a 9/10 game.
So much funso many options available.
Crusader Kings II has a deep enough simulation that after you've spent a certain amount of time with ityou stop 'playing' the game and start treating it as an amusing experiment. Can I make my kid into the Pope? What happens if I convert everyone to Cathar? How will the AI respond to this tiny change? If you are the curious typethis is endless fun. :D
Not Addicting.
What if I declared war on Arles? I could easily conquer all of itI meanI am the Kasier of the Holy Roman Empire
I love this game so much with the aspects of Creating Titles and more. The only problem I have with the game is not manually saving the game. Error for unknown reasons thing. Other than thatI LOVE IT!
great fun if you like genocide and killing your kids lots of dlc thoughyou're gonna be spending more than 40 jew slips for the 'whole' game
I Purchased this game after playing it on a friends pc and i absolutely love it. so man mods as well and you can even commit so many sins hahahha   you can even have children with your sister or mother :0   11/10 would impregnate sister again
I fell asleep and left the game on for twelve hours. Title screen music is beautiful. 10/10 would sleep again
Still on the fence about it. I really have not played it much over the past few months though so from a bang for your buck perspective it was a waste of coin. That saidit does have it's interesting aspectsjust I think I need someone to teach me how to play
I have spent hours in this game very fun highly recommend others to play.
fuck this game i can't loed my saves
Like Civ5 and Age of Empires had a babyand you gave that baby a healthy dose of Methamphetaminebut in a good way :) I Don't Know Why Other Games Even Try...
I killed all of my male heirs so that my daughter could rule and then I committed suicide   10/10 for assassination plots
I Love the histories.
A great game that I have put... a lot of time into. Much of this is due to the mod capabilities. Their is so many different styles of games you can playmy favorite game of all time.
An amazing game. Crusader Kings 2 is not a linear experience with the same story. Each time you start a new game each experience is completly differentwith tons of intrigueall controlled by the player's choices. The vanilla version only allows christian characters ( a good 40% of the game) to be accessable
Awesome Game! Make sure you get the complete edition so you don't have to hunt down every single dlc. The Complete edition on sale is worth it!
No one game is ever the sameeven when starting with the same character for the 10th time. Will buy again.
Excellent game for those who enjoy a sandboxstrategy game with optional role playing and infinite replayablity.  Terrible game for those who do not enjoy strategy games and those who want a game that focuses on war.  I originally only bought this game for the Game of Thrones mod it has. I had to play the vanilla game in order to better understand the mechanics. NowI don't care which I play I just love the game and how unique it is in that diplomacy and deceit matter more than war (though war is still an important aspect).  CK2 is a game that puts you in the role of a landed lord in medival Europe
I like Paradox games and this onealong with EU4are maasterpieces. That said
Siegfried XIVone of many males of the Siegfried Dynasty who all share the same name. Also killinglots of killing. All the Siegfrieds loved having people die.  Inbreeding? A common place due to the importance of good traits
I found this game very hard to grasp the mechanics and play through - the tutorial didmt help me understand the game aspects that well and i soon found myself frustrated with it - i have not therefore played it very much and certainly have not got any of the achievements etc.  More of a RTS game than you actually think (game speed/time is fast)but you control everything in it from policy to marriages as well as raising armies and leading invasions. A one stop shop for complete control over building an empire rather than simply focussing on paying for troops and marching them across a map to knock somesone's wall down.  A good idea to blend a game like Total War (without the actual live battle control option and the Civ style gameplay).  Overalldesign and concept of the game does look very clever and worth playing - i will come back to this game and try again no doubt.
Fantastic game and the best around in real time strategy games.
I'm going to say that I love the gameeven though it crashed before I was able to survive the whole period. Despite not being able to get any real help about the problemthey did help when I had problems activating in the first place. The problem is most likely my computer
My favorite game. Not as complex as people say and hilarious with friends.
Gotta love this game.
This is a great and complex game! HoweverI had to step away because this game really seems to require a more in-depth approach that I just don't have the time and patience for right now. I tried to just dive in and play like I have played other games like the Total War seriesbut I found that it seems to require much more thinking and patience to actually be successful in this game. Keep in mind
Like Pokemon but with human children.
Great timesink with a plethora of options. Can be a bit overwhelming at first )
Crusader Kings 2 is the best game because you can marry your sister who is later killed by your inbred schizophrenic son from jail - because he imprisoned himself for conspiring to murder his mother.
This is probably one of the greatest grand stategy games ever.
All the runtime errors are fuckbut it's a great game. Imaginethe game is great enough to beat the annoyance of it crashing constantly.
Married my friend and got babies 10/10 secret fantasies come true!
If you are interested in history and like political intrigue and stuff like thatyou wil love this game. It will take you around 5 hours of playtime to fully understand how this game workssince it lacks a good tutorial
Best Game of Thrones simulator on the market. 10/10
So I have logged a few hours into the gamestill trying to fully understand this thingbut here is my story.   Play Ironman  Start in Ireland  Takes 10 years to fabricate a claim  Starts War  All neighbors dogpile on me  I lose  Notice that wife is second in line to England  Plot to kill heir  King of England wants in  We kill heir  Wife inherits  I die
10/10 would expel jews again.
Crusader Kings II is the first grand strategy game I've ever played. I got interested to it after hearing a friend talk about it (after the Old Gods expansioncreating a Finnish empire and conquering the world). I was first concerned about the complexity of the game but you get eased into the game mechanics and quirks after a while. The initial tutorial helps a bit. Alsolearning the ropes is easy now as there are many youtubers creating content from this game. I'd personally liken the learning curve to Dwarf Fortress. You need to have loads of 'fun' before all the pieces click. I'd also recommend learning one religion &amp starting location first
There is a reson many people who own this game tend to have 100+ hours played on it. Possitivly the best strategy game I've ever played.
Take control of familypull them th rough rough timeseveryone still hates you and make inbred babies.  10/10 would keep playing.
The perfect game for anyone who likes strategy with a touch of role play.   At the beginning it can be hard to get a good start because I found the tutorial rather unhelpful and had to look up a few things on the wiki.  But once you got all the important details the game can reward you with hours and hours of great gameplay.   I personally love the factthat every game map looks different after you started the gamebecause there are so many random events that influence your game. And so every game will be a little (or a lot) different than the one before.  I also found the game to be pleasently challenging
This game is awesome!  Very high learning curve as everyone says but the tutoril sufficed for meand i even kept playing as the Spanish just because i like them so much!!!  i tell my friends about my playthroughs often and as a bunch of people who watch GoT and vikings all the time they super dig it.  EDIT 11/22 The AGoT /mod is amazing! as is the base gameupdated constantly!  EDIT 1/5/16 This game is still amazing
Whatup player. You like straight up chillin' on some medieval historydude? Got some time to kill? Aightcool man I got this game here for ya.  And they never saw lil rumblr again.  I've put about 100 hours into CK II and I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface of what this game is capable of. I had to spend hours reading wiki's and watching youtube tutorials before I could even parse the interface! Weird
CK2 is the complicatedadvanced strategy game hardcore gamers deserve. It's kind of a pain to learn how to play it properly and you will probably need to watch a few games go to complete fuck in a matter of minutes before you get the hang of how to be successful in the game. Once you do thoughCK2 is dangeerously fun and addictive.   If you're looking for a game that requires serious strategy skills and will kick your  if you don't pay attention
Great game. It is very addictingespecially if you love muder and conquer. It is very addicting. Although it has a lot of DLCsome of which should be updates
I've never enjoyed wasting my life so much! CK2 is by far the most immersive game I've ever playedI get lost in it and find myself thinking about my dynasty's fate even when I'm actually doing something else (which is rare). Bare bonesthe game is fantastic
Great game
My son was born a midget and my grandson was born a midget out of incest after my son fucked my wife.    Pretty good game.
Crusader Kings II is simply put an amazingly crafted game. While chalanging to learn at firstit is an extreemly rewarding game to play. The only reason I avoid playing it is because I know once I startI won't be able to stop.  9/10
Very Good!!
This is one of my favorite strategy games of all time--as my almost 450 hours at the time of writing show--because of its focus on human interactions rather than (necessarily) warfarewhich is pretty unusual for a grand strategy game. I get attached to my characters in ways that I really don't with generals in the Total War games or nameless units in Civilization. This is all about building your dynasty and ensuring your legacywhich leads to a lot of different playstyles. You can try to be an independent count resisting assimilation. You can form a super empire that encompasses the entire world. You can be the dutiful vassal
Inbred son is the only popular member of my dynastyacquires more land for the family in a few months than any of my other characters have in 150 years by essentially being Forrest Gump of the medieval world. Buy this game immediately.  P.S. It works fine on a 2011 MacBook Prono problems at all.
i did not like this game slowboring and frequent crashes to desktop. I requested a steam refund.
Hellosome people let their game run in the background while they leave the PC and steam records this time as in game playtime.   I am not one of those people.     This strategy game has a difficult learning curve to get over but once you do it is the greatest strategy sandbox game to kill time with.
Starts a game a a vassal of the Byzantine Emperor. Joins rebellion then gets imprisoned and castrated. Shortly after get wife pregnant.... HOW????
Possibly one of the best games I've ever played. More addicting than an MMO.
Strategy mixed with roleplay in historically accurate medieval world. A must-have if you like at least 2 of these 3 characteristics.  Unlike what I've read in a few reviewsDLCs are definitely NOT mandatory to enjoy CK2. I spent my 20/30 first hours on the base game and never felt like anything was missing.  You may have hear a lot about the 'harsh' learning curvebut don't worry
sitll havent quite mastered the game mechaniczs yet. but definately worth the buy if your a hardcore statergy player
While not for everyoneCK2 is in all honesty the best RTS game I have ever played in my life. I'm a huge nerd and aspiring medievalist so I may be biasedbut the game is outstandingly addictively fun despite (or because of!) the asymptote-like learning curve. The only possible shortcoming is the 100+ USD you have to dump into the game to access all the features
OMG. This game is one of the most in depth games I've ever playedeven without DLC it's amazing. I'm not a hardcore gamerso I will admit it probaly took me the first 10 hours of gameplay to figure everything out
#love I know I have over 200 hours with how much I have played it offline.
WARNING: If you've never played this game beforeand don't want to spend all your free time trying to endlessly look up Youtube full tutorial series and researching how to play the gameand then still not know how to play afterwards
I'm posting this review mostly because I just passed 1200 hoursand it's officially an addiction. If you enjoy telling dynamic stories with a grand medieval themecreating deep alternate histories
Amazing game you will love it just clear your time for awhile you will become addicted
Highly recommend this game. It has a pretty steep learning curvebut once you figure your way around the many menus and optionsit's among the best grand strategy games out there.
This is a amazing strategy game with amazing intigue and inheritance mechanicsthough they can be quite confusing sometimes. If you have difficulty with learning this gamelook up Arumba's Crusader King 2 tutorial series to help.   This game is very in-depth. It can be very complicated and has a difficult learning curve
This game took up my life! It has a bit of a steep learning curve but once you get down the basicsyou'll be having so much damn fun.
It's really goodif you liked Hearts of Iron 2 and 3... Aaandwell
If you want start from humble begginings turn the other way. You will get stomped and swept under the rug. The best way to start is with the big kingdoms and dive deep into the intrigue. Though I personaly didnt enjoy this game I like what they did here. If you love drama and politics dive in. If you want grand strategy go somewhere else. Other games do it better. I think most people should at least give this one a shot though.
A very immersive and bold strategy game that lets you really carve your own European medieval history instead of following a guideline. The game play itself is at first a steep learning curve but when you get used to itit's absolutely fantastic I fully recommend this game to anyone interested in the genre/similar grand strategy games.
great game
Pros: Can pork your sister Can have your gay son's eyes ripped out Can praise tengri tbh Cons: Can't be your own grandfather No viewable orgies Isn't a dating sim
Boring as hell.
Freakin DLC. Stop it.
I really enjoy CK2. I love the variety of choices available I can play as the ruler of a nationor as one of the ruler's vassals. I really enjoy the amount of depth there is in managing diplomacyyour court
One of the best grand strategy games ever made. Build your empire anywhere in Europe (and surrounding areas) and plunge into the feudal system of the Middle Ages. Develop allies or for some funyou can even make some enemies!
Very complicatedbut probably the only game that I can murder all my In-Laws to gain control of Scotland.
Big learning curvebut it's worth the time.
NoNot at all. Waste of time unless you spend alot of money seeing all those great dlc things when watching youtubers.
This is an excellent game plain and simple.
A masterpiece from Paradox in which domestic and foreign diplomacyfamily tiesintrigue
First time into this game (didn't play Crusader Kings I) - Learning curve is a little steep and enjoyment can be highly dependent on the realm and level of character you chose. I would recommend this game to those who enjoy Paradox releases and also enjoy geo-political planning and warfare.
great game spent too many hours of my life on this.
Amazing grand-strategy game that needs to be played to be appreciated. The amount of things you can do in this game are astonishing. Any fans of EU4 or other paradox gamesthis is a must buy. Try to get it on sale though as the expansions add up.
be the count of weimar in East Francia be a master seducer fuck everyone in europe invite all the fuck?es to my court get so many offspring i get claims to all lands infiltrate college of cardinalsget loads of money from bribed pope everyone loves memake me king of germany in a massive rebellion time to fuck some more fuck karling women get claims get lands divorce and into the oubliette you go new karling woman repeat tfw you control all of europe tfw you become the weimar republic  i r8 this gr8 game 8/8 m8.
Were to start wit this gameit has good gameplay features and a great feel when you play it. In a way it feels like real lifebecause there are no turns there isnt no movement limit
Crush the Irish under your Anglo Saxon boot heel. Raise a Jihad against the infidel Christians of the Holy Roman Empire. Marry into alliancesbetray your friendsand assassinate your family until you've finally siezed the crown. Now
My brother seduced my wifemy three daughtersand my three concubines. He then proceeded to murder my heirs
An insane game for insane people. Lay down your koran and switch to the one true faith of christianitysteal the nephew of your former caliph and educate that nephewmarry him to your daughter
pretty good 7/10
Wish these fuckers would bundle the portraits is all I'm sayingwonderful game though 8/10 (DLC Micro-Transactions brought it down from a 10/10)
I Play the Game and I don't know what I'm doing...I named my Kids: son of a fuck?unintentionallyprovided and freak 10/10
The lack of a good tutorial is bad. Given the absolutely insane complexity of this gamethat will probably turn off quite a few people. Go watch Arumba play this gamehe has a tutorial series that helped me understand this game much
too much salt ¯\_? ? ? ? ?_/¯
Well... Actually put off buying this game for years... The Grand Strategy of the game was appealing but I've never had much luck with computer Role/Playing games... And since the game is both... I shied away from it... A friend bought the original base game for me and dared me to try it out... Well I must admit its a very good game... The learning cure is steep however... But once you get past that it really is an addictive little game... The fact that Paradox Interactive is always updating the game and making new content is a big plus too.
A really great gamethat I love. You can spent countless hours in itand it is also probably my favorite paradox game. My only complants or negatives is that it can be fairly hard to get into a new game at times
Playing as a schizophrenic basileus with all 7 deadly sins has a Voice of satan as well as suspected demon spawn but also has a voice of jesus and surprisingly zealous not to mention exactly 2 year after he ascend to throne the 'joan of arc' event triggers and the mad basileus decided to support her till the very end oh....did i mention he's a werewolf as well   Stephanos II of Byzantine empire might not be liked by his vassals but he gets the job done reclaiming anatolia as well as subjugating the papacy
This game is my spirit animal.
I love this game. I highly recommend it but all the dlc can be intimidating and pretty expensive. There are a few key dlc if you want to get the most out of the gamenot including racial portriats. I suggest get mostif not all
Great Gameone thing im particualy fond of is that the mod's are just as good as the dlc. This game is very fun to play
Great grand strategy game!
One of the most intresting games of its period and really takes you into intrigues of medieval courts. Teach also quite detailed history of Europe and Mid-eastreligionsnations
400 hours of rising from Baron to Emperorsending out raiding vikingshave a son go to Miklagård to fight as a Varangian only to come back blinded and castrated
Awesome game! Thousands of hours of fun!  A must!
Start as count of gotland Swear fealty to the petty king of Svitjod Help my liege become king of Sweden and then overthrow him Everyone hates me so better call the carriage makers and snake charmers Send a raiding party to the east realize said party got lost and ended up in the Mediterranean  conquer Rome for the hell of it and run away with the pope in a sack install zealous vassal in Rome and wait  nowa few years later the pope is still prisoner in the Norse kingdom of Gotland and the people of Rome have lost faith in him and turning to the Æsir for guidance
I love this gamewith the Game of Thrones mod! But I cant play as House Mudd in the gamethats what makes me sad..
Crusader Kings 2 is a great example of a strategy gamedone right and it is that for multiple reasons. First offthe mechanics of the game are simply awesome
The level of depth and detail in this game is astounding. More than a little overwhelming at firstit offers some of the most intense gameplay that I've encountered. Think: Game of Thrones squaredbut on an evenmore vast and epic scale as it spans generations and ages
It's a good game
A different take on grand strategy where instead of a straight-forward conquest-based approach where military conflict dictates the gameplayyou have a diplomacy heavy social experiment where handling relationships among your court as well as your peers are much more crucial to success. In a lot of ways you play CK2 to survive rather than to win and it works brilliantly.
Playing as custom king of Hungary.  Marry princess of the HRE.  Start pumping out sons like crazy.  Heir is decentthird son is spectacular. Geniusattractive
Many hours of gameplay and a ton of replay value
Very good tactic game but it is complicated and there is no epic battles like in Medieval 2 total war. If you want to make your country greatand have a challange choose Crusader Kings 2.
Best game ever!!! A really addicting game )
Only for people who like grand strategybut for them this game is awesome!
charlemagne start  day 1 = play with the af munso dinasty .  day 2 = conquer saxtony   day 3 = my wife is pregnant with my 3rd child  day 4= conquered sweedennorway and a little of finland  day 25 = i got my 16th kid from my wife and the 2 concubines i forcefully took and they cheated on me  day 26 = king dies ragnarr suceddes and the kingdoms split amongs all the kids......  day 26.5 = maximun unrest everyone rebells....  day 30 = ragnarr dies of leper and im stuck with an infant on the throne  day 31 = even more rebels...    would play sweeden again 9/11
11/10 would seduce the pope again
It's an alright game. It's not as fun as EU4in my honest opinionbut the ability to take matters into your own hands and assassinate leaders you don't like is one of the good things that this game can bring to light.  Game stability is another issue entirely
Start as Byzantine emperor in 1066. Make alliance with HRE somehow and stop the Turks from taking Anatolia. Go to war with the various kingdoms in the Balkans and when i run out of cash kick the Jews out of the empire to get rid of my debts to them. Realize that my spymaster was a Jew and now i have a dumbass spymaster. Start a holy war with the Muslims. Fail to assassinate the caliph. Take some Muslim land and commit religious genocide against them. Dumbass son Kills me and takes over the empire Revolt happens and at the same time the caliph launches a jihad for Armenia against me. I lose and get imprisoned then executed by some Duke of mine. I have no successor and the game ends.  fuckING AWSOME GAME. 100000000000/10
Great for teaching people geogrophy and historical political policies... also great for teaching your children how to start a lasting dynasty through assassinationstrade agreementsarranged marriages
Pretty much the best simulator of medieval politics you will find. Accurate all the time? No? Capable of wide diversions from history and reality? Sure. But there isn't really another sim out there like thisor with this many possibilities.
I would write a reviewbut am to busy playing crusader kings 2
This is probably my all time favorite gameI would recommend it to anyone with a love of strategy/RPG games and the time to commit to learning how to play.  Pros -Literally unlimited replay valueno two games ever the same. -Cultures
Eugenics simulator 1066.  10/10 Must buy!
Pure awesomeness.
Channel your inner Medieval Lord (or Lady). Great gamelove making my own dynasty that will rule through the ages. While the combat between armies is fairly basicpretty much whoever has the larger numbers
Hard to play to form the Roman Empire as Byzantine Empire not that I'm an expert or anythingits an RPG as paradox put it and its amazing awesome :)
This game... its awesome... What other game can you make Sweden a mighty powerhungry hippotaking over all known Europe in a couple of hundreds of years?!  Its a must play for every strategy nerd/fan.
Game that gets pretty in depth in politics (little too much to my tastes) etc. although there are some game breaking exploits and world domination is somewhat... impossible unless you use those exploits.  6/10
Took a while for me to learn how to playbut once I did you couldn't stop me from being a playa.
Like RTS? Want to waste weeks or months on a single playthrough of a game? This is the game for you.
i just got done playing this game wait......what time is it....and for that mater what year is it?
this game is one of the most complex strategy games i have ever played yet somehow it flows really well. its hard but you feel awsome when you were just count but now the king of the world it's just an amazing game its worth the price and the DLC adds so much just buy it.
Can be very addictive. Adds a unique spin on grand strategy that can be interesting to those new to the genre.
All the delicious strategy you could ever want :D
YeahI play it from time to time.
Simply the best strategy game I have ever played
It's a nice game. Pick it up when it's on one of the frequent 75% salesotherwise the DLCs are going to be very expensive. Don't buy Way of Lifewhile it adds fun things for you to do
EDIT: Changing my review to negative after the latest patch and DLC expansion Conclave which completely broke the game with the new education system. Some other features are fine but one of the most important parts of this game for me is the dynasty management and raising your children. If they sort the childhood education I will give it a positive review again. Right now I cannot play my all time favorite game and enjoy it like before.   Really one of the strategy games I had most fun with overall together with Medieval 2: Total War and Rome: Total War. The games are widely different however and personally I really love the complexity and increased difficulty that one faces in Crusader Kings. The fact that the game is more about your dynasty and personal character rather than the entire nation(as in EU series) is something which makes Crusader Kings so much more enjoyable to me and further adds alot of replayability to the game. That means if you like to roleplay your actions according to your characters personality it is entirely possible and very enjoyable in this game.   The expansions have added alot more depth into the game. I would recommend getting atleast the Old Gods directly when you purchase the base game as that expansion adds an earlier starting date and several interesting mechanic for Norse Rulers. After that I'd say Legacy of Rome is a nice expansion to have. I didn't really play Rajas of India even though I have it so I cannot comment on that. I'm completely uninterested in India and prefer CatholicMuslim or Norse rulers. That leads me into Sword of Islam which is obviously a must have if you want to play a muslim ruler which is pretty interesting and more challenging in terms of dynasty management in comparison to catholic rulers imo. The expansions I would probably not advice people to purchase is definetely Sunset Invasionit's really pretty crap imo
This game is great for people who love to mess around and just ruin history.  Invading the HRE after forming Ireland as Deashumanium (stupid irish names) for examplethen destroying waldenisian Scotland and cathar France while marrying your sister off to your nephewthe king of aquitaine.  Great game I really only recommend on sale
This game is awesome. See all the positive reviews? The only negative reviews in for this game are about the amount and price of DLCs. But these people fail to see that the base gameno modsno DLC
One of the most addicting games I've ever played. Everything Civ wishes it could be. My only complaint is that it can get boring. If you like varietyyou might find that you never finish even one single gamejust like me
it sucks is horaerball
BrilliantRTS as it should be.
very fun with freinds.
A thouroughly addictive gamewith a steady flow of upgrades.
Best Game of all time
This game has allowed me to commit unspeakable crimes against humanity all in the name of Jesus Christ and I love it.
I'll be brief:  - Great mix of grand-strategy game and RPG with an amazing replay value (just check other reviews by people with hundreds and even thousands of hours into the game)  - You WILL need 5-10 hours of WORK to get used to all the game mechanics. Youtube videos provide good assistance. Just be patient and spent some hours checking out other players or try parallel playing/watching with a tablet or smartphone and your PC  - Questionable DLC policy... but at least the developers keep supporting their game   BUT:  Only buy the Crusader Kings II Collection when it's on sale for roughly 40! For the best experience with this game you need at least some of the DLC packs. And the vanilla version of CKII just doesn't contain enough of the important/fun mechanics to justify it's 40 (or $ or whatever) pricetag...   P.S.: Ignore my displayed time with the gameI'm playing offline and steam doesn't seem to be able to recognize this. If you want to know: I spent roughly 100 hours with CKII.
Great game.
Crusader Kings 2  A Paradox Interractive game that delivers complexityfun and interest. This game is designed for niche market of gamers but if you like deep mechanical games with many layers of gameplay then this is for you. You play as I either a custom or pre-made character in historical Europe and India. Your job is to run and safeguard your dynasty in whatever manner possible. I recomend this game indeedbe prepared to spend large amounts of money on all the DLC released for the game. Most of the DLC are worth the price.
Over time the added DLC's have made this game better and deeper.
Seduced a neighbouring rulers wifeconqured his landand made is wife my concubine just before I excecuted him.  10/10 would steal his girl again in his next life time
I never realized I was a grand strategy fan. I can't get into DOTA or Civbut the scheming! I dig itMarry off your kids
The game itself is great. Whether playing seriously or with commands and/or cheat mods. I have nothing bad to say about it besides the amount of DLC and some of the prices for it.
Incest = wincest
played it for a bit. nearly fucked my cousin 10/10
I like this gamebut that I don't like was that they have make so many DLC. Most of the dlc's are unit packportrait pack and songs pack. But I like it. If you not have some of the dlc's it can be boring to play. I have Ruler Deginer
I had a son named Cesaro and to teach him a lession I pushed him off a balcony. He was maimed for the rest of his life.  10/10 would push that turd again.
If your interested in the game itselfbuy it there is a 99% chance it would have been money well sepnt.
Simply the most beautifully crafted digital doll house money can buy you... and now it comes with horses! What's not to like?
Fun and interactive. Starts historically accurate and allows you to build on the historical figures to create your own European Dynasty. Empire building with the extra levels of intrigue and military. The game allows you to create your path for glorywith an old school RPG feel for the development of your leader and council as you build your nation.
Its really a great stratagy game.  CKII is a game that I find more about mental stratagy and trying to outthink unpredictable events. If your looking for fancy graphics and intense combatthis is not the game for you.  If your looking to breed with cousinssiblings
There are very few games I've played that I am unable to complain aboutbut this is one of them.  Paradox has created a game that is incredibly complexand becomes even more complex with every DLC they release. Speaking of DLCs
The greatest idea ever concieved of by mankind.
$10.99 is a steal for this game.  It may seem intimidating at first with so much to learn but just start off on a segregated island.  You can rule a provinceor can become King of an entire realm if you desire. You can play passive and contribute to your countryor rebel and attempt to overthrow the kingdom.  You can set taxes for your cities
It's like tamagotchi but with people from the dark ages.
While i do reccomend this gamei for some reason am not able to start past 1337 with bookmarks. This is right after the conclave expansionso it may be bugged. But be warned
One of the best games I ever played.
I like this game.
Really goodintricate strategy gamewell worth the price on amazon (not here)
Besides the micro-transactionsthis game is a master piece.  I suggest picking up the AGOT mode (Game of Thrones mod) it's almost version 1.0 now.   It's really hard going back to EU games after thisat least for me. The replay-ability in this game is astounding. I usually just play a duke in England every time I play
10/10 Would kill their first Child again just because their second one has better traits.  10/10 Would Conquered Norse Scandinavia again just because their raids are annoying.  Welcome to Crusader Kings 2!
To play crusader kings II all you need is a mouse with two buttons and an inclination towards incestmurder and adultery.
Creating the grand Empire of Scandinavia has never been this fun before.
Game is fun
10/10  -1 because of texts too small
Definitely recommend this game if you like strategy games like Civ or Age of Empires. This is not the same kind of gamebut if you like thoseyou'll LOVE this!
Crusader Kings 2 is very funbut also takes a little getting used to. Have fun!
This game is like crack. Seriously get this game and mod the hell out of it. If you're like me and don't like the practices done by private owned companies and refuse to buy the dlc because of it then you know what you gotta do.  I always try to get the realm as close to libertarian-socialism as I can. The closest I can get to it is like a mix of feudalism and marxist-lenninism. Super high taxes so the wealth is completely owned by the statelowest levy requirementsrelying instead on my demense
I used to recommend this gameand now I don't.  I feel like the most recent updates ruined this game.
Steep learning curvebut rewarding once you figure it all outand once you do figure it all out you discover that it's actually a dynasty simulator with a built in sadism element.  There is nothing quite like having two kids
United IrelandOne grandson the King of West Franciaone grandson the King of East Francia
I've played it a little. It's pretty good.
I've put so many hours into this game that I feel like I should have paid more for it.
Hard to learn the mechanics but fun once you do
I've played it a bit. It's aight.  Althought after the big Conclave update be ready to play a game just as hard as Xcom2 on Veteran.
King Murchad of Ireland was a sex offender. He banged every women in the courtand ended up having 12 fuck children plus five legitimate ones. He legitimized all of his fucks and now he has members of his family connected to every major kingdom in Europe.  10/10
Got it when Sword of Islam was released4 years later I somehow have over 240USD in DLC.  240USD/10.
This be da dank kush mang. I be playin' this sheet fo' days mah homie. It be like 'BAMN' in tha start bu' dayum it be exciting to learn! I be recommendin' dis to mah homies in Afghanialand and stuff yo. Y'all get dis game or somethin' if y'all want to like be a king like I am. I be knowin' everythang about dis' game now and yo dawg it be really like 'DAAYUM'. Dis game be keepin' it real fo shizzle.   Its great except for the fuck piles of DLC.

Devs are constantly ruining the game for me. They don't care about fun anymorethey just make Europa Universalis with portraits.  fuck youParadox.
Had to unistall in order to regain lifehas been in withdrawal ever since. Buy only if you have free timeif not you'll make free time. And lose everything you've ever loved.  A must buy!
I think I'm finally getting the hang of it
Pretty good game 8/8 would play again.
A good game. Just buy it.
Started as a duke in SicilyHoly warred for north Africa after creating the Kingdom of Sicily as it only made sense for quick expansion. in a single crusade for Andulusia I did the whole reconquista in blink of the eyeturned east for Egypt
Fantastic game00s of hours of potential play time. I have played about 50 hours and am only half way through my first dynasty run. I have killed my wifeimprisoned my daughter and had my heir die of an 'accident'. Could write a book based on my house's story.
Took a couple false starts to learn how to playand then I managed to elevate myself from Earl of Connacht to the triple-crowned King of IrelandScotland and Wales through a rigorous regimen of murder
Crusader Kings II like Europa has a steep learning curve but once you get the hang of it it's a gratifying game. It requires knowledge of how the feudal system works and doesn't really explain things in their entirety. You'll spend most of your time managing your vassalschanging succession lawsand trying to assassinate other characters. My biggest gripe to the developer is all the DLC. I wish they could have included more content in the base game instead of releasing $100 worth of DLC. They did the same thing with Europa.
This game is fantastic. I'd advise buying it on sale and with the main DLC since altogether it can get pretty pricey. I realise there's a lot and it may be confusing so here's a list of the DLC that will provide a wide range of options as well as gameplay differences.  Charlemagne Sword of Islam Horse lords Rajas of India The Old Gods The Republic (These allow you access to play in an earlier time periodextending gameplayand unlocks Islamic
Endless replayability.
Great game. You need to play it to enjoy it.
The pope has died in battle.
I went from a decent human being to an incestuousgaykingslaying lunatic possessed by the devil and riddled with disease from my 100-or-so affairs on my ugly
A neverending tide of crappy and poorly optimized DLC along with game-breaking and seemingly untested patches have ruined this game. Understand the most of it's high ratings are from years ago when it was a fantastic game. In it's current state I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Just so mutch love!&lt3
Quite simplythe greatest game ever in the history of anything anywhere.
One of the best grand strategy games out thereif not the best. If you have ever played Total War and wanted a better campaign experiencethis game is that. My review is based on the mod community however
how do i play this?
Amazing game its a pure LEGEND.
Difficult game to get into but once you do.. you'll be hooked. its a very indepth strategy game.
I spent a game destroying a dynasty because some ancestor of theirs killed one of my early characters. I waged Holy War after Holy War and removed Kebabs from the Middle East. I forged a Pagan Sun worshiping dynasty that is a minor footnote in history into the greatest and Most Powerful Empire the world has ever seen.  Great gameI love it.
The game is excellently made and is updated with large patches and dlc regularly so that when things get stale it becomes exciting again after taking a break for only a week or so.
Ever get bored in history calss? How abou making your own historyas the greatest ruler the world has ever seen!
Fuq family
10/10 will imprison and impale my brother-in-law to just get land again.
A fantastic game. Definitely recommended
Extremely addictive gamevery engaging and personalizable. Customizing your character and leading your section of Europe through the dark ages there is always something to new to do. Being able to play a country till you want to change the fate of another allows for lots of 'what-if' replayability scenarios. The mod scene is simply incrediblehighly suggest the Historical Immersion Project mod if you want the most from the game. All the DLC is very enjoyable as well.  Downsides are that its really hard to finish a single game or see everything in CK2. Combat a bit dry
I don't know any other game where you can have a ruler be a gaypossessed werewolf that talks to satangets military advice from jesus and holds all 7 deadly sins. 10/10
I tried to play CK2.... but I'm too moral a person.  CK2 is a great game if you're into plottingbackstabbingand generally are okay with murdering your brother just to steal his title so you have direct access to his income and armies
This game is like trying to build a spaceship out of toothpicks inside a hyperbolic time chamber. It's so monumentally fucked up. I have no idea how they invented this total madness.  My first run throughwhile I was learning the gameI spent 26 hours forgetting to eat
This Game is Greatfun time for allsingleplayer and Multiplay. Only complaint I have is that multiplayer needs to be more stable
This game is pretty good. I play it from time to time.
just started playingseems good so far
Crusader Kings 2 is a revelation for the strategy game genre - one of the first mainstream grand strategy games that holds incredibly unique gameplay that will keep you playing to preserve your dynasty and drive it to historical greatness.
This Game is SWEEEEETTTTT!!! UP TO 1256 hours
This game is pretty goodI guess.
This game taught me the art of killing my son so that I may marry his sister. It taught me the finer things in lifesuch as appointing my horseMr. Buttons
Got maimed in a fight then got wounded in the next but this magically cures the maimed status 10/10 would get cut by a sword to regain limbs again
10/10 would marry my firstborn son to my firstborn daughter and marry their daughter again
Probably the most most immersive game i've ever played
First off this Game is amazingI am going to give 4 pro's and 4 con's of the game and the gameplay itself.  Pro's: - The game gives a great field of ways to do somethingfor instance: You are a Lord of York and you have a Liege (King) who dislikes you and wants to revoke your title to have it for himself you can start a plot to kill him or you can start a faction for Indipendence and let a greater force join you beacause he is your friend and now the Liege would rethink his decicion before going to war with you.  - You have can have amazing mods on this game like the Game of Thrones mod where you can play in Westeros or Essos.  - Of you think you're done with playing
This game is deeper than old Meg's pus*ybut once you'll get into itit acctually feels really nice.  11/10
Note to self: Shattered World + Crusades = too many armies.
Yeahpretty good game I must say but be aware of the comany thet makes it. Paradox will charhe yu 10x for the same game with dlc's right and left.
10/10 would stop my king to eat and become fat
Tracts of land need plowing.
Always great to be murdered by my wife. 11/10.
Holy fantastic game. I've spent a disgustingly large amount of time playing this game and it still doesn't get old.
So I've chosen the Umayyad start in the early middle ages (year 769) and set my goal to islamize all of Europe. Conquered the whole Iberian Peninsula quickly and formed the Empire of Hispania. Then I went on a holy war for some land in West Franciawhich I easily won. Then I died of old age at around 57which is fine I guess. But in a turn of events
I don't have a problem.  Someone help me...
Who would have thought arranging marriages could be so fun? I found myself spending large amounts of time poring through family trees in this game. And I had a blast doing it. This game is very difficult to put down.
The only game you'll find yourself quoting bee movie! 'arent they our cousins?' 'distantdistant.'
This is not a casual game. Its a very deepcomplicated strategy game. With that saidit has almost endless replay potential
One of my favorite games of all time. The majority of dlc's are pretty goodbut paradox has started to release some fuck?? one's (DO NOT BUY CONCLAVE IT WILL WRECK YOUR GAME).
Made my wife the court jester. 11/10
The game could swallow your entire life-hour by customizing your own character. Either by cheat or natural event
I love the game but I have bought both Way of Life and The Reaper's Due and even though they are both installed and checked neither of them work when I start the gameit is like I dont have them. I have emailled support and searched the web for a fix but have got nothing.
Jumping Jews of Jerusalem apperead at me court in ConnachtaJumping Jews of Jerusalem stumbled and dishonored me dynasties fair. Jumping Jews of Jerusalem were executed for treason  10/10 would execute the Jumping Jews of Jerusalem again
Having played over 100 hours of Europa Universalis IVcoming to this was a whole new experience. For once the largest countries don't always have it best! Alsothe Byzantines aren't roadkill. That's new.  (pauses to take that into account)  Anyways
Game I'm on right now has me playing a duke in the Byzantine Empire. Married a common girlfell deeply in love with herhad lots of babies. As time progressed
Step 1: Buy game for $10 on sale Step 2: Pirate all DLC Step 3: ??? Step 4: Profit
At first i did not like they game because it felt a bit complicatedhowever after the initial learning curve this game has quickly became one of my faviorite games and i realy enjoy it now :D.
As kotaku puts it's 'the gateway drug to grand stategy' pretty much a historical simulatorwhere you get to take a family through 400 years of high medival politicswar and subterfuge. Now with DLC you can take control of pagans
the game is great (what got me into grand strategy games) paradox did great and and the viking metal dlc is so good
10/10 Would murder my rival's family again
This game is pretty fricking in-depth and has a bit of a learning curve. I still don't know how to do certain things and yet have been loving it fully and completely. The historical accuracydiplomacy options and even mod support all rock. If you love the Total War gamesthis game is probably for you. If you enjoy really long
Had 20 children to 3 wives and 6 concubines not one inherited the genius trait.  10/10
Once you truely get a grasp on this game it becomes quite a legendary experience.
Its a good gameprobably the easiest of Paradox's grand strategiesif that interests you.
600 hours in as of writing this and I'm about half way through my second game! I'm finally feeling like I just about know the rules now. WellI know most of the rules for a Feudal Catholic King. Not so much for a Merchant RepublicMuslim Kingdom
A complex simulation of feudal politicsdifficult to get intobut quite enjoyable once you do
With over 1400 hours of game play over the course of a year I still find this game re-playable. I first tried out the game on a demo and fell in love with the concept of playing a dynasty over the twenty years in that demo. I later bought the game during a steam sale along with as many of the DLC I could afford at the timeand bought the rest of the DLC on another steam sale. I have experienced many things in this game and hope that my helpful review will get any who read this a clear picture of what this game is.  When you first start the game you will get the option to chose any ruler on a list of bookmarked dates or just select anywhere on the make that is selectable. (If you got the ruler customization DLC then you could make your own ruler after selecting a realm.) The earliest start date is 1066 without The Old Gods and Charlemagne DLC
CK2  History class
I love this gameand have been hooked on it for some timebut the reason I'm giving it a negative rating is because of the business practices associated with this game. The amount of game changing DLC is ridiculous. Without any of the DLC's that come with this game
Original medieval simulatorthere is nothing quite like it. Opened-ended sandbox with a lot of intrigurewar
It is like Sims with religious Wars and STDs.   10/10
Strategy is what this game is all about.
Played as King of Scotland. Rapidly conquered Ireland. Despite my best effortsson focused on theology. Have second son. Realize the inheiritance will split my kingdom. Wait until my character is super old and execute my seven year old second son because he was easier to imprison. Die. Become first sonwho has somehow contracted leprosy since I last saw him. Quickly become possessed
Better than sex.
- as a 19yo bold and stupid regnanti marry an ambitious woman with a high schemer skills - she gives me a male heir in less than a year - two weeks after my son's birth i get foodpoisoned at a feast and die - still wondering who's behind my murder  10/10 would marry her again
11/10 super fun game.  Sadly my rulers end up dying to cancer... almost. every. time. ... makes me sad and laugh
Somehow this game almost never gets boring. Kinda pricy to get in though. I don't want to know how much money I have spent to get all DLC for it.
Great gamea MUST for all paradoxgrand strategy fans
One of the best grand strategy games of all time.
One of the most deep and addictive games I've ever played. The family dynasty system is so much fun - building up your family's holdingstrying to engineer the best marriages for future claimsmaking sure your relatives aren't total idiots/jerks. Paradox does such a great job with steadily improving the game too CK2 originally came out in 2012 but still has meaty DLC dropping regularly. Combined with a great modding community
An amazing game that combines strategy and role-playing into a source of endless delight.
Great game lots of funny moments
One of my Vassals didn't come to my lavish banquet i spent 100 gold onso i spent 6000 gold to 'dissappear' all of his childrenmade his heir a eunuch
Great gameI loved it. I'm a fan of the Total War games so this was unusual to begin with but after persevering and watch 'Let's play's on Youtube I got the hang of it. Loved the idea of being a family rather than a country!
My favourite game!
Best game ever? Probably...If you want to find out exactly how evil you are inside play this game.   -You will murder and backstab everyone who ever loved you. -You will exterminate whole nations b/c 400 years ago their king refused to marry your ugly daughter. -You will imprison your maid and let her die of neglect because you were bored.
It is very good game but with dlc's . In my country the value of the national money is fuck ( thanks to politics and politicians ) . Like 1 Dollar  3 Turkish Liras . But thanks to steam they fixed the price a lil' bit . I bought the game's most contents at sale . Like 40 dollars ( 113 Turkish Liras with ultimate strategy lol . The price without sale was 500 Turkish Liras ) . And I must say it's a greater game than Europa Universalis IV . The price of Europa Universalis IV is higher than Crusader Kings II's but that game is better than it . You can manage so many things in CK 2 but you can't manage these many things in EU 4 . If you compare these two things they have their special things that other don't have . I can say that game is the best Paradox product for a fee of course . If you are happen to buy a strategy game like this . This game must be your most precious game . This game earns the every dime of its price ( with 75% sale of course ) .  Good things : - Huge Management For Nation - Rich Diplomacy Content - Synchronous With Real History ( sort of ) - Customization ( With DLC's ) - Rich Content Rather Than Europa Universalis IV - Many Things You Expect From a Strategy Game - Good Army Management - Managable And Improvable Rulers  Bad things : - Short Timeline ( you have to edit game to reach longer . 600 years is short for me and I play it from 700s to 1300s . In default you start from 1000s to 1300s . It's pretty short for a game like this. ) - Bad Fleet Management - Game Display Is Hard To Understand ( Hard management for contents ) - No Mods In Workshop ( You can find them on internet like moddbyou can download mods from workshop but i ment big mods can't be reachable via workshop as far as i know . ) - So Many Trash DLC that already have to be in game  Don't expect ultimate graphics from a game like this . If they did so retty Graphics you would have to pay huge amounts for Stable FPS ( Hardware had to be beast ) .  Last Edit : 12 November 2016 06:47 UTC+3
This is the greatest single game ever created by God or man. It is also the most expensive game ever created as well so if you give it a try you are going to become addicted like the rest of us and thats how Paradox gets you hooklineand Motherfuckin sinker. Now you have another $300 worth of DLC to pick up for the complete experience and you will pick it up. All of it. Must play CKII
Highly recommend this game its awesome!
All you need is this game and the Game of Thrones mod and you'll lose around 300 hours of your life.
After an absolute shed-load of hours playing this gameI'm still barely an amateur in the ways of Karling murder and Zoroastrian incest. Amateurness asideI've still managed to raid
Very in depth game.  Very modable.  Lots of replayability.  The only annoying thing is the constanttotally rediculousrandom effects. You start out ok. Then by 10 years you are a possessed
I bought crusader kings II because Europa Universalis' extended timeline mod just didn't do the trick for me. what I expected was something quite alike EUbut only slightly different.  now here's the good partit was a lot different. Crusader Kings II really refines the genre
I've played this game quite a bitbut I can't make myself enjoy it so much as Europa Universalis IV.  What I don't like about this game is that it is so difficult to make moneywhich is needed to make anykind of other development in the country and take many decisions. Also
44844
Incredibly fun grand strategy game. If you are a fan of other Paradox grand strategy gamesthen you'll like this one just as much. If you aren't particularly a fan of grand strategy gamesthis one is stil worth checking out
Insanely fun! Word of advice: Before buyinglook up gameplay videos etc. Make sure you are aware this is NOT Mount and Bladeor Total War. Learn the game. Take the losses. Take the obstacles. It is a part of the games approach to be under the gun with decision making
This game is really good.
Pretty good. I'll write a full review once I've put enough time in. 9/10
Ever wanted to know how many generations of inbreeding does it take to turn your dynasty infertile? Well now you can!  Just watch out for those overpriced DLCs.
I try to play kind characters in most games. Crusader Kings 2 makes me assassinate my vassalwho I have known since he was a childbecause he followed the wrong religion. It made me war against my brothers to reunite an empire
It starts an innocent take on the grand strategy genre.   It starts with mere 'dynastic bettering'  But soon you'll be strategically interbreeding.  No big dealpeople married cousins very recentlyright?  But when your daughter-aunt rules a kingdom
If you like over throwing democratically elected countries and destroying entire economiesthen I suggest donating to the Clinton Foundationif you want to waste an entire day expanding your own empire
9/10 needs more paper mana
Great Game! Really worth the time and money -)If you miss a good fightgo for real time strategy
There's a reason I have 500+ hours played in this game. It's that good.
If you like brooding over you next move for hours on end then this is for you.
Can have intercourse with horses  10/10
- Starts as Count of Santiago in 769 - Grooms awesome son - Gets murdered by wife - Son rulesconquers Portucale from the Moors - Son becomes Duke and powerful council member in the Kingdom of Asturias - At age 51 has existential crisisseeks immortality - Sends his knights to the four corners of the known world in search of someone who possessed the secrets of immortality - Finds no one - Wild old woman named Cleopatra appears - Ignores everyone who says the old woman is a sham - First test
If you wanna lose track of time because you just want to win an extra war or get to the next year. Then this game is for you.  DEUS VULT!!
After playing over 500 hourscreating multiple kingdoms or empires (and destroying even more)recreating Roman Empire and trying to create many other (often twisted) combinations I still can't quite stop playing this game. It's been with me for over 2 years and I sincirely recommend it to every fan of strategy games. It was time definentely well wasted.  By me 10/10
The only game where you have to pick between your sister or your beloved horse for who will be your queen.
A very good base game with dlc that for the most part adds to the game
Think of this game as Simswith strategy and incest - lots of incest
+Incest +Vikings +Crusades +Possibility to murder little children +Black Death wiping out Europe  --The DLCs bring you to bankruptcy 9.9/10
It's OK I guess. I might have to play a little more just to be sure if I like my Lunatic King character and the way how his heir killed his 6 brotherstheir male children and ended my lineage by dying without an heir of his own. But heyatleast he got to be the King for 6 years before ending my House's reign as the rulers of England.
One of the best strategy games i ever played. I just keep comming back to the game.  The game and most of the DLC-s are worth every penny.
The only game where i've been genuinely scared of hyperintelligent Aztecs invading my fuck and tearing down my empire.
Started out as an irish count and ended up owning most of europe.
You want to have to read 20 guides to get your first game going? You want to have your newborn son and heir killed by your brother because he wants the throne? You want to marry a 2 year-old and die before they ever come of age?  Then Crusader Kings II is the game for you!  Nobut seriouslyCrusader King has a extremely high bar of entry
I became an immortal lunatic with a horse doctor for 400 years.  Would recommend to a friend.
Even though this game has a pretty steep learning curvewhen you first begin to understand the basic conceptsthe rest will follow. This is pretty much your very own history fanfiction maker
How to begin?  It's a long time since I played it to be honest. But I think the game hours tells you how much I have enjoyed it over the years.  Warning: Learning curve is steep! And I still don't have all the skills to even survive past the first character.. becouse...  GAVELKIND! MURDER! JIHAD AND...  Ohsorry... did I blur out? I meanit's not that hard...  Mongols. Plauge. Vikings. More Plauge. More Vikings. Crusades. Jerusalem. Jihad. Crusade. Plauge. Family dead. And did I mention the PLAUGE!  After the update of illneses I stopped for a while
Love this gamewith all the dlc you can waste hours on hours
I can't stop. Please send help!
I like to pretend I understand this game and wow people with my intelligence
I cannot start this game because I'm never able to shut down.  The only game I find enjoyable even though I'm losing. It's like history evolving and your ability to influence history is limited (you really do participate and influence progressbut it is perfectly balanced).  I would love to have more hours in the game... But I cannot risk starting a game up...
I used to have a life now i have CK2 and EU4
While there is a lot of DLC and it takes a while to get a handle on all the mechanicsthis game is well worth the effort. The wiki can be a big help if you find yourself lost or confused about how things work. Once you know what you are doing this game is great.
The game is great because it allows you to be any ruler (almost)is a mix of rpg and strategyand it is purposefully unbalanced. The modding community is also quite good. However it can be unfair at times
It's a great game and a giant timesink. Will make you hate the Karlings.
I guess it's okay...
I accidently caused a civil war that birthed three new aztec empiresone in Englandone in France and one in Greece.  10/10 for historical accuracy.
Don't know how to play this :-?
Played a game with my friend as Navarahe was the newly founded Portugalwe worked together to take out all the sand fuck?s in the area. After that we turned our attention to Castill who had recently ate up Leon and most of Galacia. We knew Castill would dominate us militarily because we went on heaps of crusades and had defended against many muslim jihads thus our army size was greatly reduced (I had a levy of 1000 vs castill's levy of 17000).   Castill declared war on me and I knew I was going to loose
Crusader Kings 2: Murder everyone you hate simulator
Well i'm fucked... Ia well known and formerly loved vikingam the victim of a malicious disease
Even tho I find Paradox's DLC marketing a bit greedyyou gotta give it to them. After allit's the reason I 'still' come across stuff that I haven't seen before.  Best medieval dynasty simulator/grand strategy game ever made.  I'd give my left kidney to a better made game with the same concept.
Only a few hours in and I have already united northern Spain and am in the line of succession for the Holy Roman Empire. I'm still a long way from being a probut already enjoying the game. Would recommend.
I spent too much time on this damn game. Send help.
It's a time machine! I went though hundreds year from 7 century. It's now 21th century? Oops...
You can marry your sister and have a harem full of horses. 8/8
10/10 would bang my wifes sister again...and her daughter
I have sunk more than 350 hours into this game and will probably continue to put more in it's almost made me late for work on a number of occassions. It has stayed fresh and amazing throughout my playthroughs and I cannot recommend it enough. The level of detailintrigueand just plain fun that arises once you get over the steep learning curve of the game will see you sink hundreds of hours into it. Seriously...you need to play this game.
Just one more year...' -4hrs later
I have a new found hatred of Karlings and Heresy.
Ultimate incest simulator on the marketstrongly recommended
Really nice simulation
While this game can be a little tedious and complicated to startit can become seriously addictive! I recomend people buy it (especially when it and expansions are on sale) and add some mods to make the game exactly what you want to play.
Hands down one of my favorite games of all time. It comes with a steep learning curve though. The Game of Thrones mod makes for a different type of game as well.
Imprisoned my step-daughter and murdered my wife in order to keep control of my two counties and produce an heir that wasn't a complete failure - A+ game
Look at the number of hours I have in this game. That sums it upreally.  It's fantastic. It's rage inducing. It makes murder and incest fun.  But most importantlyit allows you to seduce your horse and restore the Roman Empire (as a horse).  Best use of a farm animal. Ever. Of all time.
One of the best games currently on saleIt's a time consumer like no other game. It's hard to understand but very rewarding once you get the hang of it.  You lean good life lessions such as:  1. Everyone you ever see will want to kill you (so be aware) 2. People only care about themself 3. Choose the traits of your wife carefully 4. If you can get a horse named glitterhoof 5. Never have more than one sonsince the younger one will most likely spend their entire life trying to kill the elder one 6. Never stop seducing someone 7. If someone is a fuck throw money at them  4/7 would play 350hrs more
Still one of the best romantic comedy strategy games.
Was a viking chiefson and first heir joined the Varangian guard and came back a homosexual eunuch. 10/10 would do again.
Banged my cousin. Became king of Ireland. 10/10.
I played it a little.
Best family and friend simulator 2016
Crusader Kings 2 is as fresh as it is now as it was back in 2012. This game keeps expanding and developing thanks to Paradox's constant development and maintanance. Howeverthe development comes at a price: Paradox's dlc policy.   There have been dozens of DLC's released so far for this game. Accompanying each DLC is a free patch for every customer which add fixes or changes game's rules to make it even better. While each specific DLC has added depth to the gameall of them do not share the same quality. Moreover
one of the best games
This probably isn't the easiest game to get intobut if you have a bit of patience then this is basically Littlefinger Simulator 2016 with bonus incest and eugenics (there's a superb GoT mod if you want to actually play in that setting). You can also just be a viking lord and pillage Rome and then sacrifice the pope to the Norse gods.
You need to be focus on everything or else you lose.
So you want to kill you mothermarry your sister and send your usless sons to die in foreign lands? CK2 got you covered!  This is the ultimate dysfunctional family simulator. Take control of the head of an 8th century family and plotkill and fight for power in this absolutely brilliant grand strategy game from Paradox. And if 700 years is not enough
Be friends vassal Find an attractive and quick woman in the woods Take her to your court  Take her as concubine  Friend who is my lord imprisons her and then makes her his concubine Find another lady in the woods who is also quick and attractive  Take her to courtjust as a lover My lords concubine is cheating on him with me The child is mine Lord imprisons me and kills my lover Beg for mercy as he tries to cut my fuck off He releases me to help against factions  Start a war for independence over my ladies of the woods 10/10 would start more wars for random women I find in the woods
Best game ever sooo many hour spend inbreading
Highly addictivemedieval dynasty simulator. There is good replayability and decision making eg what vassal to reward for his loyal service to your crown. The graphics are perfectly fine for a game of this type and the game for the most part runs smoothly.   Just make sure to have a few save games or save to the cloud. I have had a couple of corrupted save files occur before.
A game that make me a fan of Paradox Development Studio. Love the gameplaygraphics and mods. CKIII is going to be my pre order game!
Basically eugenics simulator. 10/10 would create kingdom of geniusstrongattractive people again
Never finished an actual game. Can't stop starting over with new ideasnew countrynew whatever. Pretty good game.
I have spent far too much money and time on this gameit's like a drink problem.... Once I start I just can't control myselfI play an hour
Proudly nominating this for the 'Just 5 more minutes!' award.
This is by far the best game I've played in a while. I always keep coming back for more.
I've logged more time into this game than I might have had for many other games including Morrowind when it first came out and League of Legends. It surpassed Skyrim (which blew my mind).  As a huge fan of strategy gamesthis game does have one hell of a learning curve at first. Once you begin to pick up how to play the gamethings become easier. The replay value is phenomenal. It's so easy to say '5 more minutes' and it can turn into a full hour. If you like a mix of RTS and something a little like Civilization
This has to be one of my favourite games of all timeand is my most played on Steam so far.It's a fairly unique strategy game with RPG and simulation elementsthat allows you to play as any kind of character possible
And years later...I still get totally lost for hours at a time. I don't know what they could possible do in CK3. CK2 is (still) worth every penny!!
non-stop dlcs. but still fine game.
Crusaders Kings 2 is for people that look at the more common rts titles and think 'this isnt complex enough'. It is to date the best sandbox grand rts I have ever played. The only real weakness of it is a rather bad tutorial and the overwhelming scope of the game making it hard to approach if you are new to Paradox Interactive developed titles. If you have never played a paradox grand strategy game before I would recomend playing 'Hearts of Iron 4' because of the excellent tutorial of that game but if you have played that for awhile and is ready for a new grand strategy gamethis is the game for you.  As in all grand rts titles the graphics really exists to accomodate the UI and little else which as of now it does very wellthough it wont win any awards for graphical fidelity or aesthetics. Trying to talk about the mechanics of a game like this is like trying to describe the ocean bucket for bucket
I mean It´s Just perfect
Ladies and gentlemen. 'Lo and behold! Before you is the ultimate middle age simulator game called CK2! A game with many good sides and few flaws!  What is so good about this game? You play as a landed ruler that has to essentially keep his dynasty in powerduring which your ruler constantly switches due to assassination plotsdepression
Game is damn awesome if you love High Strategy games with a large focus on politics. Buy it.  Now with fully fleshed out mods for:  -Game of Thrones -Warhammer Fantast -Elder Scrolls -Lord of The Rings
Crusader Kings II has that ability to sit in your library for a whileand make you come backbuy all the DLC
cuck everyone.
Chiming in to say that this game deserves it's high praise - one of the most funcomplex and yet accesible (if you put the time into it) games out there.
When I was away leading the realm's armiesmy wife became pregnant.  Of courseI investigated
Truly a testament to the genius that is Paradox InteractiveCrusader Kings II is THE dynasty simulator where you play as the figurehead of a family during the middle ages. Embark on crusades to take back Jerusalem from the Muslimsor even fight the crusaders yourself as the Muslim Sultan of Egypt. This game is currently one of the most complex yet rewarding simulations you can get for a medieval setting
The gift that keeps on giving :')
A game that keeps having you come back for more. By more i mean more crying over the death over your characterover the incompetent replacementthe numerous rebellions that usually follows and of course over the reduction of your huge empire to a single region.
I'm just here for the badge you get after reviewing a game you nominated in the Steam Awards.  And if you're wondering what category I nominated CK2 forjust look at how many hours I have on record and draw your own conclusion. )
Pretty amazing gameI recommend it!
It's a good game. I didn't think I would like itbut I ended up liking it.
The Real Game of Thrones Simulator. Amazing game.
Don't buy this. Do something else. Save yourself
This game's simply fantastic. I spent an uncountable amount on time playingwith and without mods. The amount of possibilities is just awesome.
This game taught me early European history better than my college professor.  10/10
Very enjoyable game which will take a while to learn but provide thousands of hours in return.
This is a great game.  Prepare to kill your wifeyour kidsyour crazy uncle. If you die of old age you will be lucky.
Constantly updated and always addictive
You could say that 410 hours that I spent on this game could be used in a better way... but I would disagree :).
The Best Murder your friends Simulator ever
I hope it will win it's 'The best incest simulator' award.
This medieval dynasty simulator is beyond engaging. Getting past the initial phase of 'oh my god what does this thing mean?!' and finding the depths of the game is incredibly rewarding. The things you can accomplish and the stories you can create are always worth the playtimein my experience. Eventually you'll find yourself testing the limits of the gameand then branch out into the modding community
Be menew player Playing king of Leongoing pretty well Marry princess from other kingdom
This is a wonderful game that I have put too many hours into. I wish the dlc had more in it and that they would fix the Roman empire imperial administation but it is worth it especially on sale.
You can solve basically any problem in this game through murder.  10/10
Last foreveralways differenta lot of mods.
If you like Grand Strategyto meat least out of the titles I've tried
Interactive history - start when you like - as who you like. And then try to keep your dynasty alive and in power. Experience power struggleswarsMongols from the East
Game is one of best games ever played. Tons of replayabilitylarge modding community and lots to do.
If you like strategy games and especially grand strategy games you'll like this. Crusader kings 2(CK2) focuses on your characters personal skills and deficiencies more than the greater picture of other grand strategies but it's what gives it a unique feeling. You can play in many ways if you like map painting there's plenty of that to go around but if you like internal politics this is the best strategy game around. The incredible modding community and ongoing support for the game from the devs makes this game an incredible bang for your buck proposition.
Great game
Conquer the world through incestand assassination plots. Then appoint a horse as the pope.
If you value a healthy social lifedon't buy this game.  If you're fine with wasting countless hours trying to torture/murder/conquer your way to the top while unleasing your evil selfbuy it right away.
500 hours playing this gameit means something I believe.  Some time later: 950 hours..
This game is #1. I've never played a game so addicting. With all the different ways to playit takes a couple (hundredthousand?) hours to fully experience CK2
Not bad. Worth playing for a few hours.
I play sometimes.
You know that good feelingwhen everything goes as you planned? Wellthan you have´t played CK2.
The only game where you can grow your dynasty to be the biggest force in Euro-Asia... and lose it all because your PC died without a heir or had too many heirs or your small council hated you or your kid was too ambitious... what it is my CouncilorPope ordered another Holy War? Sorry guyscrusader trait won't be gained by doing nothing!
Just buy the damn game. You won't need any other for a long time.
Excellent game! It was already good at release and now after years of patches that added content the quality is amazingthere's just so many things that you can do. I don't own all the DLCsbut the ones that I have really add depth to the game. The Old Gods is my favourite.
One of the best strategy games I have ever played. Paradox as a studio always delivers and this game is no different. And the DLC has kept the money flowing out of my pocket to this day.  10/10 would lose all my money to a medieval genocide sim again. Massive murder
Incestuous marriage 
Is Crusader Kings II worth your attention and money?  I like to think soeven though the dlc is getting a little out of hand. But if you like grand strategy it should be a must buyregardless of the abundance of dlc. I've gotten all of them apart from Sons of Abraham and I must say they were worth every penny
If you have played europa universalis or a similar game from paradoxthis is just as epic. Yet again paradox have showened that they trully master the crafting of a map based strategy game. If you like these kind of game buy itbecasue then you will put hours into it.
This game has remained one of my favorite games since my friend introduced me to the original several years ago. With the DLC that has come outthere is a plethora of different ways to play the game. I always end up coming back to this game whenever I step away from it for too long. Highly recommended.
You can breed with horses.  10/10 Eugenics simulator.
Truely a singular achievement in gaming. Before playing it's important to realize this is a dynasty simulator rather than a war game... while you can certainly take over the worldthe only loosely defined goals are for your dynasty to a) survive and b) grow in prestige.
The best game ever for creating historical hilariously named monsters.
Conquer Land Make Babies Get Cancer Have Eye Removed Lose Hand In Battle Wife becomes possessed Wife kills all my sons I die No heir Game over 11/10 Would play again
First point alot of the negative comments complain about the DLC and compare paradox to EA. Unlike EA taking things out of their games (sim citysims 4etc) Paradox are adding more into spice up the game and keep you playing with the bigger DLCS (old gods
Best funny story generator I have ever played
Best medieval simulator there is.
Most addictive game
Played it a littlepretty good.
44844best incest simulator on the market
Murder incest simulator.  This game is so addictive. Lost too many hours to it!
It takes your time like u have no life.
Good game with great developers.
Fun for all the familyespecially thr yhings you can do to your family in the game... Great dynasty simulator and take-over-the-known-world game.
A Game of Centuries... Literally. There is certain kind twisted enjoyment trying to make your dynasty survive the years. The family trees that keeps twisting around as you try to keep everything in place and bid for power. Makes one happy :D Unimaginable amount of replay and quite steep learning curve... Love it.
It's pretty good!
Totally Best Life Eating Game Ever.
Started as William the fuck in 1066 to go for the achievment to take over England.  Attempt 1: Get 12000 troops together cross the English channelFrance and HRE go to war my charcter is made lead troops for France.. Annoyed at this i continue start sieging London. William the fuck dies in battle against the HRE..  Attempt 2:Do the same before this time England has an Army of 5000 men i think ok this is an easy fight 12000 vs. 5000 pfft .. Seconds later R.I.P. 12000 die horribly kind of fuck?? of at this point.  Attempt 3: Same as before only yhis time i dont attack the English ArmyIm happily sieging London when oh whos this the Norse Invasion with 10000 men.... R.I.P England. Suddenly im fighting 10000 Norse men who now own England.  Hit Esc
Great gameI always come back to it.
It's ok
If you're looking for a heroic adventure with noble and just characterswell you've bought the wrong game.
44844
This is a very good game in its own right but it also has a high repeatability factormany games after 2 or 3 play through then get dumped into the forget pile but because of the huge variations possible in this game you keep coming back . However what is exceptionally annoying is the constant drip feed of extra items solely to milk yet more money out of the customers. The only positive of this is that the game is still supported even after all this time possibly because of the desire to get another few bucks from the next add on.   We all like add ons but many of the ones released should have either been in the original game or lumped together in bigger releases.
I think I would've spent $200+ dollars on this game if I bought all the DLC for it full price. 10/10 not a moneypit
I just noticed that I've put in over 800 hours of play time into this game I felt I needed to come and give my endorsment properly If you enjoy a grand strategy title that spans many generations where selective breeding can make as much difference as a carfully laid game plan then this title is for you.  Oh the wicked things I've done to my rivals and my own family members as well just to gain more power with each generatonor to make sure that the 'good son' is in line to take inheirit my lands.  Not to mention how many times I've wanted to smash my keyboard to bits when that perfectly groomed heir dies the same year they assume the throne leaving their brother Dingus the dullard to run my realm into civil war and ruin.  I wouldn't be suprised if I end up putting another 800 hours into this title.
Would die a possessedcrippled94 year old king getting military advice from Jesus again.
A game of fun and strategy. And fun comes first.
Role playing a bloody aristocrat.
This game will turn you into a ruthlesscalculatingcold-blooded person as you plot to murder your infant grandchildren who
What can I say. It's a game of conquestintrigueand strategic planning to make sure you stand on top in this game of characters. You start off as a noble of your picking and depending on your decisions
Pretty good.
The amount of detail and in-depth content in this game is truly incredible. One of the best AI I've played against. The sheer amount of possibilities is almost overwhelming. It does take quite a few playthroughs to understand and even thenyou won't know about many mechanics in the game but that's what makes it funyou're always discovering more and that's what I love abut this game. If you're a fan of grand strategy games
An advanced matchmaker simulation set in mediaeval times. Or how to capture most of Europe without going to war. Absolutely addictive and definitely something you should check out if you're a strategy enthusiast.
A journey of intrigue and the self made millionaire Donald Tru.. whoever you chose to be.
The most fun you'll ever have strategically murdering members of your family in order to keep control of your feudal demesne.  The DLC bring substantial free updates to the main game in addition to the reasonably-priced paid contentso it keeps on getting better and better with time.
Sacrificed my son and heir to the gods.  Impaled a courtier because she hated cats. Got Lover's Pox. Had any vassal who didn't like me assassinated and had a dog.  10/10 would own a dog again
Think of it as a strategy role playing game in the vein of a civilization style gamebut with far less emphasis on technology and a far more developed system of diplomacy. You play as a dynasty and control one ruler at a timeswitching to their heir each time your current character dies. There is no particular goal to the game
gets chancellor its glitterhoof 0 on all stats  best gamewould glitterhoof again 10/10
Played endlessly on the original. This one beat it in every way and continues to add content. DLC heavy for a newcomerbut for those that have been playing since release and picking up all of the expansions along the waymassive game
Even now after 4 years can still enjoy the game !
Cuckolding husbands since 769.
This game is an amazing way to live out the feudal system and to make a horse your chancellor.
To say I've spent a few hours playing this game would be underestimating it. As with many of the older Paradox gamesthe learning curvecan be described more as a learning cliff
Crusader Kings II is a game that attracts history loverssim lovers and mayhem lovers! It seems complicated at first but then you realiseso is life! And that is precisely what makes this game so awesome: you can manipulate historical events to your advantage to change the course of history
Very fun and intriguing game.
A strategy gamea feudal simulator and both a history lesson and historical fiction. It will devour hours of your time. It has a steep learning curvebut eventually you'll get the hang of it and commit kin-slaying infanticide every two weeks.
Paradox grand strategy at its best with plenty of comical events and occurances. A glorious medieval sandbox.
I killed my son because he was fatuglyand lazy. Once I thought I was possesed by a demon. I even tried to make a flying machine with a help of a dog. It's like if Civ and Total War had a baby. You have to focus on keeping your people happy enough to raise a large army
Is there any other game where you can sayI just made my best friend and advisora horse
I get to fulfil my incestuous fantasies where I impregnate my imouto and marry my children with one another.
I have been playing this game for years and the love and the work they have continued to put in this helps keep bringing me back for more and more they may make mistakes but they continue to try to make this game better.
There is so much depth in this game its amazing! Overthrow kingdomsplot to kill your fathermarry your sister and a bunch of other medieval things you get to do! The only downside is that it takes about 20-30 hours to truely get a grasp on this game. Once you get the hang of it
One of the best medieval strategy games out there.
If you want a REAL sandbox experiencetry this game. You willl be the true master of your destiny.
I have manymany hours on a non-Steam version of this game.  It is complicated as hell at first lookbut if you just do some research and get some tips as you go along you will find yourself drawn in
Child-murderreligious warsincest
I have had quite a few hours on this game. I keep coming back to it. i purchase every explansion and am at the stage now where I'm slowly beginning to go for the achivements. Great game.
This game is a masterpiece. Although I do have all the expansions (apart from a few ill-conceived music remixes I won't touch)and they make the game infinitely betterit's a masterpiece even without any of them. No matter how hard I try
Despite what people sayit's not hard to learn. It might take an hour or two to get everything downbut once you do it's a breeze. Well worth your time.   However
My Finnish Shia Merchant Emperor won a scholarly debate against an Immortal Hellenic Horse Assasin. 10/10would go stark raving mad from inbreeding again.
first of all i played this game 270 hours since nov. 2012.  I love this game. Reason isthis game puts you in most desperate and realistic situations like that should be in medieval ages. As a countduke or emperor -doesnt matter- you always think one thing. Survive. Its intrigue system is so good
You can easily spend thousands of hours politicking and scheming in this game. Far and away the most Game of Thrones game in existance (especially if you play with the Game of Thrones mod).
The Doge of Venice repeatedly slept with my wives. All 6 of them. On our wedding nights.   10/10 would play another 300 hours
Eugenics-performingsister-seducingZun-worshipping
If you like being a horrible person and being rewarded for itthis game is for you.

Real good game if you can learn the basics. Commit to learn the basic mechanics and this game will take over your life.
The best Grand strategy alongside EU4. Highly recommended.
Recommended with the caveat that you need to be into slow paced highly complex strategy games.  Learning curve is pretty steepover 1300 hours in and I'm not 100% clear on everythingthough it's mostly about the archaic succession law rules and things like that
Game with battles so intense you can't even see them.
I keep coming back to this shiiii
This game has become the new 'one more turn' Civ5 game for me. It isn't turn basedhoweverI just can't shake the just play for a few more minutes that just captures my attention for a few more hours! There are a great deal of expansion packs for this game however they add a good amount of content to the game and the developers still release new expansions even though the game was released in 2012. This game is really well made and is a really fun game to play with a great amount of depth. The initial learning curve can be really high as even though I have played for many hours there are still game mechanics that I haven't even come close to mastering. Very good game and very good value for the money when you compare the time you play to money spent.
If civiilization is entirely too short and simple then crusader kings is for you.
High learning curvebut really fun nonetheless. The best grand strategy game that I've played so far.
10/10 would kill my own courtiers in a hunt for giant hamsters again
10/10 Would play it again since 5pm until 7am next day.  Nominated for 'The Steam Awards' 2016 in the category 'The Just 5 More Minutes Award.
Crusader Kings II (CK2) is best described as a medieval political simulatorwhich doesnt really sound very exciting or do the game justice. This is a different breed of strategy gamewhere it isnt about building the biggest army and going round painting the map your colour. You can 'win' the game without fighting a single battle
A bit heavy on the DLC side but the game is so deep and so much fun. The mods for it are just amazing. Plus this cool merchant guy keeps giving my characters free eunuchs.
My concubine is my niece. She is also a horse.
This game is honestly a ton of fun. Whether you are a huge fan of Paradox alreadyor just delving into Grand Strategy for the first timethis is really the game to do so.  There are just so many levels to this game
Amazing replayability coupled with that 'just one more turn' magic (even though it's not a turn based gamebut you get what I mean).
I keep putting off reviewing this masterpiece because it seems every hour I play I notice something different than the last time I played. I have almost 1200 hours as of making this reviewand I legitimately have nothing bad to say about this game. Unlike EUIV
Crusader kings have given me countless hours of fun and at times anguish as I see my empires rise from nothing and have their backs broken and fall apart again. The game isnt for the casual gamer to be honest but for those dedicated to 'grand strategy games' this is a pearl amongst its kind. Rpg elementscharacter customization etc ads depth to a already deep game.  Update : Still a good game and it have just gotten better and better with updates and dlc`s over the years.
The game where plotting murder against your family seems to happen all to often. Awesome game.
Its good and stuff.
This game is definitely worth it for those who enjoy strategy games. In additionthere are so many different ways to play depending on your character's religion and government type. For exampleplaying as a merchant republic is very different to playing as a feudal lord.
The best grand strategy game ever made in my opinion. The combination of depthfeaturesdifficulty
I like this game quite a bit. With 700 hours playedI can say that there is some fun to be had in it. Just don't count on getting your friends into it. I've had a 2.5/10 success rate with that.
Crusader Kings II in a Nutshell
Incest Simulatorthe Game. You're gonna love it.   Until you get conquerd by the Mongols.
fucked a bush 10/10!
Never thought I would accidently marry my cousin 10/10
Additive game after you learn how to playit took me more than 15h just to get the basics but worth it
Nothing quite warms my heart like spending two nights building up my dynasty and emptying my treasury to build a chicken coop or some fuckonly to have some guy named Sigurd Pigfucker and his merry band of 2500 Scandinavian savages roll through and murder my whole family. Nothing like getting backstabbed in the middle of a jihad because Iran doesn't think I'm the 'right kind' of Muslim like this is the cool kid's table at school and not a war for survival. Nothing like spending years building a steppe empire just so I could die and it could go to my clubfooted fuck infant son who literally everyone in my family fucking despises
This game turns you into a horrible monster.  Ramsay Bolton is nothing compared to you.   I once cheered out loud when my assassination of a pregnant 'slow' woman succeeded so she wouldn't spread her traits in my dynasty. Death by manure explosion.
Be the king of Denmark Old as fuckhave like 3 sons each aged like 20 yrs Oldest son is my heirpretty nice dude. Will Inherit all of my Kingdom Other 2 sons hate me and my heir's guts
Fun family game for all ages
CKII is a deep game and has a STEEP learning curve. The first few hours you will be completely lost. The next week you'll occasionally think you've lost your mind.  Even after serveral hundred hours I still find surprises.  Give yourself some time to learn the basics and it becomes a amazingly deep and adictive game.
Successfully removed kebabs from the Holy Land. Would recommend. Deus Vult
The best game to play if you want your child to be the literal spawn of Satan
I strongly recommend you check some gameplay videos online before deciding to buy this game.   That being saidbuy the game and plot to murder your kin to reunite your realm after you forgot to change succession law for 50 years straightbecause you were too busy warmongering.
Infinite replayability whether you're a history buff or an RPG'erParadox has developed this game for you. Multiple updates well after its release is a testament to their commitment to this game!
I decided to finally attempt the achievement for restoring the Persian Empire and spent 20 minutes rerolling Karen in the Charlemagne start until I got a really good intrigue character. In the first hour of play my character contracted cancerhis physician castrated him to save his life before an heir was born and the only other living member of the dynasty died of old age without any children either. Before the game automatically ended due to no remaining character to continue the dynasty I managed to become the greatest spymaster of all timedestabilizing the Abbasid Caliphate into total collapse through a terror campaign of murder and kidnappings.  Persia will have to wait another day but at least I can say I destroyed the largest empire in the game's earliest start.
Love it. Keep coming back!
They should teach this stuff in school.
The only Paradox game I've really been able to get into CK2 is a character-driven game where you play as a dynasty in the middle ages. The aim of the game isde factoto have the most prestigious bloodline you can
If your looking for a strategy RPGlook no further.  Take charge of some of the worlds most historic charactersand let your imgaination run amok as you attempt to change history.  10/10
It's good to be King.
Step 1: Install Game   Step 2: Murder your father   Step 3: Marry your motherhave her assassinated after she gives birth to a sister/daughter.  Step 4: Marry your sister/daughter.  Step 5: Become the Saoshyant   10/10 it's okay
Crusader Kings 2 is a massively complicated and frustrating game that takes forever to learn due to its inadequate tutorial system but keep digging and you'll find a unique and rewarding game full of surprises.  In Crusader Kings 2 you play not as a ruler of a nation but as an individual person trying to maintain the survival and prestige of that persons lineage. If your family tree ends it's game overand you'll be getting game over a lot as you're thrown into a fairly realistic historical location between 1066 and 1337 A.D(or further back if you purchase the Charlemagne and Old Gods DLC) full of wardisease
Kidnapped the pope on a raid of Rome. He wet himself as I sacrificed him in the name of the Norse gods. 10/10 Would destroy the Catholics again.
A great game if you enjoy history. It allows you relive the exciting lives none of your peasant ancestors got to live because they were peasants. Explore rich options to take care of your enemies (ex: kill him and his entire family because he wants a claim on the title you worked 200 years to keep and when you deny himhe simply cucks your wife)
Would recommend.
Put simplythis is one of the best games I've ever playedregardless of whether I count it as a strategy game
Great game 10/10
Over 2000 hours in. Would murder my brother and make my horse chancellor again. 11/10
Amazing game though a bit hard to get into.
Highly addictive and a great game if you like creating your own story. Made me interested in learning about history
Grand strategy on a suitably epic scale. Massively addictiveinfinitely variableand so many facets I'm still running in to entire new aspects I didn't previously know existed 50 hours in.  ----  Updated: hundreds of hours played
Took over land to capture their nobles and start a eugenics program with said nobles   10/10 would start the third reich centuries early again
Super addictive game which in some way makes you question your morality in the quest for power.
If you don't know anything about this game besides what's on this pageyou'd probably think it's some kind of dating sim where you try and seduce your sister (who happens to be a horse) while you race against the clock to avoid succumbing to syphilis and Saracens. While those are vital aspects of the gamethere's a lot more to it. Crusader Kings is a grand strategy game by Paradox Interactive where you control a medieval dynasty instead of a country. In the base game
Paradox's best game.
End of the world Stuck in a shelter underground Live well because I have Crusader Kings II
CKII is one of my favorite modern strategy games. In part this is because it focuses on storytelling instead of an immortal deity running a countryyou're controlling the current leader of a dynasty. Like most other Paradox Interactive gamesit's 'spreadsheet-heavy' finding someone to marry means scrolling through lists and cross-referencing details
Awesome for many reasons that others have already pointed out. As an added benefityou will also learn a ton about medieval history. Really!
incest killing children more incest killing vassels because they hate you killing more vassels because their children hate you and the children become vassels even more incest 10/10 would incest again
Essentially the only medieval dynast simulator outside of Medieval 2: Total War. Somewhat severe amount of DLC's but most are worth it.
I have always been a huge fan of this game! CK1 was awesomebut CK2 is that much better.  Seriouslyin what game can you marry off your kids to gain alliances with bigger and stronger countries to help you gain more territory and then screw them over because you married them your worthless imbred kids to their heir and now their line of succession is all a mess
I got along my in-game family much like the Borgiasif the Borgias all had connections to viking hordes. Much incest and fratricite ensued.  10/10
WellI've put more time into this game then I'm willing to admit. It's a dream if you want to roleplay the life of a midevial king. Or dukeor count if you're crazy enough. There is a pretty big learning curve
I can marry members of my family Torture people 10/10
Pretty much amazing. There are only a few needed expansions and it can give you hours of fun
Get all the DLCs for the full experience and then forget everything else.
Crusader Kings II is a combination real-time Grand Strategy game and dynastic RPG set in the Middle Ages. You play as a dynasty of rulersnominally trying to take over territory and secure the stability of your realm and your line of succession. In practice you're trying to get up to whatever crazy medieval hijinks suits your fancyoften by doing your best impression of a Disney villain. Kidnapping
There's a pretty steep learning curve herebut it is well worth it. Very high replayability. It's a different kind of strategy gameand probably Paradox's best.
The two games I have reached over 100 hours are Skyrim and CK2..
Vanilla is very funalbeit a bit complex starting as a new player. I would reccomend not enabling all of the expansionsonly the major ones
10/10 would waste over a month of my life again.
Fun gamegreat historical detailreally nails the succession/strategy game feel
Requires a ton of patience and attention but once you dive into the evolving storywell worth all the complexities
This is definitely my go to game. I can't get enough of it.
Some people played this game more than 1000 hoursdo you still need a review?
This game will put game of throne on shameevery plot you can think ofyou can perform it here. With a super complex yet simple chain of relation (you don't need to care what Tsar of Muscovy care
I'm updating my review cause I want a Steam Badge. (and my views have changed a little)  A return to form for CK2. The team that made this dlc understands the core design philosophy of the game and I really appreciate the work they've put in over the past few months. The features they've added might need a bit of tweaking at the moment but I can see them fitting in perfectly as soon as they've been polished a little.   Epidemics are tense and truly deadly to the unprepared. Precautions are costly but a badly timed epidemic can totally ravage your court without protection. A bunch of new traits have been thrown into the mix that add character to your ruler. Interesting events involving your court physician and quarantine spice up peacetime and give you a few more reasons not to paint the entire map as quickly as possible. Everything you'd expect from a disease-focused expansion is herea lot of new flavour has been added to the game and you're getting good value for your money. New event chains are interestingespecially those that get triggered by secluding yourself at court.  On the negative side
A game filled with politics and warwhere you will need to build your legacy. Your children and their children after them will take your place in ruling Europeuntil your dynasty rules supreme.
I cant recommend this game enough.
Magnificient game  9/10  Buy it.  After all these years still rolling.
This is the game that i've got the most out of. Everytime i play a new game i get a new experience. Some new intriguesome courtier scheming that blind sides mecrazy incestuous love triangle between my dynasty that gets exposed causing all my vassals to rebel against their 'effeminate
Very good gameand better playing with some friends. I started with the game+DLC pack on sale and lately I have added conclavecharlemange and way of life. To be honest I've never got to play them yet
This will destroy you if you buy it in the middle of exams. Trust me
Excellent game and goes to the same category in my mind as Civilization etc. I only have 10 hours with Steam versionbut I've played this game off Steam...too much!
Its good
I could have sworn I'd already written a glowing review for thisbut it's my pick for the 'Test of Time' award in the 2016 Steam Awards. Most hours played on my Steam account by a considerable margin.  That saidit's not for everyone. Like most Paradox games
This is the greatest game in the history of all time. If you do not play it you have failed at life. The end. I continue to believe this three years after writing the initial reviewI still play this all the time.
I loved this game and I think everyone who likes RPG and strategy should get it.
Must have for any fan of Game of Thrones. This game uses intriguefamily affairs and classic grand strategy elements to create a very diverse and addicting game.
What other game can you become an immortal zunist lunatic cripple with an immortal horse advisorremove kebabcatch Robin Hood
I've put more time into CK2 than almost any other game I've played. It's great if you just want something where you can sit back and not do to muchbut it's also great if you want to micromanage everything. Yesthe DLC is expensive but paradox continues to support this game 4 years after its release and I'll continue to support Paradox.
As someone who has played this game for a fair amount and figured out most of the ways to playI can say that I love this game. This game is one of the most complexinfuriating at times
Clearlythe 'I hate my syblingswife and children' Award winner
What to say about this game....  Paradox Struck Gold for me with this game.  I say it should be given Game of the past....4-5 years at least
Spent an hour customizing and designing the perfect ruler.  10 minutes laterRuler dies of pneumonia..... yay
A great grand strategy gamewith an emphasis on personal relations.
The best incest simulator on the marketand that's before installing the Game of Thrones mod!
Like Sims 3 but with a historical theme and the added bonus of intrigue and inbreeding
This is one of my favorite games. The mix of grand strategy with some rpg elements (you assume the role of one ruler and his dynasty) in one historically accurate medieval settingmakes this game unique. Once you get past the high learning curve you will enjoy this game.
Nominated for The 'Most Deus Vult' Award
Best Game of Throne simulator on the marketespecially if you install the Game of Throne mod.
This is one of my favorite games of all time. Take control of a Countor Kingor whatever during mideval times in Europe
Dont let the fact it has a bunch of DLC discourage you. You dont need them all to play. The game is fantastic and will keep you wanting moreit also has a Game of Thrones mod that is fantastic.
While difficult to get intothis game is worth getting through the learning curve.  Allowing alternate histories to play out you can create the world of your dreamsor watch it all come crumbling down as fates favor your rivals.  Also I don't care what anyone says
This game takes out the darkest of everyone that plays it. EVERYONE!
The premium backstabbing simulator
My favorite game from paradox. Plaguesincest and holy wars what else could you want.
This game is an absolute riot if you're a history buffspecifically an alternate history buffas the world will always turn out ridiculous eventually. While it can be very daunting at first
This game is greateven though you are bound to be ripped off by all these DLCs.
This game is so gudit took me 200 hours to understand that
44844would commit regicide for fun anyday of the week.
Amazing game that has been well supported for 4 years.
Keep coming back to this game over and overnever able to stay away for more than the span of a DLC. 10/10 would primogeniture again.
Want to recreate your family history or restore the Roman Empire to its once former glory? Than Crusader Kings II is the game for you!  Crusader Kings II is in my honest opinion one of the best strategy games of all time. You take on the role of a medieval noble and build a dynasty from obscurity into greatness through murdermarriage and bloodshed. With constant game updates and DLC adding to the game experiencecoupled with an active community of modders and story tellers
Interesting game . . . I think?
150 hrs in and I still have no idea on what I'm doing.  10/10 would recommend
11/10 would declare war on my firstborn daughterimprison herexecute her
You can go insane an make your horse a minister.
Its like if game of thrones and real life had a child and then cooked the child into a pie.
You can make your dynasty horses through a lot of luck and some skill so clearly that is the best of us a farm animal.
Yo u better not press that claim!' 'That fuck'  10/10
Theres just something special about the character-focus of this game that you dont find with other strategy games... The fact that you can roleplay as a kingor a lowly countetc
Really complex and confusinghowever has an endless amount of possiblities and endless gameplay time
This game is huge. Literally. I started small and ended up conquering most of the Mongol Empire until my reign as Baby Lord was ended by my uncle. The DLCsdynamic features and realistic court systems add so much diversityintrigue and require a level of cleverness and depth that exceeds many games in this type of genre.   100% would totally marry a cunning woman
I played Crusader Kings 1. I knowthat sounds crazythat game is -old-. That game was amazing. It is still an excellent source for off-the-wall roleplay possibilities. It defined Feudalism.  Crusader Kings II is a worthy successor in every way and better in every imaginable vector. In Crusader Kings II + all its expansions
One of the best purchases I have made in my life. It's a shame that most of the content is hidden behind a paywall but they are cheap on a sale so I do recommend you do buy all the DLCjust at a reduced price.
Murdered my sisters husband so I could marry her myself 10/10
Took some time to get into and understand everything that is going onbut once past the steep learning curve this game is a blast - and there is a ton of stuff that I am sure I still have to learn which will make the game (and my strategies) so much better.  There is just so much excitement once you get into it... first true gamestarted as a count worked on up to a king. Held my land well until the succession when all hell broke loose. Half of my vassals rebelled for independence. Thought I was done for (since the neighboring kingdom decided they wanted to take my throne all at the same time) but luckily a few vassals remained with me. Lost a few wars
It's complicated but good.
Great replay ability as a vanilla game then with the added DLC and or mods just makes it better !
Great game
OverallCrusader Kings 2 is a pretty good gameand I would recommend it to anyone who is considering buying it. To give you some information about the game's strengths and weaknesses
Cool
Play it it's expensivebut worth it.
A really entertaining strategy game!
The character and dynasty aspect of this game turn what is essentially a map painting simulator into a storytelling opportunity that will fill many an hour of your time.
Just nominated this game for the 'Best Use of a Farm Animal' award. One reason: Glitterhoof. Aslothat time a horse became the Empress of Rome.  Hilarity asideCK2 is one of the best historical strategy games out there. Balancing the complex dynamics of court intrigue with the fun of steering your own alternate history
crusading intensifies'
All in allCK2 is extremely enjoyable. It's perfect for you if you happen to be a fan of the following: regicideinfanticide
This is a great gametake the time to learn it and it will be hours of fun. And you can marry your daugthers away :)
One of the best incest simulators ever made..
Be warnedgetting into this game will make you stay up to the birds start chirping outside.   Crusader Kings II is my absolute favorite Paradox Grand Strategy gameand my love of this game has made me never want to play such games as Civilization again.  My only real negative is the confusing DLC strategy. As of the time of this writing there's no proper pack that includes at least most of the expansions
Great game.
As it turns outthe Black Death is actually quite deadly. Just like my son who killed me for powerbefore the Black Death could.
-Started as a Duke in East Franicia -Gave my son a county -Son rebels and decalres war -I get killed in battle due to shear bad luck (18 Martial) -Take over playing as my rebelious heir -Promptly catch the plague and die -Ending score of 363  5/7 would lose to RNG again
WellI 'd like to nominate this game for The Just 5 More Minutes Awardbut changed my mind for: The Test of Time Award. Absolutely a must-buy. Keep up the good work
Play as Byzantines. Mend the schism between Orthodoxy and Catholocism. Reform the Roman Empire. Re-Conquer those barbarian lands that broke away from the Empire. Laugh as those horse loving Mongols try to invade your Eastern provinces. Barely raise an eyebrow as the Aztecs try to invade France. Pax Romana over the entire world.  10/10 would recivilize the whole world again.
When I first played Crusader Kings 2 it gave me a headache. It was largely overwhelming as I didn't understand the mechanics or even some of the words. What the hell was a Casus Belli?  With currently 800+ hours logged it is easily one of my favorite games. I'm all about replayability and this is one game you can return to time and time again just to explore your different options. The DLCs are all quite expansive and add a lot of content to the game. The quanity of DLC might seem a bit jarring at first but they frequently go on sale and for a good price.   AdditionallyI came away from Crusader Kings 2 with a substantial history lesson. I am now more familiar with geographyrulers
This is a good game and you can waste hours with this one. And finally when you're on verge getting your dynasty to the emperors throneyou die. Nice isn't it... :)
Mass genocideincestholy war
A very good game.
Sunk so many hours insometimes it just keeps my hands busy while listening to podcasts. Paradox keep udating it always feels fresh.
Seducing your vassals for eternal peace. 10/10 would create a homosexual kingdom again
I think I might slowly get the hang of this... oh wait nonew update.  10/10 would waste again whole weekends plundering Romemurdering children because of their claims and marring my daughters away to foreign kings for alliances.
The premier medieval murder-incest-genocide simulator.
Do yourself a favour and buy this game. It's worth every cent and has endless replayability.
The DLC's only made it harder (Much harder to conquer the world as Ireland anyay) but its worth it for the madness.
This game is by far my most played game in my library... it's totally epic!
I nominated this game for the 'Best Use of a Farm Animal' award.   http://kotaku.com/that-time-a-horse-conquered-the-ancient-world-1757913762
spent an hour building a viking empirethen died and watched it burn to the ground 10/10
Absolutely a great game
Yes it may seem really hard to get intobut once you get past that first block you'll find yourself wearing a cloak and cackling maniacly as you ensure the downfall of a troublesom vassals entire family line.
Truly the magnum opus of Paradox the game has remained timeless despite the yearsand each new expansion brings flavour and dynamics to the game.
10/10 would Gavelkind again.
Worth the steep learning curve.
Clear 'Just 5 more minutes' candidate in this contest :)
You can never trust your relatives. You can never trust your neighbours. Everyone is out to mess you up...but you can rule a country/land as a horse so that kind of outweighs the other negatives.
Game where you know what traits people have and how to act accordingly.  It's really fun game.
The very Best RTS of this era.... potential for evolving the game further is limitless even so. Simply the best game I have played of its genre.
This is serously the best plot generator for any story you will ever want to write or hear. You face off everything: Loaylty and treacherymoments of absolute power and dire walks at the abyssvirtues and vices. And of course all that child-murdering incest psychopathic behaviour which is necessary to 'uphold and advance the realm'. On top of all the epic
This game is just so good that it makes someone who is good look quite good but not as good as what they would look if this game didnt exist because it is just that goodif hitler was alive he would target this game as he would see it too good to be good enough to be allowed to be good.
Crusader Kings IIperhaps the most amazingfrustrating game ever? This game might be my favorite game of all time
Started at the mid 1000s start (can't remember the exact year) on ironman mode. Was the Emporer of the Byzantine Empire. My goal was to restore the glory of Rome. Conquored all of the Fatmid lands over a few generations. Conquored some of the western Sunni lands. 1250s the Mongols completely crush me and my Holy Roman allies. My dynasty fades into obscurity. Byzantium is lost. 10/10 would gladly do again.
Countless hours of funhillarious scenariosgreat role-playing
Probably the funnest of Paradox's three main GS lines- those being Crusader KingsEuropa Universalisand Victoria- at least in my opinion. The simple and well-executed opinion system based around character traits that the game is oriented around makes for a surprisingly organic experience overall
Just one more tick...
The game is greatmy stories can't give it justice. I think all I need to say is this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/5a08w2/my_horse_is_the_new_pope/
Outstanding. You dont need all the DLC either!
This game has alot going for it. The nation buildingfamily dynastiesreligion and historical relavence
What other game can you describe as a 'role playing grand strategy medieval despot simulator'? I dare you to give me even one.
I used to think that being a good guy would be good in this game. Now i know better...
Pros: -Teaches you about history and cruelty -Features emergent gameplay and cruelty -Engaging level of complexity and cruelty -Taut visual style and cruelty -Offers challenging but rewarding achievements and cruelty  Cons: -Occasional double-chinned offspring
One of the most challenging strategy games that I have ever played! Gameplay so intense it will have you asking questions like:    How is it 3am already?  How do I open my consol?  Why is the DLC so expensive?  Do I really need all the DLC to enjoy this game?  How to invade a whole kingdom?  How do I form a Merchant Republic?  How did 2k units lose to 800?  How does the inbreeding mechanic work?  Why did the war end?
This game is a Grand Strategy Masterpiecenevermind the Developers trying to cheat you out of your money with useless expansions! With the New Steam Awards I nominated this game for Being just as good now as it was when I first got italot of it's life came from DLC but it also came from Mods and the game's greatness in general.
Gameplay:  You play as a land-holding individual (The game only let you play as European feudal lord when it first came outbut now you can play as other characters suchs as nomadtribal leaders and such)
A mere 20 hours of play (tutorial only). 'My liegeI would like my life back pleaseyour grace'.
Simply the most fun I've ever had with a grand strategy game.
To say this game eats time is an unders statement. While i haven't played it recently i can say that it is a really enjoyable game and that if you can get it on sale with it's dlc it is well worth the invesment.
This is easily the most fun game I've ever played. If you're a history nerd like methis is the right game for you.
The game is different every time you play itsome of the expansions are questionable but also always add some kind of challenge as well. Highly recommend to anybody who is a fan of Paradox games or just wants something different. Give it a few hours play before you decidethere is a learning curve
Came xwedodahstayed for the castrations. Great game.
fucked a horse 10/10
I have...a few hours into this gameand I still feel like I am not 100% competent. Great gameif you can stand the steep learning curve and RNG gods.
Given my nearly 1000 hours in game I think it would be obvious that I would recommend it. Here are a few words as to why. So Paradox is probably the king of the grand strategy genre. Basically you can start as the lord of your own county or as the King of an entire country. Invite lords and ladies to your court. assassinate the lords and ladies in your court. Marry off your children to seal alliances or to gain claims to other lands. Raise your armies to invade your neghbors with the claims you just got. Be careful though because the whole time others are trying to do the same to you.
Best / worst time sink .....
10/10 Would rule the world as a God-Emperor incest baby again.
Cool and also good
I can't stop playing this game!
I put this game down for a few weeksand then I always come back and drop another 80 hours into a campaign. Best story-creating game ever.
Its great until your 72 yr old wakes up one day realising that he has one legon armone eye and neither a fuck or fuckfuck due to a sereis of unfortuante events involving some very bad common cold treatments...
[Insert amusing personal experience here] 10/10
44844
I once started playing this at 7 PM. My family found me bleary eyed 14 hours later rambling about Jerusalem.  10/10 would Deus Vult again
Grand strategy is finally personal.    Paradox have crafted an enduring and constantly surprising simulation of medieval power. There's a very lengthy learning curve hereaided along with an investment in some YouTube viewingbut the depth of choices here make it worthwhile. I've taken a tribe on the Isle of Man and steered it to a glorious future as a trade empire spanning the British Isles and beyond. My mother murdered me so that my brother could rule a more unified Francia. My sixteen daughters all shared in my adoration for them
Played it once or twicehas a nice map.
Best Paradox game they will probably ever do.
Only game where a horse can become the holy roman emperor. 10/10
One of the best bang for my buck games I have every gotten. I have put so many hours into this game it is unreal!  Over 750 hours!!
10/10 would wincest again
At first: it is a paradox gameso remember: It is difficult to learn and even more difficult to master. Moreover buy dlc only when on sale or you will go broke.  That said: If you are a history nerd like me you will really enjoy it! It is like a huge sandbox starting in 1066 (even 769 with the charlemagne dlc) and ending in 1453. So one game will take about 10 hours! Once you understood the basic mechanics you will be absorbed by the game and think about not going to work or university because you want that one kid to marry someone special and gain an important ally.
i Recommend this gameas it is a tonne of funmy only piece of advice is don't buy it for full price
Perfect game
Kill your family in creative waysAKA living out your day to day fantasies.
great game and a lot of fun.
The King had a sonthe King then dies as the son reaches 10 years of age. Due to his age the oldest sister takes the throne as Regent untill he reaches 16. at age 14 the boy is killed by the oldest sister in two attempts. The sisternow hated completely by the rest of the family
This game would be better if I could build a walland get a small loan of a million gold.
STORY TIME: Played as William the Conqueror. Barely manage to conquer England. Final battle of the war is fought in Germany.  Capture King Harold and decide to banish him instead of execute himbecause I am a merciful ruler.  His son inherits his landspromptly dies childless
Great games to put alot of hours into and also great with mods
It's pretty great
Incestits fun for the whole family.  10/10 Best Game Ever
This game makes you feel accomplishment when you marry your 12 year old daughter to a 70 year old man across the continent. 'He's only got daughtershe's not a hereticand he's not lowborn
Crusader Kings II... most of my hours I've searched and had multiple Quest Lines about Immortality... everyone of them have failed this far.  Alone this can be interestesting longer as thing happen faster  But together with a friend or more friendsthis is absolute beast!
I've played Civ Games all my lifebut when I wanted things to be a little more indepth I went and found this. I guess my time played speaks for itself. If you've played strategy games and always found yourself wanting a bit morethen Crusader Kings is a wondderful gateway to the world of Paradox games.  Also you can make people have incest to produce a line of ugly geniuses and then have one of your mutent fuck children become the pope.
Incrediblebuy it now...can't stop playing!
Crusader Kings II is a great game. I have played a bunch of different timesand its been great. Howeverit is extremely difficult at first. What I reccomend is playing as the Petty Kindom of Munster
It's ok
This game is so going to the 'Just 5 More Minutes' award. Entertaining game even if you just don't seem to do a lotit gets you stuck to the chair until you can get that additional county (or kingdom).
Really fun to play. Although I dislike the huge number of DLC's forsometimes crazy pricesoverall I think the game is worth it and the DLC's add to the fun.  The latest expansion really adds life into the game and i'm looking forward to future updates around more specific details
Assassinated by my own son then took over his mind.
Best Medieval Era Strategy game available. Constantly receiving new content from developers and modders. Game of Thrones mod highly reccomended.
Can make sure the French never come into existence 10/10
Great strategycomplex system but awesome to play
Sooo addictive. My favourite game hands down. Giventhere's an impressive list of dlc and without it the game may appear a little blandbut get all old stuff on sale
Murder your brother! Marry your sister! Wipe whole generations off the map in your quest to be Tywin Lannisteronly with hair! Highly recommended.
Oh boy it is good!
Imo this is the best paradox game ever
If you are interested in medieval history and politics go for it. If you are interested in magic and being immortal go for it. If you are interested in killing all who opose you and sexting your daughter go for it. If you are interested in real historical events and magic aztec invasion go for it.  8/10 can't sext the devil
Kill your son and marry his wife just so you can inherit your neighbor's land.
The game with the relatives you suddenly care for more then your real one..
The war system and allies is pretty nice but the actual fighting comes down to a game of numbersif you have more troops you win. All in all still love the game for what it isa dynasty simulator.
Fantastic medieval society simulator. It will destroy your life.
its good if you have friends to play whit
If you can stomach the business modelthis game is very enjoyable.
Satisfy your desire for World Domination. Plenty of intrigue and complexity trying to keep your family on top of the feudal foodchain.
Absolutely great game that's been supported by a wonderful developer for years. As long as you can get over the initial learning curve you should be able to find something you enjoy whether it be from the DLCvanilla gameor through the large modding community.
it's good if you can afford all the dlc
Nominated this for 'Unethical Behavior' Award for extra Steam Award Category.  10/10
Started playing as a Finnish Chiefreformed the Suomenuskoadopted feudalism
This is one of the greatest strategy games I have ever played. Can only be referred to as a Dynasty Simulator.  In the real worldI am a pretty nice guyhelp out friends
Game is amazing except for the ungodly amount of DLC.
great wincest dating simulator
Sucks your life away as you draw nearer and nearer to becoming a fully-fledged hermit who knows all of the intricacies of medieval Europe.
After 5h of playtime I think I know what some buttons on the UI do. 10/10 Would be confused again.
Still the best machiavelli game around.
Nearly 100 hours on the clock. Never achieved an overall victory. Would do everything again. A great time!
By far the 'best use of a farm animal' in a Video Game i have ever seen. Its not every day you can send your most trusted horse to improve diplomatic relations with the Holy Roman Emperor. 'Glitterhoof the best Chancellor to have ever lived.
Really good gameeven better with mods from steam workshop. I've played this game always as the emperor (or I should say as KAISER) of HRE because I simply love HRE. Venividi
Me: I SHALL HAVE ALL THE WOMAN OF THE REALM Friend: plz staph Me after 200 years :why my court is filled with inbreeds 10/10
Killed a babygot a kingdom as an imortal Irish Merchant Prince. 10/10
Played as the immortal demon spawn great-grandson of Charlemagne. 10/10 would become messalian again
This game is nothing like the Total war gamesand it is not like anygame you played. When i first played it i hated it cus i didn't understand anything but once you Learn your way around this game it will be a enjoyable game and you will comeback to it but hand of the sunset invasion DLC it is fun the first time but then it will be OP as hell and I learned alot of things History from this game.
This ain't your granddaddys strategy game. CKIIfollowing up on the classic Crusader Kingsbrings the grand strategy genre down to a more personal
Best one from paradoxgreat rpg elements and a lot of brutal political stuff.
One of the best strategy games
Really good game i recommend every1 to buy this.
Powwwweeeeeeerrrrrrr !!!!! Unlimited Powwwweeeeeeerrrrrrr !!!!!   Palpatine the IIndKhan of KhansAugustus
this game is awesome. I never liked to start whit high rank or position. And this game fortunatry let me start whit a little army and land place. and in a couple of years you can be a king. whit your dinasty. Just need to play good. And hope to dont be sick. and lookout for you wife. Maybe she gave you the poison
Good and addicting game.
The absolute best sociopath simulator on the market. Keep your repressed desires to marry your sisterbutcher your children and subjugating entire nations in the computer where they belong.
This is a truly great game. With the active updates for years now (there are free updates for everyone included when they release a dlc)combined with the ACTIVE and wonderful modding communitythis game almost never gets old. After EUIV
Too many possibilities to cover properly but Crusader Kings 2 is essentially Game of Thrones from Europe to India. There's also a large mod communityincluding a Game of Thrones modto whet your appetite for whatever you want this game to be.
The world's finest medieval-themed marriage and murder simulator.
Incest has never been funnier. 8.5/10 inbred children.
Burning the Pope at stake never felt so rewarding.
Contacted shamans in an atempt to become imortal. I failed and after that was known as 'King William 'Son of Satan' of Wessex'.  10/10
A frontrunner in the world of Kill Your Brother And Take His Stuff Simulators. From the triumphant Restoration of Rome under Emperor Glitterhoof to the Fraticelli Karling King-Popes of Francemost any historic development you can think of is possible in Crusader Kings II.
Best horse breeding simulator 1066
Perhaps the greatest medieval one family tree simulator on the market. Everytime you think you've seen everything the game throws something new at you. If you occasionally find yourself at 3 staring at family trees of European nobility in search for a bride for your cousins ex-wife instead of sleepingthe creators of the game have done something right.
Quality role-playing in the Grand Strategy genre. Try to conquer the world or just survive. The game lasts for hundreds and hundreds of years and time flies when you're playing. It has a pretty high cost to start up if you want all the DLCsbut you can avoid most of themmaybe even all of them and still have a good time.
I lost my elective vote to a horse gg.
Almost Perfect game 8/10 plus amazing mods like a Game of Thrones and such 95/10 ) But you get a HARD punch from me because of your thousands of DLCs. Do more work and add more content to them if you wanna be paid for em!!!!!!!!!!!
This is an amazing game played way too many hours of it! Really fun to play with your friends!
If you've ever wanted to play A Game of Thrones check this out (and gete the GoT mod that lets you just do that). CK2 is a seriously fun and weird medieval soap opera simulator.
Game of Thronesminus the bewbs.
Just buy it
I got this game on the cheap but the amount of time I've spent playing this has been more than any other game in my library besides the Mass Effect series or Planetside 2. It's definitely easier to use and get into for players not familiar with Paradox games and has a ton of storytelling potential based on the journey your legacy takes as the years go by. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has at least a passing interest in strategy and world-buildingespecially since it goes for so little during most sales.
One of the best strategy game of all time. Deep management will keep you interested in this game for a hours and hours.
I have been playing CKII for well over a year nowand can honestly say it is one of the best games I have played. Coming from a background of playing Civ I felt initially limited by the structure of ituntil I realised that this game has substantially greater depth
I am still addicted to it years after the initial release Paradox must be doing something right.
.
inbreds Bastards Heathens Heretics... Some fun to be had here.
Once upon a time this was a buggy release. Something Paradox was renowned for. Now it's the same game although polished. DLC upon DLC all of them bringing the game forward and keeping it playable.  Probably the longest lasting of any game in my library. Truly a shining star when it comes to grand strategy.
Possibly the best game about marriage ever made.
Really good grand strategy game and fabulous story generator.
Crusader Kings II is an extremely good and well fleshed out grand strategy game that always leaves more to be mastered. The ability to play as any Christian in medival timesand more with DLCallows a huge range of characters and challenges to play through and overcome. The gameplay features a great deal of complexity
The best strategy game I have ever played. The amount of depth and replayability is unsurpassedresulting in a game that simulates medieval politcs like nothing else and offers disgustingly addictive gameplay. The only downsides are the amount of DLC (most of which is still good quality) and the initially high learning curve. If you have any interest in strategy gamesmedieval history or immortal incestuous horse emperor's
ruled my kingdom for decades hoping to raise a suitable heirhad 6 homosexualcursed
This is the game that made me lose interest in most other civilization and kingdom games.  The tutorial of this game is badand learning how to play it well is difficult. I discovered a few small parts of the UI that I had missed after playing the game for hundreds of hours. Howeverthe horrible things that happen to you while you have no idea what you're doing can be very amusing. Once you really understand the game
You died because you fell off a balcony. that your heir tampered with because he was salty with you for giving your fuck a county and executed his mother  I hate this game  I love this game
Still amazing after several years and hundreds of hours of playtotally deserving of the 'Just 5 More Minutes' Awardand of any other award it is nominated for.
This game is in essence an enourmous Tywin Lannister simulator.  Further your dynasty no matter the cost and make it last for the ages.  10/10 would send my regards again.
Very good gamehowever to get the full experience of this game you need to have most if not all of the dlcbut when it is all on sale it is a good time to buy all the dlc like it is now.
As with many Paradox titles Crusader Kings II belongs to the rather small genre of Grand Strategy Games. Unfortunately this also proves to be one of the deciding points of purchase--to anyone who has not taken the time to watch and understand the scale on which the game takes placethe game may appear intimidating. Factor in the time investment into building a virtualmedieval empire
Seducing your liege's wife who is also your half-sister has never been so much fun!
[ADD UNORIGINAL GAME OF THRONES COMPARISON/REFERENCE HERE]  This game is amazing. Somehow realistic relationship manager full of intrigues hatred crazy RNG and rage.  Unfair yet still somehow fair game showing the realism of the medieval times. Extreme complexity seems to be a huge obstacle in the beginning simply it is quite difficult to get into it. The point is that if you actually manage to get hooked into the mechanics of the game it becomes extremely catchy. If Civ games was 'One more turn' this game is 'One more year'.  The biggest flaw of the game is as every Paradox game - DLCs. That company has the most annoying and the least ethical dlc strategy. The game is not really forcing you to have any (some are only graphical) but for maximum enjoyment of the game you simply need at least the big ones.
I died of cancer. 10/10. Would die of cancer again.
Many hours gladly wasted playing this game would spy on Constantinople again!
A great grand strategy game that will have you playing for hours. You can play as a lowly French count or the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire. You can go fall in love become a pois man admired by all acquire great wealth and prestige or murder your brother and steal his bitch This is a game I recommend for anyone who loves history strategy games or having a grand time.
I have no idea what I'm doingbut it's really fun!
good game and is fun
Time is non existent when you need to take the Holy land back from the infidels! DEUS VULT!
Easily one of the best games I've ever playedwhile the learning curve is a bit steep if you put in the effort to understand the game it's definitely worth it.
Perfect for those who ever wanted to kill their family.
Great historical game! I learnt alot from it. Kept me engaged for hours.
An amazing game that combines grand strategy over an exhaustively long time period with RPG-ish elements brought in through actually playing each successive ruler through history. The many things to keep track of (quality of your heirswho is currently plotting to depose you from your thronehow big is France getting
Hands down the best Strategy game out there. I've played them allCivilization seriesTotal War Series
This will be your life once you just learn to accept it. All you need to do is play this game. It will consume youand you'll enjoy it.
The best thing you can do with a farm animal: Conquer the world
Its not a game for everyonebut you can get some hilarious stories that nobody besides another CK2 player would understand. Major DLCs are well worth the purchase cosmetic ones are better grabbed on sale.
The Crusader Kings is a game that explores the mysterious medieval europe which is one of the defining periods in world history in an absorbing grand strategy-game. The game has accomplished a perfect combination between game and reality. Best game ever!
This game changed the way I look at historyand turned my interest of the medievel world into a passion of mine. Definintely would recommend this game to anyone who loves history and antiquity!
A great game of medieval fantasy - participate in your own Game of Thrones-style adventure in and around historical Europe.
I've never had more fun having no clue what I was doing!
back when killing your siblings was not as fround apon
Playd it a bit.
This is easily the game with the most amount of hours in my Steam library. A fantastic grand strategy game with just enough of a sandbox feel to add to its replayability. Even with all the hours I have in this gameI don't think I've actually completed a single run.
Great grand strategy game that I can sink hours into every day and there are so many different possibilities for play that it is definately a great game for anyone who loves strategy.
I foresee a lot of useless reviews comming..... Good game....buy it.
I've been hooked on these games for a decadeback to the original Crusader Kings. It has evolved in scope and ambition beyond anything I could've hoped forwhile still maintaining the core gameplay: a solid medieval grand strategy game about putting your dynasty first
best genocide simulator there is.
Crusader Kings 2 is a game that can quickly burn the hours of a day away. If you consider games that are built around the long strategy to be fun then this is probably a game for you. Howeverthe learning curve is quite steep and some patience is required when starting out but it is worth it. The only real con is that a lot of the dlc is pretty much required to experiance the game as it should be played. Without the dlc most of the realms on the map are not selectable by the player. The good news is that the game and most of its DLC tends to go on sale for 75% quite often so be sure to wait for that sale before buying.
Having now played 1000+ hours of this game (and reallythat might very well be the only recommendation I'd need to give it)having all the DLC
This game allows for so many combinations of reasons to hate yourself. Mine included: - Bearing only humpback children - Having my wife consistently plot against me - Multiple lovers  10/10 would lose my mind and exile myself again.  I'm sad to say that the game has stopped working on my system (consistent freezing during loading pagesparticularly during Sounds) so I no longer play it.
This is the game the brought me back to Strategy. This game has wasted more of my hours than an other since Warcraft 3. If you can overcome the daunting UIthis game will show you a wonderland full of conspiraciesdeceit
Best dynasty simulator game out there
Enjoyed this game very much.
I can't stop...
Kill your mother while declaring war on France while marrying off your 7yr old daughter to a 80yr old Norwegian King just to lay claim on an island no-one cares about while throwing your son in prison just because I'M THE KING DAMMIT NOW SCREW YOU CHURCH I'M RAISING YOUR TAXES. DON'T LIKE IT? O SNAP LOOK AT THATI JUST SENT 40 THOUSAND TROOPS INTO YOUR HOUSE AND NOW I'M SETTING EVERYTHING ON FIRE BECAUSE I'M THE GOD DAMNED KING!  AlsoHoly Wars.  Edit: Still brilliant years later. Love it more than ever.
This game is great.  This pointless review is bought to you by the steam Awards pointless achievement.
10/10 Would kill my enemies entire family again.
I recieved Crusader Kings II as part of a Humble Bundle a long time ago. I tried it initiallybut was completely overwhelmed by the game and not eager to spend the time required to figure it out. Fast forward a year to earlier this week. My wife is awayso I decided to dedicate some time to learning how to play this game. BOY AM I GLAD I DID. Holy Roman Empire! This game was SO worth the initial investment. I actually watched a number of YouTube 'How to...' type videos and played the game at the same time. I am now just over 16 hours in am starting to figure out how things work and fit together.   I love how sometimes I play and things go amazingly well. My realm is prospering and my citizens are happy. I also love how things can turn so terribly wrong so quickly. On my latest playthrough
I'm Cnut so Great at conquering England as I'd like.
Too many family murders to count.
This game has a really steep learning curve but it is definetly worth it.
Pretty good game. Almost prohibitively expensivethough. Get it when it's on sale.
I've logged over 1200 hours of gameplay on this game. It remains one of my favorites and I continue to play it. Like so many of the games produced by Paradoxthe ability to play any nation
Absolutely the best eugenics/dynastic medieval politics game. Nothing comes close.
10/10. The Best Incest/Murder Simulator.
I first found this game when my buddy mentioned it in passing. I personally love RPG's and Historyso it seemed a good mix. I had heard it was similar to EU4which worried me since I felt I would find it too difficult.  Well
The grandest game you'll ever play!  10/10
It's a paradox gameso it's VERY technical.  If you can work through that thoughit's pretty fun. It is sort of like those train simulators where you don't need to buy all the DLC to get the full experience. If you're fine just playing as a catholic
ONE OF THE BEST HISTORICAL GAMESTHE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS
It feels like a very realistic depiction of the medieval world (devil-spawn and aztecs aside)with the Game of Thrones-esque court politicsintrigue
An innovative blend of Grand Strategy and The Sims. You'll be planning your conquests for the next two hundred years one momentand the next be cursing your drunk uncle who keeps ruining your parties. The game has a great sense of tempo in varying the epic and the mundane which keeps either side of the game from becoming stale.
This game is one of my all time favoritesI own over a 100 games on steamand this is the game I have spent the most time in.  If you like strategy games
Incest simulator of the decade!
Played it for hours straight and it looked like 5 minutes. Realy amazing!
Becomes immortal at the age of 40 Dies one month later in a freak pig manure accident  11/10
If you want to play this game make sure you have time to get used to the complex nature of the game. Once you are passed that you are in a world of killing your own children with plots so the good one takes the kingdom having mini adventures with your current leader to improve their stats. And if you like a little alternate history even the Aztecs will come over and invade.  Good luck.
To create a petty prince...eager to win back his kingdom ...CHECK! To form a new nation under different laws. Let your younger child rule your kingdom ...CHECK! To convert your king and the nation to your own 'heretical' beliefs ...CHECK! To play chess with the Khan ...CHECK!  That's what the game offersdepthflavor
I plotted to kill my friend's wife and he joined in on accident.
Awesome gamebut the number of DLC you need to get the complete game is bsbut still awesome gam !
Great strategy game. Deep and epic
Eugenics simulator 2012. Still amazing almost 5 years later.
Best grand stratedgy game I've ever played. The goal is to select a historical figure and guide his family through the agesamassing family power and prestige though the generations while making sure your bloodline continues. Warseconomic development
Amazing game with stupid replayability. Hard to understand it at first because it is truly uniquebut when you doit's an amazing joyride.  Also
You will stick with this game for a long time.
Very fun for any history lovers! A bit hard to get into with a steep learning curvebut very rewarding.
A game I keep coming back to. With literally endless ways to play the game you never run out of things to do. The worth of a game is shown by the hours you can enjoy playing the gameand this has it in spades.  P.S. Other Paradox Development Studio games are of similar quality and would reccommend Europa Universalis 4Victoria 2
10/10 would remove kebab with Glitterhoof again
7:00 PM   Plays for 5 minutes*  7:05 AM
Over 1000 hours and I still playonly downside is the challenging learning curve.
Just look at the hours played.
The best eugenics simulator since Pokemon.
All the timeGONE!
Start as the chief of a small tribe Subjugate vassals and claim territory to become a king Use marriagereligionschemes and lies to gain even more power Rule a glorious Empire while banging your twin sister then get toppled by the invading Aztecs  9/10 (too many expensive dlc)
See editbecause it used to be negative before the edit. And now it's positive.  I really like this gameif you want to know the truth
they finally optimized the game
I had to explain to my dad why I was commting genocide. One of the best
I just wanted to say that I nominated this game for the 'Best Use of a Farm Animal' Steam Award because of this thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/43uy3u/look_at_my_chancellor_my_chancellor_is_amazing/czll6uo/?context=3   And thus the rule of humanity gave way to the horses...  Also this game just makes you invest emotionally in the dynasty you play. I can still remember when I accidentally had my son marry his mother's sister. Didn't realize the problem until my grandchildren started popping out inbred. Great times.
This is a game that I like
Diplomacy through marriagepersonal relationshipsand warfare. Being conquered is not necessarily the end as you can continue as a vassal
i really do reccomend this gamebut you should do some reasearch on it firstnot a good idea to just buy it on a whim. it is very hard to pick up
Great
Struggle to learn via the turorial. Watch several 45min+ YouTube tutorials instead. Practice a few times as an Irish count. Get killed by a stag. Have an idiot son. Have a genius son. Murder idiot son. Git gud. Build an empire on a mountain of baby skulls.
10/10 Medieval family simulator
A great game for those who enjoy more thoughtfulslow gaming sessions. You can easily forget it's 5:00 in the morning when being completely absorbed by dynasty and realm matters such as squashing another silly insurrection (they should know better).  Greatest problem istoo much DLC - and worst of all
You can overrun the game with horses.  11/10
The scale of this game is so imense that no two playthroughs could be similar - When killing your brotherKing of Scotlandgets too boring or too easy
great gamesometimes a bit boring but overall a great game
New to the genre? Prepare your fuck and bite into your pillow. CK2 (like EU4) is hard. In a nutshell it's about guiding a dynasty through hundreds of years of warsmarriagesdiplomacy
A fun game which would be a great way for teenagers to get familiar with the politics of the medieval world.
Crusader Kings II. Don't buy it. Why? You will neverever do anything else but plan your next strategy or campaign. If for some godforsaken reason you do buy itplease try and make sure you play as many different religions
This game is so good that I am ashamed of the amount of hours I've put into it.
It's an amazing game and I love it. One downside is that the dlc's are expensive if you want the full experiencebut other than that it is one of the best strategy games I have ever played.
I cannot recommend this game enough to any fans of Europa Universalis III or Game of Thrones. It's a wonderful combination of themwith fascinating tales created through the interaction of a mix of historical and random characters. One can lead the de Normandie line of England into further gloryor pick some minor count of Russia and strive to gain a duchy
The best hybrid mix of grand strategy and rpg anyone could ever ask foran amazing expierience. It might be a little difficult to learn but when it clicks you can be in for days of fun.
It's a grand strategy gamebut moreso it is a family simulator. And not just 'have kidsbe happy
What can I say? I wanted to write this for quite some timebut I felt that my played hours speak for itself. Crusader Kings II will only be outdone by its sequelwhich at this pace is a long way off. If you want a world where your beautiful wife runs off with your mother
Best grand strategy game from Paradox to date. The gameplay is complex but mechanics are absolutely rock-solid.   I wish the Creative Assembly strategy games played like this game on the campaign map. The only thing that could make this game better is more tactical interaction during battles.
Simply one of the best strategy games ever made. The focus on dynasties make every playthrough a new chapter in the story of your family. It's almost impossible to not burst out the history you just made to friends and strangers alikewhen you finally get yourself parted from the game. Amazing is the word I'm looking forI suppose.
This has to be one of the greatest games ive played all of this year
Incredibly intricate games with loads of details. A must have for anyone interested in deep strategy games.
Crusader Kings II is a game for the people who are into hugeold timestategy. If you don't like strategy
When I play this game in skypemy friends think I'm crazy. 'I am married to a 15 year old and I'm 86way to go I'm a badass' 'better kill my brother so I can take over Leon' 'fuckING fuck fuck fuck fuck THAT fuckING fuck GERMANY'
While it lacks the combat simulation of the Total War series (which was very good up through Medieval II: Total War Kingdoms Expansion)this is a solid game for the historical strategy game enthusiast. With The Old Gods expansionthe new Start date adds a lot of fun to the game
The learning curve is crazy but once you get to know it there's a lot of fun strategy to try. And by strategy I mean lyingstealingmurdering and plotting like an evil fuck to get everything you want. A little backing from army helps sometimes too.
Rule the land crusade stylevery hard game and very long but worth every second :D and every penny
Murdered my inbred grandson after I made my son and daughter marry. 10/10 Five stars A+. Would recommend.
So.... I finally finished my first proper playthrough and what better time to write a review of this game?  If you're looking for an intense strategy gameperhaps even one that's a bit simplejust stop looking at this game. This is by far the most complex strategy game I've played. I spent roughly 60 hours on one playthrough and many of those hours were just sitting and waiting for a certain event to happen or to pass a certain point in time.  The tutorial then
If you have the patience to learn ityou WILL love this game. Conquer Europe (and soon beyond to India) by means of diplomacywar
Great game. Worth the cost.
A great game. I spent more than 100 hours and I didn't finish a single game. You will nedd around 10 hours to understand the main ffuncitonnallity of the game but after it. It is a relatively complex game and it is what makes it fun.
Fantastically good gamehuge depthmassive replayability. Stick with it and you will get over the learning curve.
Great game if you're into grand strategy. This is a simulation of managing the personalities in your court and expanding the power of your dynasty through several generations. There is intriguepoliticswarfare
I highly recommend this game if you are into strategy type games. It's a more complex version of the Civilization franchise and it's hard not to love this game. It's really enjoyable to build an empire that can stretch from Ireland into Africa and part's of of Russia and Asia.  P.S. Keep an eye on your vassals. They are always plotting something.
Best game I've ever played. Hard to learn and get into but has almost endless replayability. Don't worry about DLC unless you love it.
Crusader Kings has to be among my favorites regarding strategies. Though I have always been a diehard fan of Total War franchise this game and others by Paradox offer a uniquein depth play that only they have been able to master and pull off. Game graphics are always evolving and getting prettier to look at. You take that away and what is left? Never relying on a need to create a game that looks graphically stunning or button mashing numbness but full of contenta casual yet thoughtful strategic decision process and beautiful soundtack
What the fuck do i do?
This game is excellent. I don't know what else to say about it. It feels like Game of Thrones: The Actual Video Gameeven without the awesome GoT total conversion mod. If you like strategy games at alldo yourself a favor and put a couple of hours into it.
Looking for a complex strategy game? Look no further! While wrapped in the trappings of historical fact once you take control of one of countless figures be they king or minor noble things can easily go off the rails. Unite Ireland and contend for control of the brittanian empire? Sure. Kick the muslim empires out of the Iberian Penninsula centuries before it actually happened? Why not? Expansions are even allowing for the islamic countries to be playable as well as a new content centered on the Bytzantine Empire.
Crusader Kings 2 or CK2 is a seriousley indepth gameyou have to have a causes beli to wage wr and well the muslims have got it preety damn bad when the holy wars begin that the pope (the pope who didnt let me invade Francefuck) decides all muslims are asshats and invades for well no reason what so ever
Awesome stuff.
My brother killed me to become king0/10.
Not much more to say then it is a Early Middle Ages murder simulatorby which I mean quite fun. Back stabbing peopleplotting to bring your dynasty to greatness- or being a decent person
Probably the best paradox title i've played.
Game of Thrones mod. That is all.
This game is quite goodbut it is VERY complex and not very well explained. If you decide to play itunderstand that you will be daunted to begin with.  Very fun to pick a small region and try to build your power up from there. Personally
This game is awesome!! Still playing this game every day and it does not get boring. The level and playability of the this guarantess hours of play and new situations to solve every time.
This is great.
Brilliant historical strategy game
best game by paradox
This game is often compared to Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' seriesand for good reason* despite the religious implications of the titleit's highly probable that you'll spend more time reveling in the seven deadlies than fighting in a holy war. Incest
Too addicting.
Played it for hundreds of hourse. I you love grand strategy you will love this game.
Anyone who loves grand strategy will love this game! The basic gameeven without the DLC or modscan give you hours of gameplay
Wonderful game in which you have to manage your own kingdom (or your duchy or county if you prefer)and generally speaking try to create a powerful noble dinasty to rule your realm for centuries. If you're a fan of Total War games probably you will enjoy CKII! :)
Great game
Maybe the best all time of it's genre.
One of the best strategy and intrigue games i have playd. After hundreds of hoursi am still discovering new aspects of and events in the game.
Pure awesomeness.
I believe this game is amazing! It accurately depicts the struggle for power in the medieval times.
Politicsreligioneconomics
An Awsome upgrade to the old Crusader Kings... Many New features. and its well done.
the best
Complexonce you get into it very enjoyable. Be warned it is not about conquering the world it is about maintaining your bloodline in a shifting political and religious world.
I don't know what I'm doing and I love it.
It's great. Arguably more fun than EU4.
Top Eugenics simulator. 10/10 would kill my son again.
Buy this game. Up to 32 playershistorical facts all over the placelinks to your characters' wiki pages
This is without a doubt the best strategy game I've ever played...I used to be a Total War player....but since i found this game I fell in love with every single aspect of it. A big yes from me and a big thank to the developers.
great stratagy game easy to learn as far as gran strats go and once it clicks it's just so much fun and i have enjoyed every minuite in it
THE SEMINAL INCEST/MURDER SIM RETURNS IN ITS SECOND (ACTUALLY FOURTH) INCARNATION. BASE GAME IS BORDERLINE UNPLAYABLE WITHOUT NUMEROUS AND OVERPRICED DLC WHICH THANKFULLY ARE EASILY PIRATED IF THAT IS YOUR PEJORATIVE. THESE IMPROVE THE GAME INTO SOMETHING THAT IS EQUALLY UNPLAYABLE FOR MOST BUT STILL TREMENDOUSLY ENTERTAINING. MARRY YOUR SISTER AND CONQUER PERSIA. KILL ALL OF YOUR CHILDREN SO THAT YOUR NEPHEW CAN INHERIT THE THRONE AS HE IS MORE SUITABLE. MARCH TO GLORIOUS DEATH IN LANDS UNKNOWN IN THE NAME OF A GOD THAT HAS NO POWER THERE. ENSURE THAT YOUR INBREDBLACK-WELSH ZOROASTRIAN SON-IN-LAW INHERITS THE THRONE OF IRELAND BY FORCE IF NEED BE. HOLD YOURSELF TO THE LAWS OF NEITHER MAN NOR GOD. OR JUST BE RUSSIA
Much to learn and doMASSIVE scale rts.
This is the most addictive game I've played in years. The learning curve is really only the interfacethe concept is simple: make your family powerful and keep power in the family. 5/5 penguin eggs.
This game is most likely the most indepth game I have ever played you are able to controll everything from your kingdom all the way down to your children and everything in between. It is filled with political intriguebattlessetbacks
I love how well developed this game is in terms of it's stategy and how it tries to reflect the political conditions of the Middle Ages. For one I like playing as the Norse (Usually Harald Fairhair of Ostlandet) and living out the Norse Sagas I so love and inventing my alternate versions of them.
Fantastic game. Don't give up if at first you don't grasp the concepts - it's well worth the learning curve.
This game is so good o_O
ComplicatedUncomprimisingDifficult and amazing. A remarkably good portrayl of Medieval politics and dynasty building.
A lot more fun than I thought it would be. Pick it up next time its on sale.
I've never played a game where it's possible to have so much fun while sucking so much at it. This game is an odd one. A combination of epic strategy and personal dramait's also a game that actually gets much harder as you begin to amass powerand being a successful liege is often more a matter of managing your unruly
9/10 would murder brother to consolidate the empire again
Exactly like Mount &amp Blade in every way except gameplay.
Really fun game once you get past the extremely steep learning curve.
Any game that will let me marry a princess then go to war with her familykill all of her family by assassinationthen have my son inherited an entire empire is a good game.
Politicsfaithfamily and war
Very good game! There are so many different charactersof different time periods 'bookmarks' in gamethat you can play the game many times
I'm a huge fan of the Total War series however I always found that it was lacking in the political drama sector. Crusader Kings II is political drama. It is a great game and a time killer. Very early on this game throws you straight in the stresses of being king. It is political strategy at its finest. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys building their own plot line however if you are looking for massive battlesthen you may be dissapointed. The game has little to almost non-existent animations for even the avatars when two armies meet however this is not the purpose of the game and shouldn't deter you from getting this game. While $39.99 may be a bit heafty for video game lacking in visual appealbut the amount of time you will spend playing this game totally covers the price. And if you can get it on sale
A KingdomFamily &amp Succession Management Simulator - can you keep your kingdom through the ages as your various rulers die and are replaced?  A Grand Strategy in that games are longcomplex and rewarding - kinda like Football Manager 201X . You will probably have to read a few guides to help you if you are a novice.  When you have a good &amp stable dynasty it gets a bit boring. On the other hand you could be faced against the crushing might of all the Islamic nations QQ . A fascinating game if you find your sweet spot.
Game has a hard learning curve at firstbut once you get used to it. bam can't get enough of it
Awesome gamewhen your a newbie its quite a challenge to learn the gameonce you know it its quite difficult to hold your empire together. I enjoy it a lot altough there should be a way to really set an example to your vassals what will happen if they betray you (maybe an option of display their heads on stakes or crusify them).  keep them good games coming :)
I've logged hundreds of hours and still have a ton of things to do in this game. Have alll the add-ons and look forward to much more!! This game of grand strategy is just awesome!!!
flipping amazing strategy gamewould also recommend every other paradox interactive game.
Brilliant strategy if u have patience and wit to play it. Its nothing like the total wars thoughso no fighting the battles manuallyits all a numbers game. Good for the intelligient ones
its hard to start up and get the feel of the game but once you learn everything its the most epic fuck ever!
What's not to like about a game that let's you plundermarry and conquer your way across Europe....?
I don't care who you are buy this game now!
Insanely detailed European conquest game. It takes hours to learn what to dobut once you do it's great fun stomping through medieval Europe taking countries for your own. Played for 32 hours and still haven't finished the conquestso you're in the for the long haul if you pick up this one.
Strangely addictive gameplaybut little manuvering room for things to do. The game is very 'samey' i hate to use such an ambiguous term but still...Would recommend just for the weird addictiveness alone.
This game is amazing tons of replayability and contentand the mods (although I haven't played them yet) look awesome as well. Anyone who likes grand strategy and intrigue should definitely check CKII out!
Highly recommend!
Amazing immersive game.. highly addictive
Pretty awesome if you can get past the learning stage. Youtube videos will help you with that. Pretty hilarious and interestingespecially if you like politics
No other game lets you kill all of your grandkids so that you can prevent them from inheriting your son's land. So good!
one of the best RPG/strategy games I have played. really fun and really addictive
I enjoy the game but insist that is definately not for everyone. It takes alot of patience just to learn the basics. The hint system and tutorials in my opinion are very lacking and not very helpful. Overall though I really like the concept and the gameI just think they could have done a better job. It has so much more potential than what what it is. It can be very frustrating learning the game but after you do it becomes an awarding experience. I guess you could argue it never was easy to rule and manage a kingdom in real life. I don't think it should be as expensive as the regular pricethank god I got it and the dlc on a holiday sale. I would have upset to pay high dollar for what you get. If your really into Medieval politics and managing your kingdom
This game dominates a large portion of my life. Whether I was conquring Irelandor forming the carpathian empire this game never ceased to grab and hold onto my attention. Its an excellent buy if your into divilization type strategy games. Very very funand excellent work from Paradox Games!
This is simply the best game from Paradox. While Europa Universalis III was one of my favourite gamesEU4 isn't as fun to play. CK2 is different - it doesn't matter if you are waging wars or at peacethere is always lots of things to do
This game is so indepthit really does take some playing to get to grips withbut well worth it! It is worth reading around at the tutorials though as the ingame ones are short and not that great.
Such an amazing game. I constantly find myself returning to it whenever I'm bored with my library. So many ways to play the gamefrom Muslim to Christian to Pagan. Always a fun dynasty when you start as a count!
I love this game. With the Game of Thrones Mod it is one of the most immersive games I have ever played. Takes more learning to play than most gamesbut do not hesitate to buy this if you see it on sale.
One of the true gems of PC-gaming. A real must for people interested in Medieval political intrigue and warfare.  Recommended for the gamer who seeks a challenge and a game to put their teeth in. Not for the casualgamer though.  If you get this gamealso get the Game of Thrones mod - it adds another 100k hour to the game!
A lovely game about brutal regicide and subterfugeall gaily covered in mounds of chainmail encrusted bodies. Play for 400 years as one dynasty from a countduke
A game where screw? marry? kill? is not a choice but a sequence.
CK2 is one of the greatest games I have ever purchased. If you are into empire building games this is the game for you.   This is a game that takes sometime to get the hang of. And even longer too master. Losing is just as much fun as winning(if you can even win).
One of the most complexe and complete historical strategy games. Well placedwith so many options and decisions and good for the begginers and newbies on Paradox Games.  The worst part about this game is the DLC politic of Paradox. For enjoy this game completlyyou needs to spend more than 100 euros/USD
Great gameif you like grand strategy with extreme depths this is it. Prepare yourself for backstabbing and plotting your way to ruling provinces  duchies  kingdoms  empiresbut be mindful for your children will kill one another and shorten your life span just so they can rule
This game would be absolutly perfect if its creators were not vile man fuck?s for DLC.  Paradox change your off basewayward errors and I will love you forever.  Or don't and go the way of the Dodo.
Crusader Kings II is an entry level Grand Strategy gameit is by far the easiest of its kind to get in to. Rather than simply managing your empireyou must also take into consideration your ruling dynasty and the game has you enact marriage alliances between your dynasty and others
Say you like world conquest. And crushing your enemies. But you want to put a personal spin on this theme.  Buy Crusader Kings II.  I built the great Christian Kingdom of Ireland up from nothingtwo small counties with not much more than a heap of rocks for a fortress and a couple of pig farms. My only vassal was also my greatest rivala filthy traitor plotting rebellion before my father was even put into the ground. It could not be helped he was half-Viking
This game issimplyamazing. Though
Solid empire management/sim game. Lots of depth and charmand latitude to strategies.  Would strongly recommend if you have a proclivity for enjoying empire games. I'm hard-pressed to think of a major critisizm... mayb more achievements? This game seems to do the gene completely right. Lots of funand addicting.
While the gameplay may not be everyones cup of teait is for people who are looking for a strategy game that plays differently. Most strategy games come with a pretty obvious way they are played. This one however is like none I have played before. You have to raise your dynasty and make them last the test of time while slowly gaining influence in the world! Take all the info you knew about other strategy games and throw them out the window for this game. A great game that will bring a challenge to any veteran strategy player.
This game is fun but really really buggy on mac. It's frustrating to spend hours into a campaign and then something in the save game gets corrupted.
GREAT GAMEBUY IT!!!!!!!!
This game is the weird perfect marriage of Civilization and The Sims. You control your dynastyand try to exist as long as possible. Most of the timeyou just watch events unfold
Beautiful and intensive medieval strategy game. &lt3
Ck2 wow how can i describe it.. well ill guess ill start with incest ever dreamed of icnest well in ck2 you fucked up perv you can do it! What else is there arranged marriage and killing your wife well you can do that to. Want more money kill you current wife and marry a new one in the wedding gifts you will get money. Hmmm you are thinking wow what else is there this game sounds like it has enough features already but no thats not all the features thats 1/100 of the features well explain a few more. Got a buddy to play the game with you? Well how about play his vassel and as soon as you find him weaker then you kill him and your friendship and take all his lands he might not talk to you but that virtual money will be more then happy to be your friend. What else can we do? Play a tiny country raise a small fortune then assassin your way to become the powerfullest man in the game without ever doing 1 war. This my firends is ck2 a game of incest and assassins and you my friend are a character in it. =D 10/10 epic game even if it ruins friendships
Amazing game! If you like strategy gamesyou really need to check this one out. I spent around 800 hours on it before I ported over to steamand it's just a fantastic dynasty simulator (there's more to it than that
One of the best games Ive played I higly recommend it.
If you like Strategy and are not afraid to jump into a deep ocean that could you reward with huge lands or your head on a plate for another powermonger.
I still don't understand this game fully. But that doesn't stop me from playing it over and over attempting to get my little kingdom to flourish! Addicting as all hell!!!
One of my favorite games. The best part is that it has great replay valuethere's always something new to try. Paradox doesn't take the route of selling you the same game every few yearsthey want to create games that players will keep on playing and they succeeded.
do not buy the customization dlc uless your okay that iron man mode is kinda made pointless buy it no acheivments can be gained if u use either one
Extremely fun 4x strategy game. Take into account almost every part of running a dynasty.
Crusader Kings II is addicting. Life-ruiningly addicting. There's a steep learning curvebut once you get over thatyou won't be able to put it down. There's something incredibly captivating in CKII
I'm really enjoying this game. A game of great systems that let you create a grand story of the rise and fall of your leaders in midevil times. The bad part is learning those systems. The in game tutorials show you all the screensbut fail to actually tell you how to use them and why they are there. I had to watch a let's play/tutorial to finally understand what was going on. And for this game that will take a lot of time (3 hours for the basics). I pushed through because it was so intertaining to see what would happen next. I'm currently in my second game and making monumental mistakesbut learning more and really having a great time even when things go bad. That is actually part of the fun. So yes
Fantastic and really sophisticated game
Great Gamesuper time sink!
This game totally rocks! Guide your dynasty through the dark ages in this fantastic mixture of RPG and Grand Strategy. Also: when in doubtassassinate. :)
Great game but has a pretty steep learning curvecant wait till i become the king of Irelandor just lose it all to my fuck half brother
Best 4x I ever play.
Great game! 10/10!
Great way to sink some timevery different to other GSG games in that it is more about diplomacy and prtecting your dynasty than it is about warfare. Very good gamebut good luck trying to form Israel as a Jew
Once you get past the learning curvethis is one of the greatest strategy games I've played.
The defining game of the historical strategy genre. Solid visuals and a great sound make this game a treat for the sensesbut be prepared for a very complicated control scheme. The UI is as lean as they could make itbut with as many options as the game has for interacting with the world it is very daunting. Don't expect to conquer the world...
Build your dynastyspread them across the worldcapture enemies
This game is just awesome. The learning curve is formidable howeverand will own your face. The first several times I played itit was just 'too much'. However
Like most paradox games this game has a steep learning curve and you'll probably spend a few hours getting to grips with it however once you do it is funchallenging and educational and I'd recommend this game to players interested in alternative historyconquest and the like.
In my most recent game my ruler's daughter turned out to be the female equivilent of Damien from the Omen (complete with creepy nanny). After all her elder brothers and daughters died in mysterious circumstances she became the sole heir to the empire.   I cannot recommend this game enough.
Alot of funand if you want to have a more interesting gamemake sure you have the insanity trait. :)
44844did not give me cancer. Would recommend for non cancer use.
Like hard games? This one will laugh in your face as you are suddenly being murdering by your 13-year-old son.
It's not the usualbuild an empirebuild your army and conquer your neighbours kind-of-game. Well
Awesome medieval simulation that gives you a lot of freedom. There are many DLCs that add even more features but sadly they are overpriced. The game itself however is worth every penny and can be played for hundreds of hours without getting boring. Instead of buying the DLC you should get some amazing mods like A Game of Thrones and Elder Kings.
On the top 5 best games I've ever played. This game is so much more than a grand strategyit's a dynamic story generator. With a little imagination and a sense of humorthis is the most immersive simulator of the human condition ever put to code.
There are manymany video game adaptations of 'A Game of Thrones.' They're all terrible because they miss the point. A Game of Thrones is not about fightingmagic
Still the best grand stratagy out!
It's an incest simulator with a bit of stratergy thrown in for good measure. 10/10
All other strategy games pale in comparison. This is the measuring stick by which we should judge all grand strategy games.
This game is simply cathar(meaning perfect read it up on wiki)when this game first came out I played this game from 2pm till 2:30am that is how engrossed I have always been with this game and it never ceases to amaze me at how dynamic &amp how different each dynasty I play and aech save I play and the mods this game get from the community and the gargantuan amount of DLC this game gets is obseen I have never seen anything close to what this game gets from fans and producers as well as the most updated game I have ever known the very beginning when this game came out seems extremely alien now without the commander traitsthe teching up
This game makes you seriously consider murdering your brother and his entire household down to the smallest child as a matter of course44844
Expensively great. c:
A learning curve that's more like a wall' I've heard that been said of Paradox gamesand it is kinda true. But once you are over the wallor even just climbing it
Yesthis game is a good roleplaying game. DLC everywhere but whatever.
Difficult to master but ultimately a very fufilling strategy game
Be history yourself
Absoulutley great game. Not as interactive as Victoria IIhowever there are many different ways to play the game and can be worked on for a very long time before you are done with the game
At firstI was kind of confused about what I was doing since it is not the same as Medieveal Total War or any of the Total War games...but after I read a little more and realized that I was keeping my family line alive the game became addictive. I actually prefer this game to any of the Total War games now...  I love the ability to 'plot' against other individualswhether killing them
Holy Crap this game....  If anyone's reading theseyou'll have noticed the 600 odd hours I've poured into this. Literally poured. Likelife just sucked out of me and into the software. Its that good. To me.   And that's the thing about this style of game
Tutorial took me 2 hoursbut this **** is pretty awesome once ya understand what you're doing. As I type thisKing Darkwing Duck is expanding the Holy Roman Empire.
As a nord King with great prospectwent in a wargot clubbed in the head
Like intriguebackstabbing and conquering? This is the game for you!
great strategy and roleplaywith endless replayability set in the dark agesit is erfectly possible to become the king of russia while fighting off a horde of muslims while being possesed by the devil and assasinating the pope for your dark lord...
After two years and over 800 hours playedI can confirm that I am probably autistic and that Crusader Kings 2 is an amazing game. If you have any interest in grand strategymedieval intrigue
Grand strategy game where your lineage  your empirekingdomdukedom. Survive against castle intrigue
grand strategy game from paradox. Sees you as a ruling family trough the ages. Woescheme and fight your way to the top of europe. Build and upgrade your holidings. Manage your vasals.  Play as a christian ruler and go on crusades to reclaim the Holy land or play as a muslim shike and launch a Jihad.
For fans of Civilization 5 that want a lot more depth to the gamethis is it.   The combat is pretty simple on the surfaceand it is super big jump to grasp all the concepts
Top notch GRTS
This is an awesome grand strategyor should I say grand-sims. It's not about controlling nations as it is controlling relationships.
Pros: Wanna be a feudal medieval lord and ensure the success and survival of your house/bloodline/dynasty via warintriguepiety
What can I say about Crusader Kings II.  Wellit isn't a perfect gamebut it is easily one of the best strategy/rpg games I have ever played and definately Paradox's best game to date. Even including EUIV. Add to that
Crusader Kings II has got to be one of my favorite strategy games. Although the game is very complicatedwith some patience you can grasp it and have a damn good time. If you want to have a really good time and have your game filled with a lot of actioni'd suggest you start yourself out as a count and work your way up. See how high you can climb and how long you can keep your balance on the unstable ladder that is this game. A word of advice: Don't trust anyone
This game is remarkably fun for something that is relatively hands-off. Howeverlike many Paradox gamesit had no win conditions
Really fun game. Wouldn't reccomend playing to 'win.' Definitely better to play and see where it takes you. Endless replayability.
This game is master at medieval alternate history. I have spent 100s of hours playing this game and I have only beaten it once. It is just that fun. I always want to come back for more and it has endless levels of replayabilitybecause you don't know what crazy event will happen next! While the game may not appeal to the strategy battle gamersit does appeal to the grand strategy gamers. And rightly so! It has a bit of a learning curve
If Risk and Civ had a babyand that baby was stolen by JRR Martin and raised as a literate but sociopathic being not opposed to murderthat being would be Crusader Kings II. Engrossing and wonderful. BUY IT
a very good grand strategy game tottally recomended. As the trailer suggestsplay yourself as a medieval king paving your own story with far too many choices.
A fun game about maps that lets you play as a variety of scary foreigners attacking mainland Europe during the middle ages.
Amazing game and super addictive. Learning curve is a bit steepbut if you just start playing and don't be afraid to lose a bunch at the start. This game is often at its most fun when things are going wrong - fighting succession warsstomping out plots to kill you started by your power hungry brothers
Crusader Kings 2 is one of the most in depth strategy games available. The game is highly challenging and one wrong move could ruin dozens of hours of gameplay. Surviving in this game will make you feel like a tactical geniusand it is one of the few strategy games that has the 'One More Turn' effect on me. If you're a fan of strategy and you don't own this gameyou're robbing yourself of the exerpeince of a generation.
It's got a really steep learning curvebut so much fun.
By far one of the best strategy games to come out in a long time. It has provided me with many hours of interesting and unique gameplay and continues to surprise me again and again. The fan community is extremely dedicated to the game and it is noticeable in the amount of mods constatly created and updated. Which is great if you need a change of pace from the vanilla game. To me Crusader Kings is not just GAME OF THE YEAR but one of the Greatest gaming experiences of all time.
Great gameunlimited replayability! One of the only games i'm willing to spend dozens of dollars on for dlc.
Seems simple to look atbut this game is anything but simple. You may build an empire from your starting character and the day after his deathyou will be the count of a lonely county in the blink of an eye and not even be mad! Very few games give players this kind of satisfaction
Fascinating game with hours of gameplay. Build a dynasty only to see a connivng uncle destroy it all.
One of the best games out there in my opinion.
Best game of medieval strategy i've ever played. The start can be slow and confusing but when you learn how to play you'll see how fantastic is this game.
Crusader Kings II is one of the finest grand strategy games currently on the market. Unlike other titles of the genresuch as the Total War seriesCrusader Kings II takes the focus of the player away from battles and warfare - although both play a large role in the game - and shifts the focus to politics
Easily one of the Best Realtime Grand Strategy games ever madeit combines character based roleplaying and Medieval Intrigue with Province and Country scale Strategy. Its extensive moddability has led to a huge and well organized modding communitywho have already released many major balancing/improvement mods and many total overhaul mods
Crusader Kings II is an amazing game for anyone looking for a strategic experience. Not only do you play on a map that is historically accurate but you can choose which Empirekingdompetty kingdom or county you would like to play. Also you can choose any character you would like to play or just create your own character to place your name in the history books. The sheer intricacy of this game is almost overwhelming giving yourself a seemingly endless amount of content to explore. All in all ive found myself spending many hours in this game without even realizing it. 10/10 would def bang.
Pretty fun if you have any interest on being a king or in medieval history
This has to be one of the best games I have ever played. The scope of it is so enormousthe replayability factor is incredible. You could play exactly the same character every time and never have the same game. There really is only one way to describe this gameEPIC.  The expansions are great
The thing I like about this is the stories that develop and especially that there is life after death! You may start as king of France then lose most of your kingdom and die in prison - but this is not the end. Your children or siblings take overand the marriages you arranged for them can suddenly mean you inherit new lands and gain new allies. From this you can take back what's yours from the pesky new 'king' of France and see your dynasty prosper. Also you can say 'not king yet' at every year's end.
I stayed away from this game for a long time because I was pretty sure of two things:  1) It would be really hard to get the hang of 2) I would get dangerously addicted to it and waste a lot of time  Both those things turned out to be true. Oh god how I love this game.
check it out
Ever wanted to make a family of inbreds found a Crusader Kingdom on the corpses of people who stand in the way of your chromosomes? This is your game.
Ave Maria help me I can't stop playing.
One of the best and most engrossing PC games I've ever played. Be the best and rule Eurasia for more than half a millenia.  If you are looking to waste away in front of your computer plotting minute schemes for your fiefdom this game is exactly what you need. You may try to wed your sister but your freakish offspring will either be revolting (to the Church) or die within months. Oryou could be more traditional and wrest control of kingdoms by marrying all of those princes and princesses that are in the 'have-not' bucket and are left with some minor duchy and not the golden goose. Thensimply win enough support and wage war for your child's 'rightful' place as king/queen.  Do all this while trying not to fuck off your lord or your vassals and you will succeed. Also
I cannot recommend this game enough. Deep and accurate in history. Great way to RP if you want to play through generations after generations of your family dynasty. 3 Mods also make this game a must have: Elder ScrollsGame of Thronesand now Lord of the Rings.   This company can do no wrong.
The most engaging true stragety game I've ever played and may just be the most accessible. A great score only deepens the experience of micromanaging your dynasty through an interesting divide of european history.
If you like Civyou have to play this.
Game of thronesthe game. Expect to be overwhelmed at first but once you figure out how to do things it's an incredibly rewarding game.
Couldn't be a more addictive game! You rule Paradox!
If you like EU4 then chances are you will like this game.
A great game if you can go pass the learning curve.
great game!
There's just too much to say about this game...while it can be incredibly complex (at timesjust mind-boggling)it is still just crazy fun. And then
Wowtruly a awesome game. I have lost a lot of sleep and almost been late for work playing this game. I havn't played a game so in depth since Skyrim. A great buy for history buffs and strategist like. I know I havn't fully learned the ropes of this game but it will be only a matter of time to master such a great game. One of Paradox's best.
You can be a drunken fat midget Emperor of Rome 10/10
One of the most engaging and addictive medieval strategy games I have ever played. If you've ever wanted to be a king or queen in medieval europe this is the game for you.
The best medieval game I've played so far. Unlike any others. Came from Total War genresand can't say it's better... it's different. I love them bothand this is definitely new and astonishing
why is my wife trying to kill her son?
Super immersivejust about the best grand strategy game out there.
great game had lots of fun whit it and i stil am having fun whit it you can be lots of poeple but you do have to buy a few cheap dlc's to make it realy fun but that is no propblem atleast not for me
This is a very good Grand Strategy Gameit actually feels like your a Feudal Lord in the Middle Ages or a Moslem Said or even a Northmen Jarl!
i have (unfortuatly) spent 550 hours in this game. fantastic repaly value. moderate entry barrier. if you can get past the tutorials and have a little patience and imagination this is one of the best midevil games there is. i cant recommend it enoughone of my top 10 all time games.
You may need a million and one DLC's that cost the price of the actual gamebut with or without them the game is still oddly addicting
great game.
for strategy loversfirst thing although war and battles are common and happen often it is not the focus of the game and your ability to have effect on combat is extremely limited and is mostly just simming based on whos commander is better so if you want in depth combat this won't help you.  besides that it is a brilliant game full of countless oppurtunities and ways to play. you can start as count/duke/king whatever your fancy and start your own history. there really is almost unlimited hour you can get in this game with 5 different type of attribute focusesover 400+ years for you to work with no game having a remote possibility of ending the same way between assassinations
Great game once you figure out how to play it.
One of the best grand strategy games I have ever played. 10/10
Sure I'd recommend it if you like math I'd REALLY recommed it )
This is probably the most incredible strategy game on the market. To put things easily EU4 is about nationalism while CK2 is about building a family empire. The level of depth Paradox achieved with this game is astonishing. The huge issue with the game is the price tag. It seriously costs nearly $100 for the full package. If you have the money and the time however this game is going to eat up hours of your time with the immense depth it features. To say you should buy this game is putting it lightly. If you like history and you like marrying your children to their cousins so they will not start a revolution this game is the perfect thing for you.
I have really enjoyed this game although to get a real fun experience you need more than just the base game which limits you to playing only a fraction of the world while buying the dlc lets you explore many a great empires and i have enjoyed all the time i have put into it.
I am eternally condemned to exclusively sire spiteful morons.
Great game just a bit hard to learn.
raise armiesbuild castlesmarry off your daughters
Do not get this game if you have a macbut if you have a pc get it.
In Crusader Kings 2 you become a member of a medieval dynasty and try to guide them through the middle ages. Unlike other Paradox titles you're not controlling a country just a family. Even if you build a country that could last to the modern age it's still game over if your family dies out! The game's really fun and very easy compared to other Paradox games that being said I'd recommend you read Kersch's CK2 learning LP if you're serious about playing. The Sword of Islam expansion/DLCwhich I wish I had allows you to play as Muslim characters and Paradox has announced that there'll be DLC to enable playing as Pagans and possibly Republics too!  There is literally no good reason not to get this game!
I didn't think a game could keep me up as long as Civbut Crusader Kings 2 did it...
CK2 is the deepest most complexand most intelligent game I have ever played. There is absolutely zero excuse to not have played it.
If you're a fan of sweeping strategy gamessuch as Europa Universalis then this is the game for you. The depth is astounding and it will consume hours before you know they have passed.
Hard to learn but gotta love the fact that it hearkens back to the old days of vidoe games where they were supposed to be hard and challenging
It's a little buggy - generally someone gets dropped from a multiplayer game at least once every time we play. But it's fun-ish. If you enjoy medieval politics warfare risk and dying of the Pox it's a great game. It's very text heavy which is fine but it is quite fun especially if you are not being killed immediately. Pro-tip - Do not take any of the red hearts beyond 'Wounded' on multi-player unless you do not want that character to die within the first 6-months of the game.
Great timesink!
One of the best games ever made! (I bought on Gamersgate initally to explain my low play time on Steam)
If you like historygreat strategyand creating alternate histories then this game is for you. You get to play as a noble dynasty in Medieval Europe. Fight to gain control of a kingdom - or try to rule an empire. So many options
Okay so i'm 24 hours into the game so far and i'm going to continue with it.  The game itself is amazing there's everything you can wish for in a grand strategy game.  Want a game that's even more complicated thatn EUW4? Here you go!  However do notice that there is a very high learning curve for the game the first 4 hours of this game was rather frustrating this was due to the fact that I did not like the tutorial as they only touched very basically on the subjects.  So if you got the patience you should really try the game out before you know you'll be 300 pounds and 60 years old... In real life!
Very fun and strategic game. Defineitly recommend this :)
Continues to get bigger and better. The MAJOR DLC expansions have done much to improve enjoyment and provide further depth to the game. The key points on DLC for this game - WAIT for sales which frequently occur here or on other sites. The game is only playable on steam so you can buy it anywherejust shop for deals. At full price you would pay around 170 US dollars for everything when not on saleso I recommend that option only to the player who had to have it all now.  Major DLC (1-5 on sale often
Love this game and to me the best of the paradox games
One of my favorite games ever!
This is a extremely addictive gamewith the DLC increasing the timeframe and features available already this game could potentially become even bigger with the additions of more land and more game time. Well worth buying and even better with the DLC
Amazing gameand so indepth that it's totally worth it!
Epiccomplex without being overcomplicated (but you really should go through the tutorial a lot of non-intuitive stuff) and and includes the awesome dynastic breeding simulator which was the high point of CK1. Highly recommended
Epic Game. Highly recommened.
I bought this a year ago and have never really got to play I always ended up stopping cuz theres a lot to take in. Being a huge game of thrones fan I always try again
My D ick + Catholic mouth = Pagan Empire
fuck is this game dificult to understand. I still dont fully comprehend it but if youre into these types of games Crusader Kings is perfect for you.
None of my DLC works for some reason. Also my game always crashes and I have to reopen it. I have reinstalled it twice. It's a fun game but these issues are game breaking.
Holy sh**where did my time go?? Deepchallenging
Another massive grand-strategy from Paradox with a heavy RPG twist. Think in terms of a historical Game of Thrones and you wouldn't be far off. Warring armiesintriguesuspicious accidents resulting in death
awesome strategy game with i played over 200 hours and many more to come. I Highly recommend this game to everyone who love complex strategy
If you've ever wondered what a combination of civ and the sims would look likethis might be what you're looking for. It has all the marriage and murder you could ever want.
History as told by George RR Martin. Good stuff.  Also I read the books before they were cool. *hipster glasses*
A-fuckin-starcould be improved only with the touch of god. But make sure you pick up Sword of Islam DLC (hellall the dlc) as being a crusader king is good
I have played this game a lotand would certainly recommend it. It hits all the right toneswith its mixed elements os Grand Strategy and RPG-like structure. As said in its page
Crusader Kings 2or as I like to call it 'The family breeding simulator'is a very fun and entertaining game
If you love paradoxlove rpgs and the middle ages then this is for you!
Medieval strategy at it's finest.
I've played 200+ hoursand still find fun stuff to try. There is so much content in the Original Version + tons of DLCyou will never get bored.
A wonderful semi-historical sandboxwith good modding support. Fun for anyone who likes to mess around with historybecome Emperor of Britannia
Child murdering - incest simulator. It doesn't come any better. Expansion packs should be prioritized Legacy of RomeThe Old GodsSons of AbrahamThe Republic/Sword of Islam/Rajas of Indiadepending on what you're most interested in playing as.
This game might start off slowbecause it has so many aspects to maintaining an empire or rising through the ranks from something like a lowly count to an emperorbut once you understand the game HOLY fuck is it fun. Definitely buy the Legacy of Rome DLC
Best strategy game of my life (after Victoria I) It's amazing how entertaining to live and govern in the medieval Europe!
This has to be my favorite grand strategy game of all time.
This is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. I wasn't familiar with other Paradox titles before I tried this gameand when I first played the demo I was completely lost. I've now played over 500 hours. The depth of what you can accomplish is incredible. Recreate the roman empireor convert the known world to Judiasm
The game is a lot of fun. Very politicalas are a lot of Paradox games. You have as much as 400 years worth of in-game time to pick a provincebuild it
I'm pretty much addicted to this game
This was my first step into Grand Strategy and I'm definitely loving it. While I do sometimes miss the grand battles of Midieval Total War 2 (and similar titles)the amount of customization and depth that CKII has to offer in all other fields more then makes up for it.   For strategists and people that like dynastical intrigue this game is awesome.
Very good strategy game. Compared to a game like Civilizationis like comparing chess with tic-tac-toelike comparing Superman with one of the wonder twins. Seriously
Learn how easy it is to become a tyrannical fuck from the feudal system. Who is going to stop you? Wellmaybe your son's wife will have you murderd.  Suggested research materials: Tutors on netflix for a road map to fedual success.
Great game!
This game is epic when you get into it...
Great game..combines dynasty building with empire building..hours of and hours of play time. If you aren't familiar with Paradox games it may take a bit to learn how it worksbut it is well worth it.
One of the best games I have ever played.
An amazing sandbox game. Your imagination is the limit in this medieval political / military sim. My first play through alone lasted 93 hours.
I've spent many hours with this game and I have to say it is the completion of the trifecta of Hearts of Iron 2 and VictoriaParadoxes other greatest achievements
Great game after you get to learn how to play it. You have to have the patience of a rock though.
This game is awesome!
If you like historyspecifically medieval historythis is the game for you. It literally plays like a medieval lord sim
I've spent so many hours on this game it's nearly embarassing.
fuck fuck?eskill your own childrenget money
I don't know how to play
A SUPERB Strategy game. You owe it to yourself to play this game.
10/10 Would murder my illegitimate firstborn in his sleep to ensure my only slightly less inbred son inherits my titles again.
This game is as historically accurate as a bored teen's fan-fiction while being stuck in world history classbut thats not to say its a bad game. It focuses more on the ruleing of kingdoms rather than the conquring of themas the combat is lacking
I can't receommend this game enough... it's extremely funand you learn quite a bit of history in the process.
You'll lose hours in it if you just aren't afraid to learn the mechanics.  This is the easiest Paradox grand strategy gameso start here if you want to get into them.
Simply putthis has got to be one of the most engrossing and complex game I have ever played. You will play for weeks and still learn something new.
More of a role-playing game/dynasty simulator than strategy in the Civilization mold.  Where the game really excels is in emergent storytelling. In my current game I won my independencekilled my two sistersmy husband (due to some interface issues when we married that meant the children would be part of his dynasty and not mine)
totally awesome if you like slower paced games
Game of Thrones- The Gameenough said.
one of the most complex realtime strategy games I have ever played it is fantastically made and I am in love with it.
This is one of the best games I've ever played
Great gamebut be carefulit can be very frustrating ) If You like Europa Universalis series and You want to know better Your ruling family
9001/9000 would remove kebab again.
Yesit has a MASSIVE learning curve thoughbe very wary.
amazing a historical eroupe what is clay in your hand to shape and then use the converter to take over the world in eu4.
Such a great game. If you love historyyou'll love this game. Takes a while to learnbut stick with it. It's worth it.
Love this game so much!
Hardbut fun.
Never has opportunism and moral ambiguity been this much fun.
Crusader Kings 2 is a great grand strategy game. It's very different from Europa Universalis and is the easiest paradox grand strategy game to get started within my opinion. You control a medieval noble dynasty and fightplot

The one thing that will bring sativa out of business.
Most grand strategy games have the player as a faceless intelligence behind a nation. In CKIIyou play instead as the head of a dynastic line. This changes your priorities in so many facinating ways- instead of just trying to make (say) England more powerfulyou're goal is to see that your relatives gain power anywhere. Maybe that means making England powerful. Maybe it means assassinating the current king and plunging Europe into war. It's amazingly deep yet quite accessable. I recommend it without reservations.
While perhaps slightly less complex than Europa Universalis III and IVand certainly Victoria II and Hearts of Iron IIIit offers a unique experience in that both territory and family matters. You always play as a character from your dynasty and you always have a next in line who you will continue to play as - regardless of how disastardously you set it up for that guy. Maybe you'll just inherit 1/5th of your realm? Or maybe you'll be embroiled in civil wars? For all its shortcomings this is still a deeply engrossing and fully enjoyable grand strategy game and I recommend it to anyone who has had a taste of
Great game for people who love the micro management of the Europa and the Victoria games. The realm labels that festoon the map hide power hierarchies populated by hundreds of historically based and randomly generated characters. Every one of these characters is out to realise their own ambitions and further their own family interests.
Why haven't you got this yet?
Can't Stop... PLAYING. By god one of the best Strategy games I've played.
Great game - deepfrustrating and longbut great if you like the grand strategy and politics. Also
How do you play? I don't know but I like it!
This game is so much fun. It is very complicated and takes a while to masterbut it is so worth it.
An awesome strategy game not to be ignored! 10/10
10/10  If you havent played any of the Paradox Interactive grand strategy games this is a decent place to start. Its definitely the easiest of the bunch to start learning and play. That being saidit will take you about 20+ hours of playing to actually understand how to play this game. Even at the 10-20 hour mark you will constantly be discovering new ways in which to affect the outcome of the game. As with all Paradox strategy gamesthe expansion packs are almost must buys because they expand and refine the gameplay far beyond the original scope. All of their games also have a very dedicated modding community which provides great enhancements to the core gameplay as well. If you can look beyond simple graphics you will find a game that is incredible challenging
its a game and stuffso thats cool
It may take you some time to get into.... but once you figure out the various intricacies and systems within the game and how to use them to your full advantage... you will find yourself engulfed of one of the greatest Grand Strategy games of recent times.
Very good game for everyone. Good mods as well.
You may look at this and say it looks pretty lamebut I don't know what it is but you eventually start feeling like your dynasty is your family. I murdered 3 of my own family members so I could become king HAHA. Playing as Duke Williamand I conquered England. And I actually managed to defeat the Holy Roman Empire. Using cunning of course. Just buy
CK2 is a challenging strategy game unlike anything I've played before. There are so many dimensions to coverit will keep you on your toes through four centuries of European history.
much wow very venice
If you like Paradox gamesdon't miss this one. I even like it better than EU3:HTTT
Love this game! Make sure to pick up the Game of Thrones Mod
I've spent like 180 hours playing this. Greatest game I've ever playedddd
It's pretty awesome of a game. I enjoyed it very much and thought that it was an interesting concept. My only issue happens to be when I use Mods it usually results in a game going on the fritz. Same happened hereand haven't been able to update since. Otherwiseits a great game.
Accidentally gave away half of Ireland to my firstborn sonthen spent 1250 gold to try to kill him to get it back. 9.5/10
One of the best purchases I've ever made. It'll take over your life. The only thing against it is the price if you want the DLC as well (although to their credit it adds a lot to the game).  However they regulary have 75% off which takes the price down to a very resonable level.   If you ask me? Buy it. Buy it now. (or wait for a sale) (what? I'm cheap) But put it at #1 on your wish list whatever you do.
This game is too awesome. The replayability alone is more than enough to get you pumped up to play this game. Then the updates and DLCs just keep on coming! I mean being able to port through EU4that's just effin insane! Who the hell does that! I've had this game for 4 years and I still come back to it every month or so.
One of the best sandbox/simulators/strategy games I've ever played! Not for those who shy away from a steep learning curve however.
Steep learning curve and bad tutorial is the only bad thing you can say about this game. Save often and pick you location carefully but then enjoy the only TBS (sort of) with real diplomacy and intrigue.
Brilliant game.
My father murdered my son so i had him killed and my wife ran off with my half-brotherwhat a game 10/10
This game is the most awesome strategy game ever.I first become intrested in strategy games with Medieval total war 2 (if we discount rts like empire earthC&ampCAoE2) and Civ IV.But while both are very good games neither come close to CK2.Unlike those games where you tend to play countrys and try to fruther your country's goals here your play a family and try to futher there goals. A subtle and important diffence as the best games are when you try to go from count to king and basically grab as much power as possible. Only to see all fall apart and start over again.The DLC makes this game a lot better I would recommed to get the dlc as soon as it is on a sale.
You will lose your life as the hours pass without you noticing.
An engaging game of politicsintrigue and character development from the POV of a historical region's leader. Must play IMO
This game is detailedcomplex and often the AI politics have an oddly human feel to them. It is incredibly well donea medival kingdom simulation that while being very realistic
Awesome game. Totally Addictive!
This is probably one of my games that i play the most. Having said thatif your looking for a combat strategy gamelook elsewhere. This game is not that type of game. If your looking for a micro managing game where you control each of your territories to the minute detail
121 hours played in two weeksfun game. Steep learning curvebut fun once you get it. Do recommend if you like grand stategy games with war
Proof that humility is taught. Nothing points out your mediocrity more than the pervasiveness of your flaws across generations. You will learn as much about yourself as you will about Medeival Era nobility. Spoiler: you're both incompetent.  Overall rating: Hate myself/10
I absolutely love this game. The level of play for such a large strategy game is well focused. That being saidthe latest expansion Rajas of India is terrible. Playing as the King of Pala (Bengali India) I found myself doing nothing but putting down peasant rebellions. At one point I had five active rebellions. I cleared them uphad time to marry a daughter off and there were three more rebellions. Unless this is fixed or considering you don't mind non-stop peasant killing
Awesome simply awesome
Its boss
The DLC pricing scheme is insane - only buy this stuff when on massive discount. Honestly none of it is vital. I've bought most of it on discount and still have paid an insane amount in total (for 1 game).  Howeverthe game itself does scratch some likely preverted itch of mine. Will be playing for a very long time.   OTOHFor anyone who wants action do not look here. Watching time pass so you can build another building or arrange another marriage is not for everyone (or most).
Very involved game but I've enjoyed itthough set aside some time when you play as it can be time consuming.
Yes. Buy it and love the Intrigue.
It takes a long time to learn to playbut it's very worth it! So entertaining and addictive. Love it!
Great game deserves a much higher meta score considering cod MW 2 has a score of 86
This is one of the best strategy games i ever played. You mission is pretty much to keep your dinasty alivewith brings a new point of view different from bland games where all you do is conquer. Managing the people of your courtyour family
An amazing game of family feuds and medieval dominance. Pick this one up if you are a fan of deep and very long world conquest
good game/5 so good i played it again
Very smooth and prettybut extremely confusing. I wonder if you need to be slightly autistic to enjoy it. Why do I keep playing this?
awesome simulator...endless replayability
A fantastic game based almost entirely around trading your daughters.
Great Gameplaying it for yearsstill loving it ! :D
Its epic if u managed to understand the game :D
I love this game. Murderintriguepolitical marriages
im in love with this game
If your a stratgey game fan then crusader kings franchise is the upper tier of the genre. Deepruthless and superb AI will keep you challenged for unlimited time. Visit the forums to download excellent mods with total map overhaul supported by dedicated modders and community. Watch lets play and tutorials on you tube to learn how to play the game and ease the steep learning curve.  Highly recommended for long time stratgey players.
Don't buy this game if you have family or loved onesit will suck your life away like a medieval vampire!  However if you have free time and want to get immersed in a world of court intruige and conflict where battle is not the only way to defeat your opponents then this is the game for you. The politics and deplomacy systems are first class making game play inresting and rewardingwhether you're paying a Kind or one of his vassles.  The level of detail in this game makes it almost a RPGas you nurse your family members through the generations. Especially when you have to deal with a less that perfect ruler. Maybe you'd be better off having him assassinated and letting his uncle take over.  Best of all this game is often on sale for $10 and when it is I highly recommend picking it up.
While still quite complexthis is the best and most accessible Paradox game yet - a real Game of Thrones.
This is the most fun I've had playing a grand strategy game since Alpha Centauri was new.
Unique combination of strategyrole-playingand expansion. Learn some geography and history as well.
Amazing. There are no other words to describe this.  After installing the GoT mods over 80 hours agoI find the replayability of this truly astounding.  Highly reccommended.
A great Jihad/Crusading/Great Holy Warring experience for all types. If you enjoy strategygive it a whirland pray your ruler doesnt die with seven male heirs under gavelkind!
It's good. Play it if you can handle strategy games more complex than Civilizationpreferably the older ones. (YesI'm saying Civ 5 is simple)
I killed 10 newborns so that my dim-wittedinbredclubfooted
Paradox Grand Strategy is always a step above the rest.
My favourite game of 2014. Creates a perfect blend of Grand StrategyRPG and complexity all rolled into one excellent game.
If you love strategy you will love this. DEUS VULT!
Think of ROME TW and multiply by like... a billion!!! :D Still quite the learning time till someone can actually get in on it....
Very difficult to learnIt took me awhile and I almost gave upbut then suddenly it clicked. It's great
Deepinnovative strategy game that draws you in once you learn the (very) deep mechanics. Highly recommendedespecially for strategy fans
This game has sucked 500+ hours from my life. I feel as though this game was made for me. Paradox makes really great 4x games. I think this is their best one. Great mods out for this as well.
This gamewith its attendent mods and DLCis probasbly one of the best valued games out on the market right now
It is a good game.
Excellent strategy game! The mods just make it even better... highly recommend the Game of Thrones modwhich makes this game so much better.
A game which makes its own story through your gameplay any can create some dramatic struggles.
Love the game and it just keeps getting better and better
The best Joffery simulator around.  10/10 would assassinate spouse again.
I only discovered this series of game recentlyand after becoming somewhat bored from playing Civilization Vand having less time to play
I have never felt so challanged by a game beforethe game mechanics after 60 hours of play still feel a bit obscured. Definetly one of the best games i have played. Recommended for the lovers of hardcore strategy without a sense of accomplishment but your own. I keep coming back to this game and saying just wowso simple and at the same time so complex. Its a game of patience and understanding. One of the great and memorable.
One of the best grand-strat games out thereworth sinking a good few hundred hours into.
Amazing game. One of the easier Paradox games to get into. All based on making your family prosper. Nations and empires are just your means to an end. Decent visuals. Isnt too demanding on a system. Cool mods like Game of Thrones and all kinds of others that add multiudes of new features. Very fun and addicting! Must have for history buffs and people who enjoy the fine things of life. Buy now. Now i say!
republics are best feudal is fuck
It takes a lot to finally get in tobut once you're in you'll be hooked. Managing your dynasty and expanding your empire is surprisingly addictive. Expand through force of arms or through canny diplomacy and politicsthe choice is yours.  Grab the demo and give it a try. Don't let the complexity scare you off
Fantastic game. Extrememly complex to get intobut very satisfying once you grasp the basic concepts of the game. Very enjoyable.
go from being a count to emperor keep your dynasty going through the generations plot and scheme this is a great RTS game set in different periods of of medieval europe the middle east and north africa and if that doesnt interest you get the detailed game of thrones mod for it and play as one of the many houses from big to small
Awesome game! Hard to learnbut once you do its loads of fun.
Can't stop playing it. It is different each time I play. It pulls off the feel of a sandbox game while still being in the micro management genre of strategy games. Something for everyone.
Awsome game! Takes quite a while to understand the mechanics and the interactions in the game. But once you get there it will make the nights bo by in a blink of an eye.
Kill you infant son because he's an imbecileor sleep with you sister to further your intrests in this murder and incest simulator by Paradox.
Sacrificed my wife to the pagan gods as she begged for mercy. Impregnated my brother's wife. Would play again.
One of the best grand strategy games I have ever playedthe indepth intriguethe wars you can wage
Top Quality Game. Fun while being difficult. 9.7/10
More than 400hours on that gamemy favorite strategy game.
You will play this game... and you will love it.  If anyone has the patience to master the U.I.there is nearly limitless hours of playtime awaiting them. I highly HIGHLY recommend this to people who want a more complexmore satisfying
This game is amazing. I've spend over 400 hours in this game (it doesn't say so because the hour thing got reset a few times) This game has pretty much unlimited replayabiltyand then there are mods. The mods for this game are great! This game is awesome   9/10!
It is an extremely fun game to play
Most people don't understand how people back in history lived their livesor what their social structure was like. They only have stereotypes and legendsdistorted tales from an age long past.  If you want to learn how politics worked in the Middle Ages
Once you learn how to play it's really a lot of fun
If you're looking for incest/gay son/Oedipus complex simulatorlook no further. Very calmcomfy game with amazing soundtrack and focus on dynasties
An incredibly in depth RTS gamebut surprisingly easy to pick up. It's certainly a game that can addict you and have you staring at the screen for hours: 'Just one more County to invade!'
RTSbut dynastic (you play a family line). Very different sort of rtseven for paradox games. Also check out the game of thrones mod.
This was the first paradox gameand to be honest it is still one of my favorite grand strategy games of all time. What you need to know though is that it is at first a very challenging game with rather complicated mechanics. Once you get over the initial four or so hours and you start to get a feeling for what is happening and what your focus should be the game keeps growing and growing! The focus on characters and relationships between lordsvassals and the like really adds an interesting
The best medieval family Simulator out there. Invade your enemiesmurder your rivals and backstab your liege in an attempt to do well... anything you pleasetake over Europe as the Irish
The best Game of Thrones game you'll ever play. Especially if you actually get the Game of Thrones mod for it.
This game is the most in-depth Grand Strategy game I have ever seen besides EU: IV. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good challenge
Crusader Kings II offers a superb historical sandbox experience. It feels like it will never end. I can get lost forever in just looking at the big what-if scenario unfolding. :)
One of the best stratigic games i have every played. Offers what it shows and more. If you are not surdownlaod the demoand play a few rounds. No two games are the same.
Fratricide Simulator 2K6 is one of the most engrossing grand strategy games I have ever played.
This is the game for those that truly enjoy a game that captures what it would be like to rule a familya countya duchy
A longmethodical strategy with surprising replayability. Only weakness is the multiplayer isn't quite stable. Even sototally worth buying and playing.
Outstanding grand strategy game with a bit of a learning curvebut is immensely fun once mastered. And for any fans of A Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Firethere's a total conversion mod for CK2 that is worth it in itself.
You can kill all the heritics! 10/10
A fantastic strategy game with depthpolish and unmatchable levels of enjoyment. The best game for dynamic stories that mould themsleves around the choices you makeyou have the chance to truely shape your own world.
If you enjoy killing someones entire family to get their landthis game is for you!
A very good Strategy gameunfortantely they seem to think that charging people for every minute update and calling it a 'DLC' is a good business model.
My absolute favorite feudal incest simulator.   Alsoif you're not a feministthis game will turn you into one after you have to watch your gluttonous
Buy this game if you have aspergers.
Yothis is the greatest game ever made and it has completely consumed my miserable life
Very very complete ! If you are not interested in this kind of gamedon't buy it. But if you areyou will need a fex hours to understand the mechanics (plots
A great improvement on the first Crusader KingsCrusader Kings II is a wonderful addition to Paradox's Grand Strategy titles. Bewarehowever
Easy way to spend dozens of hours.
Not a war game or strategy game (although it can be categorized as both)but more precisely a surprisingly addictive feudalism simulationwith 'The Sims'-like characters who have traits and personalities all their own. With endless replayability
I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. I started as a Portuguese dude in Porto or Coimbra or somewhere and I kept trying to invade southern Portugal but it wouldn't let me because I didn't have a causa belli or something. So basically the Moors were just hanging out in Lisboa and there was nothing I could do. Then some guy who I thought was supposed to be part of my kingdom started attacking me. Then I sent all my servants to get married to the Pope's underlings but that didn't really do anything. Then I got poisoned but it was ok because I got better and then I found some wandering samurai who was supposed to teach me how to be a better fighter but kept getting drunk instead. Then I died eventually and started playing as this little fat guy who I guess was my son. But he got assassinated pretty quick and I lost the game. I'm guessing I have to start off as someone who isn't Portuguese so I can go on Crusades and get the Pope to like mebut I really have no clue how to do anything.
The greatest MBS (Medieval fuck Simulator) ever commited to code and the closest thing to a 'Song of Ice and Fire' game we are likely to get (there is even a mod for it!). If you are the kind of person who autoresolves most Total War battles and wishes there was more political intrigue then this is the game for you.   Surethe combat is lacklustrebut once you've had your first imbecile son assassinated to stop him from inheriting and ruining your kingdom
A very deep game (a Paradox Trademark) that isin my opinionParadox's best game. The character progression is incredible
Great game. Where else can you have your nephew thrown off a castle?
MarryfuckKill...Hardcore Simulator
This game is probally the most enjoyingsatisfyingand immersive of any strategy game I have ever owned. Whilst it does take a lot of patience to complete the game
Awsome game
Amazing even though I dont know how to play!
I would recommend this game to anyoneespecially people who love strategy games. Fair warning thoughthere is a little bit of a learning curve. It took me about 6 hours to get a good feel for the game
This game is great. It is complexit takes a ton of dedication to learn the game. But after you learn the mechanicsyou start to improve upon your strategies. I highly recommend this game. I have put 350+ hours into it. Another truly grand strategy game from Paradox Interactive. Well done!
I have a coupon for 50% off of this game if any one wants to trade for it. I already have this game and that is why I do not need the coupon. It is a great game though.
This was one of those games which started with 'wtf is this' and ended up with 'omfg I can't stop playing it'. While having a fairly high learning curvethis is an ultimate strategy game. Very intricate and complex gameplay with lots of areas to take care of and tons of challenges and countless possible playthroughs. If anybody wants itI got a coupon for it for 50% off which is active till February 1
Played this game for about an hour and a half and had no idea what I was doing. I successfully engaged in multiple pointless wars and married off everyone I could to girls less that a quater of their age. The amount of stuff you can do in this game is magnificentand it'd be great if I could only just figure out how to use it...
one generation of incest can't be that bad
Great game. Hard to figure out all the aspects of the gamebut will easily consume dozens of hours as you get immersed.
The best bureaucracy 'em up EVER!!!
THIS GAME IS SO FUN!! i wonder what multiplayer will be like.
Do you love history? Do you love seeing nations rise and fall? Do you like role playing games? Stradgy games? Perhaps you'll like a medevil role-playing grand stradgy game where you play as a noble dynasy and try to outwitoverpowerand use your cunning to gain more power or just try to maintain it! Crusader Kings II is that game. It suits any type of game style
Addictive and deep middle-age degenerate incest simulator!
CK2 is my first Paradox Interactive gameand I have already spent 150 hours on it. It is very addictive. While the interface is rather intuitive to useyou will however need to carefully learn the ropes of the game to become an expert at it. In 150 hours
44844
I've spent over 200 hours playing this game. The depth is astounding and there are always new ways to play. You can be a crafty master of intrigue or a conquerer or just a peaceful merchant republic. No matter how you play once you get sucked in you won't ever want to leave.
?????
One of the most in-depth games I've ever played.The level of detail and attention needed to succeed keeps me entertained for hours
really in depth game that i am just starting to appreciate. lots of strategy
It's like Game of Thrones.  If Game of Thrones let you marry your 7 year old grand daughter and then assassinate her to inherit the Kingdom of Portugal.
Very fun game. Hard to get a multiplayer match going though.......
one of the best games I have ever playedwell worth it.
Such a great game! Perfect combination of military and political intrigue in a RTS. What really made the game for me was the Game Of Thrones mod since I'm a huge fan of the show.
Best medieval Grand-strategy game I've ever played. Might be a little hard at firstbut a lot easier to learn than other Paradox games (Victoria 2Hearts of Iron). One of the most addictive and entertaining games once you've learned how to play it. Also
This is the first game I have actually lost track of time while playing. So much detail and in depth strategy to the game. Highly recommended for those who love their strat games.
40hrs in 3 days. That's how engrossing this is. It's been a little frustrating because of the amount left unexplainedand a few glitches. But it's still great! Don't expect total freedomthough. Even the characters you play as have social constraints. In fact
Spread your seed and win the world.
Those who take the time to understand the complexities of around succession laws and territorial claims will be rewarded with a game that will allow you to plot to assassinate their own dimwitted children in favor of the more capable ones. Don't try to create a matriarchy thoughit seems that women were kinda like dogs during the 11th century it will backfire and back things may happen if not done with the utmost of care.
Buy it. Now.
Great game.
Experienced strategy gamers only!  With this particular gameyou can control any countyor nation. I chose to take control of the Saxon king of England. What is really cool about this game is you do not simply manage diplomatic relations with other major powers
A very addictive and enjoyable gamea must for stratigy game fans. the only real draw backs been a weak tutarial and steep learning curve but still enjoyble if you stick at it
Best grand strategy game ever made. Mix of real time grand strategy and RPG elements (these are rather simplifiedbut very enyoyable). Terrific historical accuarcy with great attention to every detail related to medieval era. You play rather as dynasty than a country wich makes this game totally different than any of Europa Universalis games. Game is sometimes ridiculously hard (especally on Ironman Mode) but it's one of my favourite features of CK. It sucks that you have to buy over 9000 DLC packs to get really cool stuff like vikings or playable muslims and jews - that's biggest flaw of CK. OverallCK is one of the best strategy games and one of the most unique games of all time.
Although daunting for beginnersCrusader Kings II is the 1st strategy game without the 'Sid Meier' prefix to completly take over my life for weeks at a time. Mod-Friendlythe Game of Thrones mod is a must play for any fan of the series
The game is great! Do NOT under anycircumstances waste the money on the 'DLC collection.' All it is is background music and new faces. You can but the expansions for the same price and have more fun. I made this mistake and am very angry I wasted my $50. Other than thatit is a good game. Have fun crusading!
love it but wont let me use the ruler design dlc i bought
one of the key points of ck2 is the savegames are exportable to eu4 ... but crusader kings is still a fun game in its own rightand well-made.
This game is so much funand dangerously addicting once you learn what you are doing!
history nerdgasm
Absolutely Fantastic!  This game is the epitome of GOOD grand strategy games. It's so difficult it's unplayablebut it doesn't make you feel like a god-king. There is a seemingly endless replayability and the gameplay mechanics are second to none. It is a very good way to pass time or simply to have funit is truly one of my favorite games.
10/10 would assassinate entire lineage again
Could be the best Paradox Plaza game ever madeabsolutely excellent.
It's pretty great.
This is a good game with a lot of issues. The basic premisegroom your dynasty throughout the high and late middle ages using warreligionarranged marriages
The most complex and satisfying paradox game in the entire series. Nothing else comes quite close. If you're a fan of any of the other gamesor enjoy thoughftul games of intrigue and warcheck it out
a game full of treachery and incest. always wanted to run a kingdom of inbred dwarves? this is your game.
Best game eu as well.
Great Game!!
worth
I've never been much of a fan of these so called 'strategy map games' but I have to admitthat Crusader Kings II (CK2) has given me a lot of enjoyable gameplay and fine moments. Paradox has a certain way to persuade players to their games. I think it's the complexity of the game that lures more prey more human players to play this game. I for one fell in love with the plot and kill system of the medieval politics and way of life in this game.  I'd definitely recommend this game both for single- and multiplayer purposes. SP is good for practisebut the real deal and fun comes from eiher challenging other players from around the world and face the unknown with or without your own companions.   For multiplayer it also works quite fine if one works with his friends to achieve a common goal. No matter whether the goal is just to plot and kill the reigning king or reform the Norse faith under one single banner. Working together
I have plotted to have so many children assassinated I have lost count!  10/10
This is a good RTS but becomes really straight forward after a whilethis is my opinion but do not believe people when they say CK is complicated when in reality it really is not once you get the game mechanics downunderstand what you need to do
This isn't a game that will suit everyone's tastes. It's a slow burnermixing long term strategic planning with entertaining political intrigue and famaily dynasty dynamics. Play as a Christian counta Muslim
Little learning curvebut once you get the hang of itit becomes super addictive.
It's basically game of thrones without dragons. Until you add the game of thrones mod which adds dragons. huzzzzzzah
My life is gone. thanksParadox.
This Game has a very large depth of playand an enourmous amount of replayability value. The game starts as a ruler of your choice whom controls at least 1 province in a Catholic/Orthodox kingdom of your choosing [DLC adds Pagan/Muslim/etc]and you attempt to grow your Dynasty over the course of 500 years. The game
very very very good game. Takes quite some time to learnbut absolutely worth it. Involvement in your characters and a wide range of choices makes every playthrough different. Do not forget to try out the excellent game of thrones mod for this game.
A superb game. The other reviews tell enough about thisso I will speak of the downside. The price. While 40 is a great deal for the gamethe content dlc-s (not including the aestetic dlc-s) are a 'must' to get the level of expirience few games in this ganre offer. They offer you the opportunity to play as anything from a merchant republic to viking lord. The game feels as if it's missing content without them and let's be frank
Incredably fun but you have to make your own story. Set goals and play you characters in ways that make sense for them and not to 'win'
Since I acquired the Old Gods and Sons of Abraham DLCI have been unable to play my other games. I love this game so much for its diversity. Probably the best game I've owned to date
One the best Paradox's games.  Improve the 'classical' Paradox's style in many aspects.  Really appreciated also the possibility to 'transfer' a game world to 'Europa Universalis IV'.
Don't let the simplistic graphics/interface fool youthis is probably the deepest and most replayable strategy game I've ever played. Hilariousengrossing
Just see how many hours we all have on this gameit should tell you a lot.
One of the best games I've played. The dynasty dynamic adds a whole new level and it is over-all fantastic
Incredibly good grand strategy game with superb political aspects. There is nothing like it!
Few other games give you the ability to imprision your motherbanish your fatherand send your worthless brother off to the Holy Land to meet his end. Get this.
Very addictive and fun. Though it seems extremely difficult and complex at the startit becomes very easy to graspif you give it a chance. Also
A good entry point into grand strategy games.
Religous persecutionGenocideincest
A very complete Strategy game about the Family's of Europe. The map streches all the way from Iceland to Persia and down to south africa. Not your typical Strategy game because instead of trying to advance your nationyou try to advance your family through War and Marriage . You can arrange power alliances by marrarring into powerful Familys. You try to advance your dynasty to the zinth of its power IF 30 is a littie much for you then the Crusader Kings I is for sale for only 10 but either way this is one the greatest strategy games of the year    A must Have for all Strategy Gamers
well i think its cool and good sometimes to play map games. im gay
Somehow ended up impregnating my daughter's daughterwho also happened to be my daughter. 10/10 for gamebut it also made me realize that I may be a horrible person. Also as a hint
This is a stellar game for anybody who is into history or politics. One thing to keep in mind with the game is that it is a Grand Strategyu simulatorso you will not be directing battles or micromanaging troopsas combat is handled in an abstract manner.  The real appeal to the game is the alternate history and the geneology portions. Since this game is about forging a dynasty
Fantastic in every way. Depthstrategy and incest all in one!
It's basically a Game of Thrones game. Except much better than the licensed Game of Thrones game.
I don't even know where to start to review a game like this. It's a strategy on a massive scale. I should probably state that the initial learning curve is steep -- very steep.   **Note: Do Not Try To Learn This Game By Doing In-Game Tutorials (They Are Bad)Watch Some Great YouTube Video Resources**  Unfortunately the enjoyment comes after the learning curvebut when you hit that breaking point
Crusader Kings 2 is what would happen if the Sims and a grand strategy game had a baby. It's a fantastic gameeasily on my top 5 strategy games.
An authentic Historical experience.
This is a brilliant game. There are endless possibilitieswhich makes each play unique. Everything is possible: fucking your cousingetting a homosexual
This is not a game for beginners and kidsif you are a real man u will love this game. Paradox has done it again and i give it my highest rating. Best game from best the developer.
It's like Game of Thrones but in Middle Ages Europe and with more child killing. Seriously my rebuilt Roman Empire has a throne of baby skulls.
Great gamebut very hard to startbut once you do you will be able to play for days.
Truly outstanding! I wish there were more strategy games out there like this one!
This gamelike most paradox gameshas a steep learning curve. If you spend the time to learn the intricacies of this game it is totally worth it. The value is in exploring the variety of ways to expand your lands and family power
I just fucked my Auntwho happens to be the Empress of the Byzantine empire. Ended up getting murdered by a Persian Christian in the middle of the Abbasid empire for whatever reason. 10/10 will rage quit more.
There was an earthquake in my county that caused a tear in the ground. 10/10 would sacrifice my daughter to close the Gate to Hell again.
AMMMMMMAAZING! Game. Its really hard and really fun. I love this game one of my top 10 games I must have.
PLOTS WITHIN PLOTS. THE FAMILY LINE MUST SURVIVE!
I WAS a civ 5 player before I found this game (and its cousin Europa Universalis 4). Note the emphasis on the WAS. Crusader Kings 2 isno doubtan epic. Relatively easy to pick up
Crusader Kings II makes Civ V look simplisitc and short. You have far more control over the details of your empirehave to consider threats from within your own kingdom instead of just those outside your bordersand to top it all off the game is heavily driven by random story driven events-- ensuring that no two playthroughs will be the same.  I've never played a game with depth quite like CK2. In what other strategy game can I say that I plotted to kill my grandson
Great game! Paradox knows grand strategy games and continues to show it here. Ive played countless hours and always have fun. CK2 feels like you are playing a real-world version of song of ice and fire... or you can get the mod 'a game of thrones' and its like you are playing a game actually made to encapsulate the series.
I tried to murder my brother and usurp his kingdombut he found out and now he hates me. A vassal of mine has too much power and is now starting a war for the kingdom of leon ( I currently hold three kingdom titles LeonCastille
hi!! I was total war fun.. until I found this game. hard at the beginning but after demo test and few gamesI think is the best medieval strategy game ever!! and try the dlc for customize your ruler!!!! fantastic game.. 10/10
This game is well worth your money if you're into grand strategy games. It's strange at firstespecially if it's your first grand strategybut once you get used to it it's great fun.
Okay well this game is addicting. Downloaded it about 8 oclock the other night. Checked my phone to see the time and it was 3 in the morning.
well this is the best game ever.
Best Grand Strategy game ever.
Same mapevery single time. And doesn't get borringnever. Awesome game
Make ally with a kingwhom I have kill his son.  10/10
One of my most played gamesI love that it is very challenging and I love the Game of Thrones mods!
This is the first Paradox game for me that I was able to really 'get into'play and enjoy! I believe it's key to understand what this game is and what it isn't: this is certainly not a military strategy game like the Total War series where battles (or military operations in general) are the focus. This is really a 'dynasty' or 'family line' simulator that is able to generate fascinating storylines focusing on dynasties and their struggles through time.  The one thing that made this game accessible for me were watching different 'let's play' videos on YouTubeas the manual is completely useless and the tutorials are also close to worthless.  Have fun!
At once the best strategy gamebest RPG and best life simulator ever made.
Very addictive.
As you can see from my hours of gameplaythis game is time consuminga masterpiece of grand strategy game fans.
If you want a game where you can marry off a newborn child to a 72 year old noblethis is your game. Princess XxQuikSk0p3Xx is due to be married to some old German guy.
A great game !
Incredible gameplayed for over 40 hours and will continuethe game will naver end!!!!!
Crusader Kings II is simply amazing. A game full of heavy strategy and depth. I've only just started but even the last 6 hours of playing has left me understanding that there is quite a learning curve to playing the game properly.  Definitely very impressedespecially since this is my first go at a grand strategy game like this!
Phenominal gamewill probably put another 150 hours in this game
What I Expected: Conquering Europe!  What I Got: Murdering Children For Their Titles!
gayest game ever. reccomended.
Destroy history invade the europe with the muslim or invade middle east with an irish empire? Triumph with an heresy and destroy rome! Loot rome capture the pope and sacrifice him!
Fantasitic gamehighly addictive
An incredibly mean time-sink. While it may appear somewhat dry at firstit is more immersive than Hearts of Iron.  Why?  You control a dynasty/family from 1066 to 1452 one member at a timethe character you play being chosen by inheritance of your main title. All characters have vices and virtues making you try to assassinate that fat
Possibly the most human game I've ever played. Weirdsince this is such a numbers game. In-depthhighly moddable and just all-around FANTASTIC. N.B. If you get this
10/10 would marry 3 year old again
I love this game. It is much broader and more political than the Total War series that I was hoping this would emulate. It also has significantly poorer graphics than most modern games and it seems like it would run good even on lesser machines than listed in the requirements.  battles are over-simplified but it helps you progress through time there are TONs of achievements and they are all fairly difficult to achieve the mods can be great (I recommend the game of thrones one) tons of DLC which is good for the amount of content but bad for the cost  good gamegreat value when on sale
One of the most indepth srategy games out there. It is great. I have logged over 300 hours in the game and I still love playing it.
This game is immersivelot's of fun to play and replayand has me hooked up from the first gameplay. It takes a bit of a learning curve
If you like strategy game you have to play Crusader Kings II. It is a classic Paradox grand strategy game (EU IIIVictora 2HoI3 and so on) and it's their best franchise IMO. Unlike other games you don't play as a nation but as a dinasty and you don't have any specific task to accomplish you can try to become the HRE emperor
I wanted a game that would deliver a dynastic experienceand it exceeded my expectations. It's so in depth that it has a steep learning curve. Just don't expect an action-filled game the combat is pretty lame. Also don't expect to go outsideor keep any relationships going. This game sucks you in and makes your wonder where your day went.
One of the best strategy games I have ever played.
Fantastic strategy game. Watch your back though or you may find your fortunes change very rapidly!
This is a very awesome game once you learn how to play it. The RPG elements are amazing and the game will keep you on your toes if you let it. The only thing I would change is that the popup messages take up the center of the screen and when it pauses the time it doesnt give you an option to slow down the timeso becareful with the superclocked speed on time! Especially in war!
An amazing grand strategy game! I'd recommend it only for those who've had experience in the genre (Eu4VictoriaMaybe Civ5.) If you play enough this becomes one of the most hilariously fun games on the planet. Its replayability is the reason i sink hundreds of hours into these games.
This game is a fuck? to learn.  Took me a good week to learn the game once i learned to play the game I love it.
My only reccomendation is to watch some lets play videos of this game to help you decide if you might like it or not. It is a very unusual strategy game.
Take all the effort the Total War series puts into their realtime battles and apply it instead to deepening the strategic gameand you get something like this. Investment is keyin relationships
Amazing gameif you enjoy Paradox games then this is one if not their best game yet.  You do not take the role of a nation but a character the rest of the world is controlled by other character that you can interact withmarry
Great game. Get the 'A Game of Thrones' mod.
This game is the best strategy game ever. Well....when it works. If you own a PC the game works fine and you should have little to no problems. On the other handMac and paradox games don't mix well. The game on startup crashes and is only playable when opening the game without steam. Even though in the latest patch it says this crash has been fixed it really hasn't. I still do recommend the game because my guess is the majority of steam users are on PC but if you are on a mac don't buy this unless you have the ability to run Windows via Bootcamp or Parallels. If you have that option you'll have a great time playing this game. :)
it may take a long time to get the grasp of everything and has a big learning curve. But if you get past it which i recommened you'll find this is one of the most fun and addicting games you've ever played.
Highly recommended for those who take amusement in killing your family members and vice versa
Two hours instill no fucking idea what I am doingmy brother imprisoned my wife
This is one of my favourite games. If you've liked Paradoxe's other gamesCK II is much in the same vein. CK II isn't really a strategy gameits a 'dynasty simulator' where your goal isn't necessarily to ensure you control max territory but rather that your family is as powerful. connected and long lasting as possible. 'Conquest' in this game happens as much through strength of arms as it does from clever marriages well placed assasins (think Tywin Lannister from Game Of Thrones).  Overall
This game is almost everything I could want in a Medieval Strategy Game!  Feudal SystemIntriguePolitics
Great dynamics strategy. Very fun.
yeah man but it has a step learning curve
This is one of the best games there is if you like to pause and think about your actions. The characters are also surprisingly endearing for being randomly generated still images.
You will spend hours murdering your grandchildrenusing your daughters as pawns in alliancesand homogenizing the unique cultures of the lands you conquer. You will send your children to be tutored by someone with a -100 approval rating of you just so they get that +1 bonus to stewardship
Crusader Kings 2 can be an obtuse game at times but once you crack it open it will consume you. Crusader Kings 2 is a game about people with everything else being slightly ancillary. Yes you will own land and hopefully form a great kingdombut it is your relationships with those around you that will shape how you go about it. The game cleverly prevents power creep by introducing mortalityone day you will die and your heir will take over. This introduces a raft of challenges for the player as sons who were once assets to the kingdom will tear it apart as they fight over it. My most memorable experience so far involved being almost wiped out by a viking horde and being saved by a last minute marriage into England who were then called into war as my allies. While I was safe for the time being I had given England a foothold into my kingdom. This situation exemplifies whats so great about Crusader Kings 2
This is probably the greatest game ever just because of the sheer replay value. It reall ynever gets old trying to conquer like vast and real territories so you can forge an empire out of a bunch of warring states. If only the map were... more globalit'd be perfect. I buy all the DLC.
Another Paradox game for history loversthis game is very fun but like their other titles very hard to break into. HoweverParadox does continue to get better in regards to their tutorial system
Pretty awesome.
Excellent gamehas a pretty high learning curve but once you get past that it is a really good game.  The GOT mod for it is also excellent.
Very good gamejust too much micro management for me :)
Probably one of the most addicting Grand Strategy games. Kill your childrenyour spouseyour uncles and much more.
It's awesome
Great game ever!
Have you ever read Game of Thrones and thoughtThat's what want do!'? Do you like plotingtrading children
Imprison relatives! Plot against your benefactors! Declare anti-popes!  It's not about battlesbut essentially being an unimportant noble plotting so that your grandson will be the kingand then panicing for a Plan B when he dies in a 'hunting accident'. This usually involves a series of plots
This is the most engagingchallengingagonizing yet ultimately rewarding strategy game I have ever played. For me
The multi-generational dynastic gameplay is unique. I keep coming back to this game and recently I have discovered the Game of Thrones mod. I cannot recommend this game enough to people who enjoy complex strategy games.
Awesome gamehowever splitting game into many DLC's and it's pricing are very disappointing.
The grandest dynasty simulator ever made. You'll pour hours into building your kingdom or duchymolding a suitable heirand dodging attempts on your throne from rivals
Truly live the lineage of some of Europe's best and worst kings of the Middle Ages.
I have to say that Crusader Kings II is one of my most favorite games of all time. Essentiallyyou play as a medieval dynasty between the years 1066 and 1453 (you can start at 867 with the Old Gods DLC). There is no ultimate goal to the gamemaking it a total sandbox where all goals are solely your own. You could try to unify Ireland
This is a good game that's game mechanics simulate feudalism well. What you spend most of your time doing in this game is managing your relationships with your vassals as you don't directly control much territory. The higher your relations are with your various vassals are the more tax they pay and troops they provide as levies. This game uses the same engine as Europa Universalis IV but is not as pretty. If you are going to choose one of these I would recommend getting EU4 over this one. If you do get this game make sure that you get it in a bundle with all the DLC's as there are multitudes of them and the mods that are worth playing require the DLC to play.
This is without a doubt Paradox's finest game everas well as their simplest to learn.
This game is freaking awesome.
A great amount of tactical thinking combined with a difficulty level that gives small successes meaning. I cannot recommend this game enough.
When Civ V strategy is not enough anymore. Plus politics a la Game Of Thrones.
Crusader Kings II is unbelievably good. For awhile it ruined games like Civilization for me. In CK2 you actually are the leader you are playing as. This means that when you dieyou become your heir. You can marry your family off to gain powerful alliances. You can plot to have your older brother killed because he comes before you in the line of succession. You can have your council fabricate claims to steal land from neighbors. The modding capability for this game is amazing. I love playing the Game of Thrones mod for this game and that's just scratching the surface. There are tons more mods for CK2. The replay value and the immersive nature of this game make it a must have.
If you like strategy games like the total war series or civilization but find yourself wishing you had more depth? Want more challenge without superficial handicaps to you and unfair ai bonuses? Then Crusader Kings II is your next logical step. Arrange marriagesmanage vassalschange laws
This is a great game and it is really fun. The only thing is that there are too many DLC's to download before you can play all the charcters. Other than that great game.
Hours &amp hours &amp hours &amp hours &amp hours &amp hours &amp hours &amp hours &amp hours of fun. And even more fun when the pope calls for a crusade! Got a very steep learning curvebut the depth to this game is phenomenal. Definitely one of those 'one-more-turn' gamesor in this case
Great Stuff! very indepth.
I married my sister and killed our child because he was a fuck??. 10/10 would recommend
I am really impressed with the level of detail they put into this strategic game. Everything looks great and the mechanics keep the game from becoming boring without over whelming you at the same time. The level of detail and information for each historical figures and detail on the territories and how they change over the ages is mind blowing. I never thought Id use Wikipedia to try and help me win at a game. I highly recommend if you have a few hours of patience to learn the game.
CK2 is a very complex simulation of noble relationships where each individual has a tracked opinion of every other individual in the world. Things like personality trait conflicts and actions taken by people have an effect on how the opinion builds up (or down)and is finally realized in game by having happy people support your plotsfactions
Very Challanging but Very Rewarding. I'm still learning the mechanics but loving it!! Sadly PARADOX'S tutorials are less than great but many good GUIDES are available online &amp VERY helpfull Community.  Also varorious DLC has different gameplay mechanics that are not stated well. Again ask Community!!
Who needs Game of Thrones? This has a very steep learning curve but then it grows on you like a tumor. It is great.
THIS GAME IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This game is beautifully intricatealbeit a little overwhelming. We all know what happens with overwhelming games though - we slowly understand them and then grow to absolutely adore them. The community is very extreme in that there are two key mods that I personally would recommend and they are Elder Kingsand A Game of Thrones. They are pretty obvious in what both are and go to far extents in completely unique ways that exploit the vastness of this game to each polar extreme be it with dragons as pets
Had two people with Genius and quick their kids was ugly and imbecile and teh mother died in childbirth and the father died in battle... 10/10
Time well spend! Awesome purchase for strategy fans. And when you get tired playingtry some modsat least GoT mod for CKII!
It isn't exactly a whirlwind of actionbut if you can get past the learning curve it has a certain charm.
This game has absolutely redefined strategy. Never before have I played a game with such an admixture of intrigue and warfareof adultery and zealotry....
Great game if you have the time to learn. Also it will eat away your time.
Two marathon all nighters playing this game over Christmas says this is addictive and fun! The learning curve is incredibly steep. Howeverthat I think is the charmas you make mistakes
This game is fantastically in-depthsillyand grittily realistic all at the same time. It'll make you want to laugh and cry. It's an at times incomprehensible
If you have something important coming upavoid this game because this game is so addictive with inifinite replay value.
Vast expansive world full of iunteresting hcarcters and fun little flavor events spent 400+ hours in the past year onm this game.
This game is fantasticif you have the right mindset for it. I highly recommend starting out as a small kingor even a count of a large country and scheming your way to the top. It's so very satisfying.
I found it easier to pick up concepts and figure out what was going on in this game compared to other grand strategy. That doesn't mean the game is any easier though. It can be quite complex! Planning ahead generations through good breeding and successful assassinations is funespecially with the roleplaying aspect of the game. There is some luck involved with eventsbut overall good breeding determines a lot. The music is
It's just plain awesome
really great gamelots of depth makes you thirst for moreendless ways to play
I started it upand it looked too complicated to get into with my schedule. Waiting till I get a free weekend.  I have two 50% coupons for it if you are thinking about getting it.
very good stratagey game depth is amazing I Recomend this game
None of the DLC has worked for me and I've tried everything recomendedbut overall it's a good game even without the DLC
The inital learning curve kind of sucks and it could be equated to a text based game with graphics. But if you like strat games this is one of the best out there in my opinion. Oh and the little choice prompts tend to be pretty amusing.
Great Game for any one . You have the possibility to conquer the British Isles from a single county in Ireland. One of my favorite games and I recommend it as a great game.
much intrigue  such war  many plot  incest lots  many pretenders   wow  10/10
1
Best strategy game ever made. As a feudal lord in the medieval ages you have got to schemeplot and conquor yourself to an empire
Terrible interfacebut the best ever political strategic game.
One of the best games and best purchases I made in recent memory. Paradox again proves why they are the Masters of this type of game. Rule your family and have complete control of crafting a mighty line or crumbling under your own failure. The Freedom Granted to be a kind or cruel rulervs a snarky or loyal servent is grand. You find yourself making plots generations in advance seeing how you can manipulate things on the grand scale while keeping things in check in your local. That you can have your great plans undone by a assasination you didnt see coming or a Marrige that produced no children. The ability to roll it over to EU4 is a great feature to keep your world going and even stranger. This is a game for those who love history love chaning it and wondering what would happen.   also the 7 deadly sins campaign was awesome. side note but True.   I would Recomend this to Anyone with out hesitation and why I write this Glowing Review! One of the greatest games of all time.
Okaythis is a very specific kind of game.  If you like mapgamesyou may like this. The family intrigue and marriage alliances are all very Game of Thrones and relatively complicated. Some aspects are a little dull but time can fly by very quickly as to your preference allowing you to manipulate the more enjoyable stuff.  It's great starting off as a little nobody but then managing to establish a dynasty that puts your great grandchild as the first Queen of a Kingdom.
Great game I really love it
Goodness gollyI love this game. Haven't played much recentlybut my heavens.  One of the best things about CKII
To be bluntbeing a king is pretty darn hard. You start out with either a small kingdomdukedom or even an empire. But the challenge isn't just expanding your territory and the like. You've got to stave off the hundreds of fuck?? off lords
This is by far the best family tree simulator I've ever played.
This game is really goodI use the Song of Ice and Fire mod.
The only thing to say about this game is: Amazing. I recently started playing PCand mostly play RTS games. Paradox has quickly become my favorite game company because of this game and the Europa series. One of the great things about this game is that you can start from little to nothinglike the northern half of Wales
This game is something very special. As far as I am aware there is notnor has there ever beena game quite like this.  The conventional grand strategy we have come to expect from Paradox is all well and good
This game will bring out anyone's machivellian side. For fans of managmentand grand strategy this is a must.
you get to inprison babies and turn them in to your concubines when they come of age. lots of assassinationblindingand castration. BDSM taken too far. 9/10 if you like power fetishes i suppose you'll like this
Only game I've played where I have been imprisoned at the ripe age of 3 for inciting a civil warand then upon release at 5 being fostered by the king himself only to later go on and kill his son. Great gamego try it.
An amazing gamehowever has a steep learning curve. if you want to have any idea of what to do PLAY ALL THE TUTORIAL!!!!!!!
I'm a long-term EU playerand this game strikes a great balance by reducing the world map but adding depth in the vassal and personal relationships. It takes some time to learn all of the new functions and nuancebut well worth it.
Very Fun and a great way to waste a day off! :)
As a long time fan of Hearts of IronVictoria and recently EUIIII thought i'd have Crusader Kings II figured out from the get go. It surprised me immensely. It's not so much a mediaeval strategy game as a 'dynastic simulator'
A great game with endless possibilities for storytelling. You start as a migthy (or totally ignorable) dynasty in High Medieval Europe that has to expand its powerbasesecure holdings and titles for its sons and good marriage-alliances for its daugthers. To quote Tywin Lannister from A Game of Thrones: 'A good man does everything he can to better the position of his family.' And boy will you be doing stuff - from fighting on the blood- and mudstained fields of Central Europe to crusading in the arid and saracen-infested Holy Landeverything is included in this game.  Though you won't be figthing the awesome and realistic battles of Medieval 2 Total War
You'll become a massive fuckperhaps even literallybut it's addictive as hell.
This game is awesome! Definetly not for someone who wants to not thinkit is defintly a strategy game.
After a while of learning curvesay 10 hours including watching walkthrough on u tubthis compelling game made by the same swedish studio which produced the HOI serial
Already played more than 30 hours of CK2 within the past 3 weeksonly heard of the game through watching series of it on Youtube. The original game is already a solid 8/10 but adding the expansions (have yet to buy Sons of Abraham) pushes this game to a 9. The requirement to play in Ironman mode in order to earn achievements makes earning them more challenging and more enjoyable.
I love this game. There's not many others games out therethat outright encourage you to marry for power. The devious joy you get when you marry someone who is third in line to the throneand shortly after
This is honestly one of my favorite games out there. You can start yourself in a variety of situations that can all turn out differently should you make a wrong choice. AlsoI love how easy it is to lose in this game: if you make a single wrong choiceit is possible to lose anything between a county and an empire.  I would highly recommend this game.  Pro: Replayability Importance of every decision Variety of approaches to every problem User Interface  Cons: If you start as a single county
One of the most complex games I've EVER played. It took me two days of patience and watching Youtube videosas well as playing the same character of the Youtube video to actually grasp onto what was going on in the game. Once I got it I had to have more. So I downloaded more. The only way you can get Badges from this game is to be in Ironman Mode with no saving capable :( but aside from this AMAZING game. Because of Ironman Mode Steam says over 50 hours of playing for me but Actual play time is closer to being around 20 hours ACTUAL playtime.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE fuck IS GOING ONBUT I LIKE IT.
Crusader Kings 2 makes you work for it's awesomeness. But once you get how to playget ready for an incredibly vivid strategy game.
If you like strategy games with quite a lot of micro-managementthis game is awesome! Paradox comes out with a lot of these gamesso if you like Europa Universalis or Sengoku - you'll like this.
They had me at marriagekidsand plotting!!
Really really fun... if you put in the dedication to understand it. It is complicatedmuch more than CiVfor example. I recomend watching somebody let's play it. My favorite is a youtuber called Arumba07
This Game is amazing.
Goodbut I feel like the whole 'vassal management' system is a distraction from what is inevitably a world conquest game. There is nothing more frustrating than fighting a difficult waronly to have a third of your realm shatter from your borders because someone thought you are ugly and fat and they would make a much better
Great game. Its the game i trolled the game and fuck? everyones account.
This is one of those games that you can play over and over and over and over again. NormallyI get pretty grouchy when a company has multiple DLCs -- but this game is complete without any of them. They really do accentuate the game without making you feel like you have to have them.  The fact that they use them to support the continued development -- and thusimproving game play even if you don't have the DLC's
Wonderful grand strategy game. Not as complex as Europa Universalis but still has great depth. Unlike other Paradox GS games you don't control a notion but rather a medieval noble dynasty (you only ever directly control you dynasties patron/matronother family members have to be influenced via diplomacy) with the goal of amassing as much glory/piety as possible (alternatively you can just try an take over the world). Great care has been taken in regards to historical accuracythe feudal lord/vassal structure has been mapped precisely and is one of the main game mechanics
Greatdeep grand strategy game. Obviously no focus on graphicsbut very deep under the hood.
Let's face it - I'll recommend anything by Paradox.  It's a wonderful game though - I recommend you try the demo at leastif nothing else.
I have played this game for less than 10 hours and every single one of these playthroughs have been utter failures. This isn't a 'tough' game so much as it's detail oriented. Watch more Let's Play videos on Youtube than you can handle and make sure to keep playing everytime you learn something new to try it out.   All-in-Allif you can handle the enormous learning curvethe micro-management of your land
Awesome game for every alternative-history fan!
Difficult to get into at first as I was expecting a Total War clone good game with a bit of perseveration.
A fantastically deep game. It is more of a political / medieval family lineage simulator than a RTS like Age of Empiresbut if you are looking for Civ-style deep complexity with politicking and world dominationthis is for you.
I love the old strategy games on NESSNESPSONE and PS2 like Nobunaga's Ambition or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. This tickles a similar fancy in that regard but obviously this is European focused and is very much about your heir as much as it is about taxes
After being a long time fan of the Civilization series. I purchased this game not knowing exactly what I was getting. Butafter a few hours of gameplayI love it. It is way more in depth than the Civ series and makes it look like a dumbed down version of the Crusader series. The lineage factor can keep you playing for hours and I got this game for a steal during the holiday sales including all the of the DLC. I couldn't have asked for a better game and now I'm looking into getting other games from the developer such as Europa IV and the bunch. 5/5 for me.
Great Grand Strategy game: WarIntrigueReligion and Economy!
Instead of playing as a nationyou play as a dynasty. From duke of Apulia to the King of 7 kingdoms. Plus a ton of in-depth gameplay and the likeI call Crusader Kings 2 a must-buy for strategy lovers like myself.
I was a bit hesitant about this game at firstbut now I love it. I have wasted wayy too many hours trying to ensure my dynasty remains strong for all time.
Crusader Kings II is a fantastically engrossing game of strategy that will suck you in and hold your attention for far longer than you originally intended. It has a steep learning curvebut a depth and breadth that makes Civ V seem like Monopoly by comparison. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys grand strategy games you will not be disappointed!
I have spent more time on this game than I should have. It's very very taking!  Simply putyou are a nobleman (or woman) in the Middle Ages and you're working to increase the size of your holdings. Start as a simple count and work your dynasty's way to the throne of an emperor! This isn't just a wargamethere is little of the administrative aspect present in other Paradox games
A fantastic combination of a high-detail historical strategy and management game coupled with an excellent real-time strategy fighting mechanic. If you ever wanted to run a Viking state while invading Englandor grow your own powerful merchant republicor pick your own nation and create the largest empire ever
I haven't played different game since April of 2012.
great game once you learn how to play!
This game is just amazing.
Absolutely excellent game! Todaythe 30th of DecemberI can with certainty say this is my game of the year. It has completely captivated me
Basically mideival history class + A Game of Thrones + cocaine. Extremely fun and addictivebuy at your own risk.
omgso goodcan't stop playing with it D: !
Ever want to call a Norse crusade against the Catholic heathens? Practice polygamy? What about get invaded by hyper-advanced Aztecs from across the atlantic ocean? Then have I got the game for you...  PS. There are concubines. I don't even know what those are and I like it.
Play this without cheatsand get ready to slowly wither away / get instantly conquered / having civil war because your heir is fuckfuck or with negative traits that make your vassals angry. Then mongols come and take you out.  With moderate cheating it is fun. Google for CK2 wiki.  What I dislike how the armies move. They have an arrow that slowly fills up and then the army teleports to next province. Real time would be better.  Also if you summon your huge 7000 strong levy from the province where an army of 50-700 random toddlers are 'sieging'you will lose the fight because your army has zero morale and you cannot select leaders to it
WHETHER IT'S POISONING YOUR BORTHER TO OBTAIN ITALYMURDERING HALF YOUR FAMILY TO FURTHER YOUR EUGENICS PROGRAM TO GET A STRONG ATTRACTIVE GENIUS OR TURNING THE EMPRESS OF THE BYZANTINE EMPIRE INTO YOUR CONCUBINE SO THAT YOUR KID CAN THEN INHERIT THEIR FILTHY ORTHODOX LANDYOU SHOULD PLAY CK2
Yes. Just yes.
AwesomeI recommend playing it with all DLC.
This game whilst having one of the steepest learning curves I have come acroos has given me hours of fun. The depth the developers went to recreate as close to an historical starting point and then give you free reign over a dynasty whether it be the King of England the holy roman emperor or just some lowly count in the middle of nowhere. Its all the the court gossip and conspiricies killing your second cousin off as it will put you grandson in line for the duchy in 40 years time when you die and your son dies. All for nothing as you die and then so does your grandson in a crazy attempt at showing how brave he was and climbing a tower. If you like game of thrones you will love this game and that is just the vanilla getting the old gods expansion and the legacy of rome expansion could be seen as a must if you want to play as pagans and start early or build a standing army made up of retinues. And then theres the mods. There is so much to do in this game its amazing.
Wonderful gamewith immense detail and endless replayability. It never gets tiringand is worth the price
great game
Great game!
My spymaster dicovered a plot where he wanted to kill himself. 11/10
This game is so awsome this review ins't enough! The game is perfect in every way and i would not do one thing to change it! I highly recommend this game for people who are addicted to strategy and sandbox type games this game will get you your fix!
Similar-yet-different from other Paradox Interactive strategy games. In this oneyou control a royal bloodline rather than a nationwhich adds all kinds of interesting intrigue and goals. The Old Gods DLC also lets you play as Norse vikings and raid villages
Best Strategy &amp Alternate History game NA. 10/10 would assassinate heir again.
My 3rd son became possesed by the devil at the young age of 3 and got himself a witch babysitter. At age 5 he killed his older brother. At age 18 he became countand quickly decided to attempt to murder his father. Failed twicewas imprisoned twice and houdini-escaped twice. At age 20 he sucedeed in killing his father
Great game0/10. Loaded with all kinds of unexpected humor while maintaining a very serious and straightforward diplomacy and politics system. A little challenging to pick up at first I'm almost a hundred hours in and there's still new things I'm discovering how to do. Definitely worth trying at the very least.
Blending StrategyRole-PlayingSimulation and Medieval History
Enormously immersive Macro-RTS with pause that ate away the hours. Still playing ages post release.
CK2 is probably one of the most interesting games I've ever played. There's not a lot of actionbut it's intense as you decide whether to assassinate a political opponent or review the pros and cons of an arranged marriage. The game has a bit of a learning curvebut I think it's easy to pick up relative to the other Paradox games.  10/10. This is one of my favorite games of all time.
There seems to be no way to load a saved game.
It's like crack.
HE DIDN'T RULE SO GOOD
hours of dynastical pleasure
Crusader Kings II ishands downone of the ultimate strategy experiences to be had. Not only is the game utterly polished and every mechanic seamlessly integrated
It's not just that Crusader Kings II is my favorite game of the last two yearsor even that it's many expansions have together eaten up more of my time than any other game I currently own. It's also thatwhen it comes to the style of game
STEEEEEEEP learning curve. (very steep) Howeverif you are patient enough to learn the game it is honestly a GoTY candidate. I have a fair few hours logged (almost 700 atm) and it is still new everytime. Do yourself a favor and get this game but not just for you for a friend as well that way you can work through the learning process alongside another point of view.
A great game utilizing 'the most powerful graphic processor' - your imagination. Solid improvement over CK1 by one of the very few PC-paladins of the game industry - Paradox.  Not too complexsometimes a bit ridicullousbut overall very engaging for all history-lovers and armchair generals.  Caution: very time-consuming
This game is Unique Among Strategy games. Mostly because you play as people rather then nations. This is fun as it gives you some cool characters but it has a side effect. The side effect is that its very easy to lose and in fact can be quite hard.  In fact I would say this is one of the hardest games I have played. Sometimes the game just kills you and there isnt any way with all your skill you could get out of it. This is a negative part of the game for me. As much as this is most likely real to life it makes a rather lame game experience. Despite this I do think its a good game. I have walked away and come back to this game a few times. I think I love to hate this game. part of me loves the experience but sometimes when it decides its time to take away everything i worked for well. Just like life we hate that experience and maybe its a bit to fragile experience for a 'game'.
This is a great game as it provides great grand srategy without completly overwhemling you.
This comes hardas I love this game so muchbut at this point with the current 'updates and fixes' the game is nearly broken. In single player almost any small player (county or dutchy) near a muslim AI is pounced upon. Also
I recommend this game for all those loving in-depth global strategies. Every minor tweak can be crucial for the success of the dynasty in the nearer future or generations later. Gamers loving history will also find this game very alluring. Paradox also keep Crusader Kings II updated and issue new DLCs regularily. It is one of my favourite games ever. And the only game I never delete from my PC.
Love it!. Best Game Ever!. If you like to RP and you would like to face historic figuresplay this game 10/10.
If you like war stradegy game and also like Being sneaky and decietfull then this game rocks. You can take over countries without even swinging a sword or you can go into all out war.
Excelent game. I merge two full days in it!! Only need a campaing mode or something. Buy it if you love strategy games! And is penguim friendly. :D
You can blind your sonand put him in prison ... and your entitled little fuck of a daughter and can married away to whatever bum you see fit.  WILL PLAY AGAIN.
Really the first and only Grand Strategy type of game I've ever seriously been able to get into. It's full of intriguefamily dramapolitics
if you love grand strategythen you'll love this!
A wonderfully in-depth mix of RPGstrategy and history. Start with a chosen characterfrom the lowliest count to the most powerful emperor and choose a time in history from the Dark Ages to Medieval
A vassal plotted against me. I had him executedand I forced his daughter to become my wife.  10/10 would execute again.
PLAY THIS GAME. PLay a characterdo anything to become king or stay in power. The narrative of this game is incredibleyou could play it and then write a book detailing your experiences. In a game of CK2 i have been known to have control of a character with amazing stats known as the 'spawn of the devil' who believes he can converse directly with God and recieves battlefield advice from Jesus. He married 3 witches off to his sons
Excellent Game. Well worth the money
Fantastic game with deep intrigue levels
This game isquite possiblythe best product that Paradox has put out. If you are looking for a rock 'em sock 'em action game
Play it. That is all.
Incest and murder simulator of the decade.
Maybe the best strategy game I've ever played. Lots of depth emerges from simple (if somewhat opaque) mechanics.
You can kill your family and torture prisoners!!!!!!! whats not to love? :)
Gotta saythis game is amazing. If you need more convincingread up on this. It's fucking hilarious.  http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?736028-From-Holy-Kingdom-to-Unholy-nightmare-Why-this-is-the-best-DLC-yet&amps=f9f354dcb97b5646dd055bc75f816daf
Simply amazing. The 'vanilla' game is fantasticimmersive and beautiful by itself (new content is added constantly)but the DLCs add real depth
Great game for anyone who likes Europe in Dark ages.
CK2 has a massive learning curve and a very unique playstyle. You can play as just about any historical noble from a mayor to a Popeand your job is to expand your lot in life while managing your court and lineagea la Game of Thrones. Let me paint you a picture:  You're eyeing a neighboring county
A steep learning curve but quite alot of fun once you have the hang of it.
It would be amazing...if it did not break after a while from the beginning i loved this game and played it alotbut unfortunately it became increasingly unstable until it just became unplayablenow i cannot get past the initial loading screen  Amazing Game
Would you like to be a cat in charge of your own Kingdom of Cats? Well this game is for you.
Was a Dukebecame Emperormarried my brothers daughters
I would give this game a 75 out of 100. I like the concept of CK2 very much. The game had a steep learning curve for me but maybe that was because it's the 1st Paradox game I've ever played and I'm not familiar with their interface. I got bored with it before I had spent enough hours to sit and learn the games concepts and to fully enjoy it.
One of the most enjoyable games i have played. you effectively have to play as a dynasty and be as successful as possiblestart as a emperor or a lord or anything in between and murder and usurp your way up the lordshipsdukeships and thrones and create huge empires through conquest. BRILLIANT mods avaliable for various fantasy settings
High learning curve but if you get past that it is a great paradox map staring game
great game but you NEED the dlc's :(
When you realize that you're engaged to this game probably a month has passed away. Pretty cool game. Just go and make your dinasty grow.  8/10
So as you can probably tell I am a bit devoted to the game...my wife will tell you she's spent many a night alone in bed while I stayed up playing this little monster. I enjoy that I can start different gamesbuild different empirescheat when I want and just the overall feel of the game. If I had a wish list though
Pretty good gamethere is a steep learnig curve but if you start out as a county in Ireland you should be able to learn the basics and move forward.
fucking best game all time.
Overall opinion: Great game once you get into ithowever the learning curve is steep and tutorials minimal. Would definitely recommend it for anyone interested in these types of games.  More detailed info that may or may not help in determining whether *you* would like this game:   1. This game is difficult to get into. There are in game tutorials that explain things briefly - but that's exactly what it isthey only explain things. There's no Age of Empires style 'Draw a box around your units
Pillagemurder and marry your way to success. Ahh love it!
Great game depicting the Medieval Era accurately.
Simply putthis game is a true masterpiece among masterpieces. Equally simply put: This game is one of the most difficult games to learn how to play. At the time of writing this reviewI had put 28 hours into the game but only a couple hours ago had I truly understood it. However
While I haven't delved as far into Crusader Kings II as I have Europa Universalis IVI can see that this is a fantastically made Grand Strategy gameand you get to play as individual kings.  Rajas of India recently expanded into India as well
My lusty queen cheated on meso I imprisoned herhad a b.a.s.t.a.r.d child with her sister
If you like strategy gamesthis is a great one.
One of my Favorite games. While playing the mongolian scenariothe Persian empire title disappeared and thus I am currently holding a temporary title. It sucked but I still love the game =)
This game is amazingI still haven't managed to completely win all of my goals in a playthrough.  Just for an example - my last king who I was banking on uniting Ireland ended up dying young and leaving only one heir. So now I am playing as my very young ward (and only child) who is under the loving care of a priest if I remember correctly.  Well he ended up developing the homosexual trait and then my entire bloodline was doomedunless I felt like playing one of the reject kids I married off to turkish infidels - ensuring they never return to bother me again. Man did that backfire.
This game is awesome buy it!!!
Great gamei love the challenges this game posseses. I have played more hours on this game than i can think of. One game worth buyingno matter the price
Frustratingly addictive. The DLCs are winners too.
I love grand strategy but this has alot more RPG elements to it where it's the best of both RTS and RPG worlds. Pick or make a ruler between 866 AD to 1466 AD in EuropeNorth Africa or Middle East and go to town with building a dynasty. Highly recommand if you want something thats historically accuate. I for one love my Kingdom of Ireland then invade Scotland and England to create the Empire of Britanna all based out of Dublin.
Medieval Inbred Child Murder Simulator II is the best game I have played in years. This is strat/sim/4x crack. There is a huge-ish learning curvebut the game mechanics can be picked up quickly as you play (although it helps to have ranks in knowledge geography/history/nobility/royalty) and the payoff is huge. This game has more intriguediplomacy/politics and strategy than most strategy games and more roleplaying than most RPGs. Get it and be the scheming fuck you always wanted to be.
great game!!!
Would buy just for a game of thrones mod
Forget the empty threats and sabre-rattling of the modern eraand start practicing diplomacy the fun way!   Who needs gunboats when a single knife will do the job just as efficiently? Why bother with sister cities when you can make them your sister-in-law?   Politics has become quite the boring spectator sport nowadays. Isn't it more fun clawingstabbing
Paradox is one of my favorite developers. I've been playing all their gamessuch as Europa &amp Victoria. This game is unique. It isn't your typical strategy game. Don't expect to enter the game and start expanding. Expansion/Imperialism isn't favored nor promoted in this game like all other strategy games. It encompasses Europe around the 1060s. This is a Social-Political-Religious game. With social classes you can be a lowly count to a high king. The warefare is similar to all of Paradox's warfaresimplistic yet entertaining. I rarely purchase games
WARNING - This game creates deadly addiction. You start up as a young (or not so young) lordfull of hope and dreams. Ready to shape your realm into a place where everybody can live happily. Then your wife kills youyour son is an imbecile
I am still having trouble opening up the DLC on my Mac after buying it.
With the Game of Thrones mod this is pure awesomeness!
OMG INTRIGES EVERYWHERE! Never...EVER trust your brother-in-law. Kill your firstborn son! Imprison your whole family! Absolutely no problem to sleep with your daughter-in-law. Great game.
Good gamevery easy going and fun to play. My only issue is the amount of pointless DLCfor example the unit
King of Denmark made my daughters his concubines44844
Great game and have much fun with it. !BUT! do yourself a favor and dont buy it over steam. 40 wtf? You can get it elsewhere for 10 bucks boxed. Id only recommend buying it over steam if its badly reduced.  greetings
fuck your own family members for maximum royalty points
Byzantine Iceland. 20/10.
Perhaps one of the best games i have ever played. Crusader Kings II offers an enticing experience of medevial life as the upper echelon of societyincluding all the intrigue and plots of the royalityand the ability to perfectly blend simulation
5/5  The most polishedelegant and skillfully executed of the Paradox historical series. Dozens of strategy layers creates a complex engaging challengeeasily accessible through its interface. And there's still plenty of potential for expansion. What might come next? Playable Republics?
Great base game with a bunch of good mods
One of the best Grand Strategy games ever made.
Great strategy game and a good one to start with in the paradox interactive grand strategies
Recomendedthe best game i've ever hadit suits my imagination . As a character in this game
Purchase CK2 if you like Song of Ice and Flame franchisethe politics part in particular. Or if you would want to dive into the Middle Age game setting. Or to develop your character as a really cruel ruler. Or a people-loving monarch. These are the examplesthe possibilities are endless.  But remember that everything in this game has its cost raised high
One of those most amazing games I have ever played. Sucks you in and takes over your life! Awesome!!!!
For the first few hours of this game I honestly thought I would never figure out how it worked. When they say grand strategy they really do mean grandbut that complexity is just what ends up making it great. Its one of those games where once you finally get into the swing of things you think you might play a couple hoursand then suddenly realize the sun has come up for the second time and it may possibly be a good idea to sleep or let your boss know you didnt die and do in fact plan to return to work. This genre isn't exactly for everyone
Without a single doubtCrusader Kings 2 is probably the greatest Strategy/RPG out therethe story progression is deep and immersive
the first game i have ever played where I was psyched I planned a marriage between my daughter and the High King of the North
Best Middle Ages Lineage Simulator on the Market
Very fun gamenot Paradox's slowest (which is saying something)just takes a bit of learning to get into. Definitely recommend for anyone not looking for a high-octane experience.
Such a time devouring game. I love it!
You either love it or hate it. I love it. Not for casual gamers.
This game is the grandest grand strategy I have ever had the pleasure to play. It seems very imposing at firstbut the very well done tutorials allow you to learn the game with relative ease. I recomend buying the 'Ruler Designer' DLC as wellso you can customise your starting character.  Great fun
Ive plotted to assassinate my own daughterand succeededive executed arabian princesses for the craic
It's a great game but it takes a while to get into it and to learn all the things you can do. Once there tohugh its highly addictive and the DLC's just add to the fun you can have.
Top game. You can make your royal family completely inbredand execute babies. You are Kingyou can do these things! ...That isn't the game's highlight though. Did I mention that there is a Game of Thrones mod for it? Well yeah
For those who are interested in the 'strategy' of strategy gamingCKII and other Paradox titles such as Europa Universalis and Victoria provide perhaps some of the most in-dept gameplay available on PC. These games aren't for everyone they have a steep learning curve generally and there is a lot of stuff to remember and the game at times can be unforgiving and doesn't hold your hand throughout. CKII in particular is a Medieval strategy and simulation where while it is a real time strategy game it is also a RPG in the sense that you choose not so much a particular nation like you would in other titles but instead an individual and his/her dynasty and you progress through the game as descendents of the character you choosethe management of securing and heir and thus continuing your game is but one of the many features of this fantastic game. 9/10
It is a good game. Very hadr and complicated but fun.
Not a game for the feint hearteda world of endless possabilities and gameplaystarting off as your character of choice you can set your own goal build a kingdom
Great game that lets you be whoever you want throughout an alternate version of history that you shape as you play the game.
Immerse yourself in the politics of Medieval Europe filled with warreligionpillage and murder.  An excellent game.
I absolutely LOVE this game.
This is the perfect video game for anyone who's watched too much Game of Thrones and now dreams of being a tyrannical feudal overlord.
One of the best family simulations out therewhere u can openly butcher your wifekids
It is unreal how compelling it is to assassinate the drunken midget of a son who betrayed you and stole your land.
Why can't I stop?    help pls..
Don't be put off by the seemingly endless options and actions. Just pick a county and start playing. It's not a game where you win by taking over the whole known worldalthough you can play it like thatit's a game where just the act of playing makes you a winner
This game is amazgin for anyboy who loves historyand the ability to re-write it to your own likeing every single game if you so choose. Its very easy to just start playing the game and lose almost 8 hours in it not even noticing what your doing. Wish my computer could run it better than it doesbut i still love every minute of playing this game
Amazing game very fun and veryvery imersive. So many ways to play its crazy and soo many options. Well worth the money because its replayability is insane.
This game is easily the greatest medieval simulator currently available. Spanning almost half a millenium and with a varied and dynamic gameplay experienceno two games will ever turn out the sameand the possibilities are endless. Conquer France as Ireland? You can do that. Reestablish the glory of Rome? Do that with the Legacy of Rome expansion. Strike terror into the hearts of all mankind as the count of Yorkshire? Well
Summary: it's like Game of Thrones the Video Game. Have you ever fantasized that you're part of a familial political rivalry between your brothersyour cousinsand the kingdom next door? This is for you. Do you like alternate history and imagine scenarios in which the Karen-Pahlevi retook Persia from the Saffarid/Samanid/Abassid dynasties? This is for you.  It's really good. Go play it.  Also recommended: Europa Universalis 4
Mudered my children repeatedly 10/10
A game for brilliant strategists 9/10
Its a Masterpiece
I will never be good at this game. Brilliant!
One of my Facourite Strategy Games
Deeply satisfying strategy games that's far more accessible than it would have you believe. Working your way from Earl to Emperor is an experience I would recommend to any strategy fan.
Hells yea
bought this + the old gods DLC after watching NorthernlionMarthas and Arumba do their CK2 videos... fell in love instantlyim a HUGE RTS fan
After nearly 500 hours in-game I can say: It's quite alright.
Just buy this game
Probably the most intuitive strategy game out on the market. It does get some getting used to... but that is only because the market is flooded with quickfeed your 1-2hr need and get outtype of games. I'm now in the 200+hr of this game and its update where your country can feed into Europa Unversalis IV is amazing!  Highly recommend but only if you're willing to play and learn. Very player immersive.
World's #1 child murdering simulator
Wow! Just when you think your dynesty is secure its probably not. Solution? Off with her head! Very addictive :)
It is extremely satisfying to successfully pull of a chain of plots in order to put oneself in the throne. And then it's a ton of fun to ensure that no one else tries to take it for himself.  Now if only I could get the hang of warfare...
a good game but im just not smart enough for it
My most played game on steam at moment!  5/5
Crusader KIngs 2 Review For this review I will using CS2 instead of Crusader Kings 2. This game is absoultly great. I would recomened this game to anyone. This game is so good that no matter how many times you play the game the way that the game plays will never be the same. Im on my 4th playthrough and there has no similartys at all. This game offer so much varity that you play as a KingChaplinDuke or even the a leader of a Republic. There are a few downsides to this game though  1) To learn the game if your a noob it will take a long time to master the game as its so large and thier are so many different to do. 2) The price also is an issue
someone please expalin this game to me
i wholeheartedly endorse the purchasing of this fine product
One of the best games to come out in years
Crusader Kings 2 is one of if not the best diplomatic medeival simulations ever made! If you enjoy a game that you don't have to wage war but focus on building your dynasty then this game is for you! GO BUY IT! That's all I can say.
Build castlesget titlesrule all the peasants of the medieval world.
Great game with hours of playability.
My favourite game I own
Better than EU3uses the same engine. I cannot not recommend getting all dl content. each of them will expand the gameplay a lot :) especially TOG wich moved the startdate backwards to 867 is awesome
love this game
Realize your dynastic ambitions through intriguewarfareand hilariously named relatives. In this game you want to play just one more turn
I enjoyed the Total War gamesbut Crusader Kings II is a different breed entirely. I'm not an expert on the Middle Ages (yet)but the game does an excellent job
Like Europa Universalis seriesbut better with a great political/dynasty aspect to it.   If you are into these sort of strategy gamesthis is the best so far by the Paradox team.
An interesting and entertaining strategy game where family and domestic intrigue is the main focus of the action. Kind of reminds me of the old Romance Of The Three Kingdoms Games. Combat is pretty abstractedbut I dig it. Game without DLC is just as good as well.
Crusader Kings II is great with all the expansion packs. You get to controll the path of a dynastyinstead of just a country. You can rise from a minor feudal count to Emperor of Romerestored to its former borders. It's not all wars with other nations you can marry your dynasty into power
its an awesome game that involves alot of thinking about how to gain power and to keep from other nations and people in your lands it is also always a good challenge to play and no two play throughs are alike even if you go back to a save 5 minutes before. overall this game in my opinion gets a 9/10
Stuff happens. And then the mongols come.
A great simulationstrategyand role-playing experience. Full of unique opportunities and stories.
How can one Dynastyone familyon person
An incredible gamefor sure. One of the most complex games I have ever playedas it makes other titles seems like those fuckfuck cubes toddlers play with. Once you spend a lot of time trying to understand the game and its mechanics
Ever... ...felt a 'killing' urge to assassinate your neighbour? ...wondered what witnessing your liege imprison and execute you would be like? ...had a need to see a mongol invasion army at your border? ...wanted to line your pockets with french gold and bed german lasses for the glory of Thor? ...found yourself thinking of how many dukes you can execute before your vassals call you a tyrant?   Well now you can find your answers! With your very own Machiavelli simulator of Crusader Kings II... Kill your brothersbed your daughtersand declare war on the infidel. Not recommended for children. Nothing says good MP like co-conspirators
I lost Normandy to my half-brotherhave fucks all over france that want me deadand a 20 yo king that sleeps with my 60+ mother. GG
This is a great game for anyone who loves stragey and RPGs.
This is one of the best games I have ever played. The end.
What can I say. I have put 176 hours so far in this game. What do you think?
Great game. Can be frustrating at times but in the end you're always left with a great story. Recently I played as Svithjod (Sweden) and united the kingdomconquered some of Holland and was ready to take a piece of Norway to be able to reform the norse faith and work towards the empire of Scandinavia. All of a suddenI died from old age. Now everyone hates me and they form factions and my kingdom is splintered by civil war. Then I die again to assassination. Now my land is strewn across my two uncles and everyone wants to depose me. I call in my allies
This game has a huge learning curve to start but is worthwhile persevering through. The level of depth and character development for your rulers allows you to forge a dynasty through the ages of your own making. Intrigue and plots abound in what I found to be a truly enthralling journey through the middle ages.  The expansions and mods currently available and the mods being developed will ensure this game has lots of longevity too should you tire of the vanilla campaign. I would guide your attention to the excellent Game of Thrones mod available for free as a starter for 10creates the atmosphere of the tv series and books perfectly but allows you to play as any of the the Kings or Lords (including minor ones) and forge your own story within that world.  Highly recommended
Great fun ! Worth every coin !
This iswithout a doubtone of the most fun games I have ever played.  If you like the Total War games
Great gamea must buy. Nothing like playing a lowly count and then becoming the emperor of xonly to sire a demon possed child that ruins hours of carefull planning. 10/10
Took a little while to learn but well worth it. You'll be poring over genealogical charts and court rosters for hours. One of the hardest lessons was to unlearn what other video games taught. If something goes wrong in CKII just roll with it and see what happens. Marry off the wrong heirtrust the wrong allypick the wrong skirmish and your kingly crown will be replaced by whatever lowly earls wear. 30 hours of planning and executing set back to 0 and it's up to you to climb that mountain again.
Takes a bit to really understand and get into. Once you do thoughit makes a pretty engrossing game
Where can I start on this game.  This is strategy at its bestand will see you fail and fail until you learn from your mistakesand that is a good thing. You are constantly learning about the game and little strategy's to get better at it
I thought I was a good person...
I inherited the throne from my father after the war of succesion killed all the my older siblings. The war dragged on for several yearsso much blood. My sister was taken from our kingdomkidnapped by the Tengri Hordes that charged into Europe
You will put tons of hours into this game
You see that 'Add To Cart' button? Press it now.
Great gameso much fun!
Amazing gamehas the best replayability of anything I've ever played. It takes hours and hours to understandbut is well worth it!
I very much enjoy playing this RTS/Strategy game. To this dayI'm still addicted to the conquest of Europeand love the celtic Norse :)
If you have any interest in medival europe and enjoy strategy games then get this game!!!
I absolutely love this game. This game has endless replayability. This game reminds me of Sims in the way that I just start games to start themI have about 5 or 6 games in progress at one time and swap between them occasionally during one play stretch. If you like medieval europestrategy
This is my favourite strategy game ever.
One of the best strategic games I have ever played. Simply breath taking. When used with the modsit is just one of those games that makes you forget what day it is.
Tough to get in tothe menus can be confusing when you start to play this game. But once you're inthis game sucks you in like a tripple cunted hooker.
This game makes Civ look simple. Plus you can scheme to murder your friends and family
I my self have been playing CK2 all day since I got it on Friday.Its already amounted to 15 hours+ when I get on after I write this :P.Its one of the best Paradox games ive played.
Little hard to grasp but a decent game. Play as France and conquer the world or be Austria and just deal with fighting off rebels! 7.50/10
A grand strategy set in Medieval Europe. Highly recommended.
Good one from Paradox and it can link with EU4
love the focus on individuals
A friend got this game for me. I initally wasn't too crazy about itbecause I wasn't really into this genre of gaming. I will say thoughafter some time
i know there is a great game here but i am struggling to find the time to learn it.
This game has a steep learning curve and is very complex compared to most other strategy games out there. But once you look over wikisthe Paradox Interactive forums and other tutorials you can probably start to get the hang of this game after a few hours of playand quickly get better at it from there. Buy this game if you like strategy games like Civilization - you won't regret it.
By far the best historical game I've ever played. Countless possibilities and senarios to experience. After 100+ hours playing this gameI'm still figuring out new strategies to bring glory to my dynasty. It will take quite a bit of time to learn the mechanics of the game and even more hours before you understand how to acquire power and keep it. Crusader Kings 2 could possibly be one of the most rewarding games you will ever play if you are willing to dedicate some serious hours (easily 100+ hours per game depending on starting date). Oh and did I mention that you will be learning about Feudal Europe and some key historical events &amp figures in the process?!
Yeah its alright
A dynastic simulation of nobility in the middle agesCrusader Kings 2 is oddly compelling. Definitely not for the impatient or the understimulatedCrusader Kings is like chess
Great great game that you could spend hoursif not years playing :3
Complexbut a lot of fun
This game. Buy it. With your money.
Fantastic game! :)
Great grandstratagy game with alot of depth and intrigue
I've got something like 940 hours checked into this game. It's easily paid for itself and far far more in that time spaneasily worth the purchasewas worth the purchase at release
Get this game!! It is one of my favorite games of all time.
Game is rather funbut at a steep learning curve. As with most (if not all) of paradox gamesthis one in particular took me about a day to learn how to play it properly and I still have more to learn.
Definitely the most complex strategy game I've player or would care to play. If strategy is your thing and you really like punishing yourself with a learning curve from hellgo for it.
GREAT GAME I just got it on the 30 of november and have played like 36 hours
i have spent way too much time playing this. what am i doing with my life?
This game is great. Hard to learn mechanicsbut once learned you will have lot of fun with your medieval character. Sometimes it's more RPG than classic paradox grand strategycause you really need to care about your character. DLCs are also very good
I'll keep it simple: you can have a wildly different experience each of your first 10 play-throughs. It's nuancedit's balancedit's challenging
Eugenics can be fun for the whole family! Provided they make the cut that is.  Troublesome views of genetics asideCrusader Kings 2 is a great game. This is provided your a patient gamerwilling to plot and wait for things to be set in motion. It can be a thoroughly rewarding game that takes a dynastic spin on grand strategy games. You take the role of the head of a family
You need spreadsheets and autism to play this game. 10/10 would play as Poland again
Greatest medieval grand strategy game of all time!
This game is incredible. The amount of depth and features has you still discovering things after 200 hourslike I am. It can seem overwhelming at firstbut once you get into the swing of things it just becomes addictive. Paradox also have plans for another years worth of content
Genius game with a real connection to history. Games like civ feel like monopoly after this.
I believe this to be one of the greatest game ever created if you enjoy playing Hardcore strategy games.   You should def. buy it if you are looking for countless hrs of nonestop playing but be warnedIts hard as hell at first. You will spend hours and hours pulling your hair not know what to do but at the endworth it. Enjoy it.
Utterly amazing if you have any passing interest in strategyhistory or psychopathic behavior. Also great support and modding communityand constant updates that add free content. Most DLC are cosmetic.
One of the Best Medieval Simulations EVER and its a hell of alot of fun.
Crusader Kings II is EPIC. Think Game of Thrones meets Civilization. You are the head of your dynasty and the goal is to keep that dynasty going through any means necessary. Plottingbackstabbingand treachery are just the beginning. War becomes almost an afterthought. If you like Grand Strategy
Possibly the best of the Paradox historical sims. Comparatively easy to get into as wellalthough the complexities of medieval law will confuse most at first in regards to inheritance of titlesclaimants
A nice change of pace. More role playing elements involved in comparison to other strategy games. Build a family dynastyguide it through the agesgrant land titles
Definitely a nine out of ten and it is only not a 10 out of 10 because I don't want them to stop working on it. A steep learning curve but once you have got past that you learn the intricate bits along the way! A good beginners starting point is Herefordshire in 1067 because Williamyour good ole' pal gives you a few titles extra. Very much a recommended purchase!
Steep learning curve but well worth it.
Download and try the Game of Thrones mod!
If I was only able to play one game for the rest of my life it would be this game.    One of the drawbacks of grand strategy games is that they have the tendency to feel mechanical and isolated. CK2 is one of the few games in this genre that does not suffer from this problem. Its RPG elements put a human quality to the game. You have a character you choose a wifeyou have kids and you raise them up. Instead of staring at numbers or faceless hordes of identical troops you are dealing with family members and rivals who have a face and a name. That being said the game still includes a heavy elements of classic grand strategy. You can conquer the worldand become the biggest empire. The diference in this game instead of being loyal to a country you are loyal to a dynasty and a family. Your motivation is not nationalistic conquest but to secure your dynasty in the world. This mixture of elements makes for an addicting experience and one that is unique on every playthrough.
This game is great if you are into slow moving high stress and confusing as hell vidieo games. Good luck for anyone who buys or bought this.
Sothis game has been fantastic so far and it is still pleasing to play. Although there is one problem. The MASSIVE amount of DLC this game has. Yeah I know that most of it is songs but this is just borderline micro-transactions. Still a great game don't get me wrong but it is just annoying to spend so much money and then have another DLC come out.
One of the best strategy games you will ever purchase. An immersive game that drags you in and won't let you go anytime soon. Take your family to the height of power and then watch it crumble like a playing card tower under the rule of your legitimized born out of wedlock son after his brothers were murdered by your scheming lover.
By far the most intuitive and fun paradox title for my money.
Incredibly complexwholly life-consuming and wickedly distracting but first and foremost an excellentexcellent game.
Best historically-based strategy game I knowand the most unique. Nothing matches this for depthdetail
this game is a very good dynasty simulator and also gives that good feel of the medieval era and with all the dlc you can play as either a christian player a muslim or even a norse pagan who can raid the coast of europe but overall with all the dlc's and the base game its self i would say that this is a very good game but i will say that you must have patience if this is your first paradox interactive game becuase the first is always the hardest so it takes some time getting used to it but once you do man you feel like you have mastered a complex game as with any paradox game that is
Not Complex. Super shallow gameplay...
Wow. Huge learning curveor maybe I've just gone half-wit from playing too much dumbed down MMO Star Wars. Jumping right in without doing tutorials was a time sinkbut after failing abysmally for three or four games and several hours I started to get the hang of the game. There is a lot going on
Crusader Kings II is a different kind of grand strategy game for most people who play grand strategy games and strategy games in general. The goal of the game is not to make yourself Emperor of all of EuropeNorth Africathe Middle East
the greatest grand strategy of all time!
In response to the criticisms that many people have concerning broken mechanics and others similar to 'It not about war enough'I think you are missing the point.  This is not a medival warfare simluation game. Nor is it ment to be a walk in the park. This is a feudal system simulator focusing on a dynasty. It is built in a manner such to recreat historical events with unique cultural flavors. It is filled with actual choices that monarchs of medival Europe would have had to make.   Yesthere are somethings that aren't as ironed out as they hsould be. However
10 out of 10best baby killing simulator i have ever seen/played. Love killing babies with a pillow during the night? Buy this game.
If you love Strategy/Simulation gamesthis is for you. I purchased this game less than 72 hours agoand in that time I have played 38 active hours of this game. The Game is immersive
One of the most fleshed out grand strategy games you will play. Well worth getting through the learning curve. Whether it is conquering your foes with all your might or subduing them with your wit and cunningthis game has it. Amazing modding scene to boot. Get ready to get lost in the treacherous courts of Middle Ages.
This game man....Its awesome because of   A: You can create your own empire by rising through the ranks of a kingdom you serve from a lowly count to the nest HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR HIMSELF!  B: Liecheat and steal from other kingdoms and enemy lords (as well as allies) to achieve your goals!   C: Send you daugthers away to foreign lands to prevent wars and improve relations and choose wisely who'll be your successor!  ( Only strongs kings can keep kingdoms together...even if it means through bloodshed)
Its a history lesson that you can change! With all the intrigue of Game of Thrones (and there's a mod for it)

LIKE CRUSADES? HATE CRUSADES? AMBIVALENT ABOUT CRUSADES BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN INDIA?  Welcome to CKIIthe kerbal space program of indo-european medieval history/geography. You're probably going to spend the same time learning as playingso buckle the fuck up
It's like playing Game of Thrones. Also you can murder kids if you feel like it.
Highly Addictive!
Assassinated for being a gay midget with a lisptotally worth the price of admission just for that alone.
Crusader Kings II is one of my favourite games ever. I have been able to dig well over a hundred hours playing this game and I still find new and interesting ways to play it. I would advise it to anybody who likes world conquest and strategy games.
DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! It will ruin every other game you have. I don't play them anymoreas this is the bestmost in-depth game I've ever played.
BEST GAME EVER!!! At least to me. First game in my life that I own EVERY DLC to... DO NOT PLAY if you have a addiction issues....
Married my Auntfell in love with a dude and killed myself in a satanic ritual. 10/10 would play again
If you like Grand Strategy gamesthen this game is a no brainer impulse buy. If not then its a great introduction for Grand Strategys as its the best on the market!  I tend to play as the King of Castille (Northern Spain) with the ambition to take over Spain and Portugalin his life style and build a backbone for my heirs so they can attempt to conquer France.  But there are many variables which can set you back (which is a GOOD thing as it makes things more interesting) for example
A great game if you are trying to make sophomore year last two years.
Addictive. Awesome Mods!
Stared at a map for ten hoursmurdered two of my sons. GOTY
650+ hours played and still finding new ways to enjoy the gamelots of great modsa good dev team that fairly quickly corrects bugs. The only down side I can think of is the long/high learning curve.
Dynastic World Domination
It's like I'm really an English noble from back when that meant anything
Paradox always makes the best strategy games.
Crusader Kings II left me baffled and stupefied for the first half hour but after I figured out the basics the game became addictive. There is a limitless supply of plots to makeLords to usurpand troublesome vassals to get rid of.
In general it's controling you family and when you manage that (kill of unnecesary heirs and all) you try to control as much land as possible. That goes pretty well when you have a long reign and a lot of respecthowever it can all turn around when you die from a depression let's say and you vassels get cocky and try to be independant.   Of course the gameplay in the expansions is a lot differentespecially the patricians families are a welcome variation on the theme. This game doesn't has pretty graphics
Awesomeness!! Just that this game heats up my imac fast! Haha!
I have never seen such a detailed gamewhere the smallest things can influence the course of your character's life.   A must have for lovers of strategy and/or history.
Honestly a fantastic game if you like strategy. And by godis this strategy.  You play the game through the perspective of the head of your familyor 'Dynasty'
This game is excellent. It may take a while to get used tothoughbecause you have to readjust how you think about playing a simulation like this. Instead of playing a country
Awesome gameentertaining for hours and hours. Plenty of depthrealism and also the chance to change history!
If you enjoy hordes of IslamicMongolian and Viking warriors that suffer zero attrition showing up whenever they want anywhere in Europe or the Middle East to fuck your fuck upthis game is for you. And if you don't? This game is also for you.
Baby smothering simulator of the year!
A great gamewhich although is not as military based as Total War - requires a lot of strategic thinking to succeed in the game. The political intrigue is great.
A great strategy game that you can spend literally many days playing. A lot of contentand you really get that 'just one more turn'-feeling. But since there are no turns in this gameyou just keep playing indefinitely. Can't stop!
This game is Funtastic :D
Once you play thisyou'll have trouble getting back into Civilization! This one takes the cake for strategy/take over the map type games!
MOAR MERCS else it is pretty good. Some bugs on start up but restart always fix it. 8/10
I've been playing this game for over a year now and it's basically supplanted everything else - even Europa Universalis IVby the same developers (Paradox Development Studiosseriously
Just do it!!!

After almost 700 hour of game playI can tell you this game is worth every hour I played. This game is easily one of the most complex games I have ever played. There are many games out there that deliver a similar experinecebut none approach this game in quality

was funonly needs a hitler option
Paradox is really moving genre forward. This is not 24*7 gamebut it easily could steal around 5 hours a day from you. This game is HARDhave uniq features and enjoyable.
The best game in the last 3 years for me...truly
It provides is a wholly unique perspective and set of objectives to build a sandbox strategy game around. Use this to get started:  http://lparchive.org/Crusader-Kings-2/
my incest gave birth to the pope and the holy roman emperor
Paradox has outdone itself by leaps and bounds!!! I highly reccomend this game to any strategy fanand any Paradox fan!!! The visualsthe gameplay (allthough learning curve is steep)
Truly phenomenal game!
Stabbing: The Game.
Best tatical and strategy game iv'e played since just before lunchtimeround about 1156..............AD.
Once you get your head around the different but parallel game mechanics you realise that Crusader Kings 2 is far simpler than first contact with the game would have you believe. This is no bad thinghoweveras the wide range of goings on make for a very busy game and the bigger your empire gets the more you have to watch your back.  Thoroughly enjoyable - I dumped over 200 hours into it over the first couple of months of ownership.
You marry your aunts and kill your brothers.
love the complexity
Perfect game
Fantastic feudal intrigue simulatordon't be discouraged by the interfaceit's quite easy to learn
I cannot stop playing this gamefor it's one of the most refined blends of RPG and strategy I've ever been able to play. The strategy elements are interestingbut what truly makes Crusader Kings II unique is how it features characters that are
Loved the gamevery intense and in-depth.
One of if not only best medieval dynastic survival game ever. kill everything your wife your kids and your family. Its a ton of fun.
I bought the 'republic DLC' something just so I can 'castrate' filthy peasents...DAT IMMERSION..its like im really in the medievals !
This is basically a dark ages back stabbing simulator. The basic game starts in 1066 and runs upto somewhere in the 1400s I think. You select a country and play as it's ruler. You'll try sort out taxes and the like whilst trying to keep your underlings and allies friendly with you all whilst trying to expand your empire. The Game of Thrones mod is rather good too.
a very good game
One of the most complex strategy games that I have tried to date. This game is mainly about trying to expand your realm through various methodsincluding killing off useless heirs to prevent them from succeeding you and keeping your vassals happy by rewarding them with delicious lands. You will want to watch some video tutorials online before startingbecause till now
NO THE COOK IS NOT THE EMPEROR JESUS CHRIST
one of the most addictive strategy games i have ever played
A slow paced epic strategy game set in a time where arranged marriages and dynastic planning were as dangerous to your neighbours as standing armies.  You will not be able to steamroll conquor the worldwars are fought over claims which you either inherit or fabricate.  Personally i have spent almost 300 hours in this game and have enjoyed every one of them. There is no way of winning. Either your dynasty dies out (and often it will)you get so powerfull it becomes pointless to keep playing
Dear sweet Jesus this is fun
A surprisingly good and deep strategy game that I almost wrote off due to the complexity.  You play as one of many nations in Europe vying for land and supremacy. There are many ways to get landwhether it be claim forgery and then conquering the landor through marriage where your descendant will inherit the land. From a single country you could gain a few more counties to form a duchy. Conquer a few more duchies and you could form a country. Conquer a few more land and you could form an empire. All the while you try to manage politics to ensure a stable succession to your descendants
What can I say about this game that hasn't already been said? It's powerfuldynamicemersive
[the most] unexpected fun in a video game since euro truck sim' -david lee roth
Great gamelots of replay value.
THE SECOND BEST GAME EVER! BUY IT OR GOTO HELL!
WellI'll be damned: Paradox actually did everything right this time!  Contrary to their previous gamesCrusader Kings 2 was not released as an empty shell (Europa Universalis 3) or in a completely broken
Get it not just the actual gameplay but for the user created content such as Elder KingsGame of Thrones etc. just to name a few total conversion. Once you get over the learning curvehours of immersive gameplay are guaranteed.
fuck DUNSLIEB  LONG LIVE KING CU' ULAD OF THE FREE REPUBLIC OF ULSTERfuck THE POPEfuck ANDORRA AND fuck EVERYONE WHO DIDN'T WANT TO HELP ME KILL DUNSLIEB
A great game. Even better with friends.
I've sunk many countless hours into this game. I originally bought it on a whim during a steam sale and after getting over the initial learning curve I found it to be one of the most unique and deep strategy games ever.
This game is my first paradox strategic game. The learning curve was pretty steepeven when you follow everything on the tutorialI had a hard time figuring everything out
fucksBoats and the Byzantinium Empire
Probably the best Medieval Random Crazy soap opra fuckt game of all time. There is so much crazy fuck that can happen in this gameyou have to use your mind to picture the most of it but this game is amazing0/10 would buy
If you enjoy historical strategy that focus on relationships between peopleyou will like this game.
You should spend all of your money on this game immediately.
Just look at the average play time of the people reviewing this game. It's a complexbeautifulimmersive
This game may seem like a RTS gamebut it's more of an RPG. You play as a dynastyall characters in your bloodline. The game can get really tense
Crusader Kings II is by far the most complex strategy game I ever played. All the time spent understanding paradox games is worthwhile. If you have patience to learn and love strategy games you should have this one.
Very in depth gamewell worth itbut be prepared to lose a few hours per game
Crusader Kings 2 is hard to describe. The game has trouble describing itself. It's too complex. Long story shortit's a Grand Strategy game set in medieval times. You can pick any rulerfrom a lowly count in Ireland to the mighty Holy Roman Emperor
Not for the average gamer by any means. CKII presents a daunting learning curve even for someone that considers themselves a veteran strategy player. This is really less a strategy game and more aptly described as a medieval nobility simulator. If you're as at home deciding on the finer details of your line of succession or the latest court intrigue as you are plotting to storm the neighboring county then you may just find yourself finding no other game out there that offers this depth.   For everyone elseyou may not survive the tutorial..
Great addicting game !

THIS GAME IS AMAZING! Steep learning curve but hundreds of hours of fun gameplay and part of the fun is just learning how to play.
A great game strategicfunny and brutal at times
My Viking warlord went into a fit of bloodlust during a boring meeting and ate part of the dining room tablethen slept with his sister.  Thisthe dignity of kings.
I never realised how fun murdering your children could be.
Great game with a ton of replayabilityhowever it does have a very steep learning curve to get into. Every time you play the game it plays out different.
Amazingin-depth game for players who like strategy gameswars every five minutes (If you have the Old Gods DLC)
Amazing game. From a singlular count to an entire Empire consisting of the British Islesthe Kingdom of BrittanyThe Duchy of Holland
Crusader Kings II is a fantastic game of murdermarriageand war. It can be hard for people new to Paradox games
Tactical and strategic over all a great game for history buffs and RPG masterminds. This game is dense and clearly prides itself on being historically acurate in terms of language and historical themes this is not a game for fans of fantasy or quick action slashkilland plunder types of gameplay. You must LOVE the patient cleverly stategic long drawn out-wit-them-all game aspect and be prepared to WORK at building your network of spies and allies and work extra hard at playing with or against your foes. Crusader Kings 2 is like a dressed up chess game where the ticking clock can either spell doom or success for your Empire with one move.
One of the best pc stratagy games I've ever played!
Another strategy game from Paradox which redefines the word Epic. This game is absolutely amazing. As a huge 4X fan I really appriciate the ways this game sets itself apart from any other in the genre. It's focus on diplomacyfamily intrigue and kingdom management is a great experience.
this is a game with alot of deaths.... its so sad..... ALL I WANT TO DO WAS ASSASSINATE YOUBUT NOOOOOOYOU JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT MY PLOT AND GO TO WAR WITH ME....but as i was winning I had to get ill and die AND JUST FROM THAT MY KINGDOM THAT I SLAVED OVER FOR YEARS WAS TORN IN HALF FROM THE INSIDE!!!! T_T
this game very fun to play
My favourite game of 2012 is a unique combination of court-life simulationgenetic breedingdiplomacy and strategy. Ignore the somewhat deterrent graphics and the steep learning curve and enjoy the best kingdom-tycoon game ever made.
everything i said about eu4 THIS GAME CAN BE CHALLENGING and often makes me rage but after you inherient all of euorpe you see it waas well worth it the only thing i dont like about this game is how it is hard to mod
Go to youtube and watch 'aruma' or 'shenryrr' and youll learn how to play this game quickly.
This is one of the best and most initially impenetrable games I've played in recent memory. It is a truly fantastic strategy game if you can push through the initially oddity of... welleverything. Just know that in order to become really good at this gameyou will find yourself making some really horrible choices. You will become the fuck that history requires you to be.
Like all Paradox titlesCrusader Kings 2 can come off pretty intimidating at first with the plethora of micromanagement options at your finger tips. It takes some getting to used to but when you finally get the hang of it you'll be pouring countless hours into this game. Combining in-depth political and military strategy with roleplaying elements on the mirco and macro levels creates an entirely unqiue and thrilling experience. If you're a history buffmedieval junkie
CR2 is the best strategy-RPG ever!
Assassinating wivesbrotherssisters
Highly indepth strategy gameexcellent dynasty simulator. The learning curve is longbut not steep. Towards the end of the curve
A deep strategy gamewith limitless possibilities of manupilating middle-age europe. Get prestige for your familylands and gold. And After Old Gods DLC
This is the best sandbox RPG disguised as a hard to learngraphically simpleand complex grand strategy game. Anyone who loves Civilization games should at least try this
GREAT game if you are into grandstrategy. This is quite different since you play as a dinastyinstead of a country.  If you are looking for depth strategy focused on 'social' more than warthis is what you are looking for.  Watchout tho
Incredibly deep strategy game that will eat away hours of time.
This is a fantastic game for any fan of Grand Strategyand Paradoxin general
amazingly fun but slow as hell
Very steep learning curvebut worth it!
My two cents - this game is oddly addictive. If you've played the Europa Universalis gamesyou should be able to drop right in. What makes this game unique is the family management. Think of it as a middle ground between Sims or Guild games and Total War titles. You don't feel silly trying to find a good wife for your heir - if she is celibate or hates youbad things happen. There is backstabbing
One of the most amazing Grand Strategy games I've ever playedif not the 'Grandest'. There are also several great mods for the game that either make special circumstances or completely overhaul the game to make it different. The only concerns I can think of is that you will have to sink some more money for all of the DLC to truly 'unlock' all of the aspects of the gameand that sometimes your kingdom can fall and your heirs die out in unexpected ways. Also you will probably need to spend several hours (like I did) learning all of the mechanics and playing around with starter kingdoms/duchies. (Just be sure to pick kingdoms and above for your first playthroughs
An incredibly fun Medieval-era strategy game that affords one endless hours of entertainment. The challenge of working your way up from count to kingor watching your empire fall apartor fighting off the Mongol invaders proves to be incredibly rewarding and fun.
This game is not for everyone but if you have a healthy interest in history or are hoping to get into grand strategy I would recommend this game as an ideal starting place
this game is by far one of the best i've ever played
Very Great Game
A really great game you can easily sink hundreds of hours of gameplay
PLayed 79 hours of it and it still good
I am a strategy fan ever since. This game is time consuming and complex. Once you discovered how the game mechanics work (it takes approx. 20 hours) you are ready to lead your dynasty into gloryor complete extinction. Once a son of mine tried to kill the first born who I trained to become the next leader of the realm. I put the evil son into jail. Unfortunatelymy first born died and the next heir was the guy in the prison! After 10 years rotting in a cell
Great game. If you like long drawn out strategy games then pick this up/
Very nice game where the subtleties of power and politics in the medieval era are depicted. Mostly family will be more important than crown in the game. Until you dieplay as the heir and everyone in the family fights for your titles that is. The combat takes some time getting used to and you cannot wage war because you what to.
If you like a complex ruling simulation and marrying relatives and underlings and graphics are not important to youthis may be an ideal game for you. It has huge replayability value and with the dlcs that change gamerules it is even more interesting. If you liked the first partyou will love this. I'd wish i had much more time to play this game...
Excellent grand strategy. Dynasty building and title claiming are cool features of this games. Highly recommended.
An incredibly immersive medieval experienceCrusader Kings 2 is brilliantly deep and compelling. The only possible downside is the learning curbwhich is somewhat deminished by tutorials
Any strategy fan should give this game a try. Its has a steep learning curve but a rewarding gameplay. Create your own narrative in this sandbox-esk gameset in medieval Europe or any other world with mods. Think of it like the Godfather in a medieval settingor the most accurate Game of Thrones style game you will ever play (speaking of which
Great game!
This game is basically a medieval soap opera/alternate history generation grand strategy simulation. Whereas most games have you play a nation and try to lead it to glorythis game is focused on the people onbehind
I just spent an evening trying to kill my wife. But that's okayshe was trying to kill my oldest son from a previous marriage so her son could inherit the throne.  This is a game of soap opera melodramabackstabbing
Once you nail down how to play this game correctlyit's one of the most detailedabsorbing games in a long time. Highly recommended to anyone interested in intrigue and diplomacy.
Endless replay value
I love this game. It's an interestingin-depth look at what could have been. Take control of a dynasty and ensure it's survival through over 400 yrs. Make sure to marry your children to powerful nobles and preferably nobles with positive traits. Any pretenders to your heirs can be shipped of to the monastery to ensure they don't meddle with his reign. It really is an awesome game. Hope you can survive it )
Totally rock-solid game. Way better than PI's EU4 (same developer) for the simple fact that it goes a lot deeper. Where EU4 felt like a better 'game'CK2 is a better overall experience.
This game is the best strategy game I have ever played in my life. It's addictingintensechallenging
Definitely enjoy the Old Gods DLC. That feel when you start with Bavaria and inherit East and West Francia without even trying.
A very nice gamealltough with a rather steep learning curve. infinitely replayableand the DLC's are worth it as well. If you're only vaguely interested in history
One of the best strategy games I have ever played!
This is a great game. There is a lot of depth without the immense complexity of some of the other Paradox Grand Strategy games. I recommend this game highly to anyone who is interested in Grand Strategy.
Simply putthis is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. The learning curve is a bit steepbut once you start to understand how the game works
Excellent game. Different every time you play. Has kept me busy for too many hours
My new favourite gamebetter than civ or Total war
Stunning grand strategy for the discerning connoisseur.
Absolutely fantasic Strategy/RPG Gameif anyone likes any other Paradox gamesthey should definately get this one!
Very steep learning curvebut ultimatly rewarding.
Simply unlimited hours of fun!
Great game! Hours and hours of my time i spend trying to build a great dynasty. Try it and you will get addicted! :)
If you like Micro-Managing and your idea of a fun night is playing Samurai Swords (the board game) -- than this is for you! If you are expecting CGI and explosions there is nothing to see here -- move along.  Hours of funand constant support from Paradox. The expansions are worth getting (content expansionsnot music/potraits).
I think the 380+ hours I have spent playing this game says it all. There is nothing quite like overthroughing your uncle 10 years after he murdered your father retaking the kindom only to be through into a civil war started by you hunchback craven stark raven mad sister... Thank you once agian Paradox. Just and a multiplayer campain in Banner Lords alright?
A good strategic mindbender and I still dont get half of it but I keep coming back for more
Deep gameplayvery strategic thinking required. This is not a game that you can just play for a few hours. You have to plan decades ahead to achieve your goalsand not let those goals slip. Rebellions and other attacks
Great game full of intrigueconquestand best of all gay hunchback lords. Damn those gay hunchback lords for never giving me an heir!
So much fun and enless possiblities!! Way better than Civ 5
The likelihood of genetic traits being passed is a little wonky (come onthere's no way absolutely zero out of my fifteen inbred children get the inbred trait) and it's far too easy to desync while playing multiplayerbut overall it's great. I recommend combining the lunatic and possessed traits for an -interesting- game.
An epic strategy game that really pulls you in. Even when things go wrongthe stories that emerge from the gameplay keep you coming back. With no real win condition except those you want to set yourselfthis is a historic sandbox for you to play in. Though the initial coplexity of the game can be offputting
This game doesn't work. Screw you Steam.
Best grand strategy wargame out there! Game is really immersive and you have even has some RPG feeling when you guide your familys struggle through medieval era.
This game seems to offer everything I would want in a game but as a friend told meSTEEP learning curve. I played it briefly and was totally lost even after going through the tutorial. Not giving up quite yet but side lining it until I have time to spare and immerse myself fully. Of course I am playing Navarre!
Very good game: currently addicted to it Take control of any nation or part of any nation from 873 to 1358 and do anything in between from having the Aztecs conquer europe to making Zoroastranism the largest religion in europe to forcing everybody to speak Latin again. All around only recommended for serious strategy gamers but dont let that scare you away as this may be your new addiction too.
best strategy game ever made hands down
A truly great paradox experience. It takes a while to get into itbut the modding community has created some interesting experiences including the best ASOIAF game available.
You can murder children and marry your daughter to her unclewhat's not to love?
Crusader Kings 2.  This game is a great game for people how enjoy bending history to their own will. Rule a Muslim Spain or mend the Great Schism between the East and West. Take back land from the muslims and reform Perisa as a true Zoroastrian. From Ireland to Perisa you have Europe at your finger tips.   While hard to get into Crusader Kings 2 is hard to put down when you get into it. It's a game that you control the out come of as best you can.   The expantions add many things to this game as well. Reform the Roman Empire in one. Fight off Aztecs in another if you want a true twist on history in your game.   And if you want to pull the Europe f your game and play it further you can get Europa Universalis 4 and its converter.  (Note to play as a Pagan or Muslim you will need their respective DLC. The same with the Aztecs.)
Great game ! Even I haven't yet played it ^^^ But I know already Paradox games since their beginning. If I didn't enjoy Europa Universalis 'The 1st one'I really appreciate the last version of it. It is not easy gamesbecause they are deep and difficult to master. But once you are into it
My strategy game of choice. I really need to put some more time into this.  Basically it's Game of Thrones the video game. Even has a GoT mod I think.
This game is quite addictive. As with all Paradox gamesthere is quite a learning curvebut when you get it
Y'all better get thisor Imma woop your .
The Joffrey Baratheon sim of choice.
Great gamebut very brutal. An example: I didn't have enough provinces to give to my childerenand the one that got left out created a rebelion against me. Once I defeated him
Great game. No playthrough is exactly the same and there are so many different characters of different nations and religions that you'll never run out of things to do. The expansions add lots of content but aren't really required.  It is definitely confusing at first cause the tutorial is not that goodbut if you watch a quick youtube video and do some experimentation you'll grasp the game's concepts fairly quickly!
Crusader Kings 2 is easily one of the best grand strategy games paradox has put out on the market thus far. The gameplay is a bit slowand there is a learning curvebut once you get the hang of things it can easily suck hundreds of hours out of your life. The multiplayer has it's problems
A magnificent return to medieval Europe's court of intrigueconflict and conspiracy.While original Crusader Kings was a magnificent game that was unique and offered a solid gameplayit had it's drawbacks.Second installment of the series however ironed out old issues and improved everything that was so great about the original.
Great game. Its easy to pour manymanyhours into. The rules of the game and how best to play can be challenging to learn.   The downside is the Devs release DLC piecemeal: game mechanics is one purchase
This is one of the greatest strategy games of all time. I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone!
As a fan of strategy games this is by far my favoritehowever it has a steep learning curve and I would suggest playing the tutorials and maybe watching some Let's Play videos.  Great game,85
This game is absolutely amazing. Playing as a 50 year and want to cheat on your wife with a 20 year old? Go head.
A very complex strategy game that will often leave you deeply entrenched within the gameplayhowever the controls and game mechanics are extremley complex and have a high learning curveotherwise this is a great game and I wholeheartingly recommend it to those who what a unique experience.
The game? Fantastic.  It's almost like Medieval: Total War without the battlefield mapsbut with the world map politics/trade/alliances/plots on steroids. Seriously near perfect.  If you are a fan of the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series by George R.R. Martinthe ASoIaF mod for this game is the absolute BEST thing you will probably ever get to play based on the series.  Political alliances
There is no other game that can make me play 18 hours straight. How can you not when you are desperately trying to become King of Scotland and it always seems so close...
Best game if you're into going about taking over places in different ways!
Grand Strategy made simple. It's huge but without excruciating levels of micromenagement. Awesome in every level. Prepare to get addicted
Very fun game with a steep learning curve. GIve the game a few tries and you'll get the hang of it. Check youtube for guides and you'll really enjoy this.
To beginI am the type of gamer that hates Platformers/Puzzlers and all their incarnations in addition FPS Games drive me up the wall. Strategy games I generally find to be boring once you master the perfect strategy. Case in point: Civ5.   I like the Sims franchise for having a lot of role-playing in a 'simulation' game. I love the game Resonance of Fatebut for a different reason than I like most RPGs. My type of games are the Action Role-Playing Strategy Simulators.  Crusader Kings II is all these in one neat little package. Role-Playing for the nice little random imersion events that pop-up. Simulation for the Medieval setting (My second favorite period in history.) Strategy for obvious reasons.  The game is far from perfect and can be improved considerably via mods and expansions or DLC. I personally have All the major DLC
Amazing Grand Strategy gamethe DLC Legacy of Rome really makes the game thoughbuy it as soon as you get CKII.
Amazing game. Lots of fun. An incredible time sink.
Very fun game. Worth the money
This game... is... FANTASTIC! 9/10  Only thing I think they could work on is the military aspected of this game.
Really inovative- focuses more on famiily drama and titles and politics than war. Try to make a humongus armybut watch when everything falls just because of some distant cousin with a nice claim on your throne that you should have sent to a monestary back when he was just a weak baby...Yeahits a great game
YOU NEED TO GET THIS GAME. Don't be intimidated by the steep learning curvethis is one of the most complete and complex strategy games I have played. If you like Civyou'll love this game. I recommend this guys videos for a tutorial on how to get started:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxGrv120bBA
This game is complex and has a steep learning curvebut is completely worth it. If you put in the time to learn the ropes (I recommend watching Let's Plays on YouTube)you will get a really fulfilling experience out of this game. The vanilla game is great
It is one of the most funniest games ive ever playedalot of fun by using intriguewarfare and securing your succession line.. If u like strategy on a very high plan and love to have power
Great Gamebe warned you can loose hours of your life when playing this
One of the best games I've ever played. I'm big fan of RTS gamesbut never tried before anything like this - I played hundreds of hours in Total War seriesbut after massive disappointment with Rome II decided to try simething elese.   The true is I played just few hours - comparing to other fans it's almost nothing but I found it more enjoyable than anything else. Very rewarding
Wales is better than your fucking fuck
Highly recommended. Really love the way they have put the effort into dynasties and not countries. You can really mess things up if you get too powerfull children for instance. Tons of fun!
Fun gameespecially with the modablity
You have sucked way to much of my life. Curse you. Curse you and and your family. I hope you oneday rue the mistake you have made.
If you like to micro-managethen this games is pretty good. Play as a dynastie in Medieval Europe and try take as much power as possible. From count to EmperorSultan to Jarl
Steep learning curvebut worth the effort!
Crusader Kings II puts you in the shoes of a ruler - big or small - in the early medieval era and challenges you to create your own goals. The tools you have to do this are marriagespolitical intrigueraising an army and stomping all over your enemies and murdering people. Good grief
Stay away from this gameSeriously if you are easily adicted and like grand strategy this game will make social lifestuding
Truly a fantastic gameone of the best the strategy genre has to offer. The only real downsides are the steep learning curve and the bugs (which have largely been patched). If you can handle the complexityand you probably can
Feudalism-themed kinslaying simulator. 10/10 will play again
Awesome gameif you want to lose countless hours of your life in exchange for strategic/roleplaying bliss. That being saidCrusader Kings 2 has a steep learning curve
If you're into Risk and plotting murder on a continental scale then get this game.
One of the best Games I have Ever Played Constently Being Updated and made better and plenty of downloadable content. The Game Play is a little to indepth at times as keeping track of what is going on in your kingdome while staying friends with others is very difficult but battles are a simple matter of numbers and what general you have leading your army so more indepth on the battles would be good but other than that it is pretty good
Supremely satisfying in the same way (I would imagine) building a ship in a bottle is. A gratifying experience once you invest the time to get the hang of it and complete. Every finished product is uniquebutoddly
8,5
Amazing game absolutely love thisgame!
Steep learning curve but one of the best games ive played in this genre.
Get the Game of Thrones Mod. Fun for everyone (except the Starks. They inevitably end up getting rocked by one of their own bannermen).
Sweet Lord this game is going to own me. Barely made it through 1st tutorial before I ran back here to buy ALL the DLC. If you like grand strategybuy this immediately.  This might even cut into my Kerbal time. Maybe. :D
Incest &amp Infanticide simulator. Now with 100% more Johan.
Great strategy game. Steep learning curve but it's worth it.
Grab your swordtake up your shield and march off in service of your God! (Buy this game right now you Son of Abraham!)
One of the most fun games I've playedincredibly deep. GoT mod for it is amazing as well.
It's fun -- but if you think Civ is a 'wargame' it's probably not for you.
An exceptional game for those with a taste for strategy. Unlike other games that leave you thinking 'if only it had ___'CK2 has everything that it should haveand even a mod that lets you play as famous characters from Game of Thrones. A must for anyone with the patience to learn how to play it.
This game will make you racistsexisthomophobic
one of the best games for strategy lovers
Pretty good ay! Really indepth and complex but once ya get the hang of ita quality experience
Great gamegreat depthgreat detail. Overall I'd recommend it.  With that said
Great plotsscheamsplans and wars to grow and expand your empire. You controll a person in a dynasty with the task and goals of your choosing. It gives multiple ways for you to grow in power. Unlike other strategy games were you can only grow trough one way like war for example. But Crusader kings alows you to grow stronger trough in multiple ways.  You can marry your children to the ruler or the rulers children to make so your grandchild will inherit the kingdom which you will then be a strong ally or to become a addition to your lands. You can send your loyal concil to give you the right to land you want and for you to later take it by brute force. But whats greatest is that there is multiple ways of playing. It's not only war and expansion but also political relationship management and plots and secrets in order for your dynasty to become the greatest of them all.  In the start of the game you will most likely be lost. Becuse it takes some time to learn the basics and get in on mindset of the game. Luckly enough if you are smarter then me you will check out the tutorial and not spend painful 20 hours asking yourself 'What am i doing?'. But its a great game and very fun when you have learned how the game works.  Sadly there are more dlc that you have to pay for then i would like. The dlc is not required to have a good time. They expand the game for you to try other things but in personal opinion is that the funniest charaters is the onces you don't need a dlc for (Norseman in the old gods dlc is a exception). It might look like alot of dlc but only the one with effect on gameplay mechanic is worth getting in my opinion(The republic
Currently 379 hours on record that kind of says everything. There's nothing else quite like this gameand all the DLC just makes it better.
Coming last Feburarya game that is harder than the last the prequel to the beloved Europa Universalis: Crusader Kings II.
it is a hard game to get into but when get how it all works it is a epic game
Great game if you have a couple days to kill.
Micromanagement madnessif you like that sort of thing. With the DLCit's a treasure-trove of alternate history scenarios
This game is so much funin a weird sort of way. It's not action-packedyou spend a lot of time waiting for the years to pass
I love CKIIit is fun strategy game that tests your ability to plan for the future and sucessfully control rowdy and traitorous vassals. It can easily keep a strategy gamer entertained for hours a dayit's very addictive and you cannot help but feel some pride when you build an empire from the ground up. Perfect for any strategy gamer or somebody with a taste for chivalry and steel. 9.5/10 Can be too addictive.
Where killing your wife and marrying another is a business model.
If you want to get lost in game simply choosing who you marry to whothis is it.
Overall strategywith a dynasty to role-play at the strategic mico-manage levelawesome game!!! If you love strategy games
If you love killing Muslimskilling your familyand marrying your cousin
1
So deepso intensivea great challenge
This game is the game of year every year for me.
The game will confuse you at firstbut I would recommend you look into it a bit and see if you like it. The game is most enjoyable and I have to say that this game has succeeded in keeping me into it for the longest time.   The versatility of this game and every playthrough you do is ingenious. Start as a kinga duke
If you've played Rome: Total War and wish you could trade the battle scenes for much much more in depth control over your family tree and the diplomacy between nationsthis is the game.
What a great game! All I can say is power through those first few hours of learning the mechanics. Once you do they melt away to a better immersion than I've experienced with any other game. The focus on peopledynasty and intrigue make this one of the most interesting and best games I've ever played.
this is an incredible mapgame about being a big family off fucks
My own son murdered meit was awesome.
Politics. It's a dirtynaughty business. I like dirtynaughty things. If you catch my drift.
Great game
SUPER FUN!  HINT: TO PLAY IN WINDOWED MODE GO TO = C:\Users\Name\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II) Change the line that says 'fullScreen=yes' to 'fullScreen=no'
Such a fantastic game and the Song of Ice and Fire mod only adds to the replay value.
The DLC are a gigantic ripoff schemebut the game itself is sweeeet. Just keep in mind this ain't Europa Universalis. You're controlling a familynot a country.  See how long it takes for you to resort to cheating.
This game is so simplebut so complex. It is all about relationships and how to exploit them or how to avoid being exploited
Every once in a while a game comes along that sets the barand redifines a genre. This is such a game. If you are a strategy game fan a must have for your collection. Incredible gamea solid thumbs up. Keep up the good work Paradox. This game deserves a spot in the hall of fame for strategy games.
I've never reviewed a computer game beforebut felt uttely compelled to with this one. I've been playing games for about 31 years nowsince I was 4 years old
Definately a game i recommend. It is not for the stupid or the simple minded. It is complex and long thinkingyou will at first completely hate the game and probably rage quit. If you are smart thoughand take the time to read a couple things around it is one of the most addicting games out there. A combination of civilization and total war on a huge and extremely detailed level. Be careful starting off too big
Greatest incest simulator on the market. 10/10
I've spent many many hours playing this game since I bought it. I love the depth. It's like Civ on crack. There's quite the learning curveand I still don't know that I have it all downbut even though I suck I still enjoy failing miserably over and over again.
great game takes some time to get into but its totally worht it
10/10  Quite simply the best Paradox title in my eyes. It's a character-driven grand strategy game with excellent support from the developerswho are also constantly creating new DLC for the game. Some people may call that a cash-grabbut you can pick and choose which DLC you want and the game doesn't force you to purchase them.  If you need a medieval grand strategy fix with a deep character-driven focus
Excellent. Really intricateconstantly updatedand tremendous.
So uh. I've kinda played a lot of this. CK2 is basically a medieval feudalism simulator. You play as a landed nobleand you can schemestab people
This game is a complicatedhard to understandMidevil grand strategy game. If that sounds boring to you
One of the best stratagy games I have ever playedI cannot recommend this game enough.
I'm not much of a reviewerbut this game is well worth the price. I picked it up for a sale for $10 (this game often goes on sale for 75% off along with MOST of the DLCif you're on the line and/or patient wait for a sale) and definitely have a few hundred hours put into it
Great
10/10 would crusade
you will easily sink many hours into this game. You may feel overwhelmed at first but it is well worth your time! You may learn some history in the process :).
Perfection from Paradox Interactiveas usual.
You will definitely have to watch some tutorial videos on youtube and some let's play commentaries to understand some of the conceptsbut when you dothe game is definitely worth it. You control a character and manage their relationships with vassals
One of the best games I have ever played. It can be a little hard to understand at firstbut after you figure it outit become very simple. Watch a video Online of someone playing it
A grand strategy title about successions and scheming superbly doneand for those interestedthere is an excellent Game of Thrones mod out there for the game :)
This is an awesome game. Get it and Legacy of Rome (DLC add-on)
I don't generally like strategy gamesbut this one has eaten a lot of my time. It is intricate without being all about numbers. The learning curve may be a bit steep (perhaps...?) but learning is funisn't it?
It's good to be king.
For Game of Thrones fansthe best way to describe Crusader Kings II is to call it 'The Official Tywin Lannister Simulator.' The purpose of game isn't to simply gain landbut to build a powerful dynasty through political intrigue
I have sunk hundreds of hours into this game. I have been more invested in this than Skyrim and the Witcher combined. ThatI believespeaks volumes.    While not the most accessable
I've thoroughly enjoyed playing Crusader Kings 2. It's like playing a beefed up version of Lords of the Realm 2. The only downside (depending on your point of view) is the lack of direct control over combat between armies. But the trade off of that is the fact that you can have 32 player multiplayer game going on. That's rightup to 32 people running their own empireskingdoms
If you like simulation/strategy games this one is a great addition to your collection. Another huge bonus is a LOT of user generated content. I believe there are full on Game of Thrones conversion mods and things of that nature. My only complaint was playing a nation like Englandsummoning troops and getting them to on ships its very tedious.
Paradox games are generally quite a tough nut to crack and in that regard CKII is no different. What DOES make it completely different is the fact thatas your dynasty growsyou get attached to your characters
This game creates the craziest stories. You can be a count who rises to become Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by arranging an 'accident'or marrying the wife of your ward after you arranged his marriage. It's a weird mix of the world map/army management of Europa Universalisthe personality traits and family members of Rome: Total War
It's good to be king.
Great game for strategy fans! Hours melt away. Sufficient depth without a huge learning curve. Appropriate yet slightly buggy tutorials. Highly recommended.
Have you ever wanted to be the Roman Born Emperor of the Empire of Scandinavia? Do you like to learn new and confusing ais until suddenly it becomes as simple as just a click here a click there? Then Crusader Kings 2 is for you.  Now just hope your only child isn't born fuckfuck
i will love it forever
I've been playing Paradox games since I found Europa Universalis I in the bargain bin at EB Games years ago. Since thenI've gone out and purchased just about every game in their grand strategy library...EUCK
Assassinate childrenmarry your cousinoverthrow your liege
Another Great Paradox Game
Paradox games have a steep learning curve but CK2 is probably the 'easiest' of them all. A good game to get you into grand strategy.
Short review. Wow. Longer version: This is a veryvery deep simulation of what it is like to be a midieval dynasty. Yesyou start as a lord
Awesome game! Really recommend getting this game with Ruler Designer DLC aswell
Good gamelots of depth.
AMAZING GAME. Almost feels like Game of Thrones!
Very interesting strategy game that requires alot more thinking than just maintaining your toops. With the opinions of your vassals and everything else this makes for a very interesting and fun game. A definite must play for any strategy game enthusiast.
Probably the most addictive and engrossing of the many Paradox grand strategy titles. Highly reccomended.
Paradoxthings haven't always been perfect. I remember when CK2 first came outhow much rougher it was than it is now. But Paradox
I've played a few hours...needless to sayI enjoy this game tremendously. Howeverlike many reviews state
One of my favorite games. It's a bit hard at firstbut once you get into it you can really lose hours in it.
This is a very good game. It is a very in depth simulation of Europe in the Middle Ages. It is very fun.
Amazing game. Buy right away if it is on any type of sale. I bought it for the full 40 and it was still worth it.
This is definitely the most in-depth and rewarding strategy game based in this period. It is both realistic and difficult whether you play on easy or hard you can lose everything by a stroke of bad luck and this perfectly reflects the changing fortunes of the dynasties vying for power in this period. As a student of history I give this thumbs up for its accuracy and immersion and as a game I give it my thumbs up for stealing hours of my life without making me resent it for doing so.
One of the best Grand Strategy games ever!
It's Game of Thrones without magic &amp dragons (but there is a mod for that) It's Shakespeare's playwith more a little more politics thrown in the middle It's a living history book with all the kinkyviolents and... interesting details It's Europa Universalis with actual persons instead of nations It's... Crusader Kings II. Now with even more medieval stuff.
I don't know quite how to begin with this. You need to enjoy grand-strategyRPG'smedieval history. You must possess the will to power
Thislike similar Paradox titleshas a steep learning curve. If you're willing to put hours into even a single game and learn the mechanics
The only game where your young prince is told by his regeantwho also happens to be his auntto go clean up the roof for the birds
Such a deep and complex game. Perfect for the megalomaniac in everyone. Worth the time it takes to learn definately.
This is the largest game that I have ever played. The learning curve is steep but that feeling you get when the game finally clicks and you start to realize how to play is the most fantastic feeling there is. This game will keep you enthralled in a game of medieval power politics that can be as darkeviland conniving as you wish it to be. Easily one of the best games that I have ever played.
This is easily the greatest grand strategy game I have ever played. It has set such a high bar that I am not even sure Paradox Interactive will be able to top themselves. It is incredibly deepyet despite all the complexityit always remains intuitive. You will become deeply engrossed in it and likely find yourself trying to make excuses to play just a little more every time. It sucks you in and does not want to let you go.
This game is absolutely nuts. It is a very deep game at it's most basic level and the amount of variety you can get even from replaying the same noble offers endless replayability. Schme and plot your way to European domination in what is the truest example of 'Grand Strategy' available.
It's easy to spend an entire afternoon on this gameplotting the rise of your dynasty. Grooming the perfect heir to follow in your footstepsand then having him die when you yourself are on death's doorstep and your late uncle's moron of a nephew inherits instead. Can you keep your vassals happy long enough for your family to recover from this tragedy and continue their rise to prominence?
This is a very good game and definatly worth the pick uphowever it does take some knowledge to get down. or at leat thats how it was for me. i give it 8.5/10
This game made me a monsterin my current playthrough I began to chain-murder babies in order to inherit Finland. Just one baby after the other - smothersmother
Think 'Sims' meets 'Europa Universalis' meets 'A Game of Thrones.' I'm not a huge fan of all the interface choices in this gamebut the mechanics are pretty funand the simulation aspect of this game is deep and rewarding.
You can murder children and kidnap peoplewhat is not to like?
Absolutely fantastic entry game to the Paradox grand strategy familyand simply the best medieval incest simulator around.
a great game a must have
Tis a lovely game
Finaly a game that allows you to play as Ireland! I first took over ireland then married some random British peasent. Turns out she was busy taking over England! We had a kid then i murdered her making my heir king of England! When i died he became king of Irelandso that was the first time that Ireland ruled over England! I love this game.
Very much an edgy title
Awesome gameunlike any other on the market. It's a mixture of The Simsa RTS and Tv shows like Game of Thrones or The Borgias. You should buy it
If you're looking for absolutely hard and complicated game.. then this is for you.
Absolutely awesome game. It takes a little bit to get the hang of itbut when you do you won''t be able to stop playing!
After close to 200hrs playing this game I have yet to grow even slightly tired of the backstabbing politicswar-makingdiplomatic marriages and the host of other aspects of statecraft the title has to offer. Whether working your way up the ladder as a count or dealing with rebellious lords as an emperor this game offers a ton to the strategically minded and/or the political animal.
Sequel to the original gay son simulator. Why be bothered with troublesome gameplayexcitementor action? Instead
This game is a awesome combination of both tactical- and strategic gameplay. Micromanaging you're own dynasty like you're the next Habsburg familiy is just plain satisfying.   I had tons of fun with this game and I will have a ton more fun in the future. The DLCs are mandatory for maximum enjoyment. The money are well spendI assure.
I'm kind of a sucker for a good strategy game. At firstI thoughtoh crap
Let me say this right now(IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO SPEND THE NEXT 10-20 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE LEARNING HOW TO PLAY THIS AMAZING GAME THEN STOP READING THIS REVIEW NOWAND MOVE ON!) That being said
This game is definitely an awesome Middle Ages strategy game with great Roleplaying value because you do not play a nationbut characters in a dynasty. Howeverwhat makes this game best are the tie-ins with other Paradox Titles. Like your nation? Then keep playing them in Europa Univeralis VI. Other user-made game saves let you continue your game into Victoria II and then onward to Hearts of Iron and World War Two.   Literally over a  thousand  years of alternate history gameplay! What other game can give you that?
One of the best Paradox games out there. Love it.
So I guess if that counts I created the Targaryen dynasty in Persia. If you know what I man )
Simpler than europaa must buy for people with patience and who like to be challenged
I dare you to name another strategy game where your possessed ruler can gain an army of witches that believe he is the chosen one! In this gameI have been conqueredonly to rise up and depose my ruler. I have married Joan of Arc and won a crusade. I have changed history
It's like Europa Universalis but with incest
If you like games of this type there are really none better than Paradox games.  I am enjoying Crusader Kings 2 a lot. Over the years Paradox has made this genre more accesible and that shows in Crusader Kings 2. Trust methat's a good thing...  Moddinggreat DLC and some extremely simple text based teaking you can do on your own to cutomize the game to your liking give it even more logevity.  Totally recomended fot any grand startegy fan.
Best dynasty simulator I've ever played.
im fckign autistic : - )
This is a fantastic representation of mideval Europethat is incredibly fun to learn and play. You can play as anyone from the year 867-1456and interact with thousands of npcs
Another excellent game by Paradox. The possibilities and stories you create as you play are incredible.
excellent rpg strategy simulation game with lots of cool mods you can download
What an awesome game. The possibilities the game gives you to create your own European histories are endless.
The best medieval strategy game...if you like the genre it is just addictive!
Great game. Difficult to learn at firstbut once you get the hang of it you can't stop playing.
How to lose control of any remains of a life you might have had.
An amazingly tactical gameI've sunk 100+ hours into it and only barely scratched the surface. If you're a long time RTS fanor someone who's never touched the genre
One of the best games I've ever played!
I love CKII. It is a ton of funeither single player or multiplayer. Y'all should get it. Best medieval eugenics simulator out there.
Quite complex initially. Takes a few games to really understand what's going on and to gain a sense of how things workbut once some knowledge is acquired is one of the best strategy games of its kind. Had absolutely hours of fun with CK2. 100% would recommend it.
My favourite game of all Paradox titles.
what a game
cool game!
Awesomest Paradox game ever !!! What time is it ? Wow seriously ! It's pretty time consuming once you put your head on iteven more than civ5 once you've understood the pretty complex and fuckin amazing mechanics Damn complete and well finishedcould spend my days from start to end on it ! Incredible !
like... the most addicting game ever
It is quite awesome experience if you have time to play &amp learn. Every playthrough is different and with DLC:s it is even better what I have heard. time-consuming game to learn but if you are interested building your own dynasty and watching the twists of it you will have fun time.
Great Games with numerous possibility
One of the best simulation games ever! Become a medieval ruler and create your legendary dynasty!
The most fun you can have assasinating your fuck son and marrying off your niece to pagans.
Captivating gamecompletely addicted to it. Makes for such insane number of stories its mind-boggling. Takes a while to understand and get going but an excellent game all around.   Look at a few Lets Play if you want before handI suggest Arumba on Youtube.  Will help you understand how the game plays out
This game comes pretty close to what I consider the perfect game out there.
GOTY 2012 - Medieval Incest is best incest.
Like No other Strategy Game on the market this completley in depth and immersive game will have you thowing hours at it just to get yourself a storng foothold in the ever shifting turmoil of Feudal europe plus not to mention the oppurtunity to crush some either muslimothrodoxor christian infidels in the procces depending on your prefrences plus the massive modding community with conversions like game of thrones but trust me when i say The tinniest detail matters
I don't usually play games like this but despite the steep learning curve (for me) I find it very enjoyable. The personal elements with your ruler and their family/lineage really helps to appeal to those who aren't hardcore history/strategy fans.
fuck's tight yo
really fun
If you like a slower style of grand strategy game that still feels epic and actioney then this is the game for you! The base game has a few bugs and issues to it but there's almost nothing that the healthy as hell modding community can't fix. And it's especially easy to mod thanks to steam workshop. 8/10 i got my moneys worth for it &lt3
Crusader Kings II is an immersivedeepand slower strategy experience. You'll need to give yourself some time to adjust to the game
These Paradox titles are kinda funny. If you've ever played some early DOS games where you're just thrown into the action/UI with amost zero explanation and sent desperately scrambling for a PDF or game manual you'll have a very similar experience with most 'grand strategy' games.  There are SOME popup boxes that explain the basic gameplay using esoteric jargon and often olde English. Thesecontrary to the claims of user friendlinessare not very helpful.   What it's gonna come down to is one or both of two things: Either watch someone smarter and more experienced than you play the game on YouTube or dive in
Having played the demo to deathI was so excited when I finally got the full version. Worth every cent
Crusader Kings II is a great game once you get over the steep learning curve. It will completely change your view on strategy games and makes a game like Civilization feel like child's play.  The great thing in this game is that even if you do exactly the same thingsyou will get a completely outcome. Every game you play is a different story of diplomacywar and intrigue.  I highly recommend Crusader Kings II if you want something different to sink a lot of time in.
This game is amazing. A wonderful strategy game that forces you into the harshest of situationsand sometimes the funniest. One of my favorite parts? 'England has declared the Peaceful War on Lawl World'
Consider it Civ 5 only that it wasn't streamlined and was about fifty times more in depth along with a special feature that i feel needs to be in more games today  Cheating actually makes the game different and sometimes more funespecially when you scatter an empire or form hundreds of kingdoms to fight each other.  I cannot say for the DLC since its riddled with itbut thankfully there's modding support in it too so the game is bound to be getting hundreds of hours of content every year i suggest you look for someone else to recommend you to the DLC but for this game? i recommend it like I'd recommend you to stay away from the Irategamer  Purchasing this game on a deal (when dlc is also discounted) is a genious idea and will save you lot of money and give you game that's more fun then almost any grand strategy out there!  Thanks for reading.
Very fun but requires the passion for grand strategy and the patience to manage empires. Also be prepared for a lot of small events going on at once.
This is a fantastic game.
This game is surprisingly good! Be warnedit does have a bit of a learning... cliffwith many layers of complexity
great game
Trully a MUST HAVE of any Medieval strategy lover. In depth historical eventstrue information about kingscounts
i love this game i whis it had workshop suppurt thought
I love the historic background of the game. Lots of replayability and challenge. Doesnt hurt that patches come out regularly.
More detailed game but less 'grand' than Europa Universalis IV using the same game engine and a similar interface. You'll want the expansion DLCsbut wait strictly for a sale. There's enough content to keep you busyand you'll be nickel-and-dimed. It may be worthwhile to buy the soundtrack DLCs as in the ingame music can get repetitive. Or just play your own
Loads of fun when you know what your doin!
I got bit by the grand strategy bug during this holiday season. this has turned out to be a lot of fun. the family intrigue stuff is a nice change of pace from the other gsg from paradox.
Crusader Kings II is an excellent grand strategy game. It is delightfully complexdeep and realisticeven though that is also one of it's downsides
Fantastic strategy game with massive depth but also a massive learning Curve. Also a time sinkbut in a good way.
Crusader Kings is a great gameand one of the best gateways to the grand strategy games. Don't be a fool and buy it now!
Richsmartaddictive
Great Game.
It is awesome. Kill it.
I have spent so many hours on this game and i still more then notrun into something new and special and sudden surprises. Wish the multiplayer was better but overall this is one of my favorite games of all time.
There's an initial learning curve which is a bit steep (I watched YouTube videos which were great)but it's one of the most interestingrewarding and historically accurate strategy games I've played
If you love incestregicidepatricide
Such an brilliant grand strategy gametook me a little while to get to grips with it but now when I start playing I cant pull myself away from itHighly recommend this
The only good game on Steam.
Fun very game. if you enjoy EUIV or are looking for a mariage simulatorthis is the game for you.
Best dynasty simulator strategy game ever!
A bit tough to get intobut enjoyable nonetheless! If you're not hard-core into management and strategyI would definitely not recommend
I cannot recommend this game highly enough. While many people might be scared off by the menu-driven gameplaythe depth and detail of the experience that it provides justifies it completely. If you are a history nerdyou will appreciate the intimate relation with the events and culture of the age that playing this game will bring. If you could care less about history
Very addictive. Very fun. Played this game alot and never had the same game twice. Highly recommend!
Its a great engrossing game. Hours will sail past while you are playing!!! Great mechanicscomplex game with several layers. However it has a steep learning curvethat is eased with the tutorials and playing a few games. The game is unforgiving
One of the best RPG which I've ever played. You can never forsee the next steps of your pathyou will get always surprised by this game. The publisher Paradox works very close with their community and shows love in his work. There is still future content in their pipeline which will increase the game experience once more.  To master the game it's important to share your experience with other gamers and also I recommend to watch LPs (e.g. Arumba's YouTube Channel).
You ever want to fuck your family and kill them at the same time? Then this game is for you!
This came free with my pre-purchase of Europa....man was that the best pre order ever.  Turns out I clocked more hours on here then any other game now. A great mix of politicswar and history.   From a small count to the emperorfrom a county of Ireland to the Holy Roman Empire. You can start as small or as big as you like. Each play through is completely different
This game takes a bit to learn and does have appealbut I'm not sure that appeal is lasting.
Like your own Medieval reality showyou grow and plan your dynasty to become the most influential in Europe. A refreshing change from regular 'conquer-em-all' strategy. This game places more emphasis on keeping your family in power and your vassals under control. Definitely worth a spin!
The one and only medieval political soap-opera simulator. This is the perfect game for Grand Strategy geeks who love to bring more politics and diplomacy in the otherwise fairly war-focussed genre. It's the Game of Thrones of the gaming world. No matter how good of a military leader you areyou can only reach your goals by killing your brothersbribing the pope
One of my favorite games. 100 plus hours into it.
Incrediblein-depthcomplex
This is definitely one of the best grand strategy games around. Paradox outdid themselves with this fantastic game. So many hours can be spent playing and countless ways of doing what you want to do. Buy this game now!
One of the bestif not the beststrategy games I've ever played. Ruling
At first this game comes across as rather intimidating but as you learn to play you'll soon find yourself burning through the hoursdays and weeks forming Scotland into a continent spanning empire or bringing down the Holy Roman Empire out of petty spite. This is a fantastic game on its own and with the DLC it can become so much more.
I can't stop playing. I've already played 45 hours and this is just my first game. The whole world must come under the rule of Glorious Sweden!
Absolutely wonderful. Just buy it already!
I have reformed the Norse faith. I have brought poland to the height of its power. I have murdered my sons in order to keep my kingdom stable. I have inherited france through a series of diplomatic marriages and poisoned goblets. I have killed countless children for the good of the empire. I have lead ireland to rule over the british isles. This game is fucking fun.
Literally the best strategy game I've ever played. Imagien Game of Thrones meets medieval Europeand crank it up by a facotr of 5. Your throne will be built upon liesdeceit
One of the best Medieval Strategy games since Medieval 2: Total War. Definitely in my top 3 for best games of 2012.
amazing can play it for hours but use addons will give it a little more kick
Paradox Interactive does it again. A great strategy game with lots of depth and replayability
This great game!
Absolutely incredible game.  Beyond addictive.
For people that like Grand Strategy games with a challenge and Micromanaging I would definitely is the game for you. Trying to keep yourself from going broke or your people happy can be one hard task if you don't do things properly.
This is one of my favorite games. Bought it by accident but ended up loving it. It's pretty much a medival politics simulator where you play as a family/house attempting to survive the middle ages. It sounds a lot more fun than I am describing itand that is because it is. The learning curve is very steep howeverand the tutorials are lackluster
A rarity for Paradox: a game that is polished and playable at release. While it is built on their Clauswitz engine and has very similar gameplay with their other Clauswitz games (like my beloved EU3)it boasts a much improved interface and graphics relative to EU3EU:Rome
Seriously buy the game... you will anyway.
For Sandbox-Strategy fans a must have. You will have a lot to do with managing your realms or your Family/House on the strategymaprather than fighting real battles on a battlemap like in other games. There are also some great MODs like ProjectBalanceThe Game of Thrones MOD
all video games are bad except for this one we have made the first good video game good job paradox
This is one of the most fun and immersive grand strategy games I've ever played. This game takes the complexity and diplomatic scale of games like the Europa Universalis and makes the game more character driven. In the Medieval erathere was no such thing as national diplomacy it was all personal. This game lets you play as any historical figure from a count to an emperor in Medieval EuropeMiddle East
This is grand strategy on an epic scale with a steep learning curve. It has been a lot of fun and very challenging. I can see myself putting in a ton of hours. Don't get discouraged by the complex mechanics because once you learn a littleyou will probably be hookedlike me. It's all about creating a dynasty
:'))))) 10/10 would transfer AIDS to
The most addictive history lesson ever.
It's basically a dynasty role-playing game. It's awesome.
While it has a fairly steep learning curveCrusader Kings 2 is one of my favorite games. It is never the same game twice. You must balance keeping your vassals happy and consolidating your poweror someone else will. I would urge anyone who enjoys strategy games to buy this game.
I am really enjoying this game. I have played Europa Universalis 3 (another Paradox grand strategy game) for years. This game has many similarities but offers a much deeper political strategy experience. If you are a fan of any of the Paradox Interactive grand strategy gamesyuo will enjoy this game.
A great example on how grand-strategy is the BEST genre around. This is an excellent game that can be quite a challange to pick upbut certainly is worth your time.
Kill some children and then take their stuff! Highly reccomended.
Great gamebut a steep steep learning curve at first. I don't think I got a hang of the marriage system until my third time through the game. Definitely a challenge at times.
One of my favorite grand strategy-games. Building an empire is always fun. You have just overgrown your external enemiesthen you have to manage internal struggles and keep the state from falling apart. Breeding and educating the perfect ruler and councilorstrying to forge the genius bloodline. Totally different gameplay as a republic or Muslim ruler. And not to forget the glorious vikings' raids in the name of Odin to fuck and pillage the Christians! Near-impossible quests like defend Russian borders from Mongols and avoid vassalization or rebuild the kingdom of Izrael starting as Jewish Khazars!  This game never runs out of unique stories and scenarious.
If you're looking for a different type of strategy gametry Crusader Kings 2 where the goal is to build a lasting dynasty ruling the kingdoms and empires of medieval Europe.  There's quite a bit of up-front knowlege you need on the game but there are great tutorials on YouTubeand once you're going it feels like you're a scheming puppet master in a story like A Game of Thrones
Great gameexperience the intrigue and politics of the medieval ages even before with the old gods all round great game
Plays like Europa Universalisbut deals more with family politcs than geopoliticsand both are very very good games. Another home run by Paradox. 9/10 easy.
A complex and intriguing grand strategy game. Conquer Medieval Europe either through schemingpoliticsmarriage or warfare.
Make your bloodline survive until the 1450sthe more kingdomsempires
One of the best games i have ever played. If you enjoy History or just playing strategy games this is defenitely worth the purchase. It has endless replayability and is never the same. Can easily spend hundreds of hours playing this game and still want to keep playing. One Hundred Percent worth it even when not on salebut a definte purchase if it goes on sale. Recommened that you purchase the DLC on salesongs arent really necessary but add to the experience.
This kingdom simulator has a lot of detail and depth. The entry level of this game is pretty highthere are a lot of options and data readouts to consider. I initially went on you tube and forums to figure out the pace and type of play this game requires. After I figured out the basic options and ideas of the game it was pretty fun. I have not tried any of the expansions yetbut am interested in checking them out. Also
Easily one of the best games I've ever played that has to do with dynasty simulation. There's such a high level of complexity that even after having played for 50+ hours I still encounter new mechanics and aspects that I didn't even know were in the game. It's TOTALLY worth $10.
The best incest simulator I have ever played.
Brilliant game muthuh fockers
Did you know that all the British isles were united under the rule of a gayhunchbacked dwarf in the year 1234 AD? It's trueor at least it can be true... in Crusader Kings 2.
Marry your cousinkill your parentstake over the world. The best sociopath simulator money can buy.
This game is like the emodiment of Game of Thrones. You fight to expand your territoryscheme and plot against pretty much every characterbuild an empire with your family
One of the best games ever. Honestly it sounds increadebly boringbut this game will thrill you with it's lawswars
A wonderful grand strategy game that is much easier to get into than its predecessor. Howevereven though it is much easier to get into it does not shy away from depth. The game is extremely deep and can take many playthroughs to learn all of the ins and outs to make your playtime easier.
The depth of this game is amazing. There is so much to take in that in the beginning it can seem quite daunting but once you get into it and learn how the game's many systems workthen it is simply the most detailed and entralling depiction of medieval Europe ever. There is more politics and intrigue than Game of Thronesmany paths to reach your goals: war
Perhaps the closest thing to an authentic 'history' simulation.   Hours will go by in what feels like mere minutes. Be warnedits easy to get hooked.
Hours and Hours of fun
Thumbs up for extreme medieval heir management simulation.
This is a great game of plotspowerand prestige. Play it as a conquest game such as a Total War or Civ you wont get the most fun out of it as either you will fail
Shortly after I passed 120 hours in Crusader Kings III realized that this is seriously thee greatest game of all time. There is no limit to the amount of ways this game can be played and things the player can do. Buy the game as a complete package with all the DLC. If you are a strategy gameryou will love Crusader Kings II
Great for those who like spreadsheets or the feudal system. Just be prepared to read a lot.
One of the most addictive and innovating strategy games ever. Huge learning curve but once you get it figured out you'll be enthralled.
freaking awesome if you like grand stratagy games. Pretty hard to learn but worth it
Very good game even though if you have not played the other paradox titles this one can be a little complex to get good at but with time you will get the hang of it. If you aren't entirely sure this is your type of game I recommend trying the demo first like I did and then deciding wether or not to purchase the game. Tons of replayablitytons of content and dlc if you want just a little more. Will check out other titles from this company.
Fun Simulations/strategy game especially if you're into early historical periods.
one of the best in depth stratergy game i have ever played big learning curve but a tone of fun to play so..... GET IT!!!!!
Masterpiece of epic proportions - greatest work of our lifetime.
This is a hard game: hard to approachhard to playand very hard to master
A very good Strategy gamethe amount of things that you will see in this that not only contradict what happened in history but flat our rebukes thems is insane.
Just incredibly epic and as deep as you likewith plenty of scope for tweaking.
I honestly don't think you can go wrong with buying Crusader kings collection
This game is the best game I have ever playedwell alongside Rome Total War and Total War: Rome 2.  It combines strategy and economics with military and family matters so flawlessly that I can't go back to some games because they seem to boring or slowor both.  Take advantage of any sales and get it whenever you can. There is also the Umbra Spherae mod which extends the map and nations from iceland to japan!
Brutally good medieval soap opera with betrayalschemingintrique
Probably unlike anything you have ever tried before for most gamers. Inspired by other's storiesI kept at it until piece by piece I understood the mechanics at about the 12 hour mark. Now consider it a masterpiece at 300 hours.   Its all about climbing that ladder of powerwith assassinations
This was my first Paradox strategy game so came into cold with no expectations. It has a steep learning curveand even after all this time I still learn things to this day. Once you get to grips with its mechanics you are in for a treat. It does an amazing job of creating the politics and intrigue of the era and you grow to love or hate certain characters over their lives. There's pretty much nothing negative to say about the game. If you love strategy games and enjoy a challenge this is the game for you. The various DLC just adds layer and layer of juicy goodnessalmost creating new games within the game.  Highly recommended.
Great strategy gamedefinitely recommended.
Most realistic middle age strategy dynasty simulation!
If you are a fan of the Civ series (as I was) this will forever ruin that series for you. The game has so much depth that I continue to discover new strategies and new methods with every game I play. WIth the inclusion of the Ironman mode and Steam achievements (taken from Paradox's other great strategy gameEuropa Universalis IV) there is even more to strive for. Paradox has impressed me so much over the last two years that I condider them the flagship for strategy games in our time. Cannot highly recommend enough! **Word of caution** This game has a STEEP learning curve. It does not hold you hand and just throws you into medieval Europe to fight for your own. Do not let this turn you off. Watch videos and read the forumsthere is a great community out there waiting to welcome you into the fold. Also this game is hardly about WINNING than it is SURVIVING. You will lose. Its part of what makes the game great. One wrong decision will ruin you and that is what I crave in a strategy game.
An interesting game if you like character based strategy...
One word. Epic!
This game has a single defining issue. I can't seem to stop playing.
This is one of my all-time favorite games. It not only provides a challenging and fullfilling gameplay but gives a very personal touch with the ruler and dynasty system.  I recommend this game to all those who like strategy.
600 Years of Intrigueschemesglobal strategy on a Day by Day basis. Build your own Dynasty
One of the best game I have played in the past 3 years.
If your idea of fun involves a little incest and a lot of murderthis is the game for you.
Best kinslaying simulator in the market right now.
The ultimate medieval ruler sandbox. Buy it with all the dlc includedthe game isn't quite complete without them. Wait for a salethough.
Play as a dynasty of your choice and plot and conquer your way through the rich history of the European Middle Ages. Getting the hang of this game may take some hours and it is advised to watch or read some tutorials or general mechanics. But getting a grip in this simulation gem is highly rewarding.  Start as an Irish nobleunite the Kingdom of Ireland and create the British Empire by annexing Britain counties. Start as the Norwegian king and try to unite the Scandinavian tribes by spreading the catholic faith. Play as a Greek count and try to claim the orthodox Byzantium Empire - but you end up in jail after a rebellion and being blinded and castrated (!) by your captor. Become a crusader and be granted the Kingdom of Jerusalem by the pope. And thats only the beginning.  You can spend tons of hours trying to reach your own set goals. Wed your daughters to powerful nearby Kingdoms to gain an ally in a current war until your own grandson tries to steal your sons crown 20 years later. Let your political enemies disappear by bribing their court. Get rid of your wife after she discovered your affair with a beautifullustful courtier. Its good to be king!
This is an extremely intricate and impressive Grand Strategy game. While dauntingsince it can make Civilization look like a casual gamethere are plenty of rewards waiting for those willing to devote time and energy to learning the game. It is more than just a game of conquest
Very high learning curvebut once you get the hang of it the game will keep you occupied for days.
Excellent dynastic empire builder set in and around medieval Europe. Very strong historical feel but not constrained to to follow the course of history once it gets rolling. Huge sandbox for managing your schemes for genealogical dominationwith a plethora of random events that ensures nothing is ever too predictable.
Amazing game that works fantastically with Europa Universaliswould recommend to anyone who enjoys large scale strategy such as CivTotal War or Endless Space. Most similar to the total war series but doesn't have the large real time battles
Fantastic strategy game. I find it a good compliment to Total Waras Total War focuses on the military aspect of things and pretty much assumes you have complete domestic controlwhereas Crusader Kings 2 doesn't have a very good military system but the political and intrigue components are well beyond any other game out there.
I love how in depth the factions are and all of the internal politics. War is pretty useless for territorial expansion though :(
A brand new incest and murder simulator.' - /gsg/
one oh the best games I've ever played!!
This game is awesome! It is a bit daunting at firstbut if you stick with iteverything will eventually 'click'. I highly reccomend it if you like Civ 5 but want more nitty gritty strategy elements. Its a like a clash between a social sim and grand strategy. I highly reccomend giving it a shot.
Nothing better than building my own Dinasty!
Crusader Kings 2 works fine in Mint 14Fedora 17and Ubuntu 12.04. That's pretty rad. If only it had a better battle system (optional strategy-centered battles like Total War or optional unit-centered battles like Mount &amp Blade)
I played it for 945 hours so far. I have no clue why.
Like 'Medieval Times' and strategy? Then look no further! This is an epic-strategy game with plots to kill your close family members (or have them kill you!)conceive carefully crafted marriages to seal alliances and gain territoryand oh so much more. Be careful: every plot
Sick of Civ and all the war and hardship it brings well this is the game for you because it gives you all the Civalization aspects but in a much more controlled and startegic point of view.
Crusader Kings II is by far the best strategy game I've ever playedbar none. It's the perfect game for anyone interested in strategyand even more so for those looking for a challenge. This game time-demanding and difficult to learn if you're new to the series
Crusader Kings II is an intresting game to play and review. It is a real time strategy game with a few twists. Instead of the regualr conquer all the territory on the mapthis game tasks you with playing as a specific dynastyor bloodline
A very interesting gameI highly recommend it for people who love historical simulations. A word of warning thoughdo not go into this game with out an idea of what you want to do
Great Medieval strategy game that is focused on intriguerelationshipsstate matters and best of all
very long and in depth gamevery challenging and rewarding at the same time.
This game has quickly become one of my favorite games too play. The learning curve is steep to say the least but it is very worthwhile to put the effort to get into. The game uses a traits and stats system to create an absolutely enthralling feudal politics simulation. In one of my favorite playthroughs my wife bore no male heirs for my kingdom and had reached the age of menopause. I took a concubine who eventually did bear a male heir which my wife immediately began to plot to assassinate in order for her daughters to inherit. I therefore had no choice but to imprison my wife in order to preserve the life of my only male heir. Playing a Norse character I eventually sacrificed her to the Allfather Odinfurther ensuring the survival of my heir. Turns out it was all wasted effort as the reign of the heir was short lived. He became depressed and committed suicide soon after taking the throne and before siring any heirsleaving his eldest sister to inherit the throne anyway. I am always astounded that these characters are mostly randomly generated and based mostly in stats and interactions in math but somehow become more compelling to me than many scripted characters that voice acted in triple-AAA production games. Highly recommend.
Love it!!!! The gameplay and graphics are great and if you're a fan of stratgy games This is for you.
Great game if Civilization V gets too easy for you. Highly recommend. Pick it up on sale.
buy this you fuckfucksit has multiplayerrr too yay!
As a foundation for accessiblecaptivatingand immersive Grand Strategy
Probably one of the best strategy games I have ever played
The learning curve is very steepand the UI takes a little getting used to-- but tihs game is awesome. By the same makers of Europa Universalisand again mostly about your ruler and dynasty while you consolidate power and defend against intrigue. You make a ruler first
Killin babies n fuck for land. 10/10.
Paradox is well known for their strategy gamesalways in the same stylebut not Crusader Kings II The game focuses on the rulers and the nobility
This is the best strategy game I have ever played. It can last forever.
The one and only 'Gay Son Simulator 2012'
All the fun of ruling the middle ageswithout the need to go weeks without a shower!
Blew my mind how much you can get out of this gameamazing. Best stratagy game I have ever seen. Once it's done if you can ever get the the end date you just load up EU4 and keep you save and Empire for a new age.
A brilliant game with not many faults for all grand strategy gamers.
Wonderful game. Likereally good. Takes a bit of getting used to and a bit of a learning curvebut so good.
This game has the most interesting and dynamic NPC 'diplomacy' AI I've seen. In single player things can occur that make these characters with random abilitiesstatsand dispositions to behave like real adversaries and allies. Here's a case example.  I was the king of Poland
Definitely better than the predecessorand already one of my favourite Paradox games.
Like every other Paradox gameit's one worth buying. Instead of controlling a nation in Europa Universalishere you control your dynasty throughout the medieval times. Very deep game-play and truly fun.
Many hours playing this gameendless hours thinking about it.
an incredibly deep adictive grand strategy game
A brilliant grand strategy gamewith more depth than any other game of this type that I have played.
Can't recommend this game enough. Complex to a different level.  The gameplay is so interesting it will make you play for hours on end once you get the hang of it. Saying that itdoes requires massive amounts of research and trial and error to actually figure out how to play. Well worth the time investment though and provides massive amounts of content for the price.  definitely one for the patient.
So amazing! Gives you a better idea of why European history was so F@#ked up during the medieval (late medieval?) period.  Watch a Youtube tutorial rather than the ingame tutorials.  Recommend these DLC Sword of Islam DLC  Legacy of Rome DLC Republics DLC Old Gods DLC  (Also am excited about the proposed expansion into Europa Univeralis IV)   http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?590153-Reference-%E2%80%94-Ports-savegames-metaserver-chat-and-other-resources   Ports to open for HOSTING are 1630 to 1641  UDPTCP according to official correction of manual  This tutorial was what I watched to learn how to play  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJhoyHE26lg
It takes Grand Strategy and adds a dose of RPG.
AWWWWWW YEEEEAAAAHHHHH  CKII Is one of the most imersive and gripping games I have played in years. It can be daunting at firstbut once you get to grips with the game it is incredibly rewarding. The twiststurns and foils that await you in medieval europe are incredible. Pretty much everytone will try and have you deposed or murdered as you try and usurp and murder your way to being some kind of maniacal Mercian despot.
Awesome stuff! Patience required to get a handle on all the menus and tactics - worth the time if you put it in!
Crusader kings II lets you carve out an Empire from humble beginningssow your families seeds across the continentrule anything from a county to an Empire
Its a greatin-depth startagy game. Yes it may be a little expensive for the whole collectionbut I found myself playing it hours on end. Its one of those games you cant put down.
Crusader Kings II is an incredible game! It is challengingengaging and extremely fun. You have to take a few hours to learn the mechanicsbut it's well worth it. While not the most visually appealing game
Crusader Kings 2 is one of the best grand strategy games to date. I have sunk innumerable hours into this game and will sink many more into it. It's the kind of game you play and it's suddenly next week and your girlfriend has left you. But it isn't for everyonethe learning curve is a little steep and it may seem hard to get into but the time is worth it as this is the most fun I've have with a strategy game since I first got into the Civilization series.
Buy this and watch your hours just disappear! Incredibly difficult learning curvebut after 24 hours playedI think I'm starting to get the hang of it! Now lets just declare war on the king of Norway before my wife decides to off my first-born son and heir from a previous marriage. Oh no
I love this game. I would not think I would like the whole politics aspect of it coming from Civ 5but I fell in love with my first playthrough. Even failure is fun. Get it while it is 10 bucksits worth it
Great game. You might not play battles like in Total War games but it's superior on almost every other aspect. If you like strategy games and the medieval settingthis is for you.
If you ever have too much Time on your handsthis is a perfect sink to make those hours dissappear :)
This is one of the most complex games I've ever playedyetit yields such a satisfaction when you muster it (very different from mastering it) and start playing more and more games. I love history
This game rules. Especillay with the right mods. It's like you are playing your own version of Game of Thrones in Europe.
Without a doubt one of the best RTS games I have ever played. CKII is currently beating the Total War franchise on my playlist. Just take your time picking it upthe learning curve is steep because the game is quite complex.  I cannot recommend this game highly enough
Great gamecomplicatedbut fun and hilarious. Buy it.
Whether it is through growing your realm from a single county to a mighty European empireconquering the Holy Land and becoming King of Jerusalemmurdering your oldest son to ensure the kingdom's safety in the hands of your more kingly younger son
I've put more time into this game than anything else in my Steam collection and there's still way more I haven't experienced. Steep learning curve but totally worth it. My favourite Paradox game. Possibly my favourite game period.
Would crusade again!
At first lookCrusader Kings seems a complex and for sureit can please to machiavellian strategists that like to play on both side and treacherously fall prey on both camps to get the money and the cake. However
This is easily the game of the year for me. Past two yearshonestly. I've spent countless hours alternating between tyrant and pipsqueek upstart trying to avoid being squashed. Don't buy the Aztec DLCbut I can recommend the rest of the add-ons without reservation.
Well what can i possibly say to recommend this game to you without sounding like a paranoidmurderingfratricidal
I could make this as detailed as I wantbut considering I've only hadlike
If you like killing babies and invading Poland this really is the tyranny simulator for you.
Yesalthough with the caveat that you should probably get it on salewith whatever DLC is most relevant to whatever you intend to buy. If that's plain old Catholic stuff
This game has been out long enough for you to find plenty of reviews and video gameplays (my favorite person to watch right now is Arumba at  http://www.youtube.com/user/arumba07  - if you are reading this: multiplayer match?). There isnt much I can say that hasnt been mentioned beforeso these are just my two-cents.  As to why I've spent a good part of my life playing this game: it has everything I liked from the Civilization and Total War series and what I missed from them. I was never really fond of the battles from Total War (I tended to just build unstoppable armies and quick-finish battles)but I loved the idea of managing an empire there were elements of micromanagement missing that kept me from feeling like I truly ruled my kingdom and vassals. Civilization just felt too much like a board game and Ive grown wearing of 4x games like it empires run on gold
This game is one of Paradox's masterpieces. You get to rule over a family as you must wrestle with pretendersJihadsyour damn King who keeps raising your levies and taxes
I have a very weird relationship with this game.  It's a grand strategy gameemphasis on the 'grand'. There's a lot of stuff to manage and even with the helpful tutorials (and there are a lot) it's easy to get lost. I'm not even going to pretend that I grasp most of the things involved in it. I just like playing for the random events and making alliances and foiling assassination attempts. Alsothe music is really relaxing. I've honestly never felt more relaxed when raising armies to fight off the Vikings who have been raiding my coasts for the fifth time that week.  I guess if you want a very deep
A truly awesome game. Great introduction to the grand strategy genre too.
Absolutely amazing game that I would recomend any player of strategy games to play and get addicted to
Get the DLCs for a fully enjoyable experience. Solid game otherwise.
another amazingly well done grand strategy game by Paradox Interactive to join the ranks of Europa UniversalisHearts of IronSengoku
The Queen is deadlong live the King Singers'
It is good.
Crusader Kings II is a game that may seem very confusing in the beginningbut once you've learned the basicsyou've discovered an amazing grand strategy game that will have you playing it for hours and hours
This isin my humble opinon at least. The best game paradox has made to date.   The game world can go anywhere from tengri hungary invading france to cuman coptic caliphs of castille invading mauretaniaand such crazy things does happen on a regular basis in-game (the two mentioned were player made scenarioes
Really fun and addictive RTS. Its pretty complicated and can be frustrating for the first bit with its inadequate tutorials. Since I've got the hang of it I have not been able to stop playing.
Oh sureyou can play this game and not kill your family members who may or may not be plotting to take your titles and your life....or you can imprison them allexecute them
A really incredible strategy game. The perfect Total fuck Simulator.
I reccomend this game for those that enjoy extremely in depth political strategy games. There is a lot to learn and it may be very overwhelming at first but very rewarding after the initial learning curve.
The learning curve of this game is pretty steepbut once you get over it this game will suck you in! I haven't had a game suck me in like this one since... wellI'm not sure. It's so much fun to manage an empire and build strategy based on characters/rulers and such
Amazing game! For those who wish there were more dynasty and diplomacy options in Civilizationthis game is for you. Incredible stories and no game is ever the same. Must buy!
A definite must for those of you that want a good strategy game.  Paradox Interactive has a history of gems like Crusader Kings II that blends turn-based stretegy and some role playing elements. For instanceyou can create a character that you can play in a historically accurate world and make decisions based on how you (or your character) would react.   Solet me discuss the strategy part of Crusader Kings II. Firstly
One of the best sratagy games I hae ever played
Crusader Kings II is an unbelievable game that I would recommend to anyone who has an interest in Medieval history. It's a slower gameand it takes a long time to really figure out how to play the game and maximize its full potential. This game focuses less on economy and warfareand more on political decisions and your house (family dynasty). This is 'Game of Throne' the videogame
This game is lovely for many reasonsOne of which is the Dynamic gameplay and the fact that the game is ever ongoingIf you have plans to attack France for instance and take Paris for the English crown you can do so
Did You Know? The origin of the military term 'irregulars' can be traced to the Ottoman Empire when legions of Turkish troops would line up to commit an heinous doodoo uponst the invading armies.
Brilliant. It has a decently sized learning curveand you need to get your feet wet into the shallow end of medieval history before you know what you're doingbut once you jump that hurdle it is an amazing experience.
Amazingaddictivejust...so in depth. Use your friends names for your kin and see how far they go!
This game is quite possibly one of the finest and most in-depth strategy games that exists. It's very much one of those 'just one more turn kind of gamesand once you get the hang of it
Best Medievil strategy game of all time which focuses upon the relationship of characters in a dynamic and quasi-realistic setting.
This game is addicting.
A map-painting grand strategy game with a twist: instead of playing a countryyou play a character. Build your dynasty in the feudal era through murderintrigue
A very good gamea bit complex when you start but when you've learned the basics it really gets to you.
It's a strategy game with stong RPG elements. You take the role of a ruler (KingDukeEmperor) in Europe and guide your country through history (870s-1300s). You manage your family
If you like the big strategy part of the Total War games and are fascinated with royalitymarriages and intrigues: this is the game for you. Play it. Never before have I been so engaged to a game character that I lovedhated or wanted to die as fast as possible.  Also: Wikipedia links for important people that you might encounter in the game.  And if that's not enough: there is a great 'A Song of Ice and Fire' mod.
Honestly i love this gamei find myself getting intrested in the history. or picking some random place and following as close to historical ends as i can. i would highly reccommend it. I wont lie it dose have pretty wear tutoriali had to watch several vids on YouTube
This is a fantastic game with great depth and amazing levels of play. Not only can you fail but you can Fail BIG TIME. Some of the most enjoyable moments are when your hard won empire suddenly fractures because your inbred weakling of a son inherits the Empire and you Genius Nephew suddenly rises up in revolt. This is a hilarious game and a lot of fun not only are the developers continuing to push out content for this for at least another year all the DLCs are reasonbly priced and you do not need to purchase all of them for the game to work just pick and choose the ones you would like to play. I would highly recomend this game for fans of CIV5TOTAL WAR and other games in that genre.
This game is top notch as far as living the life of a lord. There is just so much to do it can feel very overwhelming at first. If you like to read a lotor sit and strategizethen this is your game. If none of that sounds good please don't even bother.
Incredible depth and interesting to playthis game is HARD. Using the word game is difficultas it's a simulation of historical sweeping change as you attempt to maneuver your dynasty into a situation where you can control as much of Europe as possible. I've had times where things seemed to be going well
As a fan of the grand strategy game genrethis one satifies my love of dynastic succession. Now if I can only become good at all aspects of the game. If you enjoy Europa Universalisyou'll enjoy this.
Better than EU3
Extremely fun game if you have the patience to learn how to properly play it. At first I was a little disheartened considering how much there is to this game and I didn't feel like I would ever learn how to play it properlybut after doing the tutorial twice and doing many practice rounds (start with Irelandit's called 'Tutorial Island' for a reason) I realized just how many mechanics there are to this game and how amazingly done they really are. If you love a pure strategy game that focuses on the politics behind things
BEST. GAME. EVER.   After three generations of toilmy independent lord of Dublin finally united the different counties into the kingdom of Ireland. Everything prospered and went well for three more generations. My people loved meI had enough funds to crush the futile advances of the Welsh kingdom. All was well.  I didn't see any problems that my descendant
Words cannot even explain how good this game is. The amount of replayablility is insane: hundreds of characters over several start dates with tons of different strategies. If you somehow do all of thoseyou can just make your own! 10/10 would bang.
This game... :-D  Grand Strategy meets Game of Thrones with a little RPG and maybe a smidge of Football Manager.
This game is fucking awesome. Best grand strategy game ever.
Ever wondered what it would be like to be a King in middle ages? Fan of Game of Thrones itching to conquer the Iron throne with deceit? Are you burning with zealotry? Do you think think modern game have too many armies and not enough marriages? This is the game for you! With regular DLCs and updatesthe game stays fresh no matter how many times you play it. Recommended for every strategy fan out there.
Love Paradox games and this started out as no exception. It's bigcomplexand detailed. Once you get the hang of it you can chug through rather nicely. For me
Crusader Kings II was mentioned in 'Games you might not have tried #4' by Extra Credits.  http://penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/games-you-might-not-have-tried-4   This was enough for me to pick it up in the Pardox Collection and I am hooked. The learning curve is steepand definitely required some extra curricular research just to figure out where to startbut once the game clicks
Game of Thrones-Them-Up/Game of Thrones Simulator 2013
Nice entry-level grand strategy game. If you want to get into othermore complex grand stratsthis is the place to start.
I am in love with this game. Incredibly deep and complexCrusader Kings II is comparable to game such as Dwarf Fortress in terms of storytelling capacity. Is the interface unintuitive? Yes. Does the game have an Eve Online-caliber difficulty curve? You bet. Is its emergentopen ended-style gameplay more satisfying and interesting than any precooked experience provided by AAA titles? Absolutely. If this sounds appealing
Not for everyone. This game makes you attempt to conquer Europe (or not) by navigating the annoyances of the Feudal system. Relationshipsfamily and otherwisewill make or break your game
What can I sayI'm a sucker for Paradox games... The first one CK:DLV was one of my favs and this is no different! There is no 'flash' to this game but just good old deceitful strategy to keep or maintain your crown! Gets a 9/10 from mejust because you cannot play non-Catholic factions...yet.  Edit- Even though some may say that the DLC flux for this game is another company gouging people I say that each DLC is well though out and adds to an already deep
You need to understand how to get a claim on another territory once you figure that out everything else can be discovered on your first playthrough. Very rewarding!
Have you ever wanted to be a sadistic fuckerimprisoning your homosexual firstborn and marrying your daughter to a Muslim? I know I doand this game is the best to fulfull that fantasy. Unfortunately you have to exhert some considerable effort into achieving your various goals
Awesome. A great introduction to grand strategy games. Guide your dynasty through a turbulent period of history with warfarestrategic marriagesand well thought-out expansion plans. Paradox's DLC policy is fantastic - every 'expansion' or 'dlc' has opened up a new set of characters to play (e.g. Islamic rulers
Definately the best dynasty/family simulartor out there. Add medieval governance and you are set.
Huge time sink and lots of fun
Nerdy? yes. Deep? yes. Steep learning curve? not so much. Best Paradox title to date? I dare say yes! This game is stellar. The DLC really add tootheir not just cash cows for the company. From the plots to the crusadesIts good to be King!!! 95%
Great gameimprove on every aspect of EU3and a nice 3D map. Also Game of throne mod is brill if you aren't into medieval europe.
Ever wanted to rule a kingdom? How about being a duke? How about keeping your bloodline pure by marrying your sister? Well then hey! This is the game for you! Also you can be the pope.
What's there not to like about scheming for global (or at least regional) domination. While the base game was lacking (no muslims)as soon as the Sword of Islam came out it became so much more awesome. And then the other DLC's improved it even further.  It is complex as helland might cause brain explosion through the first few playthroughs (in which you will assuredly die horribly)
This game is oddly addicting. I don't even know why I like it and play for hours. Yet I do.
Probably one of the best games I've played from Paradox Interactive. It is a solid game that surpassed my expectations of it. It's immersiveit's complexit's intriguing
Hard to learn but insanely satisfing to play.
This game is pretty complicatedbut it is fun with the Game of Thrones mod :)
Awesome game that is all about building up your bloodline to become a powerful faction in Europe. Tons of fun with a great modding community specifically the GAME OF THRONES mod!! Great game that is sand boxy and is easy to sink tons of hours into.
A deep and engrossing grand strategy game built around the themes of diplomacymarriagesubterfuge
Even though its crowned a strategy gameI'd say this is the only real RPG game I've ever playedand all developers who try to make RPG genre games should take CKII as an example of what RPG game should look like.
Amazing strategic game. It tooks around hour to understand rulesand then you can play it forever. Base game with DLCs is enough to make this game greatand there are amazing mods
Overly complicatedwith tons of aspects to learn. The learning curve is similiar to running head first into a car coming towards you at 100 km/h. Still once you figure out the basicsthis is by far my favorite strategy game of all time. I am still learning new things after 150+ hours.

I don't know how to explain why this game is amazing. It simply is. Everyone I have met who has played it is simply engrossed. Whether it is by the desire to conquerthe intrigue of state diplomacyor simply getting revenge on their brother-in-law whose wife plotted to kill their son. This game will draw you in and before you know it you will be marrying your neice to the son of a rival country in order for their eventual grandchild to have a decent opinion of you so you can call on his aid in a war against your cousin whom you had excommunicated.
A wonderfully complex political and military strategy game. With my political machinationsmy dynasty went from Kings and Queens of Hungaryto counts of the invading Turks after our conquest
Great strategy game just remarkable!!!!!!
This game is to diplomacy and characters what Total War is to real time massive battles. If you could merge the overall campaigns of this game with the battles of Total War i would become a recluse and never leave my room because i would be too busy playing.
Cannot think of a negative thingexcept the learning curve. But it is totally worth it.
Deep and complexbut totally addicting. Best medieval kingdom sim out there.
For fans of character based drama and strategy games you need to check this out. My sister-in-law plotted against meso I had her executed. Her daughter did the same thingleft to rot in jail. This continued down that line of women for a good 4-5 generations before they all died off. Sometimes your relatives are a pain
Do not be daunted by the wealth of information and options presented to you. At it's core this is game about people and the lives they lead. There are few games as engrossing and deep as thisand will surely be remembered as a classic for all time.  Or at least for 1066-1400 or so
A very different take on epic strategy. The focus is definitely more on characters than general empire management which I don't find too ideal. I do love the feudal system howeverwhere you levy troops from your vassalsand you can have your troops levied by your liege and so on. Has a Game of Thrones mod if that's more your bag than medieval.
I've never been more engrossed in a historical simulator. Whether you're a countdukeking
The game is unique in that it deilberately shoos things like battlesand war in favor of not fun things like diplomacytrade
Very complex and relatively easy to get into after learning the lingo (de jureduchyetc). If you have a passing interest in grand strategy games
Incredibly in depth strategy game. Every game runs on the same map of Europe and the Near East from the eleventh century to the fifteenth century. In the game one takes control of a lineage of Kings rather than a country. There is no win scenarioone simply plays until the year 1453. A score is assignedbut the real joy is taking your small country and building it into the preeminate powerhouse of medievil Europe.
Complexe but oh so fun. Has an amazing replay value!
One of the very best strategy games I've ever played. The interface and controls are difficult to masterand the learning curve is steepbut if Civilization is a game about exploration
Crusader Kings II is quite an amazing game for any grand strategy fansWith all the DLC (As of now Sunset InvasionThe Merchant Republic
My wife has joined a war against my Kingdom three times and has refused to become my vassel. 50 gold coins latermy assassin has finished her off for good and my sonwho has been in her control for the past 30 years has gained her county and accepts my offer to join the Kingdom of Ireland. However
Crusader Kings II lets you become any leader you want to be between 1066 and 1466. You forge strong alliances and/or wage massive wars. Leave a great legacy or be a smudge on the face of history. You decide your end. Takes place throught all of Europe and parts of northern Africa and western Asia. Rating: 8 Dukes of Kent out of 10
This game is a different kind of game than most that I playeven with respect to other strategy games. It's realtime event driven strategywith battles in between.  What this game is about is building your dynasty. Your family. Garnering power for yourself and your children
One of the Best Strategy games i have played all year.
At first this game is very hard to learn and understandbut if you grunt through itthe game becomes very fun and addicting.
if you have not playedyou will not understand
Its the best strategy game I've played in a while i'd recommend to any fan of the strategy genre
oopsi just went to war with half of europe and now all of my heirs have been assassinated.
Propably the hardest of the Paradox strategiesbut at the same time it's the most interesting and exciting title from them. Instead of controlling a lifeless countryyou control a person who also happens to own some land. You can control anything from a small county to half the Europe covering empire. With the Old Gods DLC you have about 500 years of time to mold the world and choose the faith of your dynasty.  The UI in the game is propably the best of the Paradox strategies. It's still lacking some important data as well as hotkeys
Do you enjoy grand strategy games? Are you good at resolving interpersonal disputes with gifts of coinsbookstitles and the occasional dagger in the back? If your answer was yes
hey if you aren't playing this game you are a huge piece of fuck.
Crusader Kings II is an amazingly fun gamewell worth the steep learning curve.
This is possibly the Best game i have ever played. im majorly into grand time strategy and this game fit my category perfectly. 1000 out of 1000 stars!
Yesyes! A million times yes!
Best medieval TBS. All the diplomacy of the crazy middle ages and then some! Very similar to the main concept of Medieval (one) Total Warbefore the strategic part got dumbed down in the later installations of the franchise.  In other games you are good if you killed everyone. Here you are good if you survived!
I was a huge fan of the Total War series and I still ambut I found myself enjoying the map more than the battles. That was were Crusader Kings 2 came in and took over days of my life. With the DLC it is even better but as Paradox is AWESOME they add the features of the DLC in but you cannot utilise them. I am playing a hugely fun game as the Byzantine Empire (harder than it looks). As I expanded into Africa I got a Jihad called upon me and am having a whale of a time defeating the hordes! The content is brilliant and beneath a phenomenal UI is a complex game that draws you in tighter and tightercompelling you to play more. The mods are fabulous
Oh yesdear godthis is the fuck! + Game Of Thrones mod.
Very goodnot too difficult to learnand REALLY fun.
Really nice game to pick upespecially if you like the grand strategy genre or are familiar with other Paradox titles such as EU4. The tutorial doesnt do a great job of explaining things and there is so many interlinked systems that getting a grasp of them all will be difficult. Be prepared to watch Youtube vids so you cannot horribly fail your first games. The game also has quite a few multiplayer bugs but it is not too bad. Overall it works well with friends or by yourself and you will spend many hours in games.... too many. Definite buy if you can get it on sale or if some friends have it and are willing to start an epic campaign with you.
Very good 'roleplaying' strategy game
The finest Medieval eugenics simulator set to the background of constant wartreacheryillegitmate fucks and heresy. 10/10 would kill 7 children to inherit Finland again
best game i have ever played although i love these type of games
This game is amazing.   There are so many things you can do: Usurping titleswaging holy warsplotting against your brother-in-law
This is a terriffic game for strategy fanswith a strategy play a bit like the Total War series in that it uses a fixed map with pre-existing towns and provinces. It is real-time rather than turn basedbut you can pause it to study the situation and give orders. The RPG elements give the game more personality than most strategy games. You play as the successive heads of a royal family
Has taken me a while to get into it. I really love it idea of grand strategy gamesbut the scope has been far to grand. But It's getting betterand some day Denmark will overtake the rest of scandinavia..  The music is very moodsetting
Expand your DynastiesFail at Crusadingand have too many sons in gavelkind succesion
This game is epic. Paradox really are the masters of grand stategy games. This however is there best title so far. They have finally made the game graphically brillant as well as a complete overhaul of the tutorial system making the steep learning curve much smaller. A must have strategy tilte for anyone that loves a complex and time consuming strategy game to immerse themselves in.
better than the public education system
From a CK II newb (never touched CK I or any other related product) here is my review:  First 10 hours : WTF is this fuck.  After that: This fuck is amaaaaazing.
Addictivethought provokinghistorically accurate
I know what literally two of the buttons do in this gameI daresay the 10543 are very useful too.
Wellthis is whole ecosystem by now with all its DLCsbut it is so incredibly deep
A Great game. recommend buying this game if you like strategic games.
44844
I'll admitafter the more war-focused Universialis gameI didn't take to this one so well. After watching Game of Thrones
Deep strategy with a personalslightly RPGish touch. Fantastic game.
This game is a huge improvement over Crusader Kings. The graphics are leagues bettersome exploits have been removed (such as conquering loads of pagan counties early one)the new plot system gives AI characters much more personality. The game runs at least as well as CK I during the late game where the data starts to slow things down. On the minus side
Definetly a game I would recommend to anyone who enjoys history and/or strategy games. The game is meticulous in the details and has a very unique style to it. The objective is not to conquer the world or anything like that necessarilybut instead to ensure your family (dynasty) continues on. Before anything though I would not recommend this game for people who do not want to sit and learn how to play. It is not too accessibleand for the first couple of hours i was like HUH? WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? but once you learn the ropes it is quite enjoyable. What makes it fun though is the literal unpredicability of the game. You may be a good ruler
If there was ever a perfect formula for a 'Game of Thrones' gamethis would be it. Manage your chosen dynasty through the middle ages in this incredibly deep strategy game. Be warned thoughit also comes with a steep learning curve.
Crusader Kings II delivers all the intrigue and political strategy you are looking for. Filled with both random and dynamic branching events based on your choicesplay-throughs can be radically different in outcomes. This game has a monster tutorial system to wade throughbut the patient will be well rewarded with some of the most challenging empire building they are likely to find in any game.
This is an excellentunconventional strategy game. Unlike other strategy gamesyour goal in Crusader Kings 2 isn't so much to conquer anything- though that can be a goal- as it is to ensure your dynasty's survival against complex intrigue
An unbelievably good mix of rpg elements into an immersive grand strategy game leaves Crusader Kings II feeling like two games mixed into one. I was expecting playing this game much like any other grand strategy gamebut that preconception was shattered when though some well placed royal marriages my miniscule dutchy of Connacht had somehow gained sovreignty over the whole of Sweden. The game plays well and is fun to boot by leaving room for a willful suspension of disbeliefthe sheer power of intrigue in this historical context makes itself evident. Just as with any grand strategy game
I am hopelessly lost in this type of game. What I like is the high production valuesand detailed simulation of a medieval kingdown. I want to conquer the world as Wales.
I don't play violent video games. That's why I don't kill people. But I do play Crusader Kings II. That's why I am currently married to my cousinplotting an assassination of my country's ruler and preparing for an invasion of a neighbour.
this game is marveloushours and hours of epicness in a medieval time. a lot of possibility and each new time you play it you aren't bored of it.
It's what the Game of Thrones video game should've been -- there's even a Song of Ice and Fire mod for it. It's in-depth midieval politics and dynasty gameplay. I definitely recommend it if you're a fan of hardcore strategy games.
I mean if you see how many hours I put into the game you think that I need help from playing this wonderful game.  Well your wrong and you should feel bad.
It's simply awesome. I'm loving this gameand I keep going back to it even though Europa Universalis was released a while ago. The depth of it is ridiculousso expect putting alot of hours into it before you get everthing that happens. My favorite game of 2013. 10/10
This game. This effin' game has inflicted unforeseenly severe addiction spikes on me. No other game has done it quite like this one. Spending hours and hours on building and managing your ever growing medieval kingdom in the medieval world. Ruling your kingdom with a sim-like feel on the game with character traits gives the game experience a nice touch of livelyhood and fun choice options. Will you be a kind ruler who tries to win his subjects' favor through justice and being rational or be a cruel and sadistic ruler who shamelessly stomps on everyone's requests and demandsand who particurarly likes to throw little children in prison and execute themor even blind and castrate them? The large amount of possibilities and events are bound to keep you entertained for quite some time.  Medieval history haters and those passive towards it must step aside or risk invoking deep hatred towards this game for being too 'complicated' and 'boring'. This game finds its juice in its historical aspects of how the world worked during the medieval period. Family and Dynasties being the key to all forms of ruling and inheriting. You play from 1066 to 1453
An excellent grand strategy set in Medieval Europewith an intriguing twist : instead of taking a direct control of an European realmyou take control of a landed noble of your choice. Whether you're a petty duke
And Robb. Robb had been more a brother to Theon than any son born of Balon Greyjoy's loins. Murdered at the Red Weddingbutchered by the Freys. I should have been with him. Where was I? I should have died with him.  8/10good clean fun but the multiplayer requires Hamachi
I absolutely love CK2. It's a hugeenthralling and intelligent game where nearly everything is an internally-consistent simulation. Its focus on characters and families makes it infinitely more engaging and human than any other grand strategy game it isn't even fair to describe it as one. Think of it instead as a soap opera for men.  Just be warned. Once you've embraced Crusader Kings II there is no going back to pretenders like Civ or Total War!
Play as a feudal lord in medieval europe. And reshape history to your liking
It takes a little while to get the hang of the gameplay and understand how to get things donebut it's worth it in the end. Don't give up right away because this game can be a lot of fun
I've played 400 hours of this........
If you love strategyyou'll love Crusader Kings!
I began by journey in 867 AD as the leader of Khazars in a land cradled by the Caspian and Black seas. From then I was invaded by Cumania and the Turks. To survive I led my armies into the harsh winter mountains of the Kingdom of Georgia in a war of desperation. This was wasn't my land or my peopleI had no claims but the survival of my noble name and court. Over the next ten yearsthe King of Georgia was disposed off after crowining myself King of two different lands
A Crusader Kings II/Medieval II: Total War hybrid would be one of the best strategy games in my opinion. CKII is more focused on the dynasty of noble families rather than the actual factions themselves like in M2TW. In essence it's a RPG focused on your faction's family. And with a video game set during the Medieval Agesthis makes perfect sense considering bloodlines were so important in distinguishing nobility from peasants. Thus the family tree is the most important thing in this game. Who your family members marry determines what you can have a title/land claim on and what land you could possibly inherit or disinherit down the road. Throughout the game you get event prompts--which acts as the primary role-playing element--and the decisions you make influence your campaign's outcome providing a sense of connection with you and the game. Overall an engaging game and one for those who desire more from the grand strategy genre.
SImply an amazing gamealmost like a drama that you directly control... but in medieval times... where u can get your sister to marry your cousin... cus you hate both of them...and you want to laugh at their deformed babies after
One of the singularly best games to come out for PC since 2010Crusader Kings II is a grand strategy game developed by Paradox. In CK2you play as head of your dynasty through the ages. The goal of the game
Awesomethe only thing missing are Naval battles!
Hard to get intobut really pulls you in once it clicks.
Crusader Kings 2 is one of the best games I have ever played. If you are fans of medieval historyRPGsgrand strategy games or a Game of Thrones this game has it all and with each update the game improves greatly.  I cannot recommend this game enough
It's crack. Plain &amp simple. If you can survive your first timethen you're hooked for life.
Pretty amazing simulator of a complex system of feudal nobility. Complexbut rewarding for a strategy nut who digs emergent story. The family dynamics surrounding dynasty and inheritance are astonishingly richand lead to great and terrible things.
If you love Game of Thronesthis is the game for you.  (WARNING:Very steep learning curve. For the first few hours you will be completly lost. You should definalty watch a lets play of this before getting it.)
The game just keeps pulling me back in month after month. Tons of updates and new content keep flowing. Good game to pick up if you like grand strategy.
Infinite game. You can play it over and over and over again and each time you'll find a different and challenging game. You can start as a small count or as a powerful emperor and you'll find challenges that fit the size of your domain. Totally recommend it.
StrategyAdministration and Warfare only paradox can combine these elements with such perfectionsimply amazing.
Toughchallengingand magnificently detailed
Fantastic gameindepth strategy of infightingpolitical intrigue and war. Beware of the steep learning curve
This game is perfect for people who play RTS or 4X Strategy gamesbut feel like most are missing the real political manipulation and underhandedness of the 'real' world(Real being in quotes because of the questionable reality of assasinating your own child so that your other child who seems more suited to the throne can be the heir apparent). The combat is not in the same universe as the Total War series
Great game. It is much better with dlc though. I would wait till it drops in price.
This is one of the most complex and engrossing games I've ever played. There's a ton of variability and no two games feel the same. It's even better if you use your imagine and roleplay a bit.   The only caveat is that the lurning curve his highbut the tutorials are helpful and Paradox has an active and helpful online community. The reward is definitely worth the investment.
An amazing strategy gamefilled with dramatic back stabbing and difficult decisions. Do you kill of your son's wife because she's not giving you grandchildren or do you invade Ireland today? Do you send the Pope some money or go on a crusade instead? This game has thousands of decisions that effect your game you can play it as a world conquering game or you can play a smaller game just trying to keep your family alive and in power.
Don't judge this game straight awaythis game is probably the most detailed game I have ever playedwith (literally) over 1000's of characters to play as. This game rewards and stresses you for your gameplay in so many ways.
If you like Game of Thrones you'll love this.
See that trailer up there? Nowpicture doing that IN WESTEROS FROM ASOIAF! Yeahyou need to sit through a few hours of tutorials just to get a grasp on the game. And yes
This game offers a staggering amount of depth in its modelling of feudal European politics. Keeping track of the lines of succession for every county in Europe quickly becomes quite complicatedmaking this a novel and engaging strategy game that offers a fresh twist in a world dominated by action-strategy. As with many `grand strategy' titlesthe open ended nature and lack of a compelling end game can make the experience feel a little tired after some time.
A kind of historical sandbox strategy game. Pick any European leader in the period coveredfrom the baron of bumfuck nowhere to the king of Franceand try to make your dynasty prosper as your vassals revolt
An engrossing experience from the top down. Knights of HonorRisk and Paradox's Clausewitz game engine all went into a room to smoke a truckload of crack and Crusader Kings 2 is what came out. Risk is a simple thing to enjoybut I have to admit that these political kingdom strategy games mostly don't sound that interesting even to me. The beautiful maps are what draw me in and Knights of Honor opened my mind to the genre
Ok I'm officially hooked by this strategy game! I'm just playing my first Irish dinasty and I'm already at 30+ hours of game time! CK2 is different because you manage your familyyour descendantscourt intrigues
Few games will steal hours of your life awaylike Crusader Kings 2. At times it can be clunky and navigating all the individuals relationships will lead you to tear your hair out. The military system needs a lot of improvement. The real time environment can be frustrating to work with.
Great gamevery hard to get into though so if you're looking to buy I would suggest looking up some youtube channels with guides on how to play. This will give you some idea on if this game truly is for you. Starting in you will be lost and this game will beat you down for it for at least the first 20 hours of game play and even then you are still learning at 50 hours of differnt things that can happen and will happen.   The DLC of this game just adds to the fun for those who stuck with the first hours of game play and have gained a suttle understanding of how to playand just show that paradox is still able to suport a game that is over a year old.
A great complex gamefun and challenging. Now even more with the Ironman modewhere every decision counts!
At first glancethis game seems complicated and monotonous with its meger graphics and loads of windows/selecctionsbut it quickly grows on you have to lock your wife away in a dungeon because she is speaking out against you. She is only doing so because she is cheating on you with your brother
Fun strategy game that will entertain you for manymany hours. But beware the learning curve is pretty steep. Once you start to understand the game it becomes a lot of fun. I suggest starting as one of the kings in Spain. It'll help you with combat and learning to fight.
This is the most complexdeepand surprising strategy game I have ever come across. Crusader Kings 2 has an extremely high learning curve and it takes many hours to pick up on what is happening in the game
A must-have for any strategy fans and conquerors alike. Not only are you playing a game of military dominationyou're also partaking in political warfare that can range from the position of count for a single territory to the throne of a great empirespanning multiple kingdoms. Religion
Better than Civ 5! Instead of controlling a civilization across all of human historyyou contol a dynasty of rulers so that when one diesyou take over as the heir. This makes the game much more dynamic. It's much more about managing interpersonal relationships than it is anything else. It never reaches that stage like in Civ 5 where you have established treaties with some countries and are just slogging through taking over somone across an ocean and spending all your turns just moving troops around or waiting for a tech to research. I highly reccomend it.
Such a wonderful game! And far too adiciting! It has stradegy like no other game. It is beautifuly crafted and has great dlc. Not only is the game fun but also beautiful! If you have any interest in conquering Europethen its for you!
Think game of thrones but set in medieval Europe (and nowwith Vikings)  What more could you want?
Hard to lernhard to master. but very very funny game.
Medieval politics simulator 2000. Murder babiesmarry your cousinsfun for all the family.
Best grand strategy game I've ever played
This dynasty simulator is nothing like I had ever played before. Not only ddo you lead a nation through the different time periodsbut you also lead your family to success as well. With the Save converter to Europa Universalisyou could possibly play a game through almost 1000 years of history which Is pretty awesome to think of. The only drawback to this game is that the learning curve is pretty high. I still find myself having to deal with the decisions that I made without knowing the consequences. However
If you wanna rule a kingdom or empire with your family andd deal with endless civil rebellion then this is the game for you! And if your thinking of picking up this game up just for the mods.. DO IT! The mod makers put more effort into detail of enjoyable whole new game then most the game dev team did in the game itselfBut non the less they gave a great system to build onEven if they don't give everything up front
A good fun game. If you like grand startegy you should allready play this game
Holy sh*t this gameit's absolutely probably my most favorite strategy game ever. Seriouslyextremely addicting
good gamehave a lot of depth
The biggest time-suck strategy game outside the Total War series.
This is a fantastic game. It's seems quite difficult and has a bit of a learning curve but once you get used to itit's a very rewarding game.  Rather than control a nation you control a dynasty and the game is basically how you interact with other characters in the game be they rulersbishops etc This makes it a very interesting game and the political intrigue is the best part. For example
One of the best games I've played. Great for crafting your own story and practicing medieval politics.
Awesome Grand Strategy game!
Probibly one of the most addictive game you can find. Alot of feeling when playing this game.
There's a lot that's great and engrossing about this gamewhich is both to its credit and oddly enough to its fault (as a dad with a full time job who can't afford to be too engrossed).   When you first startCrusader Kings II is big and intimidating. Tutorials introduce you to many aspects of the game
The game that made me love Grand Strategy. Take the Map aspect of Medieval Total Warmake it 100 times more complexand turn it into a complete game. Historical accuracy is impressive
At first this game is a baseball bat to the head and it hits hardafter a couple of 'failed' starts the game opens up a can of brilliance.
Sick now that learning how to play it lol...takes a long time to get the hang of it though
This game was not what I was expectingbut in this case that turned out to be a gaming experience I will never forget and will continue to come back to for years to come.  If you're a major European history buffor want to get into those really complicated grand-strategy games
Manthis game is soso addictive. If you've ever wondered what Britain would have been like without the Normans
This game is really good and addictive. There are some parts which are not fully polished but it may just be because I'm not using the latest version. All in all worth the price tag.
Detailed and complex without necessarily being complicated. Theres a learning curve like all other grand strategy gamesbut this game can be especially intriguing in the Just-One-More-Turn sensewith you wanting to see how far you can go to grow your dynasty and keep it from falling to pieces.
You can marry your own niece in this game. GOTW
I spied on some dudesthrew another dude in the dungeons because he didn't like methen had war declared on me. This all happened in about 30 minutes.  10/10.
Have you ever wanted to brutally murder your cousin who you just had a child with? No? Neither did I until I played this game! Now it's a common occurence!  But seriously this game is fantastic.
One of the greatest historical strategy games I've ever played. Crusader Kings II is filled with happiness and despairand can make for one of the most subtly intense experiences of all time. One moment you're annexing a small nation into your domainthe next your second cousin is waging a war against you for the crown. CKII melds combat strategy with politics in a way few games have done successfully and allows you to play at your own pace. However
super deep game playlots of fun.
Good historical grand strategy - focusing more on deception and politics over war.
Seriously one of the best games that I have on Steam. If you like historyor grand strategy gamesor just the most ridiculous scenarios imaginable in a middle ages setting
Slightly better than life  'Edited 2/15/2014' This game is actually the most tantalizing thing that has ever graced the world of strategy gaming. This game was born of Paradox interatives divine immaculate conception and mirrors this fact by the nature of the game the challenges in which can often being overcome by 'putting a baby in it'. Yes in crusader kings you can have sonsmany sons. With the assistance of dlc you can in fact create a ruler with 300% fertilityand bear a small kingdom of your seed. However
When I first heard about this titleI wasn't so sure it was for me. The layout of the menus didn't look simple enough to navigate and I wasn't entirely sure I liked the map layouts.  After taking the leap and actually purchasing the gameI was blown away. The reason for all of the difficult menus
Hey are you a fan off deathhistoryAlternate history
There was a time when i first started playing this game where i couldnt understand why i was fighting countless rebellions and losing all the time. Fast forward a few hundred hoursand i have killed countless brothersmurdered rivals
Fun game to play.
Play as a insane king who wants to kill himself. Play as a super horny queen who wants to 'get it on' with her nephew. Learn how much it must have sucked to be jewish in the middle ages.   This game has a learning curve to be sure. This game can be hardbut once you understand it will create the most insane stories for you to tell your friends.   In what other game can your wife also be your great grandma who births you a son whom you then can smother as a infant because thats how you get your jollies? I cant name a game anything like it. Buy it. Love it.
I quite like this gamethe combination of politicswarefare and tech is awesome and quite well balanced. ALso the fact that there are lots of mods out there onthe workshop means that you are likely to find any fixes for problems you have with the mechanics.
Amazing game with so many ways to play. Plus lots of amazing DLC. A must play for strategy fans.
What can i say ?  Oh yeahi've put just about 200 hours into this game and it's still suprising me. From Iceland to Indiathis game is huge in scale and yet detailed in more ways than you can imagine. Obviously the team behind it love this game and are still making huge updates to make it even better. If you haven't got it already
It is a nice and entertaining game. Too bad it is so very (corporate) greedy ( not the gamethe DEVS) in the DLC department...  All in all +.
Absolutely amazing game. Definitely the best sandbox style medieval dynasty simulator I've ever played.
This game in my opinon is one of the best games of all time and hands down the best Strategey game I have ever played it is a bit pricey but it is worth it the only problem is that you need a experenced player to teach you how to play because it has a large learning curve.
Build your armymarry into an empirekill veryone in front of you. Kid talks back to you
The game is very adicting to play. Even when your frustrated you still continue to play. Tough to put down and you will find hours become mere minutes
Possibly one of my favorite games. Not easy to learn but well worth the effort. A must have for history nerds.
I'd imagine this is the easiest grand strategy to get into. That saidgrand strategy is a whole lot of difficult and yet a whole lot of fun. It's easier to just watch gameplay that just read a reviewso go ahead and do that. Anyway
I'm usually pretty big on being able to fight the battles on a seperate map like the Total War seriesbut I can honestly say this is my new favorite game. This game takes strategic level thinking and planning to a whole new level.
A great game for someone who wants to really dig in and take the time to learn the game. This is not for casual gamers. 9/10
A bit tricky starting outbut not as difficult as some other Grand Strategy games out there. If you are a patient gamer that doesn't need flashy visuals to keep your interestand enjoy medievel history
Feudal Administrator Simulator 2012.      I never thought I would enjoy a game this tedious.    I've played Total War and Age of Empires my entire lifeand would have considered myself a strategy player. Howeveryou cannot be considered a true strategist until you have played Crusader Kings II. This isn't about the long game
If you like strategy gamesyou'll love this game. It takes a while to learn itbut once you do
One of the best strategy games I've ever played - A game that makes you punch the air with every succesful action or react in horror as a pretender to the throne kills off your heir. Also the game constantly reveals new quirksdiscovering new things and techniques just as you think you've mastered it.  Even without the modsadd-ons or DLC's
Great gamealways play it first when I need a break from work.
Entertaining
Hands down the best game Paradox have made yet. It's worth grabbing the DLC toobut hang about for a sale.
Greathours of fun!
In short amazingget the old golds dlc and go all norse on the world.  Just a brilliant game i overlooked for sooooooo long
I've been dreaming of a game about dynasty diplomacy in a historical or fantasy setting for a long timeso you can imagine I was pleased when I discovered this game. This is like A Song of Ice and Fire set in the real worldand if you appreciate the kind of diplomacy and backstabbing that this is about
Great entry to the Grand Strategy genre. Endless possibiliteslots of replay value and a great game to swill a glass of whiskey on the rocks around to.   Pros:  - Variety of strategy - Endless possibilites - Easy to learndifficult to master - Runs on most modern (last 5 years or so) PCs - Relatively lightweight and small download - Lots of great mods  Cons:  - Multiplayer is broken at the moment (as of June 2014) - DLCs often don't work - Mods often don't work - Most of the DLC are pointless ones you don't need (music
Best. Game. Ever. The learning curve for CK2 is quite steep but after you master it no other game comes even close to the mastery of this one.
Great game that kills many hourshowever it require patience so it's not for everyone
10/10 Would recommend
I've sunk hours into this game. I love it!
Awesome game. Very complex and hard to get intobut if you're a fan of medieval history I cannot recommend it enough just for educational value alone. Unline other games made by ParadoxCrusader Kings also has a much deeper connection to the characters and their relationships
Started a plot with my half-brother to assassinate our queenescalated into a full-fledged revolt for independenceachieved victory
It's prettier than its predicesors (though still not very pretty)full of menus and numbers. This shouldn't be fun. But as I guide the Scots through 400 years of conquestin-fighting
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON BUT IT'S SO FUN WHY DID I HAVE TO MARRY A 12 YEAR OLD THAT'S REALLY GROSS YO.
What can I say what hasn't already been said about CK II? And isn't already said by my insane amount of hours played?  The learning curve in the beginning can be a bit punishingbut there are several good guides online that should get you started and once the intricate mechanics became visible there was no turning back for me.
Assassinated wife to marry my lover. 10/10  Recommended.
You finally have a son who is a geniusbut he is 4th in line to your title. The first in line is a possessed cripple. The second is a syphilitic idiot The thirdstill only a child
Fun game. If you're a fan of GoTbe sure to check out the GoT mod.
Great tactical gamealot of fun mods including The Game of Thrones mode and Elder Scrolls modswould highly recommend for those that like large scale tactical games.
I've never had so much fun marrying my sister to our uncle and assasssinating my brother and taking his fuck. I also enjoyed sacrificing my mother to the All Father. I would recommened this game to anyone who doesn't mind spending about 2 weeks trying to figure out how to play. 8/10
This is one of the best strategy games I've ever playedand there's all kinds of mods that make it even better.  Give it a try.
10/10.. If you're insane you can appoint Glitterhoof as your new chancellor..
This is probably the most complex game of it's type that I've ever seen. It has amazing depth and can play differently every time. It is definitely less 'wargame' than something like the TotalWar seriesbut I find it just as enjoyableor more so. It really is a medieval simulator. Players get a choice of military conquests
One of the best games I've played for yearsa bit of a learning curvebut once you get over that
Love this game. Don't like that the only way to earn achievements is to play iron man mode but it is a great game either way!
Great gamegood mod community
You know how there was SimCityand then the Sims took the simulation thing to a whole new dirty level? Imagine a grand strategy game... but instead of playing a kingdom or a civilizationyou're playing the fucks and despots who rule a kingdom. Throw in messy political marriages
Wonderfully fun and addictive gamewhich also teaches you why history is so incredibly f-ed up.  9/10
The 'My Mother is younger than i am' simulator. 10/10.
I unified IrelandScotland and Germany all under one crown and then joined a crusade to retake Greece from the Muslims who had already decimated the Byzantines. I then usurped the Empire and capitulated the Pope. My character then got the plague. My son who had converted to Islam took the throne. I am now an Irish Muslim count in the middle of Germany with no kingdoms. Yay. That basically sums up the rollercoasters of this game. BUY IT.
This game is AMAZING. I must admiteven after 80+ hours of playing thisI can't really consider myself good at it in any way
Fun! Punishingbut extremely fun if you have the patience.
A great game for anyone who appreciates grand strategy games with a focus on invidivual rulers and their courts. Works great in multiplayer and will eat up a ton of your time since it's so addictive.
I pressed a claim on land that used to be minewon the warimprisoned the local Duke who was there
Awesome game. Amazingly deep strategy and even after tons of hours I'm still discovering new things.
Fantastic game. Very steep learning curveas is the case with Paradox gamesbut in the end very rewarding and very satisfying indeed.
Funvery fun! Very moddablevery good game.
Young persondo you like history? PC gaming? Mastermindind the downfall of your enemies over several generations?  Then buy this game!  Did you ever wish to be a king? To rule a country with an iron fist?   Then buy this game!  TO UNITE THE WORLD UNDER YOUR BANNER?  Yesyou can do all that. If you buy this game! Buy this game!  With over 250 hours played since this game was given to me
The greatest random story generator ever written. The game's systems are labyrinthine (good) and occasionally unrealisticbut they're much closer to medieval politics than anything else out thereand the modding community has made them even better. It's a peculiarly masochistic gamer that will enjoy this game
Ever had the urge to marry your mother-in-lawkill herthen marry your sister? All while sending your cavalry to pillage neighbouring lands? With CKII you can do that.  You can also raid from the sea
You can play one instance of this game for months. You can plot to assassinate people. You can rename every province (of which there are many) to whatever you want. You can excommunicate your parents for looking at you funny. You can get gored by a wild boar. You can command multitudinous military leviesand send them all to the other side of Europe for a lark. You can have affairs with random courtiers and never face any real consequences. You can change history completely.  It's a good gameall told.
Medieval fun for the whole family!
I learned to never trust my heirs or dukes. Ended uo assassinating many people. 8/10 Would buy and play again.
Surprisingly addictive take on the strategy genre. Take over a dynasty rather than a country and focus on diplomacy and interpersonal relations. Oftentimes it's the kind of diplomacy that involves sending somebody to plant a poisonous snake in the bed of a child who happened to inherit land you wanted. You terrible human.
it's incredibly addictive. ALL HAIL SUNE THE GREAT
This game has so much depthyou'll jump in and never see the bottom.
Great strategy gameone of the bestspecially with the DLCs
This game is the peanut butter to Civ 5's jelly. It's a whole other side of stategy games I didn't know existed until recently. Granted it has a steeper learning curve than Civ games but I feel it's more rewarding. Once you figure it out you'll do ANYTHING to keep your dynasty alive.  I've already put probably 50+ hrs in and this isn't even looking at all the DLC.  PLUSit has a Game of Thrones mod which is incredibly well done.  Worth $40? Yeswithout a doubt. Worth $10? I fucking think so!
Absolutely incredible strategy game. If you want to know what it is like to be a character in Game of Thronesthis is the game for you.
What Europa Universalis does for its simulation of ruling a countryCrusader Kings does for a ruling a family/dynasty. It showcases the limitations of power with which a medieval ruler had to contend. You control landbut most of it is in the hands of your underlings. Amies are not unified formations but bands held together by men loyal or maybe not so loyal to you. Be careful of overmighty vassals or be one yourself. Scheme
Strategy Game + Medieval Europe + The Sims + Game of Thrones = Crusader Kings 2
My ruler went on a crusade and came back to a son who's slept with his sister and a wife who left him for his brotherbecame queen of Castillethen declared war on him... not much more to say really.
I first heard of this game back in the summer of 2012. I really enjoy Classical and Medieval historyso with a name like 'Crusader Kings'this game caught my attention on YouTube. I saw a Let's Play someone had done of it and I was actually caught off guard by the learning curve. It was unlike anything I had seen before. I come from the likes of Sid Meier's Civilization series which doesn't have as much strategy involved with it. Don't get me wrong. Civilization can be tough
I have played this game someseems decent.
Still debating between CK2 and Total War: Rome II as my favorite strategybut CK2 is definately up there. A slightly new twist on my favorite Total War series games by including a much more in depth political system. Things sutch as being excommunicated by the pope could make a fair impact on your game. Still getting over the 'Sunset Invasion' where the aztecs invade europebut overall i really like CK2 and would recommend anyone who enjoys strategy games
Just from a glace at the reviewsyou probably get a pretty good idea about what it's about. CKII is about managing political intrigue and your own personal royal family while maintaining a strong and united enough duchy/kingdom/empire to expand. A lot of the game is just a son-murdering and prisoner-ransoming simuatorand that's what makes this game so very unique in the grand strategy genre. This game just gets grand strategy so right.  I've already sunk a few dozens of hours in the game
Incredibly engaging grand strategy game. It's Game of Thronesminus the fantasy stuffbut including the incest
Addictive and oft times semi-weirdbut really awesome and fun.
Incredibly detailed and fun game.  The learning curve might be a tad steepbut after you finish the hours of watching Youtube videos and trying and failing to play and start to understand the game's mechanicsthe game pays for itself and the time spent learning it many times over.
Not for the faint of heart.
i am doing this for the badgebut seriously it is good.
Excellent gameencourages genius breeding and incest.
This game allows for some glorius fun. The events are awesome and it encourages and allows you to do some thingsthat while historically accurateare down right evil (like murdering all your brothers after inheiratance under gavelkind to get all your stuff back). I found the game most fun when I didn't really know what I was doing
20 hours of Let's Play videos30 some odd hours of playtimeand I'm still not always sure what I'm doing. This game is amazing and has infinite replay ability. 10/10
Think Risk. Now think a game of Risk where every country is broken up into dozens of smaller ones. Now think about that game where different people control those different parts. Now think about all those countries fightingplottingbuilding
Incredible Depthsone of the best strategy games I've played.
Everything was going peacefully in my Duchythen I get hit on the head in my battlefall into a coma and die.  'It`s alright'
This is THE grand strategy game. And I am not just saying that because I'm drunk.
Most people don't think infanticide could possibly be a good thing. Until they've played this game. This game will show you that it's just a useful tool you never understood before.
Never before has a game made me contemplate killing my own children. Still not sure if that's good or badbut I enjoy the game nonetheless.
So good its criminal!
Do not trust anybody when playing this gameleast of all your own family.
I mean you've got CRUSADES and KINGS in this gamepeople
I call this game Arranged Marriage the game because that's what you'll be doing a lot of. I would descirbe it as extremely advanced risk set in medieval times.
Became Lollard island as scotland. 10/10 Would F*ck with Europe again
This has to be my favorite Rts of all time. In Crusader Kings II your goal is to become the most piousprestegiousand rich in all of the known world (at the time). The way you do this is completely up to you. Marry your daughters off to powerful leaders for their allegiance. Make money through controlling trade routes. Decieve your way into wars to steal your neighbor's territory. I feel like this is what it would be like to rule at this time. If a vassal of yours is plotting against you
Seriously funfairly difficultgreat fun!
Probably the best and most addicting strategy game I've ever played. Similar to Total war (another favourite of mine) but far more similar to a game of thrones style game play than epic battles on the field. If your into politicsback stabbingpower grabbing and trying to keep together a kingdom against feuding lords this game is for you. 11/10 Must buy!
Middle ages Hitler incest simulator 2012
WOW  This game is amazingalthough it has very deep learning curves and a lot to learn.  I am still a beginner at this game but watching my Dynasty grows stronger and stronger ( or weaker if you will ) makes me happy.   SometimesI feel like I am running a dating show
Although a bit pricey at this pointif you want all the DLC (and you do want all the DLCtrust me on this)
This game is like crack. Child murderingMongol conqueringpolygamous crack. Once you learn how to play the game
The best strategic parts of the Civilization and Total War series combine in Crusader Kings 2. Vastly superior to Civilization 5!
I've lost plenty of hours to this game over the past couple months. The rich strategy and detail that has gone into it impresses me constantly. With plenty of additional DLC which can further augment the gameI have no doubt that people who give it a chance will have fond memories of bring EuropeAfrica and the Middle East under their heels. Set in the later portions of the Dark Ages and moving into the Middle Ages
The best Grand Stragety I've ever played along with great role playing as well.  10/10
Probably the best 'A Game of Thrones' game you'll ever play.
One can sink a lot of time into this game. You can build an empirelose it allthen build it up again. The heartbreak experienced when you train your child to be great
Best strategy game i ever played!
Crusader Kings II is a game that takes some research and determination. It starts out with that Civilization series feelinguntil you realize your two cousins got marriedyour heir is club-footed and incapable (both traits within the game...) oh yeah and you died of Tuberculosis....  Then your heir doesn't look so bad.  That's just a touch of the diplomacy that has to go on. Bickering amongst your vassals
This is probably my most-played game of all time. It never gets oldand Paradox's DLC model is exceptionally well done. Buy what you want to play withbut otherwise you get the underlying mechanic updates for free with a same-day patch.
This game is fun. It has the learning curve of an asymptotic functionbut that's OK.
This game is great. If you're a nerd with any interest in medieval historythis game is for you. If you love extremely complex strategy games with endless replay and hundreds of hours of storiesCrusader Kings 2 is for you. No Civ 5 oversimplification here. The menus have menus in this game! I know its popular in gaming dev now to make things more accessible
Pretty good game if you hate time.
This game is great! I recommend it to all fans of strategy genre. Be sure to watch a couple of tutorial videos (ingame one sucks :c)
I thought I was a good person.  I thought I cared about other people. Crusader Kings has proven me wrong.  After playing this game I've grown to only care about my namemy Dynasty and gaining it power. I've had my brother killed for sleeping with my wifethough I was sleeping with his. I had firstborn son killed when his brother was born because his brother was a genius and would be a better heir. I was excommunicated by the pope. So I went to war against him
Probably the only game where 'How can I kill my kids' is a legitimatemeaningful question. 10/10 would recommend.
hi i cant play crusader king 2 error
Game Dynasty Mechanic is great but over time game becomes stale even with DLC could use more customizable history etc
game where you rule country and try to protect your family name in middle agesdark and cold in some cases as it should bebut colorfull in other ways rich rpg elements and huge world to explore great game .. must buy
Went on to conquer England as William the conquerorgot my  kicked by Norway. Norse Britannia   10/10
It's awesome
little bit of a confusing and slow start but a very fun and challanging game to play
Great grand strategyespecially for those new to the genre. The game is way easier to learn than it looks and incredibly addictive. Each expansion adds great new content.  This game is about people and family dynasties as opposed to conquest and the game soars in this realm. There's marriageintrigue
A little hard to get into at first but once you learn how to play its very fun and addictive.
At first glance this game is EXTREMELY complicated looking. But after your do a little research and readingmaybe watch a few lets plays it becomes almost second nature to you. I have had endless amount of fun plottingruling
The game is brilliant! Took me a few hours to get the hang of itand now I am coasting! This is NOT just a wargame. This is a dynastic SIM. Build your dynastywatch your family tree grow! Make sure to get the add-ons too!
Pretty good.
Just keep coming back to this again and again. Can't go wrong
You get to crusade as kings and stuff
A wonderful gameonce you learn the ins and outs of it time will fly by. I found myself plotting my next moves while I was susposed to be working..
This is one of the most robustcomplexdeep
It's an amazing game. I'm slightly annoyed at the nickel and diming of the DLCbut rhe game itself is incredible. It is by far the best offering in the Paradox lineup of historical games.
Genuinely the best game i have playedclocked up 200hrs and counting in last 8 months. Endless variation makes for a truely versatile game thats different every time. Can not reccomend more highly.
Best incest &amp family murdering simulator
At first I had alot of trouble with this game. My empire always fell for one reason or another and I never really knew why. This discouraged my alot and I really stopped playing the game for a long while. But after getting back into the game it is honestly some of the most fun I have had in a while. I havnt played it much but from what I have I can say without a doubt that this is a great game and a must have.   so in conclusion 10/10 would murder my son again.
Awesome game!! certainly recommended :D
BUY THIS GAME  It's got a bit of a learning curvebut nothing like Dwarf Fortress or even Cities in Motion. Just Google 'how to play crusader kings 2' read and watch a little bitplay some Ireland
I accidentally sired an inbred heir on my daughter. 11/10
A game with such huge depth and scopeif you watched Game of Thrones and enjoyed the intriguebackstabbing
Crusader Kings' is a questionable name for a game that has been expanded all the way to India and has rather fleshed out the Pagan and Muslim sides of the Medieval Eurasian regionbut..  Regardlesswhy haven't you bought this yet?
One of the best games available and a must-buy for anyone who likes strategyrole playingor the medieval period.
This game is awesome. Anyone who is a fan of grand strategy games and political scheming needs to play this
only have 27 hours and and barely scraped the surface. check back in months and i bet i have over 300 hours in.
Fantastic game. Playability and stability much better than the first version. I love making my own history and dynasty!
Great game...but takes a lot of dedication and time to master.
An outstanding gamemuch more than just a RTS or a RPG.
Have a syphiliticimbecilic oldest son who desires the throneand has the support of your vassals as the next elected king? Arrange a matrilineal marriage for him to a minor princess of croatia and never worry about the bugger again!'
This game is one of the best story creation engines I have ever played. Once you get past the learning curveCK2 will offer you some of the most in depth and satisfying gameplay a strategy game can offer. If you are even remotely interested in buying this game I recommend you give it a shot.
This iswithout any doubtthe best strategy game i've ever played. Buy it and give it a try.
96 hours played. Achieved none of my goals. Absolutely awesome. If you like strategyyou'll love this.  It IS a bit on the expensive sidethough it's well worth it considering the humongous replay value.
Be a Viking pillage landstake christian wives as part of your haremSacrifice there old husbands to please the Norse gods. Continue on to conquer england while killing most of your children but the best... just a day in the life of a blood thirsty
similar to europa universalis 4 but based more on people not countrys also starting from 1066 to 1454 ( or 900's to 1454 with dlc) in this game you can only play as european countrys unless you have sunset invasion in witch you can be the aztecs
one of the best in depth startegy games i have every played.
Not only is this a fantastic game in its own right but the sommunity support and development of mods that provide new and interesting challenges ensures that Crusader Kings will continue to be a staple of grand strategy enthusiasts.
Excellent strategy/role playing game. The best medieval ruler simulation out there.
Where else can you be more cutthroat than Game Of Thrones? While the game has a steep difficulty curvewith no real action or storythe game is very compelling.  There is a narrative to be weaved from starting your dynasty as a vassal serving one's lord
Yeah(take a look at my hours invested) its that good.
It takes a while to learn the game.  I recommend watching some online tutorials.  But once one has grasped how to play it hours of fun will commence.
I recommend this game because of the rewarding gameplay and very well-executed historical simulationYou really take ownership of your dynasty and quickly begin to feel almost possessive of your in-game bloodline... as if it is your own. I'm not exaggerating to say this game is highly immersive despite lack of graphical sophistication.

Crusader Kings II is easily my favorite game of the last few years. It has a bit of a learning curvebut if you think you'd like a medieval strategy game that's more interested in arranging marriages than in army compositions you should definitely try CKII.
Overall I really enjoy this game! I have put over 100 hours in it and I still find the game exciting. I would recomend this game to anybody who likes medival history or sombody who likes to plot and see a family go from a nobody to ruling an entier nation. I would also recommend getting several of the DLC's as they greatly expand the game.
Great game!
This game is simply phenomenal. The depth is beyond anything of its type. Be warned however that there really is a large learning curve...if you've played Dwarf Fortress you'll know what I'm talking about. The UI is packed with buttons that don't look like buttons and five ways to do the same thing. The 'discoverability' of features is very low but persisting and understanding how to get things to happen yields a rich and engrossing experience.  My suggestion is buy the game and then before you even load it spend about 30-60 minutes watching a few of the YouTube tutorials (I'd recommend the series by Arumba)
Have not had this game very long (currently 22 hours). So far I have conquered Ireland and have had several rulers known as (name*) The Drunkard of Ireland.  Its been fun. 10/10
Strategy of the year 2012
Played as zoroastrian and married persian king off to sister. Better than nutella. derf/5
I was very suprized at how awesome this wasafter going throught the tutorial it is an easy consept to understandendless replayablity.
Great fun to play game :)
I don't know WHAT is going on...so many buttons.....so many....
This game is something alrighti've only played a few hours and can't quite figure out what i'm doing. Having played many games such as Civilization and Mount &amp BladeI believed i was ready to take on this challenge... I was wrong. This game is incredibly immersive and you basically have to figure our everything on your own and thats how it should be. All in all this game is a bit frustrating in the beginnign but once you figure out all the nitty gritty stuff this is a fantastic title.
-Realistic Grand Strategyyou command Armies and Nationsnot Units -Real time with pause use suggested very much. -Complex dynasties and character simulation
This game has drained +300 hours of my lifeI have geldedblinded
An exceptional gamemany of my children had to be slain to make it here )anyway intrigue and strategy at its best!
I'll be honest here. The game is hard to learnbut once it's learned it's one of the most immersiveawesome
My son married my illegitimate sister. Their son was inbred. Then I got attacked by Mongols. 10/10
It is a Good Game!  XD
Right. My guy was practically king of ireland but had not formed the title yet. So I'm likefuck when I die my son's are gonna split up all this land and fuck making it hard to form the kingdom'. This bummed out my guy (or maybe that was his wife's death) and he became depressed. Ah ha! A solution! I locked up the 3 youngest sonsexcecuted them and promptly committed suicide. No penalty and I get to keep all my land!  10/10 Became kinslayer and killed self for territorial gains. Would do again.
Whether you wish to relive or rewrite medieval historyfrom Iceland to Bengalas a fictional lowly head of a Buddhist Finnish merchant house or the Emperor Constatin III of Byzantium
Must play. Sligt learning curve. Once you pass ita universe of fucking 10/10 gameplay opens.
Political and personal intrigueconquest of Europethe ever-present threat of Mongolian hordes running roughshod over your homeland
Amazing gameI am fully immersed in playing itIt takes time to get the hang of playing it as it can be difficult to play
becouse long breath stuffss
Great gameamazing possibilties. Toug learnin curve. Better tutorials would be nice
Fun gameespecially with the Game of Thrones mod. Really complicated though.
I was 15th in line of successionnow I am King. How things can change...
A difficult game to figure out. But very rewarding when you do. If you are in to medieval strategyI recommend the purchase.
I love this game. There's so much depth to ityou don't realize how fast the hours can fly by as you plot to expand your family's influence. Be warnedthere is a learning curve
We need the anti-papacy
My first experience with CKII left me completely lost to real life for about 60 hours or so :D The game is my personal fave. You can form Roman Empire and kick all the barbarian arses around! Awesome. Though I feel a lot more could be added to the Roman Empire gameplay :C The thing about this game which makes it stand out is the world of personalities you dive in to find your place among the greatest - or live to see the fall of your dynasty. The medieval times are unforgiving - large empires will claim your land and force you to serve. Your sworn vassals will plot against you and rebel to depose you given the slightest chance - but in both cases that's not game over. It is only the beginning :P  Crusader Kings II is totally worth every penny and more. A rare masterpiece in todays gaming.
Great gamecan waste hours of play away. really addicitive like the CIV's instead of 'just one more turn' its just one more week or one more battle. One of the best strategy games out there.
An amazing game that is such a time sink. have played for hundreds of hours and cant get enough of it
One of my all time favourites Anyone with moderate patience can easily pour dozens if not hundreds of hours into this
I was a gay hunchback who conquered the whole muslim world. My born of incestious relation genius but hideous daughter proceeded to have all my male heirs strangled or deadened in created ways. She made my marshall her lovermarried my spymaster and proceeded to have my glorious empire thrown into a revolt during the aztec(?!?!?!) invasion. I died as a limp man on the battlefieldhalfway through liberating france from the french and the khans so I had that going for me.
This game in my opinion is literally one of the best games everYou can do everything in this game including multiplayer. I really wish more of my friends would pick it up. It goes on sale from time to time so I would wait till then if you do
This Game is quite frankly one of the most addictive games I own. The mechanics can take a while to get used to if you are stuck look it up on youtube as the ingame help it not that good. This is a game full of what if moments as each time you load up as a ruler as each game can be radically diffirent from the last. One game William might win his war for England the next Harold might be able to cling on to England and rule for a few more years.   Plus there is nothing quite as satisfying as taking a lowly count and turning him into a mighty king. Shall you deal with your foes with brute force assassination (killing someone in a explosion of manure has never been so much fun) or diplomacy the choice is yours.   DLC I recomend.   The Old Gods (Adds the ability to play as Pagans and adds a 866 bookmark)  Ruler Designer (Allows you to make your own character with your own dyansty instead of a preset one)   Legacy of Rome (Improves the Byzantine Empire by adding new events also adds Retinues which come in 500 men regiments and only decrease income when reinforcing)   Sons of Abraham (Adds events related to the Chatolic Church and improves its mechanics also allows the ability to play as Jews)   Any combonation of the music/unit packs (Simply put these make the game feel less dull by adding different unit models depending on the region of the map and the music packs which make the game songs feel less repetative by adding new ones   Mods I reccomend   Game of Thrones   Anyone who had read either the books or the tv show should play this Mod. Play from any point form 7796 to 8300 as any Character you wish. (The republic DLC is needed to play as any merchent republic in Essos such as Bravos) Other DlC such as the Old Gods or Sons of Abraham will improve some of the mechanics. Can Rhaegar hold onto the world's most pointy chair. Will Denarys screw the books and tv series and take back Westoros? When you play the Game of Thrones your win or you die.   Well that wraps up this Review this Game is brilliant can not recomend this enough. 10/10
A very immersive and unique empire building game. Making alies and building your family is just as important as waging war to help your empire grow. People always have interesting stories to tell after playing this game for a bit.
Best incest/murder sim on the market
This game is great. It may seem hard at the beginningbut it is not that much. In complex terms Europa Universalis IV is betterbut Crusader Kings is fun
I enjoy nothing more than a game which allows to to kill my own children
One of the best Paradox games. The focus on characters makes for some interesting drama.
Very entertaining. It takes a bit to learn how the game worksbut once you do it is really fun to manage your family!
Usually better than what really happened.
This is quite a good game if you like medieval strategy gamesbut it does take some time to get used to if you are new
To see if your worthy of you life and those around you. Take on this game Crusader Kings II and Experience what its like to slap Bi****your court or Hall of your VIP'smake your charecter worthy and happy
Love this game getting them lineages
Killed a whole family just because I wanted 1 piece of land  10/10 would reccomend
Really a fascinating gamenot like many others. At first glanceit seems like a scaled back strategy warfare game
So at the time I'm writing thisI've sunk more than 500 hours into this game. That's more than 20 straight days of gameplay. And here's the worst part: IT'S STILL FUN.  Dynastic Grand Strategy -- start near the bottom of the Feudal Ladder and work your way up. Or stumblefall
the Game of Thrones mod is a must for any fans of the books.... reason I bought it
Insanely deep medieval dynasty simulator. Stay away if you like twitch gamesor quick gamesor abstract games.  Come on in if you like complex simulations. You'll need to discover the various game mechanics to get good at this game.  I see that occasional complaint on the Paradox forums that 'the game is wrong because a bad thing happened to me'. If you will cry when encountering a setback
This scratches my history buff itch as well as gives me a strategy fix. Up frontit's very complicatedbut the game has a way of being enjoyable even when you don't exactly know what you're doing. Over time you'll develop strategies and will be further rewarded. But even from the start
Probably a game I play and replay a lot. Every situation is differentevery ruler is differentevery session is a new goal to achieve. Congrats to Pdox for keeping the game fresh ans with much update.
CrusadesHoly Wars and Jihadsoh my! Religion and politics were never so intertwined as they were during the Middle Ages and you get to relive the entire experience from the late 800's all the way to the mid-15th Century (thanks to the Norse Gods xpac). The original starting scenario is one of the most historical battles in history: Stamford Bridge. Selecting this scenario you can either play one of the three combating forces to decide the fate of England or perhaps some other noble elsewhere in Europe while the Battle of Hastings takes place or... doesn't. The second original starting scenario is after William the Conqueror has become King of England. With the advent of xpacs such as the Sword of Islam and The Republic you can play as an Islamic lord and invade Europe from a foothold in Spain or eradicate the Byzantine Empire or play as a patrician and establish a Serene Republic. The best game I played thus far was as the ruling family of Bohemia
Really amazing Medieval Strategy once you play it hours just seem to fly by and never play it at night or you wont sleep.
Welli love this gamei am addicted to it and am always thinking about coming back onto my saved game to add to it.  You basically pick an interesting person in history
Simply greatbut lack of events traits etc.
&lt I sure hope I like this gamebecause if notI've spent a lot of hours miserable.
This game offers you a chance to alter the course of history in medieval europe. There are many ways you can enjoy this gameand there isn't any one win condition. Try to unite europe under your banneror just try to insure your family name survives.  Despite my recomendation
Intentionally marrying my second son to my unknown fuck daugthermaking way for coming generations of imbred imbeciles that are to do my bidding 10/10
Nothing screams awesome like building up your own Middle Ages dynasty. Maybe it might sound lame - but - you're wrong.
Switched to this from CIV V (which I still love to play) and love it. Ruling Europe is a blast!
Killed my entire family because they tried to claim my throne.  10/10 would kill entire family again.
never forget when the norse discovered the aztecs and doomed us all
Amazing game. Multiplayer has some serious problemsbut is still playable. Very very enjoyable when playing with someone else.
I strongly recommend this gamemostly for its insane replayability.  It is rather complexwith a steep learning curve (like all Paradox interactive games)
This game is awesome. Super difficult and complicatedbut worth it.
Desyncs tend to happen during MPand looking at the internet that problem isn't uncommon. Though we are trying it with hamachi nowmaybe that works better. Aside from that not a bad game
One of the greatest games I've ever played. Worth every penny for any DLC Paradox comes out with.
Brilliant game with real historic background.
The learning curve on CK2 is a little steepbut the depth of the game is amazing. Building a kingdom is part of the gamebut even more so the focus is on building up your family dynasty. It doesn't matter how powerful you are
This is easily the worlds most advanced Dating simulator. And still fucking awesome.
Great game even if you don't like the grand strategy genre.
Where do I start with this game? All I can say is that it is arguably one of the best games I've ever playedit's definitely in my top 5! Even though one playthrough takes you agesyou could begin another playthrough and it'd be a completely different experience
Very difficult game to learn to play and understand... but amazingly addicting once you get into it. It's like Civ but you can't just steamroll everyoneand the AI doesn't make arbitrary choicesthey plan and plot against you in interesting ways. Also there's a Game of Thrones mod
Great game!
Medieval Marriage Simulator 2014now with 'more marriage.' Kill your wifeshag your daughter-in-law
This game is pure madness. Exceedingly complex and brilliant. If you can climb the learning curveCrusader Kings 2 is about the most satisfying gaming experience possible.
Quite possibly one of the most involved strategy games I've ever played. And also one of the most difficult to learn. But clearing that hill has given me one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I've had in a while. The massive scope in CK2 is undeniable. You pick a lord who owns a territory. It can be a lesser lord owning just one province or a lord with many lordlings underneath. What follows is nothing short of mind-boggling. Your options can seem limitless in your quest to dominate the worldor reunite the British Islesor rid the world of viking scum. It's almost like a sandbox game in that there really is no goal other than to further your family line. How you go about that is up to you
This game is absolutely a must for those interested in historydynastiesassassinations
This game is what would happen if Civilization and Oregon Trail had a baby that was raised by a Soap Opera. You NEED this gamewhether you realize it or not.
I bought this game over two years agoand it has never gotten boring. CK2 has the most replay value of any game I've ever played. There is a bit of a learning curvebut once you catch on
Update: This game has out-of-the-box problems with blurry fontsbut is playable at scaled-down resolutions and a mod:  http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?712799-MOD-CKII-UI-Font-Mod/page2 . Installing this requires jumping through a lot of hoopsbut should leave you with text that you can read. I'll follow up with a more gameplay oriented review after I spend some time with it.
Lived a long and prosperous life as the King of Sweden. Had 8 daughters. They all got assassinated by each other and then the second youngest took the throne only to have my vassals declare war on her because they didn't want a female ruler. Best sexist and assassination simulator to date.  11/10
A very interesting and time-consuming game. To succeed at ityou need to be deviouscunning
This game is really fucking good.
Very fun and interesting if you are a boring history loser. Will play again.
One of the most funsillycomplicated and addictive games of the past decade!  10/10
Wowfor a game I had never heard of before I saw it pop up on the Steam Specials list and after checking out a couple of videos on YouTube was instantly hooked. This game is great. After 10 hours playing the game I am still scratching my head and trying to figure out how to do things and how to take a stronger hold on the battles going on around me in this world. I love the way the game is historically acturate and all the characters are based on real life kingsdukes and lords etc. (Many of which you can follow to links on Wiki right from within the game!) Now that the price has gone back to normal I would say the price is a little high
Crusader Kings II is one of the games that i have enjoyed the most in the recent years. If you like a good strategy game with tons of hoursof time wasting. I would suggest that anybody that loves any of paradox interactives gamesshould buy this game.
Killed my wife brother for money then married my sister. 10/10
Hell yes I recommend this game. The learning curve isn't as bad as people make it out to be. Its steepbut once you do a playthrough and screw up a few dozen times in that dynastyyou get it fine
Uniting finland is hard as fuck
It's a good gamereally unique. The learning curve is quite steepbut it's a game of reaching goals and accomplishments feeding your need to continue.
10/10 Killed a lot of people to ensure my children's survivalonly to have my kids kill each other.
Wasn't sure about this at firstbut I have really gotten into it and my other new games have really taken a back seat. I like the Intrigue and the strategy of the whole thingback stabbing murder alliances and cloak and dagger.  Originally I thought the battle system was all about numbers and quality
It is not my favorite Paradox game (that would be Victoria 2) but this is the one that I can sit down and have the most fun with. To better explainin this game you play a dynastynot a 'country' that means there is good opportunity to role play. You may be emperor one generation
Let me start off by saying I love this game. I have spent endless hours building up my dynastic empireplotting and arranging to grow ever further. But this review is trying to adress one big controversy about CK2 - the DLCs.  If you look at the sheer amount of DLCs available for CK2 at this momentyou will understand
stupidly frustratingly addictive time sink. Four stars would recommend
If you played the first installment of Crusader Kingsthis version is 100% better. Intrigue events against family membersor against foreign interest. The breakdown of desmene into cities
Too hard to understandcouldn't really get into it.
Your Son annoying you why not have him killed. You wanted the kingdom next door why not marry the kings daughter then put her on the throne. Want a new summer castle why not go crusading in the holy land. Couldnt ask more of this life simulator.
all about plots and cheats
ck2 is recommended the -cptn-
Watch your long established realm breaks apart when you've been assassinatedleaving the throne for your 3 years old sickly son is chilling.
I don't know how I got up to 44 hours checked in on this game while only pursuing one goal. I would probably blame it on this Crusader Kings II's incredibly steep learning curve. This game is perfect for any history buff who specifically loves medieval historyor for anyone looking to get incredibly mad at a game that you just don't quite understand yet. Don't get me wrong thoughI don't mean that as a negative. The complexity that Paradox set up in Crusader Kings II is jaw-dropping
Your homosexual inbred cousin has successfully thrown you in the oubliette
Very well done sand box strategy.

Back in school the history lessons were... well you know... - This king invented a new lawthat king went to do crusades and the third was just sitting in the back waiting for the other two to make one tiny little mistake. Then the time for backstabing came! - Waitthis wasn't really covered in the semester Mr. Teacher! - Okay Billy
Amazing and addictive game. One of the best dynasty simulators around.
Eats way too much timebut is quite enjoyable.
The game has a steep learning curve but it is a ton of fun. super epic.
This is the only game I know where I'm ok with people discriminating aginst black jews...because it's such a fun challenge!
I've put 100 hours into this game so far and I'm still in love with it. If you get bored with being a big guy and stomping everyone you can be a little guy and try and climb up the power ladder. Its an easy game to learn but a difficult one to masterbut when you finally do its so rewarding. When its on sale I cant think of a game with better valueeven when its not on sale its still fantastic value.   and when you get a little bored of Vanilla CKII and all the DLC
It's an okay game but I give it 9/10 due to controls.
Maybe I'm missing something but I'm unable to even complete the tutorial because the options you are told to click simply don't exist (e.g. the tutorial explaining how to marry fails because the spouse is still alive whilst the game tells you that she's dead). Maybe the game proper is less buggybut I'm not inclined to recommend it at this point in time.
This is one of the best games Paradox has to offer. But as a Norwegianwhy the **************** is Trøndelag in Møre????????
So after a few rough starts of not know what to do I finally got going as Earl of Dublin. Set about create false claims Kildare and patiently waiting for my father to die off to inherit his county. Well before all this could happen my son proceed to kill me by pay my coachmen to run me off a cliff. Afterwards if became very clear that my wife was involved in this. She was after all my spy master and was working to create a spy network in my county to prevent such plots but probably a good assumption to say she found out about my mistress instead. So I learned my first rule: Never let your wife be your spy master.
Brought wife poetryshe became a nymphomaniac. 10/10  Seriously thoughthis game has a depth to it that can't be found in other strategy games. And although fun
After grooming my most intellegent and strong son to become the next leader of Cyprusit had come to my attention that my wife had a low opinion of me. So as any rational human being wouldI had her murdered. But unfortunatley my greatest son had for some reason taken great issue with the fact that I had murdered his mother. And he demanded that I step down as ruler and allow him to take control. So I told him to fuck off
Hours played on here isn't exactly accurate. I have at least 100 hours if not closer to 150.   I spent hours watching youtube videos to learn how to play the game because the tutorials are terrible. I failed miserably to get to my first kingdom multiple times. Then it all just clicked. The first time I formed an empire was an amazing feeling.   There are so many mechanics and possible things to do that it's just staggering. You can control your Dynasty's marriages down to what traits you'd like to be passed on to children (although the RNG is oft times fickle). You can participate in crusadesholy warsmend the schism between Catholics and the Orthodox and reform the Roman empire
This game is fantastic another great paradox title deeply fun and indepthThe only negative I can give this game is if your new to the paradox strategy games it has a tough learning curve.
This is how I learned about the war between the Buddhist Mongol's and the Aztecs over Iberia in 1298.
yes 10/10 would plot.
Incredibly entertaining and complex game play allows for hundreds of hours of play.
The only game where Robert Baratheon's fuck son with Sansa Stark can conquer the Seven Kingdoms.
Great grand strategy game that almost plays like a tabletop. The DLC game expanisions provide quite a few twists and variations. I love the trait systemand this game keeps getting better with age. I almost knew nothing about this game or Paradox when I bought itand this has been one of the more pleasant gems that I have discovered over the last few years.
Best incest simulator of the decade.
More Hours than I care to admit in this game. Love CK2 and all the Paradox Games that Tie into it!
Crusader Kings II is a unique game and isn't a traditional strategy game. It focuses on dynastiesfamily issuesintrigues. This may seem boring but it leads to entertaining gameplay with great depth. There are countless choices to be made with consequences. In-game tutorials helps easing the steep learning curve
Takes roughly a week to learnpossibly more if you're not experienced with Paradox titles. But if you're a grand strategy fanthis game will eventually make you an addict.
I had my nephew assassinated. Instantly.
I'm a big fan of playing this with the Game of Thrones Mod...it's really well done and a good opportunity to have Westeros look the way you believe it is supposed to
This is seriously one of my favourite games ever. The possibilities of what you can do are many. You can always find a way to do something differently. I highly reccomend this title. It's worth its price tag.
Can't recommend this game enough for history buffs or those who like detailed intriguing games.
This game is addicting. I have sunk tons of hours into itmostly because each DLC they add keeps the game fresh. There's a steep learning curvebut once you figure the gameplay out it's loads of fun
Never Has Incest been so fun
Its awesome but could be better.
I purchased Crusader Kings because I had grown bored of Civ V and wanted a game like it that would hold my attention. Little did I know what I had in store when I started playing. Civ V is to CKII as Peek-a-boo is to Chess against a grandmaster. It took me several hours of tutorials and youtube walkthroughs to even begin to grasp the mechanics of this gameand even now I still continue to find features I wasn't aware of almost every time I play.  That being saidCrusader Kings is a masterpiece of Strategy Gaming.  Do not expect to jump into this game and master it immediately
An amazing grand strategy game where wrangling your dynasty's line of successionmanaging vassal (be it feudal lordmayors or the Church) opinions to cement power and avoid revolt
With play sessions lasting multiple days and with different starting conditions offering very different challenges and rewardsthis is one of those games that you keep coming back to. Takes a while to learn how to playbut once you understand what's going on
This game has a steep learning curvebut once you get through thatit gets its hooks in you and it's hard to put down. Each game goes so differently that it's almost a completely new experience each time. There's an awesome mod scene (LOTR
Great game!
A bit difficult to get into but highly rewarding and entertaining once you get the hang of it. Make medieval Europe your playground.
Addicting. That pretty much sums up this game. Most of the hours logged playing this game were from playing a single dynasty. 80+ hours on one playit's like Civ V on political cocaine.
I wish I had bought this earlier. Can be a bit intimidating at first but becomes the ultimate laptop game after you learn the basics. Just watch out for your siblings.
Grand Strategy 20/10
It was such a painful learning curvebut now 100+ hours later I am still learning new things with each playthrough. The deepest and most rewarding strategy game I've ever playedHIGHLY recommended.
super fun game loving the politics
Marry your cousinkill your brotherexpel the jewery!
Extremely Difficult to learn but when you figure it out one of the best games out there!
I recommend this
Despite some issuesyou will sink an incredible amount of time into this game and it is well worth it.
Takes a long time to learnbut after learnedit is extremely addicting!
Pretty great gamemuch more than CK1 actually. It will absolutely astonish you with the depth of detail and historic immersionthough obviously there are setbacks
I have no idea what I'm doing but the King of Ireland is a gay midget and didn't sleep last night. 11/10 buy it
Immersive game with gripping intriguewhich can turn the tide of a game in seconds.
10/10 would marry and kill my sister again
The political drama that this game creates is something I haven't seen in a long time. This game is essentially a strategy game where you devote wealthpower and arms to press your control on duchiescounties and kingdoms to become a supreme ruler...if you want.   But the operatic twist that unfolds as you play the game will drive you crazy. If you are a fan of Game of Thrones
I am a huge fan of all things Paradoxand this game is no exception. The complexityre-playability
400+ Hours already spent. The possibilities for intrigue and alternate history is boundless. Recommended for any grand strategists wetdream.
The sheer depth of this game is staggering. The focus on your dynasty and the characters involved in it makes this game far more interesting to me than something like Europa Universalis. You really never know what might happen and you owe it to yourself to play it without save scumming. Be forewarnedthere is a steep learning curve. You will feel completely lost for awhile but it is worth powering through to finally figure it out.
Good game. kill people. kill infidels. suppoer the clergy
Awesome game! Paradox is the best
What other game can you plot to murder your brothersteal lands from your friends and marry your 60 year old character to a 16 year old girl without being sent to prison. Also no need to worry about being called a racistthe game actually encourages fighting muslims over catholics
I'm bad at this game but it's really fun! :)
Crusader Kings 2. What do I say? Hard to get intoimpossible to get out of. Todayyou're figuring out how to improve relations with a vassal
This is a truly impressive game. If you enjoy strategy games this takes it to another level. Game mechanics are somewhat complex but not overly soand you have the option of playing as any character of any province (with the proper DLC). This game makes for hours and hours of enjoyment and has a plethora of different angles from which to play.   For example in my first game that I playedI started as a Russian Prince of Novgorod and ended up through dumb luck conquering Poland (which doesn't even border Novgorod) by pressing my weak claim and eventually creating a huge empire. Takes some time and effort to learn the game but it's worth it.
This game has you in control in one secondthen totally upside down the nextyet it keeps you coming back for more. 10/10
Don't get me wrongthis is a decent game. The probelm is DLC. I don't mind studios selling DLC. I don't mind discreet advertisements for their DLC on the main menu. The problem is that the DLC for this game is literally built inand you get little greyed boxes telling you to 'buy ---- DLC to unlock this'. I don't know if this is enough to turn other people off of this game
I got betrothed to a 0 year old girl. 10/10 would do it again.
Love playing this game by myself and with 4 mates!
I baught Crusader Kings II Collection in midweek madness on -67% off thinking I would get the game and all dlc. Soon I found out that only half of the dlc where included in the fkn Crusader Kings II Collection!!!!! COLLECTION. Does steam know what COLLECTION means? Its a great game but im not happy about this. I feel cheated...
Makes me say awful yet completely justified things such as: 'Really sucks you can't just plot to kill your childrenthat would make things so much easier.'     10/10 Best game in the medieval soap opera genre.
It do not work with Win 8.1. I cannot play it at all.
Hilariousdeep grand strategy game that I'm still trying to understand. RPG elements are incorporated into the characters you play asand the political systems are much deeper than any other strategy game I've ever played. Loving it so far
complexchallengingfunny at times
The dynasty of your choice is being assaulted by the rest of the world! From assassinations to holy warsyou must protect the land given to you by your liege and mark the path of a family greater than all others. Handling the constructions of within your landsthe levying of troops to fight for their lords
Does the political intrigue of HBO's Game of Thrones interest you in figuring out how to take the throne? Do you enjoy medieval settings with feudal characters and laws? Are you looking for a complex game that encourages deeper thinking and long-term planning than typical strategy games? No? You'd rathercrush your enemiesto see them driven before you
This is a really good game. I have over 100 hours on it. 40$ is worth paying for this game.
I dont even know where to begin with this game. Quite simply it's my favorite of all time! It's definitely a must have for strategy fans and history buffs. Even if you're not usually interested in these kinds of games I would highly recommend checking it out. You may just be surprised :)
A bit slow paced with a high learning curve. Once you've learned the game it's interesting and enjoyable. I also recommend picking up 'The Old Gods' addon so you can play as Norse.
I became the Duke of Crete by marrying off my heir to a rival Duchessand then murdering her and all of her offspirng. I was then blinded and castratedbut not before throwing the Basileus off a balcony causing a civil war.  10/10
Good game but took me a while to get into. But once therevery addictive!
Probably one of the best ways to spend your free time when using PC. Yes it's very hard to understand at firstbut so much fun when you finally do! Watch Arumba videos on Youtubeyou will learn quickly.
In my latest game as Hungary (1066 start) I had managed to form the Empire of Carpathia as well as become king of Poland. It only required the untimely deaths of 12 or so newborn nobles. Yeah it's that kind of game.  Things were going well until two revolts broke outone wanted me to abdicate from the throne and let the elected next in line (my daughter) take overwhile another (started by my oldest son) wanted me to change the succession laws to Prigmogeneture (oldest child gains all titles).  I could have made my son my heir but my daughter's oldest son was also the heir to Croatia so I surrender to her and my son in that order.  I like to imagine that when my son had received my letter of surrender he dashed to the capitol almost being able to taste the throne (which tasted like butter) only to find his younger sister on the throne with her son (now heir to Carpathia thanks to my sons revolt).   Things went well and eventually I had the king of Croatia assassinated to add the kingdom to Carpathia and things were going well.  Untill the entire Empire devolved into civil war and I was left as countess of Moldou and my father (the founder of Carpathia) died of what I like to imagine as a mixture of heartbreak and dissapointment.  And this was all in my first game and I'm a complete newb at this game. Think about what a pro would be capable of.
The Sims meets grand strategy.
Can't get enough of CK II. Sure it has a high learning curvebut when you get into it you crave more. A great tool to learn more about the world history / geography / famous houses. I've been loving the DLCs too. If you love board games and strategic gamesthis is perfect for you.
Just a great great game. Never thought I would find a Grand Strategy game that would drag me away from the Total War seriesbut it has happened!!
Great game. Easy to get lost in.
No other game lets you plot to kill your own children.
Really really fun game I really like the dysnaty tree system 9.9/10 only thing is that I don't like the fact that you can't go to war without a Casus Belli but they are easy to get so
Some guy vomited into my friends lap at a party. I ordered his assassination.  10/10
Nothing quite like assassinating your wife so that you can marry a princess. This game will make you a terrible person.
Can play as possesednorse muslimdwarf
If historical grand strategy makes you tickthis is the shizz you'll ever need!
It's very good.
This game takes some effort to learnbut any fan of large scale strategy and historical sweep will love it. I highly recommend playing your first few games in a smallerout of the way county and learn the mechanics from there. Ireland tends to be a good choice. Don't make the mistake I did and think you can jump right in with the Holy Roman Empire or Byzantium!
This is the best grand strategy game I have ever played. If you like diplomacy and intrigue in strategy gamesthen you will love this. I cannot rate this highly enough.
Along with Victoriaone of Paradox's very best games. It takes abit to get used toand there are a lot of systems that are easy to learn but difficult to acclimate to
fucked my grandson's wife to give him a uncle.  Would kill everyone not jewish again 10/10
Best family killing simulator on Steam.
Takes some time and effort to get intobut this is the best strategy game I have ever played.
a deep strategy game with huge multiplayer potencial (up to 32 players though unsure how stable)
Start out as Duke of Apulia. Declare Holy War for Sicily. Win warget island. Yaycan become King. Angry vassals rise up in rebellion. Defeat rebels
Marry your dwarf cousinimprison hertorture her
This is one of the very few games nowadays that doesn't dumb itself down for a casual audienceand because of that it is deeply complexhas a huge learning curve
A lot's been said about this gameso I won't bore you with tales of unintentionally amusing things the game forces you to do ('OohI'll say it's an incest simulator! How funny!').  CK2 is one of those games with a high skill cap. You can be learning how to do new things quite a few hours in
Great game
Played a Multiplayer game with a couple of friends. Ended up becomming King of France. Offered bethrothal request from frienddidn't realize it meant his family would inherit my titles. So I plotted with his wife to murder their daughter. After mission accomplished I married my son back out to his cousin for safety of my titles. 10/10 would arrange incest again.
The best of the Paradox world-strategy games so far! Alsopure crack for micromanagement junkieshistory buffs (you will learn something if you play this)
Great Grand Strategy/Political Intrigue mix that leaves you even more devious than before. 10/10would recommend.
in depth as hell
It's funbutby the gods
Great game! Had it recommended to me by many friendsand after watching them play itwas convinced to one day own it myself. Great Diplomatic
There's nothing else to say - this game literally increases your manhood.
great game if your into this stuff.
Do you like Game of Thrones?  If the answer is yes (which it is)then play this game. It's all about intriguebackstabbing
It's Crusader Kings IIthis is what you play when you wish you could be Ned Stark but not as stupid. Or be Tywin Lannister and wreck fuck.
In what other strategy game can you pilage the landcapturing your enemiestaking thier wives for your concubine harem
10/10 Would sacrifice pope to Odin again.
Best game ever if you enjoy thinking in a game more than stabbing endless hordes of enemies. Will bring the worst kind of tyrant out of you though. 9/10.
10/10 I killed my mentally challenged son and married my daughter.
10/10 would lead my dynasty to glory via mass-murder and cynical religious conversion again.
This game is one of the best games I have ever played. You can play it millions of times and the game never turn out the same as the one before. There are countless of things to do and I will probably not be able to do them all!  I will give this game an astounding 10/10 for its amazing gameplay and many hours of endless fun!
Great game! Really fun to playby far my favourite paradox game.
It is hard to go wrong with a Paradox game and this one is my personal favorite.
fun game but the casus belli system is stupid
This game is outstanding. The depth of the gameplay and the liveliness of its world are both remarkable. Be prepared for a steep learning curve though.
Download the Game of thrones mod for even more awesomness.
If you're even remotely into the genre you HAVE to give this game a shot!
Amazing game. Almost as crazy and detailed as Dwarf Fortress. Just don't be a sucker like me and by the DLC collection assuming it will be a collection of all the DLC. It's all the fuck DLC and a couple of the nice pieces. Extreme ripoff for $50.
My Genius Wife gave me an imbecile heir.  10/10 would recommend.
I went and gave her a good tumble'  only after seeing this message did I discover that the female my King Bjorn 'tumbled' was my daughter.. cue inbred child after creating the empire of scandinaviaI then conquer Rome and imprison the Popeonly to then sacrifice him to the Allfather
Exceptionally deep strategy/RPG gameallowing the player to explore the intrigues of controlling a family throughout medeival Europe. Great depth and width of player driven storiescreating legitimate tension between the player and AI families. love it
In what other game can you become the blackgay Danish king of Jerusalemor ensure that a dynasty of dwarves rules over the Byzantine empire for centuries? None. Crusader Kings 2 is hours and hours of fun
The ultimate heartlesspower-grabbing ***hole simulator. How a typical game of CKII goes:  Oh heymy younger brother got a couple of counties I want during sucession. I'll just spend the next ten years murdering my entire extended family so I can get them back. Alright
This is my favorite game of all time. Paradox nailed this one and they keep improving it for free (though there is paid DLC). I have played for hundreds of hours both with friends and alone and will never get tired.
i have already spent 200 hours on this and that is jsut a tiny bit for this game there is so much to do and with the dlcs the games gets even deeper and has so much MORE to play then before one of the bests games i have played
So I bought this expecting it to be a Civ-alike. It is on some levels I supposebut it's WAY more fun to play it like a RPG. The simulating of your familycourt
A really amazing game. Took me a long time to really start enjoying it on account of it being quiet complicated and the tutorial being amazingly boring. But after a while it started to make sense and now it consumes my life. If your a fan of grand stratergy gamesdont mind the lack of graphics and are willing to put the time in to learn how to play then this is definetly worth a buy. 8/10
great game. Good for people who are looking for a super in depth strategy games that are very complex.
I don't always marry my cousin... But when I doI inherit my uncle's land.
Definitely a must buy if you enjoy gameplay revolving around Royal Dynasties. Whereas other Paradox Interactive games such as Europa Universalis focus almost solely on Grand StrategyCK II successfully incorporates the micro-management of one dynastic line. As suchits aruably the most accessable of the Paradox strategy games. I would also reccoment downloading the Game of Thrones modification if you enjoy the series.  9/10
This game is Grand Strategy at its absolute peak. Although a steep learning curvethe game is very rewarding for those who persist.
One of the best games out there.
Easily one of the best games you can play. Do yourself a kindness and grab this.
This game is one of the most in depth for strategy I have encounteredHowever there is a steep learning curve and can put off newer players. I advise to start in a small territory to start and get a feel for the game.
Fulfill your lust for powerland and gold while developing horrifying interpersonal skills!
One of the best stragity games of our time
Addicting game with a steep learning curve. Rewarding and fun.
This game is addicting. Every campign I have done has been never the same way. Once you start playing this game you will never want to leave the computer and go outside...
Around hour 200 I had perfected my dark ages Eugenics program to a science.
My son had me assassinated. 10/10 would die again.
Okay....  I have to be honestI came into this game with one very simplestupid goal: I wanted to play as teh Roman Empire in EU4. That's it. I didn't really care much about it beyond that. Now
This is so addicting! A very strategic game. While combat is importantlineage and diplomacy is crucial. You will find that out the first time your kingdom goes out the window because one of your vassal rebels or you loose part of it because of heritage. Trying to build a kingdom and then an empire takes skills and timebut who wouldn't want to rule! DLC are definitely worth it.
10/10 - Would go on royal hunt again.
This is GOT in Pc Formjust an awesome game!
Compelling few other games provide such a great potential for story-building.
44845would sacrifice the Pope to Odin again
It's historically accurate until you click the play button. Then you just kinda do whatever you want. Honestly if you enjoy this genre of games chances are you already own this.
This game has amazing replayability and is a blast to play. There's a somewhat steep learning curvebut it's worth learning the intricacies of the game.
Very detailed game. Only improvements I would like to see are an even more detailed diplomacy system.
An utterly brilliantaddictingand altogether too-interesting romp through the Early-Late Middle Ages. Perhaps the only game I've ever played where the story can truly be called 'natural.'  Pick a lord and begin your story.  No other experience is quite like it.
Be meQueen of FranceMarry a prince of Bavaria. Theres a black jew from Mali who is my steward on my council Whom I develop an extramarital affiar with. A while later a choclote colourd prince pops out. 'Fortunatly my Husband thinks it's his'.    10/10 Would highly reccomend
A truely amazing game. It manages to both historically simulate the middel ages but it also alows you do go wild. I have spend nearly 200 hours on this game and I'm still finding new features tucked away where I hadn't noticed. Great game. Buy it. Play it. You won't regret it.
If you enjoy a hard strategy game with a damn good amount of skill needed and a nice ironman mode then this is the game. You play as the ruler of the geographical area you choose. Either make your own character (i think a DLC is needed to make your own thats 1 issue is some DLC whoring.) but otherwise i was not disappointed at all.
I highly recommed this game. If you enjoy strategy and overall micro-management of an entire empirethis is the game to buy. You can start as far back as year 600 and be a viking lord on his rise to kingdomship or be the king of NorwaySweden or Denmark and raid the coasts around and spread fear into the Christians. If you don't fancy being a viking
If you like strategyBuy it. It's really that simple. Great depthreally engaging
One of the best gamesI've ever played. Kind of Hard to get into at first but once you dothere is no turning back. The developer keeps updating the game regulary with both free Patches and some really nice DLC. Put the Game of Thrones Mod on top and you have hours upon hours of fun
Its like civilization on steroids Add in CK2Plus for a real winner
Lost too many hours to this game. So worth it. Old gods dlc is the best!
I have by no means figured this game out entirelybut the learning experience has been great and it is becoming my go-to game in my free time.
One of the best games that I have ever played. I have lost many games through my own stupidity when I first started but it never stopped me from loading up an new one and trying again. Its a simple idea and almost risk like in the way that it works. The level of depth achieved by this game is amazing. The add ons that i have make the game a million times more replyable with each one and it was already a game that I would play through more that once.
Good game with enough complexity to keep it interesting for a long whilealthough this does make it more difficult to understand and get used to at first. A lot of new players might find it too difficult to bother with and give upbut if you keep playing you will eventually have a moment where it all 'clicks'.
A great game for those who enjoy intrigue and unfolding procedural stories.
Seized control of the Byzantine empiremarried Joan of arc and got invaded by the Mongols   10/10 would play again
!
One of the greatest strategy games I have ever playedbut not without it's faults. I'll address the minor problems first. Firstthis game is extremely DLC heavy and some features are essentially locked behind a paywall. After I bought my first DLC for this game I found I wasn't downloading new content
One of the greatest strategy games of all time!
Crusader Kings 2 is an odd Paradox Gamebut a glorious one at that.
This not necessarily your typical strategy game. You have the ability to play as over a hundred different European (and now Indian and Middle Eastern as well) kingslordsand vassals. You can pass laws
your brain will hurtyou will be confused as well but you will still enjoy it. your kingdomes will have wars and civil wars your sons and dughters will try to kill you can like-wise them. Then as you finely put your kids down with a fine beating one of your damed nobelmen decides now a good time for a revolt so u loss some of your land and then go to war....but this all pales in comparasion to the mongals o yes the mongals will come and everything will die and if eup is not ready then they will die as well and there is nuthing you can do about it. agin your brain will hurt from pankicing who is loyal and who is not whether your kids want to overthrow you. Mongol and pluges will ravange your land and that off all your enemys and allies. then confusesion will set in as your restart and try to prevent it all only to see that theres a 100 niore threts you dident see befor and this time the holy romen empire was reborn and killing everything. You will be sad for your kingdome and fuck?? at your advicer' but you will still love this game. So....GL
21 hrs gone in like 3 daysI think i've become an addict. Steep learning curve but completely worth it once you get the hang of it. Create your own kingdom and goals the outcome is in your hands.
Want to lose precious precious time? Immerse yourself in medieval history and rewrite it as you see fit. Another excellent game by Paradox. CKII is a true heir to the throne occupied by CKIbut as with all good dynasties the son usurpes the father. Crusader Kings is deadlong live Crusader Kings (II)!
If you have ever wanted to build a sprawling dynasty of nobles in medieval europecarve out your own empireor take up the banner of your favorite nation and wage war against their enemies
Game is great!
One of the best games I've ever played!
An obscure gem. The graphics aren't going to blow you awayand remind me of playing a game of Riskbut everything else is crafted excellently
This game is addictive once you learn the complex nature of its inner workings... defently have to say Paradox make great stratergy games...
I started as a single Danish provinceand wound up with all of the Holy Roman Empire being ruled and populated by Odin-worshiping vikings...... and then the Aztecs invaded. 10/10
great game
Fantastic game. Purely good. Wasted many hours of my life to this gameand still doing so! Rock'n roll!
It is very good. You have to play the tutorialsto learn the options and basics. After that play like you wan't. There are very intressting mods like the Game of Thrones mod. So have fun and try out.
This may be one of the best medieval simulator sandbox games out there. Its notabout conquest but about keeping your liniage alive through out the middle ages. Its really amazing.
Crusader Kings II is an amazing game with one goalmake your dynasty the most prestigious dynasty there is.   How you want to go about doing it is left up to yoube it fuck?? and pillaging your way through Europe as a viking
Quite simply one of the best games I have ever playedshown in the ridiculous amount of time I have spent on it. It takes a little while to learn to playbut in my mind that's the mark of a good game. It's deep
This is the best grand strategy game I have ever played. It has a steep learning curve but if you can get past it then you will enjoy your time with it.
You know a game's good when you plot to assassinate your son for sleeping with your wife...   It's that fucking good.  6/10  No sex scenes
I really enjoy this gameif you spend the time to learn how to play and have any interest in history or simulationsI think you will have a great time. I have played this game for upwards of 100 hours already
Fantastic gamefeudalism at its best.
NOT a conquest game. Dont expect to rule the world. That being saidits a good game. Really deep political and economic systems where every choise matters.
All crusader kings 2 has done for me is encourage me to consider domestic violence in certain situations.  When searching for a wife in this game make sure she will put out as not having an heir due to a celibate wife is causing my horny king problems which can only be resolved by her death  Very unique game and well worth a play
The best marriage/assassination simulator in existence
I love this game its sooo fun 10/10
Always wanted to kill your brother and marry your cousin for money and land? This is the game.  Grand strategy at it's finest. You are not a nation but a dynastybest angle I have ever seen for a game.
I was told about this game by a good friend of mineand when i finally bought it i was immediatly hooked. If you love medievial strategy and court intrigue this is the game for you. :)
Played as a ruthless tyrant. Anyone who defies me will somehow get into an 'accident'. People fear and adore me at the same time. Life is good. MUAHAHAHA!!! Went on a royal visit to one of my subjects one day. Suddenly the carriage somehow speeds up and goes out of control. I peek out the window and in front is a deep gorgebehind me I see the driver and my lovely daughter on horseback. The were smiling as they see me plunge to my death. 10/10
Murdered my oldest son cuz he was 1 point less in diplomacy than my other son. Married a 16 year old as a 70 year oldthrew my uncle in jail to get his cityproceded to blind him
Paradox have a way of making games so in depth that they can still surprise you after many hours of play. This game is no different. Whilst some of it is humdrumthe depth is there for all to see. If you like historylike being a ruler and enjoy chopping peoples heads off
Though visally it doesn't look that appealingbut if you enjoy a DEEP policical system where millitary is simply a means not the solution then you found the right game.
Especially fun playing with mods. Great strategy game. 10/10 Paradox hit the nail again.
This is quite possibly the most addicting game that I've ever played. 438 hours poured inand I still haven't ever finished a campaign to the end. How could I?! There are so many options and opportunities to play completely different games as completely different people. The learning curve is very high but the more you learnthe greater the scope of the game will appear to you. This may be the pinnacle of PC strategy gaming.
This game is destroying my life..
Played the Game of Thrones Mod. Did stuff with the Ruler Designer. Started in Ethering. Started as a Baratheon. Got claims to the Kingdom of Storms End. Two generations laterruler is Storm Queen. Married to inheritor of The North. He dies. Marries inherior to the Reach. ??? Still in the middle of it.  12/10
Fantastic game! Very unique challengeno winning or losingjust keep your family dynasty in power! Very high replaybility
This is an amazingly good grand strategy game historically based in medival Europe. You play as a medieval lordand manage his life choices as he builds his dynasty. If your character should die (from combatdisease
I love this game! Crusader Kings II is so much more than typical games of this genre. This game is incredibly deep.  You don't just manage armies and provinces. Relations with your vassals are criticaland the way you need to manage lines of inheritancemarriages
survived my regent trying to kill me severel times when i was a small child until he broke downawesome game!
i married my sister to my son and then killed them both because they're stupid and made me a stupid heir. then i killed my grandson because he was even stupider. supid
Have you always wanted to play Medieval Total Warbut with more depth? Then buy this game. With thisyou can wage huge wars
Very deep and compelling game. It's a story builder and the Game Of Thrones mod is awesome...when it doesn't crash. The Steam achievements don't seem to be working.
This is an epic game that will never be the same twice! There is a large range of mods to suit any interest and it is as close to living game of throwns without having to kill your real siblings :)
This is my favorite time sink and currently most played game on Steam. I can't say how much I love this game! For a grand strategy nerd like me this game is like crack. I definitely recommend installing both the Elder Kings and Game of Thrones mods once you have lost interest in the vanilla game. I also recommend buying all content expansions as they are well worth the money (unit texture changes are mostly just eye candy). Best option is buying a bundle when it goes on sale.
My Khivan wife was murdered by the Seljuksso I murdered my Seljuk wife in relaliation. Then I murdered two of my sons in a row so that the kingdom would fall into the hands of my capable brother. THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER
Any strategy gamer OR RPG lover will feel right at home with CK2. Do yourself a favor and pick up the Old Gods Expansion as well.
I have lost so many hours of my life playing this game. Totally worth it! It is awesome to play so many historical characters. And of coursethe best part is to reshape history. Do you want England to become greek orthodox? Do you want russia to become muslim? Do you want to recrate the the former Roman Empire as an Aztek Norwegian? The sky is the limitand with the addition of mods
This game.
Awesome gamevery authentic gameplay regarding the middle ages - and extremely fun to play for hours! :
incest simulator of the year all years
This has been one of the best Paradox Interactive gameI have ever play! I kill family memberfriends and dignitary at any given moment. When a few tweaks I cleansed cultures
Everything is greatbut font and UI are too small and blurry on 27' 1440p monitor. It's hard to enjoy such game when you hardly can see stuff. There is one font modbut it looks clunky and blurry still.
Game good. Huehue
I really like this game but wonder if they could ever extend the time line 18th centery with out changing the core game play that we all love
The Best
It is very good.
Paradox finally got around to fixing the damn game. No more lockups on my systemso I've switched my review to recommending it. That saidI'm still not a fan of Paradox after this debacle.
Became a king. Killed off the rest of my family. Started a new family. Inherited the Holy Roman Empire.  10/10  Would recommend
I can't even load the game. I meanhow can i even review it...
A game to go back toover and over and over again. A masterpiece
Killed my whole generation to become queen of brittanythen took the king of france as maternal marraige. Then succeded all his titles. 11/10
Its a cool concept and it could be fun but i have no Idea how to play the game. In my opinion its more complex then europa universalis.
I have killed so many children
The most polished and accessible Paradox title that they've released. Come for the history and strategybut stay for the hilarious contingencies and emergent scenarios.
I highly recommond this game. Managing your dynasty is so different from managing a country like other strategy games. Politics suddenly becomes so much more important than 'yet another military conquest'. And when things go very wellbut the ruler dies and you have to play as his heirthe political games gets completely turned upside down. Very good game!
Great game!
WARNING!!! This game is incredibly immersiveaddictiveand fun!  My first playthrough went something like... What am I doing?...Get married....Have kids....Take a lover...Have illigitimate kids....Take 3 concubines....Have more illigitimate kids...Kill my brother for plotting against me...Kill my mother for plotting against me...imprison a 6 year old for plotting against me....assassinate my king...take all his counties....get assassinated....mourn!!!  Seriously
Great Game. Never played any previous Paradox titles but I have been in searching for something similar to Medieval Total War 1 (first onenot the crap that followed) for a long time. The concept of shaping your destiny and bloodline is a challenging and facinating one. Takes a while to get the hang of the mechanics but once you doits a great fun.
Can you say 'eugenics?' This game is all about turning your dynasty into the best in the Medieval world. Killing stupid children is not an uncommon practice in this game. Be Tywinn Lannister and care only about the glory and future of your house.
An excellentin-depth strategy game that blends domestic and international politics during the dark ages til the fall of Constantinople in 1453. I strongly recommend playing with all of the expansions with the exception of Sunset Invasion when on Iron Man mode. The converter for CK2 to EU4 is extraordinary icing on the cake.
If you are looking for a massive real time strategy game where you don't have to go around conquering to surviveCrusader Kings II is for you. Granted conquest tends to help you outbut it's not the primary objective. The primary objective is to have your dynasty survive to a certain date in history (make lots of babies!). So going on the warpath is going harm you as well as help you.  Some of your biggest problems will be your pesky vassels or rullers. If you are under a ruler be careful
Learning curve on this game is mad rough. It's a ton of micromanaging. Get this if you like making your heirs bang people without their approval.
A must have game!
My sister hated me so I tried to imprison herit failed. She rose her army and killed me.
Crusader Kings 2 is a great gameI really enjoyed being a part of a semi-recreation of alternate histories even without the DLC packs i found myself in western europe studying A.I. habits and tendicies to get myself to the top This game requires high intellect and un-derstanding that actions you do currently could affect the out come of your child or his/her child  overall stunning and beautiful mechanics 10/10 worth buying
HOW DO I DO ANYTHING  7/10 played as a muslim named Jorbel
I really enjoy playing this game. I have a difficult time explaining to people why it is fun though. It can be extremely frusterating most of the time but when you finally figure it out it is really satisfying.
Played as an Italian Duke who was a master seducerGained Lovers Pox from a fat Italian wench from Sicily. Sense he had to live with Lovers Pox everyone else had to aswell. Went around all of europe and every Princess in Europe was given Lovers Pox and he has 10 fucks from each corner of Europe. 10/10 would pimp out all of europe again.
Decided to name my fucks after my two friends and gave them land. They both acted exactly how they would in real life. Sadly I had to execute one of them. 10/10
One of the best games I've played. I would reccomend for anyone that is into strategy games.
-Be Me -Be Ruler of Bavaria -Just Obtained East Francia since my father died -Largest counter in west Europe -Decide to wreck some pagans -Pagans band together -Get rekt by pagans -Decide to beat up my family to the west -Take 1 province -fuck was cash 11/10
**This review is based on the base game**  A great grand strategy game from Paradox. The first in their 4 strategy seriesthis game is set in the medieval periodstreching from Ireland to India and Iceland to Mali. The base game ranges from 1066 (norman invasion) - 1453 (fall of constantinople). In CKII you try to continue dynasty - trying to make it the most prestigous in Europe! The game is centered around your dynasty and succession. If your heir is not of your dynasty
I raised a daughter to be a master of court intrigue... she murdered everyone she married.  10/10
If your a person that likes history and grand strategy games with tons of diplomacy you should definetly buy this game becouse your going to find yourself playing it for eaven up to 5h straight and you whon't get feed up on this game uless you put like 500h or more in to it.
Bought game Married sister Had lots of babys marry all the baby to eachother gets syphilis excuminicated by pope dies alone  13/10
I'm something of a history geekso this game totally appeals to me on that basis alone. If you want to run around and shoot thingsplay TF2. If you want to spend (game) years setting things up so you can take a duchy away from your vassal without angering anyone
The learning curve is not as steep as you'd think. Take the time. Learn the game and enjoy it. PersonallyI love CKII! Great strategy game. Fun to play as the base gamewith all the expansions and dlc
One of my favorite games.
Probably one of the funnest games I have ever played.
Became possessed lunatickilled maid because thought she was giant gerbalturned realms currency into turnips. BUY IT!
It's a pretty good game. Get the complete edition when it's on special if you don't want to pay full price immediately.
Please gift to me.
seriously come out with another dlc im quite litteraly waithing to just throw my money at you. this game iis so great I cant even contain the exitment i get from loading it up. the modding community is small but amazing the company that made this game is one of the best in gaming ive ever had the pleasure to give money to. but i do have to warn you its a time machine I frequintly start playing in the morning and when i look up at my clock its 3 am.
Great game. It's super complicatedyou are GOING to need a tutorialand it can be a pain sometimes because the game is just SO complex
Fantastic Game! Absolutely love it! Everything i could want in a game! :)
This game is awesome.
A very fun medieval politics simulator. Children killing simulator too.
Led a crusade against a volcano.  867/10would crusade again.
468 hours of play time and not close to getting tired nuff said
Quite possibly the best historical strategy game of all time. Highly recommended.   10/10
Very good grand strategy game. If you are a fan of this kind of games then it's definitely a 'must buy'. Good history and mechanicsbut it sometimes can be really long to finish(or you can have really bad luckyou characters die
No words to describe this game. Best game I have ever played and definitely my favorite one. Gogive it a try :)
A great game but needs mods to feel like its actually real. When peasents can have a revolt every 6 months and be better equiped and gather twice your numbers......every six months. Something is broken.  I finally lost after the 5th revolt of having 4000-5000 units each time. Nothing you can do once they start.
My first entry in the Paradox World.... welli sure wasn't disappointed !  A cross between SandboxPolitical Games
Fun and very addicting. 10/10 Best political Feudal simulator to date.
Wonderful Game With Great Gameplay Graphics And Effects. Although It Does Have A Downfall With The Fact Your Entire Game Can Be Ruined If A Few Mistakes Are MadeBut For Me That Only Makes It More Fun. 9/10
I enjoyed the gamealthough I disliked how you must buy other parts of the game that the devs should already have on the game. The does have a bit of bugs but most you can fix. The game is very enjoyable if you like these types of games and even if you don't you should still try it.
Quite a fun gamehas a steep learning curve which can be both good or bad. I recomend watching additional tutorials on youtube to figure the game mechanics out. Then be prepared to invest a serious chunk of your life into this game
NEw glitches it would seem old saves are near unplayable as tech glitches allow me to keep points but reset and hten dont let me spend them. Money glitches I now have millions of gold and millions of prestige. crazy army numbers hundreds of thousand so of men now instead of 20 or 3000. Lots of thing slike this.
.... over 700 hours now?  God save me and paradox's endless DLCpatchesfixes and upgrades to the game. If you like strategy (dynastic) simulators
Absolute Crap I don't even know what to do waste of 40 bucks
Start playingeventually conquer the British Isles. Dirty ungrateful vassals rebel against me and force me to abdicate in favour of my young daughter. Now playing as daughtermy father is my regent and caretaker
Didn't rule great just got wasted while my wife slept aroundnever had a legitimite child lost when my charature died. 11/10
10/10 I love cuck kings IIits more streamlined that cuck kings I and allows more opportunites for the player to cuckold other nobles.  Pros:  -Medieval history is badass -Loads of mods for you to enjoy (total conversion to GoTor just small ones that add more flavour to the game) -Some of the DLC is actually worth buying -Custom ruler designer to turn yourself into a true cuck master -Makes you think about killing your children  Cons:  -Isn't *just* about cuckolding medieval rulers
Fairly positive. Other people sum up countless reasons why you should play the game.  I like the game mechanicsEXCEPT THE PLOT SYSTEMwhich seems random and buggy. I had a plot to kill a count and his spymaster was helping me. 292% plot power
Top
Married my aunt because she was a good breeder
Mass murder baby killing. 10/10 would mass murder again
Within the first fifteen miniutes of playing I got castrated and died of my fuck scars. 10/10
me gusta  Edit: It's been two years.. And holy-crapI've played this game more than most of all my other games. And there are still millions of things i still haven't tried... I could see myself playing this the next many years.
In a word? Epic.   This game is challengingstimulatingand different every time. If you like grand strategy games
great game if you want to roleplay politics in the medival world
Buy this game. Alsobuy all of the major DLCs. If you skip out on all the smaller onesthat's fine
Nothing spices up grand strategy like the personal dimension added in CK2. There's nothing quite like taking on the role of a viciousbackstabbingwarmongering lord of some obscure fiefdom and guiding your dynasty towards world domination - and then having that same dynasty plot against you ... DO. NOT. MISS.
A must have for players who like strategy !!!!
great game payd dlc content is agonizing
Simply a blast. This is a 4x strategy game done right. Also it's not a turn-based gamebut also not RTS really either... it's that perfect setup to make those of us that don't micromanage well enough for RTS still capable of playing and enjoying it. Howeverif you do NOT like your games to be complicated.... probably not a great choice for you. In fact the 4x strategy genre really isn't for you then.   This game is just great.  The only downside
It's like giving coke and the song of fire and ice book set as a christmas present to Civ 5.
A brilliant game of vastopen world tacticsdiplomacy and ingenuity coupled with an intricate sandbox format that changes the game each and everytime you play. You have the ability to start at any day throughout an almost four hundred year period in the European Dark Ages and are able to play as historical characters and dynasties or (my preference) forge your own history changing family. Start as a lowly Count and rise to power or begin at the top and prevent the fall. It's all here. In addition
literally the gates to hell opened in my small little town and i closed it becouse a priest walked around it in a cirkel several times and trew holy water into the gate of hell   10/10 would open the gates of hell again
Great gamenow you can picture yourself with all the traits and be super good and then accidently die in battle gg fuck this game 9/11
Great Strategy game. Attempt to conquer Europe through warsmarriageassassinations and threats.  Has had me playing for over 700 hours and multipul games
It's really good.
what a shame this game wont even loadgets to 'flags' then crashes.. 'darkstar one' was sorted out in the end and proved to be awesome. i hope for a future patch here to sort this game out.. vista 32 bit 4 gig ddr2 dell q9300 gtx 560 ti
My brother rebelled against me and took half country to war me. Then in the same time my grandmother attack me. MY FU**ING GRANDMOTHER ATTACK ME !!!! WTF IS WITH THIS GAME?!. I lost war to my GRANDMOTHER and brother they tooke most of my lands. 2 months after win my grandmother die from old age whats more when my brother got independence he was attack by muslims and die in battle so i was only heir and got my brother land and contry of my grandmother :P.  I love my famyli!
Poland expelled the Jews from the country. 15/10buy this game.
This game is one addictive beast. Came for an interesting game for some time waisting and ended with a host of funny stories. Some things are quite complicated but that isn't really a bad thing. I am still learning thing about this game 250 hours later. Just for a referenceI bought this game 4 years ago and I still play it. However you NEED the expansion which makes this a very expencive game. So remembercasual fans DO NOT APPLY.
I have my heir married to a man that wants to kill me and I am about to be invaded by an army that outnumbers me 5 to 1. YaI am having so much fun.
I bought this game with high hopes and it has delivered. I can see endless hours of play to come.
This is a VERY good game if you enjoy strategy games then this is for you. Hard game to get use too but after a while you'll love this game. I highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a good strategy game.
Had no time for the original game yetbut I bought the game for the A Game of Thrones mod and I'm not disapointed! The mod is amazing and I think it's easier to learn the game with it. Outstanding game!
I'm way too dumb for this gamepretty fun nevertheless
Solid 10/10. Bribed my nephew to murder his father by setting fire to the inn they were staying at.
I remeber when I was youthen I bought CK2 on Steam
I've spent years decades crafting the perfect muslim dynastyKilling off my brothers and uncles when I could...forcing them to marry imbeciles and 40 year old women with horribles traits when I couldn't. I only took strongbeautiful and attractive women as my wives. After much time and many 'failures' I finally managed to be blessed with a perfect son...and my cousin whom they call the 'demon child' - stabs me in the eye while I'm sleeping and kills me. I'm down to one male member of my dynasty now who's 43 and has no sons...  I died stressed
Pick random king and notice wife is old and gross. Immediately imprison and execute her then marry 16 year old.  10/10 would execute again
I love Paradox and the games they make it is really dun and can make me really entertain!!
Kill childrenhear the voice of Jesus while being possesed by the devilaccidently marry off your daughter to your grandson
Worth every dime and penny under the sofa. 10/1
starts new game marries princess of the byzantien empire has son byzantien emperor dies attack boy emperor win war son dies finds out he was inbred (before he died) wife is acctually cousine oh no she gives brith to a inbred genius strong attractive duaghter she is murderd i die    ... and it was going so well
Killed my fuck grandson so my daughter would have an heir in my dynasty.  10/10 would commit infanticide again
Being a Muslim has never been so fun!
The learning curve on this game is similar to the elevation on mount Everest. If you have the time to watch several tutorials and learn how to play the game it is well worth your time. If you like grand strategy games and you like Game of Thrones this what you NEED to play.
Also Called Dopenine Kings
This game is so good that it is truely unreviewable... All I can say is that it is a game where you take control of a landed dynasty and your goal is navigate them through the medieval times by any means necessary  9.7/10 (bad tutorialexpensive [but u can buy it on sale and in all honesty this game can provide thousands of hours of entertainment as the story changes everytime so its worth every dollar spent])
Though not without a few glitchesbugsa very steep learning curve
the best game in the entire history of genuine appreciation for history that paradox interactive has ever produced ( btw the best game in steam ) This game balances a complicated yet easy to uderstand interface and a wide set of decisonsand for the first time in history you really can become a medieval legend
I married my 15 yo daughter to a 50 yo King of Sweden.
King cut my balls off. Seduces my wife and has 15 kids with her. Blew up King with Fertilizer.   1000/10 would kill that son of a ***** agian.
-Works over 100 years to become king -Becomes King -Gets assassinated 3 months later  69/10 Would waste my time to become king again
This game is incredible. As a history buffI really can appreciate how realistic this game is in the aspects of diplomacy and war throughout the Middle Ages. Most games in this genre focus on warbut this game focuses on so much more than that. You are constantly having to worry about who will succeed you when you die and what people's opinions are of you. It is absolutely brilliant. I love everything about this game. It's map and layout is absolutely beautiful and its noneurocentric format is outstanding as well. I highly recommend this game!
After 150 hours you can finally say you passed the tutorial.
I love Europa IV and after watching a few videos I thought I'd get this gameand I must sayI LOVE it! It is quite different than Europa and definetely worth getting. Both of these games are easily my favorite historical games! Now...   Find out sister has started faction against me  Start plot to kill her  Four people join
Best strategy game around
I have very little idea of what's going most of the timebut it's simply brilliant. I didn't even realise I had nine kids unti lthe last two needed tutors. 8.5/10.
Absolutely greatyou get your  kicked like a $$$$$.
One of the best in the epic grand strategy map genre. It's good to be King. That is until your uncle ursurps the thronesteals your wifeand imprisons your children.
If you like to craft intricate stories in unique gameplay featuring Medieval Europe then go for itthe learning curve is a bit steep.
It's okay I guess...
An absolutely amazingly detailed game! If you you're a fan of Total War but want more of the politics and intriguethen this is the game for you. Howeverif you want epic battles and combat then this game may not be the best choice. Crusader Kings II has amazing depth and complexity and through careful negotiations and plots one can become a powerful ruler without having to raise an army. This is NOT a fast paced game. If you want fast paced action then go for Total War or another combat based RTS. However
10/10   This game is absolutely brilliant.   You play as the head of a dynastymarrying for either diplomatic purposes to gain powerful allies or for a geniusstrong
Very nice Game
Amazing game! There is a bit of a steep learning curve to get into it but once you do you'll end up sinking hours on end in a blink of an eye...and you'll love it
If you have any intrest in medieval period and grand strategy get this game. It is absolutely superb.
Nothin' says 'lovin'' like marrying your cousin!
check my hoursi would'nt play a game this long if it was bad. its exceedingly good if you like it you'll love ityou either don't get it and not like it
It's basically Game of Thrones Simulator 1066.  What's that? There's a Game of Thrones mod for this game?  Wellthere you go
Plays like Games of Thrones
This is a great game if your willing to learn it.
One of the best games I have ever played!!
It is complicated to learn. I recomend watching some Lets Plays of it first to help you understand how everything works. Reading the wiki helps too. Once you get into it thoughit can be really fun. I highly recomendassuming you have a lot of time on your hands to play
Great Game. Love the ton of addons available to add onto the product. Flows welland keeps you guessing vs. AI oponents. Lots of detail overall. My only wish is there would be greater diplomacy optionsas there doesn't seem like too many options actually exist. I would think if an enemy is at your borders
use to love the game...but unfortunetly it seems incompatible with my new computer and doesnt even say why its crashing seeing as how there i have almost all the dlc (only missing some of the skin and sound packs) it really is a shame that i cant recomend this game....and it has been doing this for far too long for it to be something they will fix shortly.....after almost 3 months im finaly only now giving up so if you want to risk it do so you might get lucky and be able to play a great game otherwise prepare to have wasted your money Edit: this still holds true most of the time IF you lunch it from the steam/ shortcut....one or the other wont work...depends on CPU it seems tryed it on both i have and one ran it from shorcut only other from steam only
Great game.  Too much DLC greedthough.
Great game.
Never thought I'd make this. Here it goes.  I love this game. I love Paradox. But I dislike how they handle new DLC. The fact that two sets of DLC I payed forare now either gone or barely in itpisses me off. Mediterranian potraits for the Greeks are gone
Get killed at a feast in my homeland while I'm out fighting 3 kingdoms away.
Try it. Don't think about it.. just try it. You won't be dispointed.
One of the best games I have ever played. The only problem is the dlc milking however the gave does have good sales and the dlc is almost always good. 9.7/10
An utter challenge. Easily the most complex kingdom builder I have ever played.
this is an amazing strategy game. it really sucks when you buy something a few weeks ago and then see it on sale...... damn...
This game can be hard to learn in the beginingbut once you doit becomes one of the best games out there
Unified the Kingdom of Danmark under the guidance of the gay Italian queen. 10/10 would play again.
It proves beneficial to take a loan from the jews and then expel them from your country.
awsome
The tutorial does not seem to work. Also i think you will ind it very hard to play this game as a perfectionist wanting to be good I find this game far to advanced for my feeble easely bord mind  But if you wnane use hours to gett into this entertainment i belive it to be great
Sold my sister for 70 gold...   10/10 would sell family members again.
one of the funnest most addictive games. But watch out for those vasslesthey WILL try to kill you.... often.... but with poorly laid plans haha.
Very intertaining and fun for hoursthe gameplay can be alittle slow at times but the freedom of a open world makes up for it.
Since I bought this game about two years agoI have apparently spent more than three weeks of my life playing Crusader Kings II (even though I didn't play it for months at times). I now have come to the conclusion that I should consider professional help.
I have spent so much time on this game. Most of it offline. Please get it and all of the dlcs. Praise be to allah
Ever wanted to selectively breed European royalty?  Welcome to your game.  Spend years trying to make your genius master tactician duke into an elected monarchonly to die and have your slow ugly brother take over and ruin all your fuck. Kill your extended family! Send your unlanded sons to become priests while they scream at you for property! Ignore the demands of your vassals until the pitchfork your ! Spend what feels like 10 minutes (but is actually 1 hour) trying to arrange the perfect marriage for claims and smarts!
A steep learning curve but ultimately the most rewarding game i've ever played. The DLCs are pricey but add significant and refreshing new perspectives that refresh the game anew. The best game I own.
UPDATE: Now that the learning scenario has been added I am much happier with this game. Updating my review to a recommend now that I don't have to slog through the tutorials and can actually learn how to play while playing.    I am amazed by the number of people who recommend this game. I found it to be another highly complicated game with a clutteredunintuitive user interface and a poorly designed tutorial. It's boring and tedious.  Some of my favorite games are CivilizationMaster of Orion 2
I've created a dnasty of inbread dwarfs! 10/10
It's complexbut once you get past the learning curveyou'll enjoy plotting and scheming as I do!
Im not sure if this the worst game ever or if Ive just found the first cyber drug.....
I banned pantsinstigated the turnip as a currencymade everyone put exactly two holes in their houses
First time really getting into this type of grand strategy game. Was able to pick the province where my family hails from and start as a Count there. Wish you could start lower as a common soldier or some suchregardless it was a grind at times to improve my position. You have a great deal of opportunity to break out earlybut as you learn how laws effect you
Amazing game. Even three years after it was madeit still never ceases to amaze newcomers such as I. DLC is worth it.
*joke about killing incest babies*  Some people complain about the amount of DLCbut its worth noting that the base game is entirely playableto the extent that the previous crusader kings game was. The first game never added playable muslim or pagan characters
This game is awesome! You have the choice of several typs of HOW TO RULE MY LAND. You are the masteryou are a Crusader King!
I have many friends who played this game and they recomended it to me but when I first played itthe tutorial was tough to follow and I looked for off game sources i.e. youtube tutorials. For a noob the game is challenging. There isn't a problem with the game as per my friends enjoyment but I would complain about the steam support. The game started crashing the last few times I tried to play and steam's refunds are stressful because their support lacks the attention customers should recieve. This is my problem and I admit maybe its just me but its hard to handle steam support and games that one may not like or find interest when played instead of having played only teasers. My problem is finding interest in the gamewhich doesn't mean others may not recomend it
This is probably my favourite game from the first day I played it. So much content in DLC - Paradox Interactive is a standout developer and publisher - tons or replayability coming from the continuing support from Paradoxendless amazing mods by fansand a unique and engaging game design. If this kind of game intrigues you at all
I will begin this review with the statement that I have more hours on the Game of Thrones mod than I do on the vanilla game. The game itself is not badif you are the type of person that can get immersed into roleplayit is great. If not then it may be a bit on the boring side as a large cunk of the gameplay in my opinion is roleplaying and growing attached to your character/dynasty. You are crafting a story
Had my 50 year old cousin marry his secret 16 year old illegitimate half sister. Of his five childrenonly the two produced from that union survived to adulthood  10/10 would wincest again
This game offers a new experince each and every time you play.
While I recommend this gameI cannot recommend enough that you watch tutorials on youtube and elsewhere before so much as touching this game. If you don'tthis game will kick your butt across the room and back like something out of a Lovecraftian insanity network
A great strategy game for anyone interested in European history.
Great Game 10/10
Simply the best medieval grand strategy game ever made. Slow at timesbut engaging and incredibly realistic.
Only played with the Game of Throne (A song of ice and fire for book fuck??s) mod but really enjoyed this game. It is a lot to take in on a first playthrough but I do think learning to manage the whole thing is worth it in this case.  The game is mostly reading so do beware if this is not your thingbut the amount of unpredictable scenario that can happen while playing gave me a ton of fun. The only thing i really wish was better is the customisation of character or land and the dlc for it is laughable.  Lesbian baby /10 would make my wife impregnate a woman again
Sexy gamesexy mapsexy DLC. Quality time. Good mods.
The stories I could tell.
Lost a girlfriend to this game. I don't regret it. Got bad grades in school (except history for some reason). Who needs it. I control all of Europe. Totally worth it.  10/10
I see countless hours of Crusader Kings II in my future... exceptsteam counts hours for you.
10/10 great game.
If there was one medieval strategy game that I had too choose to play for lifeit would be Crusader Kings 2. An uncanny masterpiece.
Lovely gameif you like shifting the ways of your mediaval country through politics and incestthis is a must buy. You can 'change' the tieds of history in a single afternoon.
Great political and intrigue game mechanics. Only game that's made me yell at my computer 'Make more babies!'
its hard but fun
My friends suck. 10 minutes into the game two of my characters have been killed. One of them was 0 years old.
This game is basically People Breeding Simulator. Besides selecting for skillsyou also have to take personality into account. Vassals with compatible personalities will go along with anything you say. Vassals with conflicting personalitites will rebel no matter how much treasure you pile at their feet. :)
DAMN THOSE FRENCHIES!!! ALWAYS IN THE WAY!
I love this game. I love the diplomatic and personality dynamicswar and combat and creating and breaking nations. A bit of a learning curvebut everything's pretty intuitive once you know what's where.
It's great fun just way too many frigging dlc.  I bought the Collection edition for 43$ and even then I don't have the Horse Lords pack. Still think it's worth it anyway. Buy it when it's on sale you won't regret it.
that feel when you time it so that you kill your heir and then immediately die so that your genius second son inherits with no revolts
Becomes King of WalesMarry William the Conquer's Daugterdie and william inherits Wales.
Its pretty good.
Iim still undecided. This game is much more strategic in a make-your-family-inherit-everything-under-the-sun way than combat- though that is also a factor.  I don't have much time in my scedule for this gamebut here's a synopsis of my first significant effort.  I don't remember the name of the countrybut I am the cheiftain of a province. I am the vassal of an overlord who is the king
Do you dream of creating a dynasty that will last a thousand years? Do you find Tywin Lannister to be a sympathetic character? Have you ever wanted to engage in an insane plot to murder your beautiful wife so you can marry a hunchbacked lunatic with a wealthiermore powerful father? If you answered yes to any or all of those questions then Crusader Kings II is the game for you!
Gamed the Trait system until I got the stats I wanted. Wife gave birth to a genius princess. Tutored her at her Father's side into an ultra-aware spying machine. Married her off multiple times to various kings and usurped their thrones into my bloodline. 10/10. Would Bene Gesserit again.
Over 100 hours logged  - Extorted more money from Pope's than I can count  - Went from a Count to a Emperor in 2 month's before dying without a heir  - While being subjugated (playing as a Pagan)went and raided his landslet him win the war and then immediately declare independence  - Somehow ended up having to marry my own daughter so that I could claim back land
Haven't played muchbut really like what I've seen so far.
Very steep learning curve requiring patiencebut once you get the hang of it you'll be killing your siblings for their holding in no time.
Amazing gameperfect for anyone who wants to start as a Kingor a lowly count and make your way in a world in chaos.   Tons of choices to make
Extremely deepextremely replayablealso has fantastic mods (even if the best ones aren't available in Workshop). Don't worry too much about buying all the DLC
Love the game. Hate the new updates that crash your game as your about to make a pagan empire. Mabee next time fix updates before you release them and set everyone back. Like i said love the game though.
Buy this gameNothing better than Stretching an Empire from Iceland to India only to see it collapse as you decided to be an Elective Monarchy and lose to someone else
The base game is great but I can't believe the ridiculous prices of DLC that add hardly any content. Some are worth the price but most aren't worth more than a dollar. The fact that horselords was released alongside a 'content' pack for it is just another example of cash-grabbing. That sort of thing makes it hard to support an otherwise great game.

By far the best game I have ever played in my entire life with infinite replayability and variety. Shoud you play western lordpagan lordmuslim lord
Very good gamecountless hours of joyshame that there is SOOOOO MANY DLCS that you have to waste 100+  to have it all
Gave a friend's wife lover's pox. She promptly infected my friend and eventually all of England.  11/10 would STI again
Started off as the Norman Duke of Apulia After the Norman Invasion in 1065. (Stamford Bridge Bookmark 1066)  After becoming King of Sicily and consolidating my holdings 10/10 to be exactI prepared for the crusades. Using my more mobile and larger force I take complete control of Jerusalem. I then Make every duke within the Dejure Kingdom Jewish and start converting my Children.  Then in 1188The NorseNormanFrenchSicilian Invaders of the Holy Land convert to Judaism
If this game didn't tend to crash to desktop every few game years I wouldn't have a single gripe about it.  There is so much going on at onceif you enjoy playing mega-spreadsheet version 10.0 you will like this game. Hours go by as you are organizing your councilbestowing titles
In the Game of Crusader Kingsyou win or you die. There is no in-between. It's a truely stunning game with maybe not the most realistic of rulership over your peopleI.E. being the Arabs and turning Catholic to become 'Persia Minor' or something under the Roman Empire's rule
i dont know what the fuck im doing but its fun!
I'ts Look like boring game... just clicking here and therebut why i stay on this screen for many hours i still have no idea may be i just a megalomania who love being a king...
Probably one of the best Grand Stratagy Games out there. Very emmersive atmospheresometimes I spend hours just looking at all the characters and their ancestors. Really fun stuff. Bend the powers of polictics and start from a Count to become a Emperor or the other way around you never know what will happen. Alsothe new Old Gods downloadable content is coming out today which sets time back by 199 years so you can play as the Vikings and raid Europe! Seriously
It's good to be king.
This is addictive. But you'll like.
In a nutshell: Incest and Assasination Simulator 2016
pffffand they say history isn't fun
This game is so fun to play when you have that Game of Thrones mod on I meanas Aegon 'The Conquerer' I took over the entire Westeros and half of Essosthen I died trying to obtain a Valyrian Steel sword:(. Anyways
do not swing on the stoolsit damages the floor
Breaking and learning things about history in a fun way. High learning curve. Took me over 24 hours of play time before I figured things out. I love how the game doesn't lag or slow down like civilisation as the game progresses and you can pace the speed of the game with different time settingsthis is really the better way for gameplay experience.
Difficult yet rewarding game.  A shame it has so many DLC's.
this game helped me improve my world geography and history love paradox love it
I like this game because you have to consider everything when you make a decision (especially war). If you don't consider everythingsomething bad will probably happen. In addition things may happen that you cannot take into account. You always have to be on your toes in order to succeed. My dislike of this game is that it has a cruise ship full of cheap DLC. Most are only $2 except for the major expansion packs but a large amount of $2 charges for new songs and new ways to design character faces can really add up.  9/10
5/10 There is a lot of depth to this gameand I know that there are people who love it dearly. I can respect the level of intricacy containted within this game. At it's corethis game is about maintaining a dynasty and really nothing else. The war element is almost nonexistant
This game never endsyoull be playing it for the rest of your lifestill an amazing game after 300 hours.
Playing as the Byzantine Empirethe Sunnis launch what feels like the 100th revolt. Raise armies from the Kingdoms of Syria and Anatolia whodespite having superior numbers
This game is one of the best grand strategy games around and is seriously amazingly fun once you get past the learning curb. However grand strategy games no matter how well made aren't for everyone so I reccommend watching some of Arumba's and Shenryyr2's youtube ck2 videos to see if it seems like the type of game you may be into.
Good immersion into the medieval world! Very interesting paths to be explored! The only downside is the lack of diplomatic options when it comes to things that are non-war related (commerceetc)  8/10
Takes a long time to learn what to do in this gamebut worth the time. Very solidbalanced strategy experience.
One of my favorite games in my library I keep coming back too.  Once I played through a string of military kings in Spain slowly driving out the Muslims. The succession went to a 3 year old boy eventually. Everybody hated him. It even got to the point they plotted to assassinate this kid. They planned out a hunting trip to bring a 3 year old on. The toddler king was like 'Oh boy! My very first hunting tripI can't wait!' On itthe guide ended up smothering the toddler king with a pillow while whispering 'I'm sorry.' The succession then went to an adult cousin.  On another run. I bought the Way of Life DLC
It's complexobtuseand dry
I feel like I do not give this game the time it deserves. I want to spend a lot longer on it and delving into it than I ever dohowever I always want to spend that time working with online friends. So it eitherin my experience
Grand Theft Empire.
People nowadays throw around words like 'hardcore' and 'casual' when talking about games. Wellrest assured this game belongs much more firmly in the 'hardcore' category than Gears of War or Call of Duty could ever dream of.  This game is complicated. Grantedthis is the first Paradox grand strategy title I've actually put any serious effort into
Without a doubt one of the most coplex and difficult games I have ever played. And it's fun to play online with friends. Yesthere is a steep learning curve at first. But once you figure things out you will probably accidentally waster an ntire day in this game as I am as of this review.
This game is awesome for the graphics and gameplaybut some things I kinda dislikeperhaps the update that made you right-click to open up a charcter option tab or whatever it is called
A 'Game of Thrones' simulator.  10/10
If you're not into a game with a steep learning curve. This isn't the game for youbut if you're looking for a game with tons of strategy and dynamicsthis is it. It's basically like playing Game of Thrones from the political aspect of it. In fact they have a mod just for that style of game play.
I'll start off by saying that I didn't really like Crusader Kings II at first. I remember telling me friend (who loves the game and is the one who conviced me to buy it) that I felt it was basically Micro-management simulator. Since I got the whole Paradox collectionI wrote it off as an unfortunate waste of money (I at least got it on sale) and didn't play it for a while. Then I saw a few guides and decided to give the game a second chanceand I must say it didn't waste them! Once I was able to see how all the mechanics of the game fitted together
This is the best medieval (or anyother time period for that matter) socio-economic simulator. I love just ploting to take lands from my allieploting against my familyor fighting holy wars (or pagen invasions). The multitude of different strategies that you can come up with is quite vast. Marry your sister just so you can later invade her country and kill her.... yup. Make your fool brother a commander of the army just so he dies and you get full control of the kingdom.... yup. Convince the world that your Uncle is a fuck-up just do you can invade kingdom.... hell yeah!!
One of the best games I have ever played.
This game is just incredible. It never bores me and since I've gotten into roleplay it has even been more fun than ever. I think it perfectly resembles the medieval intruges and politics. It is just so goodit's awesomeness can not be described by mere words. And if the thrill of killing your brother for land or raiding and pillaging the christians as sons of Ragnarr isn't enough for you... there is a song of ice and fire (game of thrones) mod.  10/10 would kill my siblings for land again. (Wellonly in the game though.)
Become the first Scottish king of Sweden. Get invaded by medieval Incans. Contract herpes. Get murdered by your inbred children.
REASON TO BUY: There is always something new to try (new religion/character). SOOOO mutch to try!!  REASON NOT TO BUY: There are so many things to try so you don't have time to try them all..
Took me 12 triesbut I finnally reunited the Roman Empire. But only from the Charlemange bookmark. Now I gotta do it from the Alexiad.
Started as Sancho of Castillevery early on switched to Elective Monarchyelected Alfonso of Leon as King uniting the three crowns
not worth it
Crusader Kings 2 is a amazing game to playyou get to be a ruler in a perod of Anceint Europer or if you buy the DLCyou can play in India
A greatcomplex grand strategy. I love the focus on characters and families as well.
It has to be said that Crusader Kings is an unusually addicting game. Whilst it may seem like a rather simplebare-boned product to someone who is unfamiliar with Paradox and is perhaps more used to the Total War seriesthis game has the seemingless power to easily encapture you in an 8 hour long-session
WHY AM I SO ADDICTED?!?!?  I'm seriousthis game is amazing. For pretty much one whole weekI've been playing this every chance I get. It's absolutely amazing. Within a week
I love this game. With over 260 hrs playedI still enjoy it.  Pros -replayability dufferent ruler typesreligeons
Pros  After many hours of play - wow. If any game were to be the right one to introduce a newcomer to the under-appreciated genre of grand strategyCK II would be the one. CK II has its own unique and more indirect form of actionthat eventually got me absorbed about as well as any other game could
Very steep learning curve. VERY STEEP!!!  Poor tutorial that ends too quickly without explaining the full game mechanics.  Control layout not intuitive.  Information not handed to the player in either a timely or instructional manner. eg. - Why marry this woman over another?  - Why hire this spy master?  - Someone joins your  court.....So?   - How do you add a guardian to your children?  - Where is the fleet I just razed?  - How do you stop everyone hating you?  - Which army on the map is marching through your land and which is about to knock you out of the game?  - When and what and why should I build something? - An incident occurs with no advice of possible ramifications on my decisions.   Every game I play I am left with more questions and frustration. I am glad I bought it on sale. I was hoping for something like Medieval War but deeper. Instead I bought a spreadsheet covered in a map and nice music.  That all said...I then went and read the negative reviews...many with LOTS of hours. Others also report its not only very steep to learnbut eventually you run into the DLC issue. Apparently (and yes I have already run into this) you need to buy a LOT of DLC to get the game to work properly.   My advice. DONT BUY.  I love deep strategy.... provided its playable. And I am not talking about 'Civ' as deep strategy. Games like Grigspy's Pacific War are the depth I like. This game seems deeper and less intuitive.
According to SteamI have played this game for 555 hours. I have never played a game which came close to this one at holding my interest. There are so many different possible ways to playit never gets old.
Amazing gameit's just a shame about all the bugs. Take the additions that CK2+ bringthey make it much more immersive
I actually hate this game.  10/10
Great gamevery immersive lots of stratergy make sure to buy it with dlc's (I have never played vanilla) BUT it is definatley worth the money.
A really fun Role playing strategy game
This game is great for staying up until the sun comes up obsessing over which of your cousins to marry.
There's a reason this is my most played game!' Okso now for the real review. This is the most in depthre-playable
Ithe aging king of England discover that my only heir is gay and has no children. In order to save my family line I throw a big party to get my daughter-in-law in bed with meshe does and now my son has a son that he believes is his
This game is spectacular. I was first critical since it had no first person action or any real time unit command like the Total War series howeverI was quickly proven wrong by the gameplay. It is a very clever game and very fun to play. I am a very big fan of CK2 and would recomend it to anyone who likes history and strategy games in general.
Start as duke of Lancasterat some point became duke of Merciacharacter dies at France leading English army
Conquer the world as your favorite midieval kingdom. Definently hours of fun and is one of my favorite games i've played.
An Awsome Game
Had 5 children one beat all to death over cookie
The kind of game you forego sleep and hygeine for. I keep trying to tell friends about my efforts to conquer Europe with a backwater Polish duke can't figure out why they're not interested.
One of the best games in my possesionif not thé best game. It is an awesome dynasty simulator where you canmore or less
Fractal complexitybut the steep learning curve is well worth it. The first 'EU-like' I've been able to get in to.
such a great game so indepth! And replayable... the MODs thew MODs too will paly agin many times! Every time I see GOT I want to play again :)
Best ww2 simulator out there.
For a indepth game like this. I still only have one question.  Whatdoido? I don undastand dis. Whatdoido? MAAAAAAAAAM. Whatdoido?  8/10 Needs moah tutorials. - Destructoid
Played for ten minutes. My wife cheated on me with my brother/nephewmurdered my only son and then soon after I 'died an inbred freak'.  10/10 GOTY
People like me often talk about games as a way of telling stories. Crusader Kings 2 is the embodiement of that idea. Crusader Kings 2for any flaws it hasis a storytelling game
I killed the Pope I sent my son to death I died from insanity I invaded Ireland I made my daughter marry a 35 year old man when she was barely 12  This is video games
Killed my mom and a elderly for being feminist    10/10
CKII is not for the plebsconfirmed.
if you are going to buy a game that crashes you might just well pirate it.
Crusader Kings 2 was my first experience with a paradox strategy. It's not about the fancy graphicsit's not about button mashing or micro-managing. You really are forced to plan 10 steps ahead and play for the long term. It differs from many other strategies which focus mainly on combat systems and tech. No 1 game will be the sameno 1 strategy will fit all sizes.  Pros: Hats down this is one of the most indepth and complex strategies I have ever played
Played as byzantine empire during the viking age. Killed the emir of Syria' Jihad on Greecelost.. end game gg wp 10/10
10/10 would bang my sister again
Greatest strategy game ever
Bought gamestarted the game then suddenly 32 hours has passed
I could not even finish the learning scenario but hey got betrothedbroke bretrothalmarried the gal anyway
For a game this austereit sure has a lot of typos.
Awesome gameloved it for a long time. Definitely worth a play!
I personaly think that if you new to the franchise it is a bit overwhelming
God dammit I Impregnated my cousin who was my son's daughter and now everyone thinks the kid is my wife's who just so happens to be my aunt's son who himself was born to my brother I'm a god damn stupid idiot.  But it's okay because I'm the Viking subjugator of Germany.
Highly recommended. If you like the idea of guiding a dynasty (sometimes successfully!) over multiple generationsdealing with Wars of Aggression (ahem..staring them)the plots of neighbors
Like a great novel or radio showCrusader Kings II is theatre of the mind. The mechanics and controls can seem overwhelming at firstbut the payoff of the stories you get is worth the investment of a dozen hours to learn how the game works. Recreate history in your own vision
this game is 10/10 too Dank to handle for the dirty plebs but for all the groovy cats out there this makes quite a good ol' romp. JKthis game is undeniable fun if you take interest in finer detailextensive systems and complex choices. The game can provide so much variety in situations that the game never really feels repetitive. All said this game does not have the simple pick up and play motives of similar games like the Civilization or total war series
If you don't play this seriouslyyou can call it an 'Incest/Plots and Intrigues/Sociopathic Ruler Sim'.  If you play this seriouslyyou'd still call it 'Incest/Plots and Intrigues/Sociopathic Ruler Sim'.  In the tutorial scenario alone
There are some people who have over 1000 hours on this game. For most gamesthat would become endless tedium. For Crusader Kings IIthat's normal.  Is it worth all of the expansions? Hell yes. Is it worth all of the eye candy? Hell yes.  If you think you're a fine
Made myself a hereticwent through three wives in one kingand comminted genocide on the House Karling
A great complex strategy game. Building a family tree for prestige while conqueringand defending your land. Giving this game a well worth a look.  Many DLC come with this gamewhich of course come with a price
Awesome game!However I don't like that they removed the assassinationsI would have liked to kill my son.
This is one of my all time favorite games! Classic Paradox coplexity that makes a very interesting and rich gaming experience. It is a expensive game if you include all the DLCsbut it was totaly worth the price for me! If you like strategic games and you have patience to learn to play itI can't recomend this game enough!  Many were called
Played as Wales and turned Europe into the glorious Empire of Prydain.  10/10 - Would be unable to pronounce any of my characters' names again.
This video game adaptation of HBO's original series Game of Thrones is surprisingly good. Created by the same team behind America's Army its no surprise there is plenty of budget put into it.
if you're never liked history in schoolyou're just like me. Random datesrandom dudes
Great game.
Killed my father and married my mother. 10/10
This game is like the best strategy game over Age of Empires IIthe only problem is that sometimes when it's loading it likes to stop responding then crash . but other than thatgreat game ^.^
Conquering random provinces in Turkey to stop your sons fuck?ing about being unlanded as a Jewish Norse emperor who's married to his aunt has never been more believable.
Difficult to beginbut hugely engaging once you've learned the basics
I once managed to inherit England/Scotland as House Zagwe (Abyssinia066 start)and used my newfound manpower to kick the Fatimid Caliphate's teeth in and establish myself as a proper empire.  10/10
I ordered the assassination of a 1 year old kid so I could unite my kingdom0/10 would regicide again.
Political marriagespolitical incest marriagespolitical incest paedophile marriages
highly addictive and full of historical stories...
If you like the idea of managing a character instead of a nation like some grand strategy games this is the game to play. You can start off as just a duke and end up ruling an empire. Each play through of the game will be different. Randomly generated situations arising as you play your character trying to improve the politcal and military situation of your land.  Having to balance your alligence to Rome (The Pope) or face being excommunicated. Ruling producing heirs and not so legitimate children. To taking control of your court and staking claims to landsto creating factions to elimate a rival or even a family memeber who wants your position.  Rule the medievil era with an ironfist and be king!
Worth ithours of fun with friends over lan or internetespecially if you are a Elder Scrolls fan and get the Elder Scrolls conversion 'Elder Kings'
This game is DOPE.
The best medieval strategy game! It may look chaotic at first but if you give some time to learn its mechanics its one of the bestif not the bestmedieval experience out there!
My son assassinated me with exploding manurewon one battle against the French then received a knock to the head. My king is now incapable.  10/10
Best game I ever playedwas always slightly hessitant of buying itbecause I knew it did not have real time battles like in for instance Medieval Total war II. However
Amazing gamebetter in every way to CK 1!
If you like history and strategy gamesif you enjoy management and detailed gamesthis is probably the best engine ever. Mix total war games with a bit of tycoon and rolegame
44844
I'd say it was definitely the best Paradox Interactive gameif I wasn't biased to Hearts of Iron 3. Truly an amazing game that you can lose hours in without knowing it. 10/10
Captured a princessmade her a concubine. then executed her two year old son.  Best Viking simulator ever 11/10
I played as a peaceful and kind ruler of Cumberland. Then the English killed me and my whole family. 11/10
Paradox's best work. If you're interested in grand strategythis is a must buy.
Ever felt the need to Deus Vult? Well you can Deus Vult to your hearts content in this game. Deus Vult in all fashionspoliticaltactical or even just marrying your own sister. It's a delightful game and addition to any library.
Never has it been so fun to murder your siblings
accidentally assassinated my entire family 10/10
Yeah there's an A Song of Ice and Fire mod for this game so I'm quitting my job and dropping out of school foreverbecuase I have everything I need.
A complex game that is amazing in its depth.
I killed my rival by recruiting his Spymaster. She sided with me. Now she is my concubine. Sweeden has never been so peaceful. Give this game a chance.
I had a lifeonce. Now I have Crusader Kings II. PersonallyI'm satisfied with the trade.
Twas an epic experience but itll take an entire 5 months study session to understand the UI .&lt
One of the best games I have ever played. It is very complex and definitely not for everyone. The choice of making you play one character allows you to both experience Grand strategy and RPG elements. This is a game still being improved and added on to years later. If you come to this game expecting Total War battles you will be disappointed but it makes up for it by being an excellent strategy game. The game will test your intelligence and morality as you try to out marryout kill and outspend everyone else in EuropeNorth Africa
Love this game!   Warning: It's complexaddictive and it's a total time-sink but when you computer the cost/hour spent playingthis will be the best thing you ever bought on Steam... especially if you catch it on sale! Oh
My 16 year old gay son took the name Leo V and became Pope.  10/10
Wait until it is on sale and buy it with all the dlc. OMG there is so much to do in the game when you have all the dlcsplus it has about 700 years for you to play thoughout versus the around 200 of EU4 and Victoria 2. And Yesyou need the dlc
Welleverytime I launch the gameI get a Runtime error. I checked the forums and nothing they suggest works. I wasted 10 dollars on this. You should get it as long as you're confident that it'll work.
This Game is one of the best buys on steam I've everymade.
One of the greatest Strategy games out there.
The learning curve is pretty steep but after a couple attempts at learning I'm starting to get the hang of it. Despite the steep learning curveI am still enjoying the game so I can't wait until I master it.
Fun game but i hate this dlc whoring paradox is doing.   11/10 would fuck? again
I can't reccomend this game enoughI have over 600 hours in it and it's worth every pennyDefinitely one of the mos satisfyingly complex strategy games I've ever played. It's basiclly a near perfect mideval politcs simulator you can build your own narratives in.
The best Early-to-Late Medieval dynastic strategy game ever made.
Conquer the medieval world through forcecunning and inbreeding.... er... that's intrigue. Best paradox game to date!
My wife was the leader of a revolt so I had her assassinated and married a 16 year old.
Best strategy game around.
Simply brillianta very addictive way of redecovering strategy genre.
Premier Game of Thrones simulator
If you only overcome difficulty of game UIthe game gives the best fun.
You guys are awesome so hilarious logging back into my saved game and hearing medieval christmas music while I'm playing.  Keep up the good work this game is the best and most re-playable game I have ever enjoyed playing.
It's Awesome
good game and best stategy ever(it's addicting)
I like this game. Seems like they pushed a few buggy releases late in 2014otherwise no issues. Hours of fun and replay value.
My personal game of the year for 2012. The historical setting is amazingthe different character scenarios are unbelievableand the dynasty system is super fun. All of this is wrapped up in a Grand RTS that can be played any way you want to.
This game is fantasticalthough it takes some getting used to. You play as a family dynasty instead of a nationand deal with feudal Europe from about 750-1450 AD.
Yes this game is great takes a little while to learn what your doing but when you do I promise this is one stragetgy game you won't reret buying.   Pros:  Fun gameplay Lots of factions to play Suprisingly deep  Khans:  a lot of the dlc should be already in the game not to be bought seperate prone to bugs from charlemagne  Overall 8/10 (would bang)  Recommended Mod: Game of thrones  Note: i really don't care about my spelling and/or grammer mistakes
if you have played another paradox game you know what your getting into. If not this is the best place to start.
Get this game. Get the ASOIAF mod. Enjoy a great strategy game with unique gameplay and a bloodline continuation that is in a league of its own. One of the best games I have gotten.
Get the demotry it out. Then buy this. This is one of the best games ever.
been playing GoT mod haven't even touched real game yet lol 111 hours whoops
A wonderful game. The mods are wonderfuland can add whole new layers to the strategy of navigating politicsand combat. Will you flex your diplomacy skills
I got to power by marrying one of my neighbours twin sisterstaking another one as my concubine and killing the rest of their family. After that I got a child with my concubine who was gay and disabledlater on we had twins
10/10 Would kill wife for younger one with active ovaries again.
If you enjoy games where you get to manage a kingdom and keep your dynasty inpowerkeep people happy with you so they won't plot to murder youexpand and defend your empire
One of the most in depth strategy I know.The scheming is a incredibly unique experence only limited by your imagination. Anyone who likes grand strategies this is a must buy.
Amazingly deep grand strategy. The Game of Thrones mod is very fun as well.
its a strategy game that is complex. looks nice but you will need to invest time for it to pay out.. confusing at first but i believe it is going to be worth the invested time.
I'm not a regular computer game player I prefer Xboxbut I must say this is perhaps one of the best games I have ever played. I have a couple hundred hours in already and still feel like I just scratched the surface. Warning: You will fall in love with this game and want to chuck it across the room all in the span of 5 minutes.
If you enjoy extinquishing entire generations of rivals because they plotted against youthis is the game for you.
Steep learning curve. Worth it.
Good game for hard core strategy enthusiasts.
This game is absurdly addictive. Cross political/historical dramalike the shows The Tudors or Vikingswith a game like Civilization and that's what Crusader Kings II is. It lets you play through all of the intrigue and economics
its one of the most addicting gmaes you can get you will find yourself getting on to play an hour or so and end up playing 4+ hours like i do
An incredible grand strategy and roleplaying game that turns you into a horrible person. It has a fairly significant learning curvebut once you get past that it can endlessly entertain you.
This game is like crack cocainne. If you have a social life then do not buy.
It is the bee's knees
A wonderful game. Don't let the complicated interface turn you off the entertainment potential really comes from the stories YOU tell that come from YOUR actions. Your own personal game of thrones. Not to mention a great window into European socio-political geography in the Middle Ages.
One of if not the best thinking game of the last years. The strategy warfare aspect could be improved a bitas could the diplomacy (that could have composite deals like in the CIV series) but besides thatis the best way to make yourself feel like a real middle age ruler.
My God.  Best. Game. Ever.  They just don't make games like this. They just... don't. Read the other comments for yourself.
AHH What?! Damn you vile addicting gameI take over all of EnglandIreland
CK2 was my first adventure into the Clausewitz systemand I think that overall having meddled with a couple of other Paradox titles(Europa Universalis IVand Hearts of Iron 3 or w/e it's called)
I really like this simulator of incestplotting to murder your sons husbandand sending a pope to make good with your evil
Iceland OP
I would Recommend this game to anyone. One of the best I've ever played.
Played as Premyslid around the time they died out and my line died out. 9/10 historically accurate  Made fucks with my son's wife. He thought they were his. Score! Conspired to kill my brother's wife in MP with my brotherso that he could re-marry. 10/10 socially acceptable
Just Look have many hours I've logged
Tried to take over Ireland to form the Kingdom of Irelandaccidently became the ruler of Norway through marriageand conquered the world with Norway's army. Yep my life is complete.  11/10
Great game
The game is funbut is very confusing and it is hard to learn how to do anything even after taking the tutorial. i give it a 7/10would make it higher but it takes more than 2 hours to even get a little understanding of what to do. I still barely know how to do anything.
Almost impossible to figure out!
Great game for those interested in the politics behind a show like Game of Thrones. Schemeplotmurder your enemies (and family) who stand in your way.
44844
A magnificently designed game with historically accurate political systems and game mechanicsperfect for anyone who likes to build their own story while controlling entire nations or counties and feeling like a medieval ruler. Be careful thoughthe DLC's aren't necessary to play the game but are very tempting once you really get into it.
Terrible gamemakes you kill your loved ones.
It's strategy to think about many things at the same time.
One of the best games ever createdbut only for the cardcore strategist!
Pro: Started as Italian Catholic Patrician in Venice. Finished game as homosexual Mongol Catholic Emperor of Italy with a long standing inbreeding experiment in a misplaced county. Murdered an entire Timurid family line until an incapabledemonicaly posessedZoroastrian
i play just an hourits vey complex game with a lot of menus and sub-menus and so onbut i recommend this game for the hardcore gamers
Wowthis took awhile to learnbut man is it fun.
This is a magnificent game. Absolutely recommend this.
Cousin had me fall off the balcony so that my sister (his wife) could inherit a duchy. As my original character's other sisterfought her and revoked her claim on the duchy twice. Had her imprisoned for a while just to have her suffer. Then had her executed.  11/10. Would fall off balcony again.
One of the best strategy game made to this day (with Europa Universalis).
Something normal fo Medieval ages that this game will allow you: I arrange wedding of of my half brothermy father's fuck to my youngest daughter... that way I legitimized my half brother as full member of our dynasty. The next day I issue an order to behead my cousinwhich was in prison for plotting against me. Normal things like that happen to me all the time while I was on my way to fight the arabs.
Killing ones own siblingskids or other close relatives has never been more fun. Oh and i guess Crusader Kings 2 is okay aswell.
Game of thrones. the videogame   every middle age fantasy you have ever wished for. wars to fight. marrie your 16 year old girl to a 53 year old duke so he could help you in the futurebe a tyrant[ if you wish to] execute people for trying to plot against yougo to a crusader so the pope would like you more
It is a lot of funbut hard as hell for a fan Total war.
I killed the 0-year old ruler of Barcelona to sell the duchy out to the French. No single crap was given that day
This is the only grand staray game I could get into. Very deep but quite accessible.
a bit hard to comprehend at first but really fun when you get the hang of it
This is different from any other strategy game I ever playedand I played a lot of them. Sureyou're the ruler
This is the game I've been looking for for a very long time. I love epic scale slow burn empire building games and in my opinion this one is near perfection. The depth is mind blowing. As a first test I decided to try to unify Ireland along it's de jure duchies. It took me 4 generations but I managed to do it. Not only was it loads of fun it could've been a satisfying game in its own right. Considering Ireland is just a small speck on the overall map it's hard to imagine all the gameplay possibilities. From a game quality perspective the art is in a league of its own and it's very well engineered. I haven't found any stability problemsit performs very welland I've only observed one potential bug (I hired Knights Templar for a battle and before combat they dismounted and became pacifist - but this may be my misunderstanding of how they're used). On balance this is a must own if you prefer mature strategy games and the only reason I gave it a 'Yes' recommendation is because there's not a 'Hell Yes'.
10/0.1 Would murder my grandsons again.
Nice game.
Crusader Kings is a specific kind of game that scratches a certain itch. If you are a fan of the total war series and always wanted a more political spin on things or a game of thrones fan that would want to rule his own kingdom then this game is for you. CK does a great job by immersing the player with excellent music and amazing events.    You'll find yourself looking at the figures on screen with love and hate. You'll feel bonded with your troops and your countrymen. Eventhough this game visually lacks the RTS of epic battles... It's actually nice on your rig and if you are so imersed then you don't need to see the battles anyway.   This game does a great job at focusing on the Kings duties. Not just war but also politicalspiritual and day to day things. It's a pleasure once you get over the slightly steep learning curve. Overal I give this game a   GLORYMETER=8.5/10
i hated the first hour but could not move my eyes from the screenminutes to hours and hours to days and i was in love. the amount i cared for my brother having a castle even though i knew it ment civil war and i knew it ment i would loose a significant amount of troops was self distructive ! thats why i love this game. its so intergrated into your imigination the graphics and lack of quality battle is totally ignorable. i was more interested in pretending that my brother was always second to me that i made a promise one day he would have his own land and keeping it no matter what. however do not like the ( to mehuge restriction on troops you get even when your lords are 100% happy with you compared to what you could have if you just didnt have lords) for me this eventually made me just become evil and have evrything to myself for shear military power. this made me not care much for lords which made my storys less important. 1000 troops drop to 200 is a huge disadvantage imo. which is unfair since the amount of effort to keep them 200 troops is allot since when that lords happiness getss to 0 the troops are just not even worth summoning. with that tweaked to 800 troops when happie i think the game would be significantly better and more stratagically improoved 9/10
Damnthis game is pretty good when you get into it
Started as polish chief and ended eradicating christianity from europe in the name of true slavic faith... with help from aztec (converted to slavicobviously) empire.  10/10
Crusader Kings II is a game that focuses on creating and evolving a historical dynasty. The player chooses a lord that can hold a range of titles (barondukeking
Crusader Kings 2 does it right. Normally after 100 hours of gameplay I tend to move on to different gamesbut this game keeps me coming back for more. From the hilarious pop up messages to the backstabing you don't see coming. This game is fun from start to finish. If you're a fan of grand strategy games then this is a must have!
I can't stop. I'm trapped in this game. Send help.
LOVE IT
What began as an attempt to forge claims to a five-hundred square mile island off the coast of Sweden by my humble nation of Denmarkresulted in a twenty-seven year war against the Holy Roman EmpirePoland
Killed my brother in a manure explosion then banged his wife and daughter at the same time.  11/10
This game is freaking amazingIt really portrays what life would have been like back then in medieval Europe. Best game I have played in a long timeIf you like this game also check out Europa Universalis IV
In depth strategyfar moreso than the total war series and the civ games. Not for everyonebut if you like strategy
This game is not for the faint of heart of those who lack patience. It has one of the highest learning curves in a Grand Strategy game. This ain't Civilization. You've been warned.  Crusader Kings II is a Grand Strategy game from Paradox Interactive. It was released in 2012 and has been very heavily supported with various expansions via Paradox as well as mod support.  You don't play as a country in this game. You play as a dynasty in the Middle Ages. You choose a person and have to rule over your land as well as make sure you have a successor to your dynasty. You may start of as a minor feudal lorda petty kinga king of a large country or an emperor. In this game you have to learn how to manipulate the political landscape
Nice mix of strategy with battles and a lot of strategy with people and social aspects. The complexicity and broad range of things to do that not just is battles are fun. I like the stories that comes with events - like when my fat king was killed by assasines on a wagon down hill... :)
Absolutely love this game! Can't get enough of it.
few 100 of hours wasted )
Whether you want an intense quick paced grand strategy action gameor if you want to just sit backrelax and watch the world evolve
This is by far the best incest and baby murder simulator on the market. With over 1 million units soldthey have to be doing something right!
This is basically Game of Thrones the game.
Stop being the only person in the world that does not have this game. It has a 95% rating for a reason. BUY THIS.
The game mechanics are beautifully implemented so as to produce a puzzle of scheming and diplomacy like no other game I've tried. The multiplayer is a bit glitchybut well worth the effort. The single player could entertain you for months.
With 271 hours playedi feel comfortable in my knowledge of this gameand i feel ready to make a 'review' of it. (note
One of the best strategy games ever made.
3/2 It sucks
World of PlotsIntrigueWar
It's funif you're into strategy games. It is a dynasty simulatornot a conquest game like the total war series. You're trying for a high score to see how your dynasty compares to those in history. It also has several links to Wikipedia for many individuals in each time period
Can murder all children9/10 would buy again.
Takes a while to get a hang ofbut it is a fantastic game and I really enjoy it.
Outstanding. All the depth you expect from Paradoxnone of the bafflement. At once a gloriously detailed simulation of medieval Europe and a top-class engine for emergent narrative. Obscure historical figures and their imaginary descendents will become characters you care deeply about (or despise with a cankerousmurderous passion). The map of Europe will be redrawn - and not just by you. In one game I spent 200 years conquering and uniting Britannia
Awesome game. Complete time sucker though. You will hate yourself at the end of a bender. But you'l love the game.
How do i get a patch?
Don't buy this -- It'll steal too much you your time.
darn it CKIIi wish i knew how to quit you.
The game where I can assassinate the Popemarry my motherand roll out holy war after holy war in my mad quest for domination...at least until my ruler dies without any legitimate heirs because he decided to be celibate.
If you want to play an RPG that pulls you into a vastvolatile world of deadly illnessesvast hordes
Wow... Huge (-F ) on the last updatea very extreme Nerf to assassination. Interesting how the NPCs can happily go about killing everyone. While I need to spend 10months crafting a plot that will likely not work.
Best. Game. Ever*.  I'm not actually a big gamermost games fail to interest me at all. Even EU4 seems to lose that special touch for meit becomes too impersonal. Having personal dramas mix right along side with imperial conquest and dynastic survival... There are ways in which this game could be better and more thorough
Great game with countless option to playwin and die.
CK II is probably the best strategy game I ever played and the one I was searching for quite a long time. You don't know me but I'll conquer your landone way or another.
Dont go to war with the Holy Roman Empire and you should be good. Amazing game! You will have many stories to share with friends about marrying wives for their huge tracks of landkilling your son because he's an idiotand wondering why you ever wanted to try playing King Phillip of France.
One of the best games ever! I have spent many hours destressing with CK2.
Medieval Russians like homosexuals even less than the Modern day equivalentapparently.
10/10 Would incest again
just like all paradox gamessmartstrong and addictive. truly a grand strategy game.
One of the best games I have ever played. Crusader Kings II allows for so much tinkering and toying with a game engine that is highly moddable (and for which some great mods have already been made).
More depth than EU3 but less of the nation building feel. Sad that you're limited to the European theater but is still very engaging.
Very well rounded game. In depth. Been playing 130+ hours and still learning a lot of about the game. Definitely worth the price and the DLCs expand the game experience
THE quintessential hardcore strategy game. If you've ever thought to youself 'I wonder what it would be like to be a medeival lord?' Well look no morebecause this is basically close as you'll getwithout actually timetravelling. I have around 800 hours logged. This game is under constant improvement
Great stuff. Very engaging.
Soyou think you're good person? Well thanthis game will change your mind - in trademark Paradox grand strategy format.
Crusader Kings II is a great gateway game for grand strategy as well as a little sprinkle of roleplaying. I will not dilute the truth about this game. This game is hard. It took me several tutorials and watching other players explain it until I could breach the entry difficulty level. And even after playing this game for yearsI am still learning all the deep mechanics in this game. But I learned these from my friends who I introduced to this game and they managed to even surpass me in some areas. There are two main advantages to this game which not many have. Each update the DLC is in the gamebut not necessarily directly accessible. With India now a landmass to invade but not to start as or playing as a Pagan or a Muslim leader. The other advantage is the coversion to Europa Universalis IV. This allows the kingdom you built up to be transfered into the world map instead of Europe
A fantastic example of what the grand strategy genre is capable of. Manages to successfully weave the GS genre with slight RPG elements to create a superb experience all around.   10/10 would bang.
the controls are hard and the tutorial is too vage
for grand scale games its over all alright but i feel like it focus to much on the people
very good finaly get to play as Ireland
A truly awesome game! Wage warworry about the successiongo on a pilgrimage
This game can be addicting.
Institute imbecile emperors and laugh at their merry mishapps. Masterpiece.
On my quest to re-establish the Roman Empirethe Duke of Sardinia rose up in revolt.  I defeated him with Russian mercenaries I bought with money I borrowed from Jewish banksand imprisoned his son.  Realizing he couldn't go to war if I had a hostage
Ever wonder what heroin was like? WellParadox interactive is giving you the chance to experience it for only slightly more than the actual cost of a heroin addiction.  Crusader Kings 2 is something of a turn-based strategy game that runs in real-time. From your vantage point over a lovely 3D map of Europeyou observe the passing of days/months/years
Truly the best strategy game i've ever played!
In shortI absolutely love this game.  In more wordsit's the kind of game you can get lost in for hours and hours (and hours). With so many different ways to play
I spent a long time forming the Wendish Empire and Installing my dynasty in all positions of power only to have my celibate lepper of a brother overthrown me with a vast army he cooked up out of thin air. He then went on to lose vast ammounts of land to Pagans and either arrested or killed all memebers of our dynastyafter several revolts to reinstall me. Before becoming too Stressed and Depressed with the situation and killing himself with me being his heir...  11/10
This game is such an interesting experience... Most games make you the center of the gamebut that isn't how this game works... You are just one part of a living world. And it works so well. The world is alive and you never know what might happen when you play a new game. Especially since it isn't focused solely on you. Also if you've been wanting a good 'A Game of Thrones' game like I have for a while now then you finally have it! Get this game and go download the 'A Game of Thrones' mod for it! It's amazing. ^.^
Like a rock of crack cocaine it is a little rough around the edges. It is like crack cocaine in other ways too...
Awsome game and for the most part historically accurate. the problem with this game is that proggress is not set in stoneand if you don pataintion you could easly miss something
Only one thing can be said about this game.  Worth every penny.
The learning curve is a bit steepand the tutorial is close to useless. But otherwise it's an excellent game which I highly recommend playing.
A great game for any history buffor regular fan of total madness. I dont know where to start describing this gameat first you'll be confused.. and then you'll be confused but hooked to the game.
This game is a blast. It balances nation interactions with personal diplomacy in a very unique way.
I recommend this game to anyone who loves RPG and strategy titles. This game brings out your dark side by killing off your rivals and pinning them against each for your own interest.
Just buy the gamefuckers!
Write a review for Crusader Kings II
One of the single most amazing strategy games ever made.
One of the best games I've ever played. It has sucked hours of my free time away. If your into grandstrategy gamesyou must have this.
It's a fun game that allows you to discover new ways to get what you want as you go on. Unfortunately there are a few bugs right nowbut it seems to be on its way to being fixed.
It's hard to imaginebut CKII is incredibly immersive. You wouldn't be able to tell given the screencaps of the gamebut you really get invested in your character and bloodline. (I was super thrilled when I managed to create an almost fully Anglo-Saxon Britannia that lasted over 200 years...)
To put it in the most simplistic terms: This is the greatest strategy game of all time!
I must state as a disclaimer that while CKII is an extremely immersive game becoming immersed initially is somewhat akin to jumping into a pool of molasis in that you cannot simply dive inbut once you do sink to the bottom it requires a great deal of motavation to swim back to the top. That being saidCKII makes up what it lacks in overarching story with its intrigue and believe it or not
This is a fantastic gameespecially for those who are intersted in medieval European history. The game lets you take over as a noble and live out your dynasty. It's scarily addicting even when not much is happening.
Amazing gameIve spent so many hours plotting to rule the world MUAHAHAHAHA 10/10 would kill my babies any day to keep my throne
Great gamevery indepth.
11
This game is a very intresting experience and I recommend it to anyone who is patient and likes the dark ages
I spent 100 hours in this game after only owning it a month. 10/10.
It is a very good game and no two play throughs are alike
I recommend watching some Youtube tutorials before sinking your teeth too far into this game. To someone not used to this type of game it can all seem very daunting. The Menu system is a bit cluttered and at times confusing but once you learn to make use of Hot Keys it won't be such a big deal.  This game can provide thousands of hours of playtimethere is always a different ruler to play asnew countries to conquer and new problems that arise when you get a bit too big for your breeches. If you want a fast paced war type game: avoid this one. If you're interested in carefully setting up your family to inherit power for generations to come
After a painful regency Emperor Edgar assumes the throne.  Edgar soon seduces and marries his sister. The Dukes and his extended family are unhappy. They rose in revolt. FortunatelyEdgar was getting military advice from Lord Jesus Christ himself. Edgar's son was assumed to be the spawn of Satan himself.  10/10
Even after many yearsCK2 Continues to be one of the games I keep coming back to over and over again. Each game is a new challenge. If you're a fan of the Grand simulation/RTS style gameswith a bit of roleplaying built in
I like this game...   Even though I have no idea what I am doing. Just try to conquer the world with fuckfuck/hunchback king killing everyone who you don't like. 10/11 potatoes
Have you ever wanted to have the chance to design an incestual nobel heratige. Well this is your chance. This game has plenty to drive it and what it lacks in graphics it makes up for in sheer depth. It spells better than me too.
Great Gamebut have to buy a dlc after a while.
I made somebody in my court a Mayor of one of the towns I control. I then had sex with his wife. When he found outI had him assassinated.   10/10 Would kill and cuckold again
EDIT: Patch 2.3.2 added a comprehensivewell made tutorial! That marks one of the biggest cons of this game off the list!  If you've ever felt like you loved classic strategy games such as Civthis may be the game for you. I've only got &lt100 hours of playtime online
Super indepthand so easy to get bogged down. Prepare to lose your time to this. It's just too bad so many options are locked behind DLC.
Best game I believe Ive ever played. I have over 100 hours. Worth checking it out.
I named one of my kids fuck as a joke. I forgot about him and later noticed that he had seven kids. Every one of them was named _____ mac fuck. He named his eldest son fuck mac fuck. As if that wasn't bad enoughthey rebelled against meso now there is an event in my gamelog called the fuck Rebellion. 11/10
I wasted money on this crap game on a friend's recommendation. If I had 10 years to dig through all the complex fuckt involved with this gameI still wouldn't know how to play it. The only thing I ever did was watch my wife pump out 7 kids.
Installed mod where everyone started as chief in control of a single cheifdom. Steamroll all my neighbors with my first ruler. Forms kingdom of Germany and reforms Germanic faith by the end of his life.   Second ruler comes around. Everyone declares war and pope calls a crusade because he is an imbicle and it will be easy. He was unfortunatly the only son my first ruler produced. 9 daughters who were strong and or genius daughters and one strong yet fuckfuck son. I could not change the succession laws in time because my first ruler died at an early age of 48. No assassination attempt on my first son was successful.  In a matter of 5 monthswhat my ruler's father took his whole life to accompishhis son fucks it all up.   The pope gains the Kingdom of Germay.   My house is systematically executed.   I shed a single tear for my family.
One of my favourite games at the moment.  As a history studentthe reliablity and accuracy of the game when you start a campaign is such a massive bonus! The ability to open up wiki links in-game to study each historical figure is also a great concept!   As for game-playit is a little complicated to get started. However
Great Game!
Great Game.
I'm been a long term stratergy gamerwith my faviroute franchise being the Total War series. CK2 Is along the same lines and is quite a bit of fun.   What I love about it is the way in which you can lead as practically anyone I like to run as an Irish Lord trying to work my dynasty into the Irish Royal Family (Incedently I usually get swamped by some Englsh King who is assisting one of my enemies and then I'm crushed). History is completely up in the airOne day when I have some more experiance I would like to lead an Indian nation to conquer Skandinavia and inhabit it as my homeland
Murdertreasonbetrayal
fuck is tight
Fun... But so many hours on modsoh well had fun making empires of vampiresdragons
One of the best grand strategy games ever! I played it twice and enjoyed a lot with the politicsthe bloodlineswar... everything is perfect in it... a must have
Best livestock management simulator on the market.
While it has a steep learning curveCK 2 is an incredible game once you've got the hang of it. Hours slip away as you scheme and seduce your way to power.
This is one of few games that I keep coming back too.
Rely nice kingdome manager game that feels like ur playing a book as the story of your tiny bit of land grows into an empire covering huge parts of the globe.
The most absorbing and engrossing strategy game - your dynastic longevity and sometimes just survival becomes a greater driver than territorial expansion or wealth creation. Endless variation allows many revisitsand just so many 'what ifs' to ponder.
This game is old.
Regent lessened my crown authority  i lessened his lifespan 10/10
« You suspect your mom to steal money » « You saw your mom steal money. » « For some reason you don't understand (because too young ) your mom has been banned. »   10/10
i play games of paradox interactive for many years. CK II is an AAA game at all aspects. The only thing that i can say is that this company at least respect their supporters and customers. The base idea is that we dont feel (till now) as customers but as Paradoxians.(there is a great community behind) Keep up the good work--- we wait for Cities Skyline and of course the new HOI 4.
ok so 111min in and i already love the game brings back memorys of risk the table top game idk what to tell you um get the game.
My mom stole my moneymurdered me and then fled the court for faraway lands  10/10
Sim managment + strategy in a serious setting. Just the Game of Thrones mod makes it worth buying.
Are you a dark hearted person? If not you will be soon. This game will send you into assassin frenzyyou will uncover a dark side of your soulthat is willing to kill the widow of your husband when she becomes pregnant in order to keep your dual monarchy together
As it stands nowCK II   is one of my   favorite   titles for Steam currently. I've been a Paradox Interactive fan since the times of Europa Universalis II being a 'new' game. I first got this title because I had a great experience playing   Crusader Kings  in HS and university.     CK II   kept with the spirit of the previous title  CKwhile restablishing the 'fantastic realism' necessary for an attempted historical simulation video game. The only downsides I see in the progression of the series as it stands now is the establishment a few issues perhaps with Paradox or the title in particular.       DLC digitis
Love this game.
Another truely incredible game by the masters of stradegy. Played for the free weekend and loved it. Then I got the full game and still loved it. There is so much to do in this gameyou really have unlimited amount of possibilities. Some minor tiny glitches but behind that I was amazed at how great the game handled. I completely recomend this game to all.  -10/10
I played 54 hours total so far and loved every second... well almost every second! I recommend to get a DLC first like the Old Gods because it makes the game much easier because you can play as a pagan which lets your declare war on anyone.BUT without getting into too much detail I give this game an 9.4/10
Killed the popeget the title 'the holy'
Great and versatile game engine. Love the intrigue and struggle to keep yourself and your dynasty on top.
Converted all of europa to Zunist 10/10 would convert again.
I loved the game from the moment I got ithowever it was very hard to adapt to it from a guy who was new to the paradox grand stradegy.
It is fun. The game is not for everyone. You do have to be the kind of person who is willing to spend his time looking at a map and just wait for intresting stuff do happen. But if you are that sort of person then you will probably have a nice time playing this game.  The games combat is extremely basic and does for the most part come down to gathering up a large pile of men with pointy sticks and throwing them at a slightly smaller pile of men with pointy sticks. It does its job but not more than that.  The focus is on the is feudal politics and i found there to be enough options and random event to be interesting for a long time. Personally i just find the idea of controling a family over several generations and gradually gain power to be extremely interesting and there are few games that offers something similiar.
Started as a Jewish character. Made my way to King of Israel.   Got Slaugtered by Muslims  Bred my way to a dynastic claim on Kingdom of Germany  Jews now run Germany
Crusader Kings II is a grand strategy game produced by Paradoxoriginally it followed feudal Christan rulers during the crusading period but the game didn't stay that way for long the first expanion allowed you to play Muslim rulers and the next expanions just grew the game more setting the date back. Allowing you to play pagans. Allowing you to play Republics. But there are a few bad things for example bugs like most Paradox games it has a lot of themalso there are insane amounts of DLC most of wich are just face or music packs.
Satan came into my room and turned me gay.  10/10
The game is pretty good but I just can't give a good review to 'DLC the Game.'
This game is quite fun to play alone or with friends. Pros: Solid gameplayawesome conceptmore depth then most RTSes
Crusader Kings II is not a game for everybody. If you are not a big fan of History then you might as well leave now. This games deal with lots of History and Historical terms such as Vassels and Leiges. If you love history and know what those last two words meant then keep reading. Next is that this game is very very VERY confusing the first time you play it. the tutorial is broken. i leanerd the game through trail and error in the main game. Just watch a few videos to learn the basics. The Strategy is complex in this game it's more then just moving soldiers around. You have to worry about having a heir to the throneyour vassels rebellingyour siblings or wife or parents or your own children plotting your murder.You have to worry about Vikings pillagers
I love the gamehate the money extortion that this company does with all the DLC that does almost nothing. Deffinintely wait to buy that until it is on sale or don't at all.
I highly recommend this game to anyone with an interest in medieval historypolitical intriguestrategy games
This game takes you in deep.  Jump in you will not regret it. 11/10
A great blastand my favorite strategy game I've played on steam so far :)
Killed lots of innocent Muslims.
in my first gamemy wife had syphillis and we banged.  would syphilis again 10/10
If you like medieval intriguediplomacyand onqest
This game is very goodfirst of allit's up to you on what to do
game owns
Game is fun to play for a short period of time!
At the time of writing this review I have nearly 200 hours invested into this game. Please understandthis does not happen. I'm the kind of guy who MIGHT get a dozen hours out of a single-player gameMAYBE 30 if it's an RPG. But to think that I can get 200 hours or more out of a single-player game is crazy. So what is it about this game?  1: The history. If you are even considering this game you must have some interest in history. Most people
always crashes upon start. eu4 is great though.
ManParadox is one of the top 5 game companies around.  ALL it's series are amazingfull realistic
The Game is not perfect (Sorry for my english) historic. And I don't recomand this game for you.... yesthe game have high quallity but after some times it will be annoing(borring if this is more correct)and it's in the past for a limited time .if you are looking after a good strategy game I recomand to you Europa Universalis 4 it's very good
Incredibly intricatevastly rewarding.
Oooohh! I have a 2 year old daughter! I'm going to imprison her! Hey I can execute her! wait...... Yeah Ima kill her. MUAHAHAUUHAHUAHUAHUHUAHUAHUAUH        what am i doing i have no clue 10/5 would kill baby again
My only heir is a zealous gay prince. 7.8/10 too much plot
I approve this game completely.
It's like your history books if in your history books all of Europe bowed before the might of Bulgaria
I slept with all the rival king's wives and my son's are now their legal heirs.  10/10 would recommend.
My daughter and my brother have a childwho is now betrothed with my aunt. Best incest simulator on Steam.
Great gameextreamly complex. Tutorial requires you to play it multiple times to build up some mussel memory.
Epicin every sense of the word.
The ultimate medieval soap opera. Marry your cousinmurder her for someone more attractive. Have 12 childrenthen assisnate half of them because they will mess up your succession. Conquer Europe
No game has sucked me in quite as effectively as this in years.
I must saywith the new limitations in the number of vassals you can havethis game is more like an RPG
Amazing mix between RPG and strategy. Political intrigue and diplomacy.  Playing this game essentially writes a Game of Thrones novel for you. :P
Polish Count Spends 70 years to get the throne 10 independence factions pop up and my sister kills my eldest heir Last male dynasty member is a celebate (-1000 fertility)  420/battletoads would waste 6 hours again
Spent two hours making a character.  Got assassinated in first 5 minutes.   10/10 Would get assassinated again.
So this is probably my most played single player game everand it's the one that I always go back to when I get really bored. Its main appeal is probably the ability to rewrite or attempt to recreate history. I have all of the big DLC's and some of the rinky dink ones. The only really bad one is Sunset Invasion (it's just dumb). I'm kind of a history buffso that's probably why I keep going back to it. Obviously I really like the game
What's better then sleeping with your worst enemies wife then convincing him the child is his ownNothing absolutly nothing!
ive wasted my life and money on this its good go play it
very good gameworth owning even if you're remotely intrested in grand strategy games.
The game is nicely deepwhich is a contrast to the usual graphics intense shallow games which are out there. If you want to be constantly challeneged and intriquedif you like thinking out strategies long term
It's a much more interesting take on strategy. It's different than what I'm used to and I welcome the change. This game gets a personal 8/10 simply for the fact its incredibly funbut a bit easy to lose your grip on what's happening.
The tag 'Grand Strategy' is proably the largest understatment made about a strategy gameever. If you think 'I've played strategy games before'. This game is going to make you cry in the corner. Create game (you probably chose a King.. you chose wrong). Proceed directly 'what.... what is thiswha..what?'  proably 20 minutes of this
I played as a Earl in Scotland(Earl Mangus Ccokburn)and with the Way of Life DLC focused on seduction where I promptly slept my way up to the King of Scotlands wife
What can I say that hasn't been said below(or above) nothing really... this isn't what I'd call a gameit's more like a medieval soap opera out your dreams/perfect kind of eskapisism without the actual 'must' to be a nerd to 'get' - if 'the dark ages' of Europe is of any interest to youthat is.  Anyway... it's highly priced
10/10 Would murder my treacherous brother for killing my only son and heir again.
That moment that you imprison your own wife for attempting to assassinate her son.
1) got my son married to my courierthen bedded my son wife . a few months later she's pregnant. i wonder who the father can be.. 2) my nephew was imprisoned by my enemeywho asked for 10 gold coins. refused just because my nephew didn't liked me. (let him rot)
Love it!
Murder your friendsmarry your children off for power and plot against your lord. Not enough for you? Sacrifice the Pope to Odintake your enemies wife as your concubine
Never thought I would play a game so much in my life.   This game is probably not for everyonehowever if you are the type of person that likes to see history unfold before your eyes likes details of everything for your perusing enjoyment or just like to sit back and relax this game is for you. Much of the game is in fact waiting for things to happen waiting for people to grow up or die or whateverbut the fact that you can control your own little family is exciting.  I ususally start as a lowly count of a single county and try to work my way up to someone more powerful even if that dream is realized in my great-great-great grandson or daughter. There is a sense of loyalty to other player
My name is Ragnarr Ragnarrson Ulfing VII. I come from the frozen northwhere I rule with an iron fist. I have broken many foesfathered many basterds and raided many coasts.  The entire European continent shiver at the mere mention of my name.  In my spare time
A really nice gamea lot of fun - especially when you play with your friends. There are always many things which can surprise you - in both wayseither helping your dynasty or
Simply put: The most complexdeepenfuriating strategy game ever made.
The greatest game I have ever played. A thinking man's game. Also a game if you want to steal your mother's claim to Saxony and kill some of your chilred becaue you have too many from taking all those concubines.
This is a game in which you can marry off your older sister to an Emperormarry her childand inherit an empire when you kill them all.  Steep learning curve
I'm finally ready to play as Billy the fuck.
As far as I know: I know nothing about this game. If you are trying to play this game for funand not for mind melting strategic maneuvers I do not recommend this game. It is the sort of game I imagine you would play after playing the Civ 5 demo for six monthsCiv 5 for 12 months
No matter how many times you get wiped off the face of the earthYou will always do the same thing again and enjoy it more every time! 10/10
This game is amazingit's ability to tell a new and exciting story each time is second to none. It is complicated to start withbut that just adds to the value of it's strong and indepth mechanics. It's worth spending the time learning the game.
10/10 would marry my sister again
If you have a itch for a strategic role playing simulationCrusader Kings II does one hell of a job at scratching it.
Funbut rather complex. Do expect to do the tutorial and still feel confused (especially saying the tutorial has problems) Howeverthe game is very fun once you figure it out.  The game WILL restrict you with DLC. You can play very few people outside of europe with no DLC. However
DLC buying simulator 2k15  11/10 would buy all dlcs again.
THE MOST indepth game I've ever played. I love it but I also hate it.... Hard to explain. It's very fun for a veryverysmall crowd of gamers... If you don't have the patience to learn something very difficult and tedious
This game is brilliant. The gameplay might seem complex for newcomersbut if you watch a few Let's Play on YouTube and play your first game in Noob Island (Ireland)you'll get the hang of it quickly.  You get immensly immersed in this game
Great gametakes a lot of time. However the 2.3.2 update broke all my saves (Example: All the kingdoms now had a combination of numbers and letters (Example within and example: 'Kingdom 77067_LL_ye') instead of names and all the crest went black except for the middle eastern ones and the game crashes after about 30 seconds without ever loading an actual saved game. The one that I did get opened had every family crest blacked out and every unit wearing B&ampW armor) and due to the amount of time I put into the gameI just uninstalled it and want be starting over. :( FYI: I already did an integrity check of the game files and all were ok.
A great game to RP! If you love Europa then you might very well enjoy this game as well!
I love this game. There is simply not much to complain about. Other then some sketchy DLC choicesand the fact that the EU4 converter hardly worksthis game can give you hundreds of hours of enjoyment. The fact that it has one of the most active modding communities kept me going when I couldn't get the nice DLC (Which are very good as well.)  Amazing art style  Interesting campaigns  Amazingly fun  Pretty addicting  A solid 10/10 from me. Even without the DLC.
Amazing gamehigh replayabilityand lots of options.
Started off as a countgot in a comabecame duke in my sleep. 10/10
One of the best strategies. Strong recomendation.
Awesome strategy game with lots of depth and plenty to do. Suggest watching a few walkthroughs on youtube before playing as tutorial is not hugely helpfull. Especially good with the dlc installed and mod support. Would recomend to anyone with an interest in history/strategy. Hard to put down
Would kill an entire lineage of children and adults alike to become duke ... again.  10 out of 10
A masterpiece of Paradox
Change the fate of the known World and rule Europe with your Pagan Family from Mali!
Play as a dynasty leading one of a great host of states from Ireland to India (DLC is needed for several groupsbut even the most basic set of characters is a huge amount of replayability)and see your people rise and fall based on an enormous amount of factors - your skill
Farewellmy life. Farewellmy free time. I'm off to play Crusader Kings II.
This game doesn't hold your hand when you're learning to play it. Questions like: Why did i lose my heir?why did my bigger army lose that battle? or why did I get a weak claim instead of a strong one? come up frequently. If youlike me
Interested in history? Like to rewrite it? Think you could do better than the von Habsbergs or Plantagenets? Patient?  10 GET A$: IF A$='yes' THEN 20 20 BUY THE GAME
I give this game a solid 10/10 for the sheer joy it is once you watch a billion Let's Plays to understand how to best play it to not let your dynasty get killed right off the bat. And with more DLC and mods and updates coming outI'm STILL trying not to crumble in the first hundred years as a Raja of India.  I fathered about nine or twelve childern as a Count to a India Lord. Married my son off to the daughter of a neighboring Raj's daughter- who just happened to have a twin. I was thinking of my son and how he would some day take my place and that deserved such a lovely pair of twins. Something I never had. :C So of course I took her as lover and then as my concubine! Sired some lovely daughters with hermurdered the son I had with her... Hey! I'm not risking my son's position here! Unfortunantly because of that mishap
Awesome game! good challenge and fun. cool music too
One of my vassals cousins raised a Viking army and carved out a Norse kingdom on the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula.  12/10 would conquer the known world again.
Excellent game with almost unlimited replay value. Sometimes bugs are introduced with new content or patches but they are fixed at a decently fast rate. There are nagging issues with the game but you will only realize them if you want total immersion or are extremely hardcoreat which point you would have already have your moneys worth in gametime.   Mods for this game are decent but as of this writing are all in a stagnate condition compared to the past. HIP has had no major improvements in a LONG while and parts of HIP such as VIET Immersion are no longer there and in development hell. CK2Plus was dead for a while and has had no significant development. Same with Lux Invicta. The new mod WTWSMS seems promising and is the only mod making significant progress.   However mods aside this is a great game. I would buy it if you like strategy or medieval history.
This game is great. It will take you some time to master it but overall you should have fun. It only sucks when you spend time moulding the perfect character then he suddenly dies and your imbecile heir takes over and everything goes to hell.
This game is a masterpiece. It's a strategy game with many RPG elementswith a strong emphasis on politics and inter-personal relationships rather than warfare.  You don't play a countrybut a noble lineage
One of the most complicated games I've ever played. Strategy upon strategy.
Dont buy this game its full of DLC these people fuck? DLC out the wazzo also this games mechanics arent a marvel or even to great such as combat and building and doing anything really is just a huge pain in the  i hate this and i wish i could get a refund on this game way to much hype and Fanboy reviews written.
I overthrew a emporerimprosined him and his familyexecuted them all except him and then just let him die in my prison of depression. And in the end I was assassinated by a three year!!!
One of the best games I've playedonce you get past the learning curve you'll have so much fun committing as much plottingdebauchery and murder as you can get your hands on.
Ignored the politicsfamily and intrique simulation to conquer the British Isles as Munster conquered all of the British Isles Then i realized that everyone hates me for killing them when they got in the way of my rightous conquest should have played Crusader Kings II instead of Crusader Kings Total War
A very good game FOR THEM WHO LIKE STRATERGY GAMES!
It made me google how to kill my son. I never thought I would do that...
Ruled the Byzantinesbecame insaneenacted the pants law. 11/10 would ban pants again.
Nice game. A little bit hard to understand at first but fun
I think this is a good gamevery in depthbut not perhaps for me.
Great game but......  difference between demo en de full game...........   nothing everthing is dlc :( :( :(   EVERTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't reccommend this game to anyone that hates not knowing how to play a game.I hated that it didn't tell me how to play.Also the campain doesn't allow you to attack until your forty (1 hour 30 minutes into the campain).In the campain you can only recruit 2 types of units.I recomend people play Empire Total War because it is simular to this game but way better because you get to do a lot more stuff and you get to controll your army in battle.
I bought the game purely on the strength of the intro video. I then had to idle 5 mins in the game to be able to write this review. I would do it all again!
Very good game but requires alot of dlcs great mods extend its lifeline. However just buy it off amazon as it is always 10 dollars there where as here its 40 unless on sale. same game the amazon version activates on steam anyway.
Really difficult to play visually simply because so much is going onhowever dont let that be a discouragementit is a quality game and very very interesting to simply say the least.
Watched my brother die Killed my father Lost my entire nation to a severe winter in Russia and got killed by the last of my family teaming up on me. 11/10 would cause Mass Russian Genocide again.
Spent hours upon hours trying to make an immortal-ish King Arthur. Would recommend!
very nice game but really confusing at the start but when u egt the hang of it its really rewarding and satifying i reccomend
The game LOOKS amazing.  I've yet to play it though apparently it keeps crashing and I've tried every avenue to fix it. Lovely.  I recommend because it's a great game in conceptbut I myself can't play it. Read someone else's review for successfully playing the dang thing. :P  7/10
cool
The best grand strategy game
Fantastic grand strategybut be ready to read up on tutorials...
A really good game that has amazing replay value.
Vor allem mit der Game of Thrones Mod genial!
Is purty coolyou can into feudalism and not afraid of anything.
10/10 The family I murdered ate pancakes.   In all seriousness this game is fun!
Great game hours of fun
Fantastic deep and complex strategy gameit will have you cackling with evil glee when you pull off an assassination attempt on your idiot sonin order to get him out of the line of succession so your smart son can be your heir. It will have you jumping up and down with joy when you finally manage to knock up your gluttonous
Deep and engrosing grand strategy game with beautiful design and heaps of detail. Must have for fans of turn based grand strategy and the historical period alike. 9/10.
I diedbrother took Norwaywhilst my heir Akbar II was KIng of Sweden. Brotherly love changes when land is involved
Wife and concubines kept giving me daughters.  Eldest Daughter is taking a fancy on me.  Visited her bedchamber and gave her a good tumble.  Eldest Daughter got pregnant with a grandson.  Empire saved and an heir appeared.  It's good to be King  100/10
i am unsure of why a 3 year old game is selling for 39.99 stilland why i can buy the game key from another site for 10 dollars vs 40 dollars hereas far as the game goes it's fairly well put together and very in depth strat
My ruler died and was inherited by his decadent son who had been imprisoned by his Duke kinsman who wouldn't let me out of jail. My captor and my regent hated me so much that they would never release me and I ended up asking the emperor to kill me so that I might play as a free man. 10/10
The most streamlined Paradox games made yet. Played way too many hours.
CK 2 is an awesome game and is one of the greatest games of all timein my view. Although the learning curve is steepby just playing the game you will eventually learn its intracasies and that is the joy. Let your destiny unfold and do your best to manage it in a way you see fit.   I do feel the infor panel and detail font size could be made larger. Un modded it is very difficult to read
no idea how to play it but i like it. 9/8

Ever wanted a game where everytime you play the world starts the same and then goes crazy?  Ever wanted to raise a family and have your drunk uncle take over and ruin everything?  Ever wanted to plunder?  Yes.
This game allows you to craft your own storyand its absolutely superb. I would also reccomend downloading the game of thrones mod for this game.
This game is a lot of fun. I mostly enjoy playing matchmaker with marriages. Sadlyit suffers from someone trying to pump it for as much money as they can get. You are constantly reminded that you don't own the full game unless you pay ten more installments of 9.99. I was playing someone who became friends with a Sunni and asked me to convert. I gave in and converted. The game then ended and told me it was game over because I became Muslim and would need to buy the DLC if I wanted to continue. Yeah. Really. It's ridiculously bad practice.   Basically? This is a fourty dollar freemium game. It's a fun freemium gamebut it's still a freemium game.
how to be a mean SoB ruler 101
Barely passed the tutorialended up trying to marry off all of my family and poison another king several times before 2 revolts wrecked my facethen failed to kill my wife trying to assassinate my vassal. Recommended 10/10
dont want to give a huge review imagine your own house in medievil agesand doing anything possibleanything at all to expand. Declare war Diplomatically Marry into the line of succession Assassinate until you are next in line these are just a few of the things you can do to expand 50/10 because i paid for the DLC
Highly addictive and very complex. I don't remember when was the last time I had so much fun playing a game. The only back side is it crashes randomly literally every 20 minutes of gameplay on my systemso i have to rely on autosaves.
oldskool game that i personally do not really think is up to par with some other in this genre. It look datedplays without to much pressure and get's you hooked for a while IF you haven't played these kind of games to many.  However even when i was not really impressed about Crusader Kings IIit did cost me a few nights.... Recommended for all hardcore strategy and civilization fans. Not recommended if graphics and quick gameplay is wanted. I would rate this 6
Was playing it for free this weekend. At first I thought this game was to hard to understandtoo deeptoo complicated ... Saw a few youtube videos
Iv had nothing but issues with the gameBettween the constant crashes to desktopthe inane control scheme
Is it wrong that i imprisoned then executed my child because they were a hunchback? I do not think so but it had to be donemy blood will not be tainted by her kind.
Awsome gameplay and like the sims mixed with eu4
freakin nice game with a nice role play rts which i was lookin for !
Played it for more than 20 hours and i never noticed what time it was. (it was 6am) Enjoyable for hours of gameplay.
Took me about 200 hours to figure out how to play the game 10/10
Lordy lordI've committed a great sin against thy teachings... I killed my crippled fuck?? sonso my 1337 warrior daughter could be crowned Queen of Denmark... She then proceeded dying of pneumonia. Game over man... Game over.
Could do with more DLC  10/10 would buy more DLC
Magnificent canvas to play your own story. Create Hispania and take on the Frenchor just try to survive as a lowly count in the Holy Roman Empire. The gameplay is deep and rewarding.
played for abitfun was hadcan recommend this game for those who like real-time strategy games.
Feeling like Walder Freyonto my 9th wife and fielding an army from my pants!  10/10 best game on steam.
in my very first game my character was trying to assassinate someonehis co-conspirator's idea was to go to an inn and pile up a bunch of poop and then ignite it... it worked.  10/10 would make flaming poop bomb again
CK2 is an engaging grand strategy game that involves thousands of different people and places. The strategy will keep you up for hours if not days trying to masterwhich after 42 hourssad to say
Crusader Kings II is an all around great game. If you enjoyed the original crusader Kings game (or any grand strategy game for that matter) you'll love this. It manages to constantly stay freshyou can start multiple games as the same country in the same time period and still enjoy it-though there are no shortage of choices as far as playable countres goand on the off chance you do get bored you can always pick up one of the many expansions...(goodbye paychecks)
Declared war on my 5 year old neiceas you do...  10/10 Would recommend to a friendthough perhaps not a family member
the best 'a game of thrones' total conversion mod is for this game. 10/10 would murder my spouse again.
Having a god complexas I doI found this game to be pretty satisfying. Even though you don't get to 'watch' the battles on the ground
Very good game. Must play if you're a EUIII fan
Ever wonder what EarlsDukesKings and Emperors really do? CK2 is the deepest
Most addicting game I've ever played
Really awesome game if you like grand strategy games. I recommend really buying this.
My dim-witted half-brother/father-in-law just assassinated my sonheir to the Jewish Persian Empire.  10/10 recommend.
This is an awesome addictive game!!!
Crusader Kings IIto dateis the best strategy game ever made for a historical period full of them. GIving you an open ended gameplay experience stretching from before the rise of the vikings until the historical fall of Byzantium to the Ottomans you can choose to expand your empire (or republic) through warfare
Not your usual strategy game. Crusader Kings II delivers on what it promises: you have lots of options in how to run your territoriestry to expandtry to respond to threats
Greatestmost replayable strategy game of its time.
Once upon a timeIKing Martrim the Second of Castille
Love it. Hundreds of hours spent and I've barely started!
Every time I pull this game out of my libraryI discover some huge new element of gameplay or strategy I had not considered beforeand am in awe of the depth of this game. Even though they're totally different games
Good gameVery fun and even though you choose one ruler you can play as any ruler in that same save really fun and you get to conqour things :D
Surprisingly addicting. Worth it.
Accidentally falling in love with my own sister was totally worth the trauma. 10/10 would fall in love again.
Despite some AI issuesit is ridiculously satisfying to create kingdoms and empires through a real mix of intrigue and military strategy. As a new-comer to the grand strategy genre I thoroughly enjoy this gamenow matter how many times I need to start over.
Excellent gamecant recommend it enough. Just look at my hours on record. I actually find CK2 to be one of the more accessible of Paradox's grand strategy titles. Dont expect gameplay along the style of Civ or Total War but if you like strategyyoure almost certainly gonna love Paradoxs series.  To those struggling to get into this game
If you enjoy a challenging strategy game with a lot of different options and ways to winthis is a great game. I've never played any other game quite like it. Yesthe graphics are fairly simplified
Great gameworth the money .  you will spend countless hours on feudal/medieval politicsdiplomacy and intrigue.   A must buy if you're into history.
Terrible. The tutorial is garbage and the game was basically unplayable. I couldn't figure out how to do anything and the tooltips were annoying and not helpful. Hard to get into a game when you can't even get through the tutorial.
Brilliant game but I can't play it at the moment. The last update made my camera movement breakI cant move right at all so it is now unplayable.  PLEASE FIX THIS I WANT TO PLAY IT FFS
After you go past the learning curve you can count on hours and hours of fun
You like strategy games? You like Paradox Games? You like Midle Ages? Well then my friend I reccomend you to buy Crusader Kings II Awsome game awsome DLCs but I think some of them are a bit overpriced. Almost a hundred percent right according to history. Alot of cool mods and a cool multiplayer to play whit friends. Almost no bugs (Atleast I haven't seen any yet) Cool graphics I just didin't liked that it only shows infantry troops when it could ex: If you have a high number of cavalry it would show a mounted knight instead of a knight. The game is easy and challanging. And there's a good thing if you don't have DLCs and you want to play multiplayer whit your friend if your friend has a DLC then you can play whit him whitout having it and you will have acess to it in the game! So yea if you're looking for these things I've said then you should buy this game. If you don't have enough money wait til steam puts discount on it because ya know Steam is a boss making discounts.
Best strategy game that you will ever play! Real timebattlesdiplomacy
Another Pretty fanthastic game by Paradox. As a fan of his gamesiam a suspect . But this is a pretty enjoyable strat rpg game in were time just fliesIts very fun and the strat is not even complicated . Very simple concepts to grasp wich it self makes the learning and achiements fun to learn and play . Dont miss this title.
This is one of those games that are so complex and in depthit takes a while to learn. The tutorial is okbut the real way to get into it is to fire up the game and just start playing. I went through the tutorial in about 30 minutes at noon on a Sunday and had the option to keep playing afterwards. I decided to keep going only for an hour or two
Cool game. Played a little bit. Heard you can play till 1453.
My court chaplain turned away from Catholicism to heresy. So I put him in prison. Then I ransomed him for a lovely 25 goldwhere hence I released him. Thenplotted to kill him. My co-conspirers of my murder plot lead him into a barn which they lit on fire. Before this
There is quite a bit of content for this game. Yescollecting them all will cost you a pretty pennyhowever it's totally worth it. there are near-endless possibilities with this one. I definately reccomend this one.
Other than past MMOsthis is the game I have the most hours on. Wait for salesand get the full DLC pack. You'll want almost all of them.
Brilliant gamejust occasinally crashes upon loading saves. I never had this problem when I wasn't using steam for this game. Sort it out Steam!
Married my 4 month old son to norse princess to improve relationships. Norse princess poisons me and takes throne with my son. Best 4 hours so far.
The umayyads conquered all of France and the AlpsGermany collapsedItaly remained Lombard
Played it here and there. I think it's starting to really grow on me. Literally. I'm an actual Crusader King.
This is a wonderful gamei will say it takes a crap ton of work to get used to it (atleast it did for me) but once i got the hang of iti am willing to spend days play CK2
Without mods became king.  With mods became ethereal vampire god being and seduced everyone near me and dueled every other man to death.  1000000/10
This is one of my favourite games. The most in complex and deep strategy game I've ever played and I love it. Plotting and planning the rise of your empire for generations is some of the most rewarding gameplay I've experienced to date. Grooming your heir and pruning your dynasty to ensure your chosen successor inherits your throne is totally exhilarating. The warfair element is incredibly well designed allowing you engage in crudadessupress revoltsand wage mass continental wars
Rewrite history
10/10 I am working to have boh the Catholic Pope and the Muslim Caliph as my vassals.
Granted my son a land title only to imprison and execute him afterwards. Did the same to his sons (my grandsons) and his grandsons (my great-grandsons). Surprisingly noone liked me anymore afterwards and I died alone and misunderstood.   Wellit was all for the greater good - needed to preserve the grand title of King of Ireland with all the attached land titles for my dynasty.
Still can't be the Pope.  10/10
The best startegy game ever :)
Started as Bjorn Ironside (Svitjod)conquered half of Europereformed Germanic faith
I think that it would be enjoyable if someone wanted to take the time to learn everythingbut they kind of throw everything at you without explaining everything in a detailed way. Howeverjust because it's not my type of game doesn't mean it is not good. I can tell that a lot of time was put into it
This is one of those games where if you go into it blindit will screw you over. One of those games where if you think it'll get easier as time goes onit will screw you over. This is one of those games where you can mind your own business
11/10 Sacrificed my son along with my self to Cthulhu in a pagan ritual.
fucked my half sister  11/10 would buy again
Kidnapped Pope and sacrificed him to Odin. 12/10
Awesome way to waste some time.
Crusader kings 2 is a game of many possibilities. The game firstly allows you to rule an entire kingdomwhile worrying about problems such as a daughter wanting to marry. In this gamedecision making affects the outcome of the game and how your experience will happen. Being a large
Was Lord fucker of House Nevermind  Yesthat was my name.  I ruled England and ate everything.  No one could not have sex with meI was a pimp.  10/10 would pimp again
I forgot i secretly had a illegimate bas tard son and had him married with my legitimate daughter. Now i have 6 inbredmentally impaired grandsons. It is just like game of thrones.
This game takes a couple of hours to learn. Then the endless fun begins.  Killed my wife and sons because my daughter was an attractive genius. 10/10would steal the King of England's wife again.
The one thing i hate about this game is that its really bland without all the DLC.
If your looking for a seriously well crafted medieval diplomacy/family simulatorthis is it. The expansions are well made and are used to expand the gameplay and give you more optionsinstead of just adding more locations. The rest of the DLC are mostly for esthetics
I just played my first game as part of the learning scenario. Here are my big take aways: I killed my brother and screwed my sister (who died of the flu or something afterward).
Brilliant gameold but still holds great charm. I come back time and time againand the new DLC's add new spice!
One of my favorite games of all time. Takes a little bit of time to really get into itbut wowonce you do it's amazing!
One of the best games in my library. Amazing replayability. Build your country into a mighty empireor maybe just own the Mediterranean as a merchant Republic. Slow endgameand with enough hours
I've never enjoyed ragequitting so much.
10/10 would incest again
Amazing game... endless possibilities... countless roles... Until the game tells me Ironman disabled - save file is apparently corrupted! Never played it with cheatBut perhaps I may have done something to the savefile somehow. Deletedrestarted.  Second time it happens
I seriously cannot get enough of CK2. Murderdecietbackstabbing
Best game ever. I just wish they would expand it deeper into Asia. I think Chinese and Japanese fuadal lord play would be awesome!

You get to play as the Byzantine Emperormend the Schismmarry the family Targaryen stlye
I chose Norseand pillagedlooted
Pure awesomesauce. There's few games that took so much of my time. It requires some knowledge of the era and some imagination to really enjoybut how deep can a game be?
In my current playthrough i just achieved the cassanova achievement. To do that I had to seduce 10 women. I achieved this by seducing my fuck childrens' wifes and my neices. I had several fuck children with the fuck childrens wives and my neices.  I was 66  10/10 best Hugh Hefner simulator
it's ok
It's cool if you want to kill people. That's cool with mepeople killer. No problems heremurderer.  Nothing.
I love this game as my hours can attest. I started out trying to be a liberal and loving leader who would never marry off a daughter to someone who I didn't approve of and would never plot any dastardly deeds. Then I went on a fraternal killing spree to create hispania   10/10 would fratricide again
Have you ever wanted to not just run a country in a grand strategy gamebut run a dynasty as well? Do you like political intrigue? Do you like absolute hilarity when things don't go exactly the way you wanted them to gobut not necessarily end your game? This is your game. I haven't had this much fun with a grand strategy game in ages and I don't plan on stopping any time soon... Unless Crusader Kings III is in the works

Murdered countless childrenmurdered my own sister and brotherkilled my father
Very fun game420+ hrs so far. The newest addition of horse lords has spiced the games up again and made me want to keep coming back. If your into the slow paced conquering or fast take everything you canthere is a start for it.
Start as frankish count within the duchy of Normandy  Assassinate everyone in my path until I am the Duke of Normandy  Incite some wars in Britain for later use  Marry sister to Emperor of Francia  *Pressing Claims*  *Executing anyone that ends up in dungeon*  Control entirety of Europe  10/10 would genocide again.
Play itjust play it. It's one of the best games i have ever played. If you just have the slightest interest in strategy games you sould buy it.
I played as the byzantine empire and i had a fucking blast reforming the roman empirei destoyed the invaders at a cost thoughthen i slowly and gradually build up my economy while fabricating claims all over itlay then i invaded and took all of the eastern lands and reclaimed the ones i lost to the invading muslims
I'm not even good at this game and I keep going back.
I can wholeheartedly reccomend Crusader Kings 2. It's a grand strategy game set in middle ages EuropeAsiaand Africa. You can play as one of many historical rulers and make your own goal. Personally
:::NOT A GAME FOR THOSE WITHOUT PATIENCE NOR TIME:::  Initial Impressions (Review To Be Updated)  Pros: Historical scenariosintrigue eventsand... well
Stupid addictive. Pretty substantial learning curvebut reckless amounts of fun. when you start to feel its getting oldjust get some reasonably priced DLC and keep on chugg'n  One interesting point is that this game has no actual purpose
One of the best games eversuch immersion!
I would reccomend it if this is your type of game. There is lots of content(unfortunately it's all payed content) from the devsand much much more from fans. There is a Game of thrones moda Lord of the rings mod
But why so many dlcs :'(
This game is sucking me in. I get a little better each time I playbut it is still brutal. Every time I try to expand Scotlandeither England invades me and takes another province
Commit incest with your granddaughtercastrate and exile her husbandbecome possessed by satan
Family.
Get rid of your free time effectively. 9/10.
Nice game :)
One of my favorite games! Oddlyit took me 8 hours of playing/fumbling with the game before it got its hooks in me. Thinking backthe only reason I kept at it was the positive reviews (postive is not even the right way to describe them... Gushing is more appropriate) - and I'm so glad I did. There is a superb game hidden under the unfriendly tutorials.   If you are thinking of giving this game a try (and if you like strategy games at all
CK2 is a wonderful strategy gamewith a lot of personality. Each playthrough creates a story you feel like sharing with others. It may look complicated at firstbut do not let that set you back
Took over Europe as Walesnow England is a small country that's the butt of every joke.
One of the best grand strategy games I have played. If you want to change historysuch as if you want the HRE to win you do it.
- start new game - all my vassals hate me - become leader in a lower crown authority faction - start civil war - lose civil war instantly - wind up in jail - lose 2 counties - no heir  10/10 would lead miserable medevial life again
My vassal asked me assist him in his plot to seduce my wife.  8/10  If the idea of a feudalism history sim interests you at allyou should try out the demo.  Howeverbecause this game costs over $200 including all the DLC (much of which should just be standard
Fantastic strategy game with just the right amount of randomness that either positively affects you and your dynasty ... or not. It's just this amount of randomness and the unique events that keep each playthrough fresh. When I first started playing I would play the same nation over and over again until I got the hang of itand each time the game turned out differently.  I will warn that it is a tough game to get into if you aren't experienced with this genre or even this developer/publisher. It can be really aggravating to try and learn the game with all sorts of events and actions taking place around youand you have 0 idea how or if they will affect you.  Give it a shot on the cheap so you can get the DLC too.
I have murdered entire families and had a good time doing it.
The buttons have buttons inbedded in the buttons so much informationso much to do and I still can't figure it out. Ill recomend it but it is very confusing.
This game is awsomethere are some things that could be better like being the Pope or play a Bishop a Cardinal an so on ... in all I give an 9 to this game :)
So I played this for an hour and a half at this point... It's not badI definitely could see myself enjoying it quite a bitif the interface wans't that complicated. Seriously it feels like running headlong into a wall! For literally EVERYTHING there is a tab
Making 8 year olds marry 30+ year olds is rather entertainingespecially when they are named something completely ridiculous
Never have I've had this much fun in just a few days. When I saw Crusader Kings 2 from a friend and on YouTubeI immeadatly went out to purchase and it was the best buy I ever have yet. The historical accuracy is incredible! Detailing many important events in the Medevel Age from the Vikings in the 9th centurythe Christian Great Schism in the 11th century
A game so largebecoming a viking mongol emperorsending christendom and the caliphate running for the hills and assassinating everybody in your court before they get to you is not only scratching the surface of the game
I laughed. I cried. I gained 15 pounds.
So much fun having crazy dynasties and WTF moments. Has incredible depth and strategy (and quite a bit of luck).  Cons: NO NAVAL BATTLES   Seriouslythe only thing I have against this game is the fact there is no naval combat. I still recommend this game whole heartedly.
It's a medieval dynasty in a box!
Amazing variety of actions you can take on your quest to build your kingdomfrom murderingbribing
Game will not loadstops on musicif not there on flags. cannot reach either steam support or Paradox. Very dissapointed
I have no idea what to do to progress in the game. I've resorted to watching youtube clips and online guides and it is still unclear what you actually do in this game.
it's a good gamereally easy to modso much possibility to play. if you like history and strategy
Its a real fun game if you like strategy games. the only real con is that combat is real basic.
Awesome gamemust download game of thrones mod in my opinion even better than the base game because it is much simpler and with fewer lords.
Awesome game! I really like it!
AMAZING GET IT with the old gods dlc 20000000000/10 best game ever for stratagey players
The 15% of the game I was allowed to play without spending another £100 was great
This game is bloody awesome. Sureit's arguable that the learning curve is steepbut it's all worth it once you get into the meat of the game. Without DLC or mods
fuckMarryKill: Alt History edition.  You'll spend a ridiculous amount of hours building yourself up from nothing
Played as a Scottish king. Did pretty well gaining most of my demense back from the Vikings. By the end of my lifethe Aztec horde was unleashed on everyone. 5000 man army wiped out my kingdom.   10/10 Would play again.
Get your own dynasty and fuck around in medieval Europe until the borders are so messy they make your eyes bleed and your family tree is so huge that you lag when you open too many branches.   Pretty much a Paradox Game through and through:   -Good strategy game. The base game by itself is goodit goes somewhat deepit has a bunch of things to do and playstyles to explore along with hidden mechanics you'll be finding out years later if you don't read the wikis. Paradox Interactive has been doing grand strategy games for many years
Started as the Duke of Lombardy (North Italy)conquered a few countiesgot voted in as the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire at the age of 21
I died from having too much sex   69/10
10/10   Great gamewith a high level of detail and scale.   Beside's that 'It's good to be the King'.
If you're looking for a game to play casually while your coffee is brewingthis game isn't for you. If you don't enjoy long lasting strategy gamesthis isn't for you. If you're looking for something that can't make you not notice hours passing by
One of my favorite games.
If they could stabilize this gameso that it didn't crash or freeze or corrupt its saved files or destroy its coop games...it would be perfect.    This game is so much funand has so much replay value
In just three months this became my most played game on steammy previous most played game is something I've had for three years. That is how addictive this game is. You don't need the dlc to enjoy it but it does helpand there is a dedicated modding community so you will probably never run out of things to do in this game. It is also worth mentioning that in multiplayer anybody who joins the game can use whatever dlc the host enables even if the people joining haven't purchased that dlc (the host does have to purchase it to enable it though). Bottom line: THIS GAME IS AMAZING! IT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!
Cant marry the future queen of scotland (16) to my son because she has sex with her 56 year old guardianwell poison will take care of it and the celebrations begin. On the wedding night she comes into my chambers and after 6 years my son has still no children but my daughter-in-law has 3
Years later and I still find myself trying to conquer the world generation at a time.
Got manipulated by Jesus and it gave me the best traits  10/10 would be manipulated again
My computer specs can more than handle this gamebut it doesnt work anymore. Before I'd easily give this game 9/10 or 10/10but ever since some of the newest DLC came out
This game did not load properly and cannot be played as is.  In shortmy equip will not support 3D games.
Amazing game with unlimited replayability. In-depth character customizationdiplomacyand battle events to build your empire. Just a couple additions
I love this game because of its great sense of freedom and fun EDIT: also this game has great mechanics that make the game even better
9/10 would murder uppity vassals again.
Best explanation of this game I've heard: 'Sureit's just a bunch of numbers and statsbut when those stats are represented by a catty Castillian princess trying to kill your brother
I like It beter than Europa III
A game I always come back to. Endless hours of emergeant storytelling and empire building. The aspect of paradox titles that stands above the rest are the political and diplomatic options.
amazing when you now what to do love this game good job
You know that scene in the LOTR where Gandalf tells Frodo about the ring and how it must be taken to Bree and when Frodo's ready to go Gandalf says something like 'Hobbits truly are remarkable creatures. You can learn all there is to know about them in a monthand after a hundred years they can still surpise you.'? That's how I feel about this game. 130 hours in and I still have no idea how to play this game to its full potential. It's a bit barren without DLC's so wait for a sale to pick it up
Start out as a vasal to a king  plan my conquest to declare independence  get married  have a son  incoming plague that kills my whole family except my wife and me  get a mistress and have a legitimized fuck daughter.  have another son with my wife  constant nagging and bad luck events from my wife makes me divorce her and give the thrown to my fuck daughterkuz screw that i do what i want  wife and my kid form a host to claim my thrown  notice my king is at war with everyoneand has multiple civil wars goin on within the kingdom take advantage of situation and declare independence  get butt pounded by random  huge army of my king
Not based on states or landsbut based on characters (and houses). This games mix brilliant strategy with RPG elements. There are so many things that will happen and can be done in CK2. Different systems of social orgnization offer compeletely different way of playmaking the game replayable time and time again.  Though many things are not very historically accurate in CK2 (especially those far away from Europe)
I'm afraid to go back in.  It controls me.
You can be a viking! A VIKING!
Crusader Kings II is a great repair of the original. I'd highly recommend it. It is a very relaxing and challenging game. It appeals deeply to the anal retentive in me.  Update: 37.9 hrs last two weeks / 135.4 hrs on record  It doesn't get any better than this. The 14 dollars for Horse Lords. I still have a few Crash-To-Desktopsbut otherwise I've never owned a game I've gotten this much worth out of.
My one friend's character made his horse the court chaplain. Its name was Glitterhoof.  Really complicatedreally in depth. Really fun. Tyrian Lannister became the King of Wales and successfully conquered Ireland before dying of old age.
Great Game..very time consuming..auto saving in ironmode is pain in the .
Good game. Plenty of intrigue and strategy thinking. Whould change some things just like ''the claim'' option to go to war but still a good game.
Converted Genghis Khan to Orthodoxlaughed as the Mongol Empire collapsed into infighting 10/10
I... have spent quite a while playing this game (300 hours so far). One game is never similar to another. All the intrigueconspiracysudden unpleasanties
I fell in love with this gameit just make time pass with ease and all you want is more.
Nothing like having ten thousands men more then your kingthen rebelling against himdespite all his vassel disliking him. Then winning the title that is rightfully is your.  10/10!
one of the greatest strategy games i have ever played
The things I've done...
(Do note that I have a lot more hours if you add in the demo and offfline. A LOT more hours) My King died of the pox with two heirsthe eldest died in battle and the youngest was nearly assinated by his grandmother. A woman who also tried to knock off her son and husband. This was in aboutohh
547 hours at the time of this update...  if you like medieval rts with betraylsbattlesheart break
A good game if you like intrigue and plotting and random shennanigans
Best strategy game I've played by far. For the last 3 daysI've only played this game and sleep. Best mistake I've ever made.
I always found it funny that even if I died the realm would eventually be lead by a person with the exact thinking that I had. It's like I had an evil clone that took my pleace every time I died No matter if the character was mad or an inbread he had the same masterplan of ruling everything . Best clone simulator in the medieval ages ! 10/10
The blood of the heathen must be spilledalong with that of any who would impede your glorious reign.  It's for the best of allreally.
its kinda barebones without the dlcs but with them its one of the best medieaval games made (but reaaly expensive if you buy without a discount
Killed Cthulhu and took the Pope as my gay lover 10/10
Have you ever wanted to murder a whole family of people what about kill your daughter in law or even your own son? If so then this is the game for you. It's a dynasty building game if you are looking for games where you can explicitly 'win' then this is not your game. In this game you choose a medieval noble and play through the late middle ages as his family the only way that you can lose the game is if all the members of your dynasty are without land at any time. So if you exclusively recieve enjoyment by an arbitrarily designated win condition do not buy this game. On the other hand if you are looking for a grand strategy game and enjoy the process of playing a game consider buying this game.
BLUF: This games is a fantastic game! Howeverit is harder on older systems than Skyrim! Finallydo not get Way of Life DLC untess it is going for very little (-50% or more). It does not add alot to the game for the full price.   WARNING This game does not play well on older 32 bit machines even with 8 GB of RAM (yes i know my system is only using 4 GB becuse it doesn't have enough address bits to use all 8 GB). LINUX users should be ok
Like game of thrones and always wished you could live it? Well now you can! Be the Little Finger were you play everyone like a chess peice for your own personal gain! You can be a Jofferywhen things don't go your way KILL THEM! who cares about the consiquences. A Robert Baratheon were you have so many fuck children you can't keep count.  And MANY MORE!
Politics.
One of my favorites. Intense Grand Strategy gamewhich will make you laughcurse or cry and sometimes all at once. Beware the Mongol Hordes! I did buy it recently so i only have 50 hours so far (for 2 and a half weeks)
The best the grand srategy genre has to offer.
Probably the greatest Grand Strategy game I've ever played. After sinking several hundred hours into this thingI honestly refuse to stop playing it. The random events of history provide a compelling experience with every playthrough with trulytruly the most limitless replayability of any game you'll ever encounter. The learning curve can be quite steep and unforgiving on the harder difficulties
hard game to learnhard game to playgood strategy game
11/10. Buying this game for my brother.  The modding for this game is way cool too.  If you are intimitaded about the game then watch all the youtube tutorials you can. This is a super fun game that has an EXTREME amount of gameplay.  $40 is well worth the investment.
A solid grand strategyfirst times should play this game vanilla a few times before getting any DLC
Game-of-Thrones-esque intrigue and political maneuvering. Does a good job of putting you in the throne. Graphics are nothing speciallike most paradox grand strategythis is offset by scale and detail.
Fantastic game with incredible replayability.  If you have ever wanted to spread your dynasty over the world with warpolitics or seduction and murder this is the game for you.  It looks a bit like Europa Universalis (also by Paradox) but plays differently. You play as a character and control only your characters actions. You have to work with skillstraits and managing relationships with other characters.  Honestly
So I was Sancho IKing of Castille. I had just killed my brother Garcia IIKing of Galicia. And my other brother
2 rulers had 'great pox' in 100 hundred yearsFemale ruler with a 12 year regency 10/10 would play again.
IT's very fun with the new Dlc's that are coming out
One of the best games of all time.
This game is amazingeven though I'm terrible at it... I absolutly recommend this game to everyone and anyone!
Put almost 200 hours into this game so farnot bored yet.
I guess it's ok.
Too much DLC.
One of the best and unique strategy games to date. Very nice!
Great grand strategy gameif you take the time to go in depth and understand the mechanics you'll find it really rewarding. 10/10 would murder an entire dynasty of more than 40 people just to inherit a landlocked county that isn't even in my de jure demesne again.
Do you have a secret desire to murder you wife and make babies with your sister?   Well then you should probably visit a doctor... But if you can't afford that you can just buy this game and create all the inbred babies you want without the hassle of being disownd by your family.
Named a son Duke fuckhe was lustful and a homophobe. 10/10 would do again.
Best pure strategy game I've played yet. Diplomacy and intrigue are actually important and meaningful for onceand there are tons of different ways to play the game.   Definitely worth the sale pricethough some of the DLC is so insignificant it would be nice if it were free.
Great game. Constantly being updated.  Just be aware the system requirements are also increasing.
Created a pagan British Empiremade my sons kings. All my sons rebelled. 10/10 Would kill all of them again.
For when you feel like being insane and screaming about numbers.
Definately worth playing. Plotswarkilling your way through the dark ages.
I've played a number of Grand Strategy games and this one is by far the best one out there. As far as GS games go it's simple enough to learnbutas all GS games are
Pros 1) Customizable Characters 2) Role Playing at it's finest 3) In Depth Strategy 4) Lots of Planning 5) No Restriction - Since Workshop appeared  Cons 1) Long Hours 2) Patience Needed 3) Strategy Game Lover Only 4) Lots of Waiting (Please This IS THE MOST WAIT EVER)  I have played this game for over 1000+ hours. To me this is a great game. The game emphasize on the planning phases and strict consequences. Forming alliances with marriages before hand. Siding who is the strongest and betraying bonds.  Basically a game of thrones for those who are new to strategy games. Patience is needed and lots of waitingI mean lots. This is not a game that will end when you destroyed the neighbouring kingdom.  You got to bring your family line up from a lowly Count to the bloody emperor and ruler of the entire free worldaka Europe
The real Leisure Suit Larry game
If I never got this gameI'd be married with 3 kids and have a white picket fence by now.   I live alone with a dog.
Craft your own dynasty with political shenanigans better than the Song of Ice and Fire! IncestBloodBetrayal
After getting the hang of thingsI decided to start a Serbia campaign in Ironman Mode. I started the game in 1166 and immediately Bulgaria declares warclaiming for one of my counties. It's OK. I hold most counties directly so I've only got one vassal to appease - my levies are quite large. So I send them to Belgrade to defend against Wallachia (their ally) when half-way through the battle my king knocks his head and becomes useless. I surrendered after two or three failed battles
WOW! This game is not for everybodybut if you like the genre is amazing. It's extremely complexdetailed and deep. You can play as a strategy game if you are a risiko fan who wants something 100 time more complicated and it's one of the best I've ever try. But you can also dream to be in a medieval novel
Playing as Pepin the HunchbackCharlemagnes legitimized son Managed to form the Empire of Francia Have several vassals in the College of Cardinalswith my fave being the Preferatus Decide to assassinate the Pope so my vassal would become the Pope. Old Pope dies
10/10 would incestassassinateand loot again
Game didnt have enough Replayability
$200 of DLC later I finally got what appears to be the complete vanilla version since there is no depth.  I sure hope the next expansion improves this way too easy game because strategically speaking it's shallow as heck.
You start playingthen you realize it's dark outside. Eight hours have passed while you have been scrutinizing nubile aristocratic women to betroth your heir to. You realize you aren't actually certain whether you've had any fun yet. Time to go to sleep you have work in the morning.
SO difficult to play AND succeed in this damn gamebut once you get rolling and understand the layers under the layersit is incredible. Its price is
Thought I'd pick it up before going to bed one night. Don't. I was up until 2am unable to tear myself away. Play in the morninglike normal people do.   I played as Castille. Killed my brotherKing of Galicia and 3 of his 4 children before the last one went into hiding and got away. My other brother
Take leadership of one of the many houses of medieval Europe in this powerhouse of real time strategy from Paradox! Have you ever wanted to see what would happen if you were head of a powerful (or not so powerful) family at any point across 700 years of European history? If so then this si the game for you!  When coupled with the vast array of additional content this game becomes simply the most in depth and immersive gaming experience for any strategy game fan. Take for instance my own recent game starting at the Petty King of Cornwallgoing on to become the King of Wales and Irelandonly to lose the lot in a brutal and bloody civil war started by an aggrieved half-brother. Not only that but with the Way of Life add-on you can direct your current ruler down personal paths that can result in Great Hunts for mythical white stags or go only holy pilgrimage with the Son of Abraham pack. Whilst many people criticise Paradox for the incredible amount of post release additional content that must be purchased
An Aussie recommended this to me.  And this is how it went down.  - Starts out to rule Kingdom of Wales - Hire someone to kill the pope - Everyone lost their fuck and burned my kingdom to the ground.  10/10 Would seduce my sister again.
Great game. Especially if you enjoy stuff where your whole strategy goes to pot because your main character dies of syphilis or something. )
Epic grand strategy but as ever useless tutorials. best get a friend in multiplayer to help you
Lots of replay potential!
Very few recent games have given me the entertainment this one has. While I recommend it highlyI also grant that it is not an easy game. Props to you if you are willing to figure it out and get the enjoyment it can offer.
Very nice game .!.
Started as Karl Karling  Killed brother  Inherited big fucking empire  Everyone hates me  Got attacked by 100 revolts  Blown up in inn with manure  Gavelkind makes me lose half of land  Get declared by Saxony  Give up 3 duchies  Got aventured by cousin  Lost all my troops agains his 12k doomstack  10/10 would get fuck? again
Get some alcoholput on some Folk metaland be the best tyrant you can be!   1
Great game. Full of hidden mechanics and full of surprises for the new gamer. This game is great for people who want to get into the world of war and intrigue with desicions that will make you have to get down and think about the odds and outcomes of your desicion. This game is great for people who play Europa Universalis players who want more detail about family and Intrigue. It should noted though that this game is only based on Europenorthern Africaand the midlleast and asia up to india. This game is very hard and if you don't like it when things don't go your way and when you can't just go to war because you want to this game is not for you.
This is a great game if you enjoy a in-depth political/conquering world strategy game.
Very likely my favorite game of all time. Used to love the Civ gamesand Romance Of The 3 Kingdoms too.  There's really just simply to much to sayI can't think of anywhere to start. If you get the game
If you like (historical) strategy games - buy this one! My fav game for sure.
Played as Finland. Took over most of Scandinavia. Tengri rulers kicked my fuck in and slaughtered my family. 10/10 would do again
Repetitive but addictingjust watch tv and play.
The learning curve is not as bad as you may think or you have heardpush past it and don't let it intimidate you. One of the most well made strategy game I've ever played.
it's the best early middle ages through pre-renaissance landed noble dynasty life simulator on the market.
This game makes me happy. I don't know a lot of people that play itbut if you love in depth strategy and have that ability to think critically this game is for you. The MOD's are excellent as welland great overall community.
if you like family intrique with political swindling then this is a great game for you.
my family tree is more like a family knot  incest/10
CK 2 is basically a game where you ball around the past as far back as 769. The game has console commands and you can pause and resume all you want. There are hundreds of amazing mods in and out of Steam Workshop. The Harem mod a good example of what's on Steam Workshop and Elder Kings of course a great example of what's not.   In my opinion the game is hard to enjoy when taken seriouslyit can become a chore. But I can assure you if you're casual or hardcore gamer this could be the game for you. Taken seriously you'll do everything you can to keep your children from being killed so that when you reach your inevtiable death the game doesn't end. (Yes the game ends if you die and your heir isn't of your dynasty).  Of course for the casual gamer you can use the observe and play console commands to go arround playing any landed character you wantor not playing any characters at all. (How I roll)  The dlc is fun even though all the expansions feel like a paywall. Most of them are worth getting just so you can run some mods. Sunset invasion is probably the most lackluster but for the right price it's worth playing once. Ultimately I can't recommend any of the dlc for full price but if you can get em each for about 75+% off you should treat yourself. The game itself is good but I do think the dlc and mods really make it a million times better. Now the game I can recommend at 50+% off. Mostly because it's been out for 3 years.
Built Empire Drove it into oblivion 10/10
One of my best games absolutley love it and recommend it to anyone!
If this game had better graphicsTotal War would no longer be a franchise...because this blows it out of the water.    9.5/10 Took .5 off because of the 3000 DLCs
L A N N I S T E R E D
Not a reviewjust a fav
A giantsprawlingever-growing collection of stories where you can choose to rule the middle ages
The best grand strategy game of all time. It doesn't work anymore. Now what?
I really think the best part about the game is it's really tickled my historical g-spot.
Top notch pausable real time strategy game.  While the learning curve initially is very steep (this is far harder to learn thansaycivilization)
447442014 @ 12:37pm  Difficult strategy game! Did not like itrather slow.   Would not reccomend. Found it rather tedeious and boring.   Update: It's difficult if you're new
Great strategy game that I've been playing/following since its predecessor. Personally I haven't liked some of the recent changesbut if you don't like itthere's always way to revese back to the old versions.
Crusader Kings 2 is one of my favourite games. It allows you to play as a feudal lord in the medieval age.  Here is a list of things I like doing:  Usurping thrones for my wife.  Having a son with my wife.  Murdering my wife so my son gets her throne.  Oh and how could I forget thismost wives in the game are very eager to kill their husbands and I make use of that quite well.  But all around it is a great game and if you like grand strategy games than this one should be fun for you. And if you want to try it but dont want to buy it cause you are unsure if you will like itthere is a demo for it
Game of Thrones meets Medieval Europe. Yesit is as good as it sounds.
I don't understand this game at alland there's something remarkably compelling about that. It's a 'grand strategy' gamewhich means you control a dynasty across centuries from Earl of a single county
Pros: Interesting gameplayprobably one of the deepest games I've ever played in terms of figuring out everything you're capable of doing.     CONS    The game is a huge time sink. If you start at the beginning with just a  single county is takes forever to do anything or get anywhere.  The game tutorial is functionally worthless. Doesn't cover nearly enough of gameplay and even the wiki isn't that great at explaining things. If I have to go to the forum to ask questions about how to play the game that's not very good conveyance on the devs part.   Poorly optimized. This is essentially a virtual board game with pretty low graphics. In the beginning it's pretty fastbut the longer you play the more lag starts to creep in. By 1250 I couldn't even go beyond x3 speed without it studdering. Which is ridiculous when Medieval Total War 2 has a LOT more graphicly intensive instances and I never had a problem with it.  Computer is a cheating cheater. Played through too many times where it felt like the computer would just pull entire legions of troops out of the ether. They never even call their vassal levies
If you ever want to learn about Medieval peopleplay this game and murder your whole family for fame and riches
its not just a gameit is life !

That game is epic like many other Paradox productions. It's simply always interestingdoesn't matter how big is your country. Big DLCs make game even more interestingbut I don't like they charge extra cash for crapy ones with shields
Conquer Europe while assassinating childrenmarrying to spouses half your ageand turning the map into your colour.
It's verrry complicated. Fun if you want to toally delve into the world of the middle agesor if you like Game of Thrones style family intrigue. Marrying your cousin? Totally possible. Murdering your cousin so you can sleep with your other cousin? Also possible.
I got it for game of thrones. Now I can kill anyone I want. I am now George R.R. Martin.
started out as marshall for friends in game. made god of war. several generations later i have an inbready family of angery waring heathen monsters with a lustful trait slowly taking over all of europe with the might of my clan. lived to 90 each generation outlived many friends and foes. never lost a war. broke thye multiplayer button. 10/10 would create inbread war gods again GG. life
Excellent game love the challenge.
good game but overprice for dlc
Holy fuck this game is good
Awesome game if you love RTS games and games from Paradox.
Re-created the 3rd Reich in Medieval Europe.  10/10
Long time since I've played it but very addictive when you get into it :)
This games learning curve is a bit on the high side. Once the games mechanics involving bloodlinesintriguereligion
Very very detailed. Huge amount of replayability. If you're newdo a LOT of research beforehand or you can get frustrated very quickly. Not for the faint of heartbut highly rewarding otherwise.
Bang everything you seebeg the pope to fund your campaigns against the filthy muslims. Kill your brother. What isn't to love?
Incest and Murder Simulator 2015  10/10
10/10 would annihilate catholicism again.  For odin.
I've played this game for a little bit...  I've googled things that have probably put me on some sort of watch list like: 'How to seduce my sister' or 'How to murder my wife and son without getting caught'.  10/10 Would commit treasonous incest again.
I sent to kill the 4 year old son of the king of FranceI succeded but they found out about meone week after that the king has another son
I've only finished one gamebut it was pretty good.  Edit: I finished another one
It's honestly one of my favorite games in the world. It's clever and deep to a point that I haven't seen too many games achieve. HoweverI'd buy it when it goes on saleotherwise it will devour your wallet.  Not all of the DLCs are worth it
It's alright.
Crusader Kings II is an amazingly fun game with the right peoplealthough does have a few grudgingly annoying features.  The game has dozens of DLCs which is a bit irking considering most are features which should have been added in free updates. Howeveronly one person needs to own the DLCs to play with them on multiplayer (he has to host the game). Thus
TFW you're a lowly noble and then you become a king but you're slow and ugly as balls.
maps but with people
One of the most engaging stratagy games out there. Steep learning curveand will eat away at your life until you have nothing left. Strong mod support including a Game oif Thrones themed mod! Lots of DLCs though. 9/10 one of my favorite games of all time.
I could say a lot about this gamebut I'd rather just say that you now have the option to blind or castrate your prisoners. Bloody good fun.
It's goodyou should probably check it out.
Made my wife my Spymaster. Wife was imprisoned by the Pope for trying to steal some unusually high technology in Roma. Ransomed for 543 golden coins. Wife brings the plague back with her. Plague kills my entire dynasty.  would get killed by psuedo-biological weapons again/10
A bit confusing at firstbut a very deep game with lots of content.
A great game if you are a fan of the Total War franchise and are looking for a cool new game that goes into more of the politics of running a medieval kingdom and giving a great repetative game to come back to.   Also with a great lenght of DLC it is extremley benifical to buy this game when on either a summer or winter sale with additional content if willing to play this game.  'Nuff said
Great game.Highly recommend it.
This is a very engrossing game and if you get the Game of Thrones Mod....oh boy. Many hours of strategy gaming bliss. It's different. It's interesting. It's fun. You should play it.
An incredible game that every gamer should own.   After starting in the Balkans I declared holy war for Rome on the Serbians and Turks. Turkey blamed Croatia and decided to start the Crusades. I drank wine for 40 years on the other side of the mountians and then married into the Ottomann empire.     30/10. Accurate to the inbreeding.
I don't think I will ever stop playing this game if Paradox keeps releasing dlc. I had the opportunity to see this game at the PI Convention in NYC in person with the creators and I knew this game would be a hit. There is so much depth historicallygameplaysimulation
Unite Ireland Have many sons to carry on bloodline Second son hates me because primogeniture Marry first son to queen of Denmark Marry second son to some noblewoman Seduce wife of second son for no good reason Becomes pregnant with my child Son thinks it's his 11/10 would cuckold son again
It's okayI guess.
Uninstalling this game meant a sudden spike in university careertime i dedicate to physical activitiessleeping hours and work productivity. Can't wait to install it again.  (It really helped in the Medieval History exam
My head exploded
Started as an unmarried Viking lord in 867 Norwaythere were no suitable wives in my local area. So I had a mail-order wife from Mongoliathen I went raiding in North Africa and took several musilm concubines. 200 years later the Scandinavian empire was filled with Mongol-Arab Muslim Vikings.  11/10 would definitely re-write history again
Jesus said there was a typo in his bible. @Pope plz fix 10/10 would recommend again
looked good but incredibly boring waist of money
203 hours later i still have no idea what i'm doing
Have you ever wanted to relive the intrigueincestbackstabbing
Brilliant game. Tons of strategyI've played more hours in this than any other strategy gamethere's just so much depth to it. And being able to wipe out an entire dynasty just because one of their random men decided to sleep with your wife is a feeling you just can't replicate anywhere else.
So far in my first game I: - Killed my cousin's entire family so that I could be the next heir - Conquer a lot of land only to lost half of it to my brother - Kill all of my brother's children to secure myself as his heir - Conquer Jerusalem - Get conquered in Jerusalem - Imprison my wife - Get assassinated 10/10
Great game. A lot of people whine about how much DLC there is but honestly it's all more or less flavor stuff. Just play the game and then buy the Major DLC that interests you if you find it fun. (I recommend Old Gods personally)
1
really fun and intersting game if you like alterante and actual history
I love this game. Very replayableand with the various expansionsyou can play as almost anyone in the game: from a minor Irish earl to the Sultan of Persia. Not the Pope though
This game is all about the 'emergent' gameplay. It's got a sandbox feel which let's you create your own stories of honor and couragebut more likely underhanded scheming and murder. For example in order to gain the kingdom of FranceI married by sister to the nobody that was set to become the king. After they had a few children I had him assassinated. After that I had to marry my son to my sisters daugther inorder to press her claim for the throne of France against my nephew. #familyfirst
I really enjoy this gamebut the clear flaw is the abhorrent amount of dlc. To have ± R1000 ($70.43) of songsunit packs (etc) is ridiculous. Paradox make this content free!
Pretty good game
Steep learning curve but an amazing complex game lies underneath. If you like killing your devil spawn son so your 'better' son can ascend to the throne then this is your game.
this is probably the toughest learning curve of any game ive playedit took maybe 30 hours of failiure before i got anywhere with this. i had to watch youtube videosgoogle answers to the simplest problems
Great grand strategy game.  I dislike the concept of all the DLC costing extrabut every once in a while the whole lot is 75% off.
this game literally crashes every single time I launch itno mods installedits just not playable plain and simple the audio cuts out in the middle of the map screen and your whole screen freezes EVERY SINGLE TIME. how is this excusable or acceptable is beyond me but for me this is fucking terrible and at this point I just want my money back.
-Played as the duke of normandy -had fun -...
great game i love the depth it contributes
By far the best medieval strategy game I've ever played. Realistic and engrossing. I've put 90+ hours into this game and have barely scratched the surface of all it's possibilities. If you like the middle ages and strategy gamesyou owe it to yourself to buy this game.
ahhhhh where to begin from my Persian shia empire in Hispania too my great Carpatian empire and me as the king of Finland only to get rekt 200 years later by a branch of my family that i banished because he slept with a maid and conceived a fuck childthis game has a lot of value and hours of gameplay and the more friends the better. is your friend all like yea ill be the best king and live for like 80 years np plot against him have him fall off a cliff and be like ahhh man what happend you died then scheme against his family by courting his now widow wife and go resputin on his sons  and cripple his kingdom. work's 99.9% of the time well according to my spy master
This game goes around the idea of politics more than war. I really like a different view from Europa 5but did not find it as fun. In all it is another well made game by paradox.
My favorite game of all time. Not easyconsidering I've been playing strategy games for almost 15 years. Paradoxyou're an incredible company that made the best medieval game ever.
11/10 - A genuinely unique game that does everything it tries very well. It captures why the breeding focus of the nobility of old occurredwell within plausibility. Supreme range of action. Fantastic freedom of choice. Mods take this title from a 10/10 and well into the realm of the assumed impossible.  CKII is a grand strategy game played from a dynasty perspective. You view the world through the perspective of the head of your familyand manipulate the world around you through him and what influence over others he wield. You have to maintain your holdings and manouver the world while grooming your heir so he's capable of taking over your dynasty when you die. A brilliant game about political manouvering in a faudal world.  This game has many dlc
This game is like Civilization met House of Cards. If those two things interest youbuy this game.
One of the best games ever if you like to plot against someone to get his titile and to gain more powerall during medieval times. Really complex mechanismfull of choices for the player. Really recommended game.
Best. Game. Ever!  I suggest you watch the youtube video tutorials and read the wiki-page to fully understand how to play. It's brilliantyou need to play past your first impressions to totally understand the politics and strategy of running a family dynasty. Always kept me on my toes.
This is a beauitful time sink of a game. I honestly wish this was for mobile. I think of this as a make your own fun type of game.  I admit that I don't like playing this game without cheat codes. But the beauity is that the game is still challenging and is still fun even if you give yourself 'Illumanti' money or Mythological stats.   The story of taking one name and making it powerful through various means is highly entertaining and makes each play through unique. Most of my fun came from making unique characters and then making their culture and race clash with the prodmnent culture. Sofor example I would make a African Mulsim in the middle of England and then give him God Money.   Of course the game can be improved in graphics and sound and the layout could be more user friendlyand of course the learning curve is deep and you always feel like you are missing some bit of key knowledge in your choices. But over all most of the action takes place in your own head and not on the screen.
I don't do reviews. CK2 merits a review. I've spend hundreds of hours admiring my dynasties. I've turned Northern Europe Norseand lived in peace alongside the Islamic State. I've created a Jewish State in Egypt. I've reconquered the Middle East in the name of God.  Buy this game if you want to lose your life and rewrite history.
If it weren't for my interest in historical/strategy gamesI would hate this game. I do actually hate it. It's pretty bad. Paradox strikes again. The DLC is ridiculously expensive and the bugs never get fixed.  9/10  fuck this game.
A great gamethough the learning curve and feudal vocabulary can be overwhelming at first.
Please reduce the price for Christmas!!! :D
If you love strategy games and empire building you'll love this game to death! I barely slept the first couple of weeks after I bought it! Though it can be pretty difficult to get started but a few youtube videos can surely salvage that! Must buy for every strategy fan!
Your fix until EU IV arrives in Augustand a great game itself. Thank youParadox.
fun little game for a few hourseverything is decent except the UI and that everything is heavily based on RNG
Kingdom of Rostov/Ghana FTW
Honestlyits one of the greatest strategy games of all time. It is completely unique in its own right. Murderbetrayal
Great gamewith lots of character driven fun as you guide your dynasty through the medieval world. Bit of a learning curve but having your kingdom fall apart around you whie you learn is almost as much fun as rising to greatness once you'v figured out the various mechanics (e.g. bigger army goodsmaller army bad). Insane amounts of replayability from feudal lords to merchant republics
conquered europe with an iron fist as an irish lord who is now 67 yeas of age with 6 children (the heir being 18) and a wife at the age of 66. oh and it all took 3 years sooo.    11/9 would conquer eroupe again
Quite possibly the best grand strategy game of all time. Crusader kings captures the feudaliqtatribal
Immersive experience thats makes you taste the insanity humans receive when they overcome social status. From a simple lord to an emperor you will have to kill many kids and change your wife.
The amount of depth and detail in this game is insane.
Lets just say this game is so good that I take breaks from Fallout 4 to play this.
A bit less friendly of a game than EUIV. Wonderful simulation of the family dynamics behind the countriesbut a bit punishing when you try unconventional things and don't succeed. Your prize ruler could have an awful heirand trying to fix it can cripple your dynasty for generations.
Cucksader Kings 2 is a good Eugenics and Adultery simulator set between the 8th and 15th centuries. Howeverwhen you spend years and years painstakingly building a great empire to pass on to your StrongGenius son
10/10 greatest game everso many hours offline and on. Plus update for the Song of Ice and fire mod is out.
10/10 would seduce entire court again
Wish you were the lecherous Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire that spends his days running around court collecting panties and fucks? Play this game. A Viking war-lord who wants to sacrifice the pope for the glory of Odin? Play this game. Having listened and subconsciously absorbing years of your fathers more-then slightly racist/xenophobic remarks about Islam over the past twenty yearsyou know want to make a completely over the top stereotypical Muslim who spends his days cavorting about his own personal harem and massacring Christians wherever you go? This is the game for you.   In all seriousness this game is awesome. I am still finding and inventing new scenarios for this game. The only reason I would hold back on ever buying it is the price of the game plus all the dice. But Paradox does a good job at putting their products on sale fairly often. Plus with the amount of time someone can sink into a game like ck2 you get a lot of bang for your buck.
Brilliant History Making in an Evening. Its fun being a proper fuck in this one.
You are sitting on your throne when suddenly *bang*. You are in a ravaged battlefield and you face 10k jihad sunni soldiers but you are sure you can beat them because you criss-cross them with your cataphrat legions formation followed by your vikings varangian and then you unleash the holy lighting bolt of god upon their generals you personally then lead the charge from the front while trying to make sense how the hell were you able to impregnate your wife while doing all that. And then *bang* you are on the forest hunting white deers. Feudal life was a savage one.
My favorite grand strategy game!
How_Low_Can_You_Stoop_To_Rule_A_Kingdom_Simulator 2014  11/10
Do you want to kill your brother to become a duke? Do you want to bribe your lord to give you special treatment over the other lords? Do you want to kill off that annoying little sister of yours? Then this is the game for you! I have so many hours invested in this game and they add tons of new content every now and then so pick it up peope.
Scratches that political game itch...even if there is a pretty steep learning curve. Having your familyyour allies familiesyour enemies' families all in mind makes each successive generation a whole new bundle of problems to deal with.
Crusader Kings II is an awesome game which provided me lots of funbut also lots of situations where I wanted to smash the PC.  You should not compare this game to any of the other Paradox titlessince it's unique in most aspects. You do not control a nation or states
Still haven't grasped the entiriety of the gamestill haven't gone through much of any of the expansionsonly feel comfortable playing as a Christian
high skill capbut you get the hang of it within a couple dozen hours. Generallythe game is fantastic and has alot to offer barely get tired of it. The *Base* cost of the game is 39.99
It's a grand strategy game where you don't really play as a countryyou play as a person. A person whose closest enemies are your family firstyour vassals second
I married my son to a princessgot her pregnantmurdered my son and my wife
Probably the easiest 'grand strategy' Paradox game to get into and also the most entertaining. Controlling territories often ends up being secondary to curbing dumbfuckery within your sprawling dynasty. Sociopathic tendencies are a must.
Love this game so far and after my third character i feel like i finally understand some of what's going on. My first 2 characters i had no clue about anything and just wanted to battle. They ended badly and wanted to give up thinking there's too much going on and i have no control over what my own vassals think of me so why not just plot to kill all that get's in my way. I got rid of that initial get right into the game bug and went through the tutorials. what a world of difference a couple hours reading made. Love this game so far
It's good to be the King
LOVE IT!
Do you liek Game of Thrones? Well this is thatbut the video game. Alsoif you really want
A Game of Thrones Mod sneak peek -start as aegon the conquerer  -conquer some stuffbecuase why not -conquer westeros and parts of essos  -keep my religion instead of convertingbecause i love having 3 wifes and 20 kids -become 'Emperor of New Valyria'' -life is going swell... -4 of out of my 20 kids rebel against me  -i put down there feeble rebellion and feed all 4 to my dragon -now im down to 16 kids  -2 more die of greyscale -down to 14 kids -1 dies for being inbred imbecile  -down to 13 - another rebellion pops off this time all of westeros is rebelling -i burn the castles and enslave there daughters and sons -regrets decision -all of essos rebells against me -5 more kids die for being fostered out to foreign nations -down to 8 kids now -burn pretty much everyones castles and enslave there familys -everyone hates me now  -my son plots to kill me  -2 more of my kids join the plot  -imprison kids -demands trial by combat - all 3 die from trial by combat -now im down to 5 kids -oh look someone assassinates my heir -down to 4 kids  -my oldest is 12 years old and already lustful and a drunkard -plots to kill 12 year old charlie sheen -12 year old dies -down to 3 kids -my wife plots to kill me -i stop her and execute her -the bloody flux breaks out in my capital -i catch the bloody flux -all my kids catch the bloody flux and my remaining wifes catch it -everyone slowly dies by bloody explosive diarrhea -my wifes and 2 of my kids die -left with 6 year old heir -i survive my explosive diarrhea disease -fast forward 15 years -my only son and heir has been groomed to command and lead -his name is Aegon II 'The Dragon' Targaryen -hasnt been married yet plan to marry him off soon -BUT THEN -he plots to kill me -i imprison him and call for a trial -he demand trial by combat -i am his opponnet -Aegon The Conquerer and Aegon The Dragon have a bloody fierce battle -its a close one -but in the end -The Conquerer put his sword through the belly of The Dragon -i am known as a kinslayer  -with my last son and heir dead my empire begins to crumple -rebellion after rebellion start popping up -i try to put them down -then my dragons gets slain in battle -but then a event pops up -someone pushes me through a balcony and i fall to my death -with all the rebellions and my dragon dieing i hadnt noticed someone had plotted to kill me -the killer was none other than my court eunch  -never trust a eunch -i lose my empire and i lose the game after 30 something years -THE END  the moral of the story is if someone trys to converts you to another religion you do it or your empire will fall
Great game of macro strategy. Make sure you marrie the right people at the right time - marry the wrong person and you are all of the sudden involved with a nation 10 times the size of yours. There is alot of different starting points and persons/lands to try and conqurer Europe withand Ive only focused on the northern lands (Scandinavia/Ireland/Scotland). Raiding is funmurder is a tool and Empires are the goal!
I really really like this game but it is not for everyone. I have been looking for a game with type of intense and deep strategy and diplomacy for a long time. Where most games rely on hack/slash and army building/conquering through superior fire powerCK2 is centered on deep political manipulation. Not since the first incarnation of Romance of the Three Kingdoms (dating myself) have I been able to find a game that does this well. There are ton of game mechanics that I dont want to go into because someone more worthy than I can probably explain them better. CK2 requires patience and researching game elements and NPC characters. You really begin to understand the life of an anchient monarch who imprisoned his baren wife or planned the murder of his oldestslothful drunkard son before he can take the throne. In CK2
You can buy the DLC pack for this game for $173! Yeah right Paradox! Are you out of your collective 'minds'? The game is great. But Paradox really has gone insane about getting it's 'loyal fans' to 'support' them.
One of my favorite gameS!
Very nice game. Takes alot of time and patience to learn.
Loot and pillage with your warband fa la la la la la la la....
Love this game-- would love it more if there were more in-depth role-playing elements. Takes a while to figure out how to play and even 150 hrs+ in and I'm still learning.
-You need a DLC to play with this faction -You need a DLC to play with this faction too -You need a DLC to be homossexual -You need a DLC to play with this religion -You need a DLC to play with this half of the map -You need a DLC to play with this hellhole -You need a DLC to have fun -You need a DLC to quit the game'
Nice and very potential game. But just for some kind of people
Fun for all the family...who doesn't want to seduceimprison and castrate their way across Europe of the Middle Ages??
Crusader Kings is a truly phenomonal Grand Strategy game and opened me up to what a true Grand Strategy is. My previous experience with the genre consisted of the Total War franchisethis game goes so much deeper than they did. IntrigueWar
I wasn't sure if I would like it since this is the first game like this I've playedbut this game is pretty fun I learn something new every time I play. I wish it had a little more depth though.
Great game even if it seems rather overwhelming at the beginning. Having played EU4 in the pastit was a smooth transition.
Simply the most engaging strategy game I've ever played. Everything in this game circles around Peopleand that is what elevates this game above any other strategy game I've played.  Your Vassals will interact with eachotherand you
i gelded all my kidsmurdered my arab wife (was a swedish duke) and gave my next wife gitteriea  as seen on TV: also expelled the jewry  boyo 1: DAYUM HONKEY YOU SURE 'BOUT PLAYIN' THIS MEDIEVAL CRUNK!?  boyo 2: sorry mistuh don't speek engrish  combAt sure ain't as good as EU IVbut is just based on how many units yuo reely have
Love this game and the endless stories it tells me! I find it hard to reach the end of it thoughespecially since my laptop can barely handle the lategame. Still recommend it though!
I've played this for more than 700 hours. Suffice to sayI'm a fan.   The learning curve is steepbut it's a proper sandbox you set your own agenda. Example: my duke just murdered the Byzantine emperor
Simply the best stratergy game on the marketcomplete masterpiece. You do not need all the DLC to play or enjoy the gamejust the actual expansions
A game where your son turning out to be the son of Satan is everything you could want.
A great grand strategy game spanning a vast time period. With a great modding community its possible to spend hundreds of hours playing.
Lets get this straight:  This is a game about sleeping with your Mom. Also Murder. Also genocide.  10/10 would bang sister again.
-Started as Wessex in 769 -Ruler dies in a couple of years -Daughternamed Sparklesbecomes ruler -A couple hundred years later and I have an empire of the Brittatnian Isles -Non Catholics take over the Papal State -Pope moves to a church in my empire -I declare war -I win -I now own the pope 10/10 would own pope again
Excellent Video Game! Very addictive and fun!
A very in-depth grand strategy gamewhich provides significant bang for your bucks. Play for hundreds of hours and there are still elements of the game to learn. While it has a steep learning curvethe in-game tutorials give you a basic rundown and there are a number of very good youtube tutorials covering all aspects of gameplay
Okaythis is definitely a big boy game. Can you say complex? 'Cuz I can. COMPLEX. See? That's what this game is. Want it in another language? ???????????????There. I said it twice. For emphasis.  HOWEVER  It is so complex because that is the only way you can get the level of satisfaction that comes from this game. I love it. Some reviewers say that the tutorial is uselessleaving you with only a small grasp of the game
Crusader Kings II is another of Paradox Studio's grand strategy games. It is an enjoyable experience all around. Though the learning curve might be a bit steep for some. When I got started a couple years back there were around 18 individual tutorials and even that needed to be teamed up with an hour youtube tutorial to learn to really play it properly. Howeverit seems like an easier/shorter tutorial has been added in the way of a short tutorial campaign.  The graphics and sound are simplebut get the job done. The sound track is earthshattering on the first opening of the game so be on the look out for that. The game also begins to lag after several hundred years of gameplay so people with weaker computers might want to prepare for that.  This game has a nice blend of character building RPG and kingdom building strategy. The RPG comes in the form of elements centred around raising your heirs
This is one of the best games I've ever played. Ever. If you like learning a little soft history and then rewriting it entirelythis game will blow your socks off.
great game 10/10
Probably the best historical game I've ever playedand I've played most of them. The fact that it's played on a personal level makes everything feel so much more deep and meaningful. The only thing I wish were different is that you end up buying so much DLC.
Start the game as a custom made King of England. I'm at war with Norway and the fuck from Normandy (noseriously he has the title 'the fuck')Norway has 12
Quite difficult to get to grips with how to playbut once you get itit becomes VERY enjoyable.
I JUST GOT HOOKED ON THIS GAME I MEAN ITS AMAZING.  10/10 would castrate my rebellious vassal again
Playing CK2 with a friend  Friend's ruler diessuccessor is married to a woman way past childbering age with no hiers  Pope won't allow a divorce  Her intrigue stat is too high to easily assassinate  I come up with a brilliant plan: I seduce his old wife so that on the off-chance that we get caughtthe scandal would allow for a divorce  Successfully seduce her and get caught giving the old lady a good tumble  I later realize that old lady was my current character's aunt  I am now trying to figure out somehting more depraved to top that for our next game  10/Squick
That feeling when you've spent 100+ hours playing this game before realizing there was a fast forward button...  I really enjoyed this game. More so upon discovering that I can speed up my game play.
I can be a raving madman married to my own granddaughter. 10/10 Would Purchase Again
Until now it's still the best strategy game ever in my opinion   It just needs more strong visual effects like: cut-movies in eventspictures of the Palace and Throne room which can be upgradedrenovated or even Falling apart if neglected (which will effect prestige
This game is very entertainingit can be extremely frustrating when things don't go your way however when things go just the way you planned it is a very rewaring experience.  I find that this game can't be compared to EUIV because they are two very different games. CKII is focused on the characters and dynasties whereas EUIV is focused on the state as a whole. It's like CKII is 'zoomed in' and EUIV is 'zoomed out'if that makes sense xD  But I would recommend it to anyone who has the patience to spend hours learning the game. Also
You get to marry your sister44844
you can kill your wifedaughterson
A history buff's dream. Control your own dynastic line from the 8th to 15th century in anywhere in the world from Iceland to India and everywhere in between. Hundreds of hours of replayability. It does have a bit of a learning curve to startbut after a few hours you'll start to get the hang of the basics.
Created an empire and gave 4 kingdoms to different members of my family thought it was the right choice. I later look at who each of them married it turns out my uncle married his neice and my sister married my cousin *instantly face palmed and laughed*. Wasn't suprised why dynasty wasn't respected nor the fact some of their children were inbreds :D
Most immersive strategy game I've ever played. 10/10would assassinate my son because his brother makes a better heir again.
My best buy from the steam sale.
Fun gameimmersive playno run through is remotely the same. Enjoyable to play not as combat orientated as Civ 5 can be. But seriously £148.26 for all the DLC?!?!!?! I'll wait for the next sale
Tried to make Hulk Hogan and Macho Man Randy Savage and they both died so their sons continued their legacy of tanned skin and racism  10/america  would bang
I lament that I spent so much of my life playing Civilization V when Crusader Kings II has been a much better gamesitting right under my nose. You'll spend 20 hours just conquering one small section of the map and you'll feel like you accomplished more than you ever did conquering an entire planet in Civ. Ironman mode is great because you can accidentally fuck up and give away half your domain and be completely unable to do anything about itsetting you back another 10 hours. This is a horrible game and I love it
This is not a review. This is me after hours of playing this game and hoping for more. I like this game a lotbut there are things that I wish they could do differently. The overall idea of the game is greatbut there are countless seemingly little game machanics that frustrate me
Great game
If there was a pre purshase for crusader kings III coming in 5-10 years from now....I would buy it today!
Be a lowly Count in southern France.  Have lots of kids. Duke makes us join the new religious sect sweeping across France. Get murdered at hands of a cousin from neighboring county. Be my son.

Crusader Kings II is one of the best games I have played. I especially like to play as the Byzantine Empireand try to recreate the Roman Empire. Sadly lost the save between updatesa downside of this beautiful game.
Whoever you areyou will love this game.
Words don't do this game justice. like game of thrones? like playing god with your family? like...murdering children? yes? GREAT!!. you just found a great way to build a vast dynasty of inbred fucks )  In all seriousnessthis game is very very very fun. It takes a bit to get the hang of the controls and mechanicsbut you will have a hard time walking away from it as your mighty king/queen FINALLY brings some peace and stability to a torn land
I've spent hours and hours on this game. I find no flaws with the gameplayonly that there is no more Game Of Thrones Mods that I used to beable to find. I LOVE this game.
This is one of the best games I've played and yet I cannot recommend it in good conscience to anyone because it's broken. And it's been different types of broken since last Marchwhen the Rajas of India patch introduced crippling bugs that should have never made it past QA and weren't fixed for months. The same day they were fixedCharlamange was released and broke the game in new ways. The same happened this month with Way of Life
It's Crusader Kings.  Addictive and endlessly compellingI feel like I have to recommend something that has held my imagination for as long as this game has.  Forge a dynasty. Shape the face of medieval Europe... and worlds beyond. A healthy modding community has several spellbinding (often literally) full conversions with new mapsnew races
WellI've never written a review beforeand I don't know if I am worthy to review this game. It says only 29 hours
I love all Paradox grand strategy games(EUIVHOI3
yea it's pretty ok!
Addicated to the Game of Thrones mod for it!!! So good!!
The only type of murder you can't commit in this game is Tyrannicide...  Oh Wait! You can! The Depression trait is so useful.
Good game overallcan also add Game of Thrones mod which i highly recommend.
Crusader kings two is a good game.
Just like a lot of games by the same producer it does take some time getting used to.  But over time I really started to enjoy playing the gamepersonally I like multiplayer mode most. The game has some deep going aspects to itmostly the whole intrigue system. Unlike for example EU 4
Amazingly fun gameyes I cheat quite a bit but I do play through without cheating toothe only problem I have is that you can't earn achievements using characters made with the ruler designer
You needn't look further than the hours on record for each of these reviews.  This game is expansive and will keep you thinking about ittime and time again.  Highly recommended.
It is a complex game and it will take many people a long time to understand how it works. But my advice is to stick it out and learn from your mistakes. This game is well worth the investing many hours. I have messed up many times. The best thing is going from a tiny duke in ireland and one of your relatives becoming emperor many years later.
buy EUIV instead this is still good but EUIV is better
While there is a massive learning curve to those who have not previously played a paradox titlethis is one of the most entertaining games of all times. Don't let my meager 500 some hours fool youI have another 700 or so played offline/unrecorded. I personally am not a fan of the most recent changes to the game
May RNGesus be on your side.
Tonnes of replayability and each game you never know what will happen within your own realm and everywhere else on the map. DLC are good but a little overpricedpersonally would lower the price of older DLCs. Overall it is a solid game and a great way to kill timewould recommend.
This game is incredibly deepcomplexand addicting! It may not be for everyone
its really nice i like it its fun and you may not have total control but that can be fixed using console or mods but its fun to play so buy it if you have enough time on your hands because like most stratagy and sorry if i miss spell im really tired feel free to correct any spell errors on my revew
A game with immense mechanics and flavorhowever has a fuckfuck marketing scheme for DLCs.  This game is lackluster in its vanilla staterequires all the big DLCs to be truly extensive.
A very interesting midieval politics simulator based on intrigue. Probably worth a grab if you enjoy that kind of thing.
Crusader Kings II is an amazing game for the right people. If you like grand strategyhistorical fiction and micro-managing this gameand Paradox games in general
Perhaps the most immersive and challenging strategy game out there....
I just cannot get on with this game. The learning curve is steep and the game is not helpful or willing to teach you the 1000 things you need to do. It is quite difficult to distinguish who is on your side and not on the map. Starter game on very easy immediately got attacked by the Norse &amp Norman armies from across the sea giving me absolutely no chance to learn the basic actions of the game. This game might eventually be rewarding if you are willing to pour hours and hours of defeat to learn it but it is definetly not for me. Back to Total war :)  5/10
10 Steps 1.Play a bunch of hours and learn the game 2.Buy the DLC 3.Be merchant republic 4.Get a bunch of money 5.wait a loads of years to have multiple children 6.Marry those children to more people 7.wait a few characters 8.Marry your kinsman to eachother 9.Wait to populate the world with inbreds 10.Get loads of money
This game has to be one of my favourites.
Had sex with son's wife and murdered a whole family starting with the babies.   Would kill babies again
I love this gameit's quickly become my favourite Paradox game. It's not too hard to learnand the emphasis on characters makes for great stories to tell to your friends
As a student of historyI find this game very appealingbut there is a steep learning curve
10/10 Would have kids with my daughter's daughter again.
I have spent quite some time playing Crusader Kings II. The game is vastly interesting and entertainingand a lot of the customizations you can do for your dynasty and nation make everything seem worthy of your time. Accomplishments seem real as you will actually work hard for them. (Yesthere have been times where I recognized that I put as much effort into Crusader Kings II as I have at jobs. That is tragically sad I am not bragging here.)  Anyway
Hard to get intobut addictive
hard to learn but when u get the hang of itits damn fun esp u like this era type of game!
Top 5 favorite games of all times. Easily can spend all day playing this game. Time flies. Best word to describe it. Epic.
Definitely worth it. Endless mods and tweaks. Even Ironman mode if you want a challenge.
Deeplonghard game... wow
Re-establish the roman empire Mary your sister-aunt-mother-cousin Appoint your horse Glitterhoof as chancellor  What more could you want?
A sweet tale of house Basayev  The house Basayev came to power in central asia in the great steppes. Their land was diverse and rich in culture and heritage. Lord Yusuf was a powerful mansmartattractive and prone to seducing women
I recommend this game because I am recommending this game because it is worthwile to recommend this game fo recommendation of worthwileness if that is even a word I don't know but what is a word really but a gathering of sounds formed into a intelligible understanding of sounds that make sense in a nonsensical way but yet that thou shalt still understand so recommend this now!
Before I came across CK2 my experience of strategy games was mostly with the Total War franchisewhich I loved. I really enjoyed the campaign map gameplay too. So when I played CK2 I was awestruck by the level of detail and scope the game gives you. Firstlyyou can choose to start at any year between 1066 and 1322 (I think)
The games is hardbut rewarding.
They said Temujin and not Genghis Khan.
Buddhist King of Mali FTW!
This game is amazingly fun but you have to have patience and know strategy.
It is sooooo great. If you love Medievel History you will love this game.
This game is my significant other. The one I go back to when I'm bored with the latest AAA title... the embarrasingly large number of hours on record stand testament to that.  I could give you a run down of one of my campaigns. There was the time I played a Norman Count recently installed after the Battle of Hastings. I played it nice with Williamwas made Duke... then overthrew his son as soon as he died and crowned myself King Edmund (Blackadder). There was the time I rebuilt the Roman Empirereunified the Christian Church then imported the Save into EU IV and took Rome to the New World. There was the time where I built a great Welsh Empire that emcompassed all of Great Britain then took the fight to the Mongols. Then there was the time that I encountered the Persian Joan of Ark who led my armies to victory in India... but I won't go into details of those
It is a great game but it has way to much DLC's and restricstions if you dont have the DLC's
Hands down one of the most immersive games I've ever played.
This game is a bloody masterpiece. Tell medo you know any more games in which you can have an inbred soncastrate him and kill half of your family? No? BUY IT. BUY IT NOW.
Great way to spent time and blow a ton of money.
After 30 minutesI googled 'Steam return policy'. After 2 hoursI conquered my first county as Duke of Apulia. After 8 hours
Crusader Kings 2 is literally just a giant Monty Python skit and everyone wants the Holy Grail.    11/10 game of the eon
This game will consume your soul and all of your energydon't buy or play it if you want to be a normal people!!!
Fantastic historical sandbox. Single player is fantastic but multiplayer is really where it shines through. Hope onto skype with a few friends and spend hours building great empires together or fighting bitter civil wars. A lot of very strong mods out there too - all of which work with multiplayer.
This is one of my absolutely favorite games. It's breadth and scope are crazy huge and the regular DLCs keep it alive and fresh. I cannot reccomend it enough.
Great gamevery steep learning curve but full of strategy and well maintained. It's more or less a Game of Thrones simulator and there is actually a game of thrones mod if that is what you want. I don't like how undependable iron man mode is with getting achievements but that's my only major complaint.
268 logged hours plus around 200 more i played offline.   Never even finished one game 10/10
UPDATE 2: with patch 2.6 it is possible to enable/disable the two terrible changes introduced in patch 2.5: defensive pacts and shattered retreat. Indeed defensive pacts were improved with a patch few week after 2.5 but the idiotic shattered retreat was still present. Nowfinallythe game is again fun and I can reccomend it again...  UPDATE: with the last patch the game has been ruined. Paradox has already confirmed that the problem will be fixed but until then I cannot recommend this...  This game has a TERRIBLE interface that makes the learning curve very steep...  But when finally you master it then the game becomes very satisfying.   Overall my opinion is very positive but I suggest to buy it (and all the DLC) when on sale.
Really enjoyable if you like a game with deliberate pacing. Be prepared to lose a lot in your first few gamesparticularly if you play in Ironman mode (which you should). Almost infinite variety comes from playing different cultures and different time periodswhile the core game mechanic is the same: Have babies
This game gives you not only the trials and tribulations of being a kingbut also a sense of history as your dynasty progresses and your children take on new challenges as you shape the course of events. When you have achieved your goalsyou can switch to a new culture and dynasty! In one game I recreated the ancient kingdom of Israel from a Jewish enclave in Ethiopia. Then when that was established as a regional power
Confusing at first but fun
I would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes grand strategy type of games. If you have never played Crusader Kings 1 or 2the learning curve can be a bit hard in the beginning but the end result is well is well worth the timeenergy and effort you put into learning this game.
I have had hours of play time from CK2 and the DLC has extended that no end. The game is a macro simulator of European Aristocratic life in the Middle Ages. That sounds super boring but it incredibly funplotting and scheming to inherit titles of your rivals or marrying your fuck son of to inbred courtiers. The depth of this game is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone interested in 4X genres. A word of warninggoing to war is not the focus of this game
It's alright.
Amazing grand strategy game. Been playing it since it came out and it never gets boring.
Defender of the crown was on of the first games i played on my old amiga. And Crusader Kings 2 was the game i always dreamed about when i was a kid.  Great szenariovery komplexfunny
After toying with most of the DLC I decided to return them. I feel that the base game is decent enough for the casual strategy gamer and for those that won't stay too long with one title. There might not be all countries or events available but in my experience the basic gameplay is the same and well enough for me. Also most of the DLC were tiny content packs of unit skins and songs which are just money milking anyway. The game itself is filled with statistics and data even though I felt that most of it was useless and the really important stuff was cluttered in the middle of it all. Great game if you're willing to put tons of effort in it and got the patience to brave through the UI.   I'm one of those that can't possibly spend all the needed time just to know what I'm doing. Therefore I don't recommend CK2 unless you really like the genre.  ---  That was like... my first impression. After playing 20 hours aka 4 failed playthroughs as the same leader during the same era I'm finally hooked. I played the vanilla version so the experience still changes a lot with the DLC (for better) but this is where I started. I used 7 hours watching tutorials and still failed miserably yet the game kept growing in me. I originally returned the DLC since I was supposed to bury the game to the deepest depths of my backlog but it just popped up like that annoying smart- swedish kid it really is... and I love it. After fixing my error and changing the review I will buy the DLC again. CK2 is a game I will be playing for years.
Best game everbut it has a pretty large learning curve. It took about a week for me to understand what was going on in the game when I started about 3 years ago. Once you get past that lump the game is just amazing. So much going onand so many choices you can make. I've spent 1
This is exactly the game I wanted it to be. If you can swallow that first bitter pill (the extremely steep learning curve)you'll be rewarded with countless hours of brain-consuming gameplay. I'm having trouble even thinking of a game with a similar level of depthcomplexity and flexibility. As long as you understand what it is -- a ruler simulator
In my opinion this one is the most tedious paradox gameBUT the most rewardingwith enough effort you can pass from being a small Kingdom to being the ruler of half of Europe in just one generation
One of the best games I ever played and I return to it every few months. If you love the strategic global map of original Total War gamesyou'll want to play CK2. Once you know the base game really well make sure to check mods.
First off I have to say this game is amazing if you love grand strategy. This isin my opinionthe best way to get the most out of this game. Firstly
- I had an affair with my step daughter. - Wife gets suspicous. - Being the paraniod king i am i imprison my wife. - Decide that my wife is will never be like my step daughter so i file for a divorce. - Pope rejects me. - Execute wife. - Step daughter's opinion of me turns to -30. - realizing im all alone I decide to commit suicide. - Son takes over the kingdom with fuck child (his fathers fuck child). - Kingdom falls to the invading norweigans.  11/9 would complexly destroy kingdom again.
-played as duke of byzantine -formed serbia kingdom -basileus let me go independent -took over poland hungary and the romuvan religion areas -expanded in to russia -conquered all of russian indian and china area -conquered all of muslim area and africa -took spain -took all of europe except HRE -attempt HRE vassilization -excepted holy crap -byzantine all thats left -take me home townone county left -aztecs invade -get  kicked -only retain serbia -me sad  10/10 would get sacrificed to aztec gods again
A difficult game to learnbut once you get the hang of the controls it is utterly consumingfull of unique challenges
Nothing beats owning an empire and three kingdoms each with different laws and half the realm being tribal resulting in 8 dynasty members ending up with all the titles you once held on succession.
This game as a steep learning curve that can be assisted by the many YouTube videos.   Once you figure out all systems and how they work together you will experience a game like no other.  This isn't a singular goal of conquering the world with war but of battles inside by your bordersinside your family and against all the religions that feel they are the 'one.'  The pace is also unlike any other game I have played. It's not about creating a strategy and implementing it immediately..... it's about creating a strategy and nudging it along over 20-30 years. Want your neighbours land but they are too strong???? Maybe in the next 30 years they will have a revolt which is the perfect time to attack..... unless you have an internal revolt yourself
Game is made in 2012 still receives a lot of patching and improvment from the developers. Its really fun has a lot of mods you can play just for war or conquest or maybe use back stab politics and marriage to gain lands instead of using peoples lives. Game is mainly focused on Europe Middle East tho India is added it does not receive a lot of action. If you like learning new things and hard mechanics i reccomend this game. It takes to learn some time but it is worth it.
Fun gamebest Stragety game of all time!
very in depth gamei barely grasp the surface of this gamebut i know i enjoy it
Prior to Reaper's Due I would have neg'd this gamebut the release patch and the DLC shows a better face of Paradox. If this continuesI'll go from 'very wary' to 'optimistic'. I believe Conclave is still utterly skippable unless you're really finding the game too easy and seek a more complex vassal game.
Please note that in total I have spent 24 days straight playing this game.  That should be enough to convince you not to buy this game. Please stay away!   In fact send helpthis game is holding me for ransom.
This is the greatest strategic game of all time. It is also unique. You are not in control of a nationyou are in control of a person. Just play it once. You can always return itbut the game is just.... I'm sorry I am going to play it again...  UPDATE: 9/4/2016 I still play this game at least once a week for a couple of hours. With the advent of each new DLC the game expands to reveal even more depth and gameplay. Its a game I would recommend trying and slowly gaining the dlc over time becuase if you like it you will keep playing it. Each new DLC adds something new that you have to figure out and learn how to deal with and manipulate. This game has a steep learning curve but one of the most unique aspects of this game is that losing is truly fun. You enjoy the story and are always curious as to what might happen next. I would avoid anything that says
I haven't played all that much but I say its pretty good
The greatest game on steam. Highly recommend Old Gods DLC.
So many hours
CKII requires utmost attention when you start playing itfor it is a slow learning process at the start. It may seem very confusing with all that text and those complicated words. Yet once you have become familiar with itthe trade-off is that it feels enormously satisfying to be able to make progress. It is also quite amusing to see your own development and how with what you first were bumbling with
its ok
A gem of a game. Has everything to keep you hooked for hours on end Combatpoliticsmorality questions
One of the best strategy games I have ever playedif not THE BEST. A must buy and DLCs ARE NEEDED for the full experiencebut its worth every penny
This game is the GOAT
+++++++
I have murderedkilledfuck? my way through so many games
Truly unique and classicDLC is expensive when its all added up but this is one of the few games I make an exception for on that and its not too bad relatively anyway
Its a fun game even without every dlc its fun
It's a fun game.
Do you like being a scheming fuck? Do you like having multiple affairs? Do you like paying lip service to the pope in order to have him call a crusade against those pesky iberian muslims instead of India? Butmost importantlydo you like medieval history?  If at least one answer was yes CK2 is for you.  In this game you can do so much stuff that it verges on being medieval life
Vikings kept raiding muh Normandy.  So I conquered their landimprisoned their king and murdered his family.
Converted to Hinduism as a Horse Lord and died instantly 10/10 gameps I hate my life.
Awsome game. Hours of fun. always come back to play. dlc should have come standardbut ah well. Paradox has to make money somehow.
Game is really goodI have lots of ours on my vanilla version but I wanted a Steam version as welllol.  Had one really nice moment when I made the Kingdom of Poland after plenty of wars

This is the story of King Fagotius VII.  Fagotius was a good king who respected the opinion of his fellow man. By age 12Fagotius discovered that being a kind king with a peaceful kingdom was boring as crap. He decided to kill some folks. Fagotius VII became a ruthless king that threw anyone who disagreed with him into prison. Soonhe had no one to serve as his council but his mother
The best strategy game of the last five years. Easily.
I absolutely LOVE this gameespecially with the Game of Thrones mod. This is tied with Tales from the Borderlands for my all-time favorite video game and I can not list off enough good things to say about it.  For onethe best part of this game is that I get to live out my Game of Thrones fanatasies in a way that no other game has captured. I always love creating a character like me and making myself Robert Baratheon's trueborn son since I have black hair and then marrying my favorite character from A Game of Thrones
Another brilliant Paradox Grand Strategy game by a company seemingly incapable of putting out a bad one. I have gotten hundreds and hundreds of hours of gameplay out of this gameand every expansion brings me back for another hundred more it seems. Once you go Paradoxother strategy games just feel...meh. If you like strategy games
Somewhat steep learning curve but worthwhile. The focus on charactersdiplomacyand intrigue sets it apart from others in its class
Kingdom managingmurderincest
Great game by a great developer
If you don't own this gameyou will. at 1073.3 hours and counting.
(in an older version) Married the Pope's fuck daughter and pressed her claim on the papacy. When my heir took over she became Popess and queen of Navarra.  10/10.
A fantastic game that's pretty much murdered by the user interface. Howeverif you have time to learnand the willingness to put up with the interface
i cant play this game with all those babys that fight each other when they grow up 200 years laterall of europe are fighting each other from the same dynasty . but the dlc dem dlc are expensive
You should know what you are getting into before buying this game. A lot of people seem to enjoy it. As for myselfI am somewhat on the fence.  Here are a few things I wish I had known before buying the game.  First of allthere is no tutorial and the game's basic mechanics are complex enough to warrant a three day simposium. You will go online and spend around a few hours reading or watching guides. Or you can be like me and stubbornly spend fifty hours crushing rebellions while trying to figure out what duchies are and why you have too many.  Crusader kings tries to fool you into thinking this is a star-craft/risk like top down game. You have your nation here
I killed my own dynasty as a 17 year old girl to become Queen of West Francegg
This is a odd tale of a bishop named TalanMy Regent (as a child king). I hated my Bishop Regentand likewise he hated me
Once you get into this gameit will be hard to give it up. Even though you could think that this is more of a 'text' gamein a way this makes it timeless. Given the recent optimization it received
I'm gonna kick this review off with the solid statement that this game is very complicated and if you arne't into sitting down doing the time of actually learning how to playthan this game isn't for you and you shouldn't bother reading this review although I encourage you to change your opinoins.   Crusader Kings II which from now on will be referred to as CKis a game with a simple objective but a very complicated road to that objective. The main and primary objective is to make your dynasty/family last as long as possible while getting a high score. You can achieve this goal by killing other people and claiming their thrones
Best of it's kind!
Spent four years of my life devoting resources to a plot to kill my brotherreallyreally wanted the fucks land. Eventually fell to his death
Good Sim/RTS/Survival mixkeep your family alivebuild up counties/provinces
Played EU4 140 hours - perty good Played CK2 10 hours - Hmmm....ThinkingStratigyEU4 with people and more!  Paradox allways delivers after 60$ on DLC's but overall this is a great game. Love playing and a good game with freinds.
This is one heck of a game! It scratches an itch I've had for a while. I have played manymany hours of Civ and Total War (games I adore)but they never satisfied the urge for true diplomatic play and intrigue.  Pros: Dynasties Meaningful choices Depth Addictiveness So much more...  Cons: Complexity (There is so much to this game - the tutorials alone may not fully prepare you. Luckily there is a helpful community out there).  This is well worth a buy!
A relatively quick story from my current game playing as the Isle of Man: This is a simple story of two brothers. Elud is the eldera not particularly bright but very pious man. Serigi is the youngera brilliant diplomat and generally likable guy. Family traditions include infighting
:()
I regret to buy this gamei cannot sleep at nights because of being curious what will happen next after i do something
I started playing this game because a couple of my friends were playing it and kept bugging meso I bought the vanilla on sale and booted it up. On their reccomendation I skipped the tutorial and we jumped right into multiplayer. We decided to do a roman conquest of Irelandso we created Roman characters and snagged areas of Ireland and went from there. They decided I should be king
Crashes on loading screen of the game. I had to change language to stop crashes. Paradox pls debug this.
The best game Paradox has ever mademaybe the best game so far in human's history. If official Chinese version is addedit'll certainly draw many Chinese players to the game.
Simply the most in depth conquest strategy game I have played. As someone who always wished for more diplomatic options in the Civilization series this game gives you everything you could dream and more. I actually had an affair with a vassels wife and impregnated herlucky for me the husband was none the wiser. You can literally casterate people and sell them into slavery! Be warned there is quite a bit of learning that goes with this game but once you get the hang of it you can see why I give this a 10/10.
I have an awsome time playing this with my friendsthis is a great game! :)
Started out as a small tribe in Norwayhad a great leader. After a lot of time and effort I conquered all of NorwayIceland
A 7 year old Norwiegam Earl was threating my land with succession claimsso I my spy sent around that he was a homosexual to everyonehe disappeared very quickly.  10/10  I LOVE THIS GAME.
First game -Plots to kill King. -Kill King but assassin is caught and gives you up. -Plots to kill that kings heir -Heir is murdered and assassin is caught again and gives you up. -Plots to kill next king. Plot works but assassin give you up. -Finally takes over lands of said kings by marrying into bloodline.  -2 game years in you are murdered with no heirs. -Game over  Very fun game once you learn how most of it works. Don't leave any of your Plot to Kill victims with any next of kin or you'll be on their hit list.
Bought gameplayed a few games to get the feel of it as an Irish Lord. On about the tenth game I formed the Kingdom of Ireland and took half of Wales. I had to declare war on the English King to do so. Not only did I kick his armies buttsbut the King of England called in the Roman Empire to help him defend Wales.....and failed
fuck you vassal and your demands for elective monarchy!
CKII has now at this point been so positively reviewed that I ask myself why bother? I guess I just want to express how fiendishly good a game Paradox has created here. I have never played a game like itand probably never will again. In CIV you keep telling yourselfjust one more turn
the game keeps on crashing after the first time it is loaded
This Game is a highly complex and stimulauting gamewith ridiculous replayability value. With a diverse dynastical focusthe gameplay becomes realistic with focus on family rather than state. Additionally
I have 4312 hours into this game. I think that says it all.
Brilliant game. DLC is often great if you avoid the unnecessary cosmetic DLC's but otherwise can't fault the game.
Perfect game.
One of the best games I ever played

Best medieval marriage simulator on the market.
Incestuous political murder simulation with strategy elements.
It is probably my favourite game on Steambut only buy it during 75% off sales DLCs needed: - Sword of Islam - Charlemagne - Way of Life - Old Gods - Legacy of Rome
It's expensive with everythingbut if you like Grand Strategy this game is the winner.
When I play strategy gamesI usually judge them on how engaging or interesting they are. How often they force you to make difficult decisions and how they reward you for playing well. CK2 does this very wellbut it also offers something very few other strategy games offer
Love this game! Would recommand to anyone that loves grand strategy games or would like to get into the genre.
I Play as the king of Sicily. One day I find out my wife is pregnant with another man's child so I impression them both and get a divorce from the pope. As soon as the fuck is born I execute both the adulterers. HoweverI let the child live out of pity. Twenty years later this same child assassinates me and most of my good heirs leaving the realm to my imbecile son. Sicily soon falls to the Byzantines after a year.  10/10
It's ok.
Great game! Amazingly well done. Only thing is the damn DLCsthere are many of them. But avoiding that is a perfect game.
They have changed something again. I guess there goes another 100 hours of my life
911 recorded hours of incestseductionholy wars
One of my all time favourite games.
Wonderful gamekeeps you coming back for more and more. Well worth getting
Takes a while to learn but rewarding when you finaly figure out what your doing.
The King had a long day ruling the kingdom of Wales and decided it was time to go to sleep. As he was about to fall asleephe suddenly heard hissing in his bedroom and it turned out it was a snake and it bit the kingcausing great pain. As the king was dying he found out that the snake belonged to his dear wife
It's not an easy task to be a king. Everyone will try to take your place. Everyone has their own agenda. Meanwhile inner intrigues can swallow your kingdomouter foes might appear on the horizon who would dare to conquer your realm. Dive deep into middle ages with its dirt and violence. Be one among many who will succeed in withstanding test of timebrining your family into the annals of history!
I love this game. I don't have as many hours as most people playingbut I still really enjoy it. This is definitely a hard game to get intoand only really plays for a certain niche
This is a very well crafted historical medieval nobility simulator that lets you experience the best and the worst of the medieval time period. As a 'grand-stratergy' gameyou should know going in that there is a lot to learn to have the best experience possible.  My biggest concern however with this game is the DLC whoring policy that Paradox have adopted such as charging 4.99 USD for somethin as simple as a map graphic pack adding more units. I would advise buying the essentials such as The Old GodsSword of Islam
This game is one of my all time favouritesI love the personal scale of it and the stories that are created. I expected a high-class strategy game and got thatbut also to my delight a game that revolves around story-telling
The best strategy game I have ever played.
almost finished United the Kingdoms and It's Better to be the Emperor achievementbut died half way.  Would try again...  oh waiti forget to use ironman mode.
Really enjoying this game. If you enjoy this genre and have some time to learn the mechanics i denfinetly recommend it.
One of my favourite games I have ever played. You need to give it time to show its true brillianceso dont go into it and expect to be a master in the first 20 minutes :P There are so many good things about this game I can't even begin to desribe the sheer amount of pleasure there is in forming your own history of europe and india. I remeber one of my games i managed to form the Russian empire 200 years before its real world creation... moments like that maker a game in which the world is what the world could have been... I know Im not making much sense so I'll leave you with this Play the game - Love the game - Become history.  Happy crusading!!!! :D
I fuck?? away sooo much time playing this
Took me 2 hours to figure out that I couldn't run this game  Seems cool tho  Update: Got a laptop that can run it but now I figured out that I'm too dumb to figure out how to play it Still seems cool tho
It is a good game.
My most successful rulerKing Murchad of Mumuinherited the Duchy of Mumu from his father at the age of 14. He contracted the great pox at the age of 16 and also became a lunatic
Play as a king who does what everyone wants orrrr execute anyone who disagrees with you. Not to mention multiple conversion mods such as Game of ThronesElder Scrollsand The Witcher.
There are games I love: Final FantasyZeldaPokemon There are games I play all year round: Destiny
What's better than taking a lowly count and making him the first step in a empire that spans the known world?
Crusader kings is probably the best game i have ever playedexpansions are expensive and there is a lot but steam has lots of sales up to 75 percent off. Only game where you can be anti christ one minute then lead the crusader's next min.
First of allthis game is great value for money. It is endlessly replayable and every timethe history which develops is different. If you are are a fan of strategy grand or just strategy in general
Great game that turns the strategy game paradigm on its head by making the focus not necessarily on expansionbut the survival of your ruling family.
On my 500th hour of Crusader KingsI decided to write a review and reflect back on all this time I've spent on the game.   To startCrusader Kings II is an excellent game
I had a life once.
This game is amazing but some dlc could be featured in the game without being a dlc but it's good game??
I love this game it is without a doubt one of the best grand strategy games. It took me about 3 days to learn this game without the tutorials help and im still learningwhat the fuck does buliding stuff even doevery time i play this game i get a new experience fromplaying as a imbred
i was just looking threw some reviews and from what i can tell all the shity players are dissing the game because they cant adapt to the new way the game is played. they act like you have to buy every single dlc to have fun when thats not true you only need to buy acouple dlcs to have MORE fun. hell you only need to add like 60 bucks to buy the good dlc if you like the game. enough rambling so would i recomend the game? HELL YEAH I WOULd and i have the core game play is fun and the dlcs make ot funner conclave added new chalenges and made the game slightly less fun if you cant deal with FULL SPEEDwhich is quite easy if you now what your doing. is paradox sucking its players for money... yes but its not like they dont deliver some steamy hot dlcs and i feel like everytime i buy a dlc im getting a little closer to ck3 because with every bu they get the more they will want to make a new one. what are the dlcs you dont need mr? well you dont need aztec invasion raj of india any of the content packs any of the portrat packs any of the unit packs or the music packs  now why should i buy the game? because its one of the best games made by paradox thats why. its a game where you can sit and just play for hours. i know i can and have. so i would buy it if i were you. DO IT YOU F###ING SL#T
Lets face itthis game is amazing. Its a true paradox grand strategy game compete with all the bells and whistlesand lets you do everything from manage your peasant army to determining how to best 'deal' with your imbecile dull son to then trying to find enough moneey to try and build that new fort you've been salivating over. Its byzantine intrigue on levels that not even a game of thrones can touch. Ive invested hundreds of hours into this game
Being a Lord was never so satisfying. And then they said I had no class consciousness. Pft.
A strategy game that deals with royal familiesreligionand feudal systems. DLC is important though.
Did you like the Total War series but auto-resolve every battle? This game is for you!  You handle the management of the empire and overall strategy. It's about diplomacy and managing your relationships with the family members and associates who are your court and vassals.  Great game if grand strategy and historical settings is your thing.
The depth of game in impossible. You can start as a count and become an emperor in 100-200 years. Which is realistic. But what will happen after you become emperor? That part is realistic too. You see your empire tear apart from inside. Awesome gameawesome mechanicsawesome depth.   + I REALLY love the character traits. It has nice real life applications. I made my 5 year old niece touch a spider
I was so excited to play this with the Game of Thrones mod. When I finally did I started questioning 'is this all there is to the game?' I thought I might be bored alreadybut then crazy things started happening. These epic events to which it was a challenge to react have proven this game to me. I will be back and I will be playing to win.
Just one more year and I swear I'll go to sleep.
As an infant emperor of BritanniaI was murdered by mother... because she didn't like my father (and predecessor). 10/10
The game itself? Amazing. The DLC? Not so much. Every single bit of DLC should be included in the fucking game. You have a game including almost every main religionempireand culture that existed during the time periods of 769 until the mid 1300s
My character Richard IIIDuke of Normandy (54)'s unmarried daughter Matilda (17) bore a fuck sonAlan to her dynasty. When I sought the unknown father of the baby by using cheat
Glorious
Conquered ScandinaviaUnited them allLooted half of europe
It's pretty awesomeespecially if you are a historian buff (though there are also a lot of historical mistakeslike no naval warfare). Just be clear that it's WAY to expensive with all the add ons and drains way to much of your life/time... Mainly
Great strategy game with a lot of intresting mechanics. one of the major downsides is the overuse of dlc that shouldn't be dlc( the dlc that unlocks religions to play) without itit is a decent game with it it's awesome
I have only had this game for a few monthsbut in just that short amount of timetwo DLC's have come out
Amazing game but it will take a good while to figure out. I watched quite a few youtube tutorials when I was just startingand I keep the wiki open in the background while playingbut after all the learning
You can hit on your sister.  11/10
If you have ever wanted to be an actual player in Game of ThronesCrusader Kings II is as close as you can get without inventing a time machine to take you back to the middle ages.  There is only map level interaction with battlesbut this game exchanges that minutae
Easily my favorite steam game that I own. The perfect strategy game for those who are familiar with the genre. Enticing to those who are new to it as well with some of the... debauchery that takes place. Just stay away from any game versions beyond 2.4.5 and the Conclave DLC.
Even the Vanilla game without the DLCs is quite enjoyable. I find myself attached to the characters and kingdoms and actually encourages me to spend more time looking up historical events and locations when not in game.   This is a slow strategy game that takes time to complete. It is challenging in may aspects which encourages a lot mental stimulation. If you're a casual gamer who's looking to build and accomplish things- this is a game for you. If you're the type who likes to pass an hour here and an hour there- this game may not be for you as it has a stiff learning curve.
If you're not doing anything you're playing wrong
A good gamewith a Clauzewitz engine. The real guy is famous for quippinginter alia
As a new playerthe tutorial is 100% useless. It doesn't highlight or indicate the things it wants you to learn or pay attention toand there doesn't appear to be any real tips or hints when you randomly go through the clickable frames in the user interface.  Further
This isn't your average chocolate chip cookie recipe! Ingredients (yields about 1 1/2 dozen): 1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 tsp. baking soda 14 tbsp. unsalted butter 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 tsp. salt 2 tsp. vanilla extract 1 large egg plus 1 large yolk 1 1/4 cups semisweet chocolate chips 3/4 walnutschopped Preheat oven to 375 degrees and line baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour and baking soda in a medium bowl. Melt 10 tablespoons butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat (I used a stainless steel skillet to easily see when the butter had begun to brown). Continue cooking and swirl pan until butter is dark golden brown and has a nutty aroma (about 1 to 3 minutes). Transfer to a large bowl and add remaining 4 tablespoons butter and stir until completely melted. Browning the butter is a key element of this recipe! It gives the cookies a great depth of flavor. Add brown sugargranulated sugar
I can't write a long in-depth review of this game.  It's awesome. Buy it. Please.
I feel like many of the changes and DLC that they have added after Rajas of India have made the game significantly more limiting in scope. The CB's have become harder to come by and certain events may NEVER trigger now. For exampleif you are an Irish lord and the Byzantines decied to kick some buttthe crusades will not fire. Still an amazing game as you see by my hour log
No other game captures the personal aspect of empire building like Crusader Kings 2.
kyle told me to buy it
i love this game and it never gets old becaues of the great mods
Best Game of Thrones simulator ever!!!
Lots of replay value and very fun. Can be hard to get into but definetly worth the effort if you like strategy or historical games.
-Found out my sister is having an affair -Blackmailed her and her lover that I'll tell everybody if they don't pay -Sister tells me some crazy dude is blackmailing them -Offer them help in exchange for money -Can't stop Blackmailer but still gets money -Happens a second time -??? -Profit  Being a feudal lord never was as much fun as now
This is a totally immersive experience. It is so much more than a grand strategy game. You feel you really are the ruler of your selected nation. The micromanagment and also the macromanagment are well thought out. Your relashinship with other nobles and vassals feel real and more often than not you actually develop an enemity or a friendship with a particular house or noble. This is a excellent game that although hard to masterit is easy to learn. Do not feel overwhelmed by all the information you are given and give this game a chance. This was my first grand strategy experience and i must salute the great effort paradox put behind it. DLC is still coming out todaygreat
Best Strategy Game I have yet to playI spend hours and hours of playing this game... really fun :)
It takes a bit of getting used to. But it is a really in depth and entertaining game once you learn the ropes
This game is brilliant. Its complexity and depth are endlessand that is the beauty of italthough that means you will have to spend time getting the feel for how the game operates. The game will force you to wake up areas of your brain you didn't even know you had! There is much work to do
Is Crusader Kings 2 addictive? Well have you ever tried Ice that one time and then been like 'I can stop any time' and instead found yourself confusedunwashedstarving and wondering how you got here (and where did the last week go)? That is basically what Crusader Kings 2 does to you.   Come on. Give it a go.
Its great. High learning curve but its worth it :D
A pretty interesting game. Provides a lot of varying option on what to do and allows one to play out different turns of history.
Great graphics and deep gameplay. Redonkulous amounts of fun abound with the new DLC and patches.
People complain about the amount of DLCbut most of it is just music and portrait packs that you don't need to buy.  Charlemagne and way of life are really the only ones that I would consider helpful enough to the game for newcommers to buy.  After thatyou can buy horse lords
It's the fuckin bees knees
Murder? Check. Intrigue? Check. Incest? Double-Check. It helps if you have a handy background knowledge of feudal politics before jumping into this Medieval character simulator. Hours of good fun to be hadcompounded if you play with friends.
I have no idea how to play this game. I spent hours trying to marry people and build a network of treachery to conspire against my enemies. I ended up getting assassinated and then having my heirs imprisoned. 10/10 would play again.
This game is fucking classi just started off as some little lord and schemed may way to the kingdom of ireland. Also this game has a 'game of thrones' mod...fuck face
Love it!
Amazing game. You'll need to dedicate sometime to this game to learn it but its well worth it.
Amazing game! Far more politics than Total War games which is great! DLC is always excellent though sometimes a little priceybut a fantastic game! Would reccomend to anyone!
Cool sandbox where you can rewrite history. You can stablish your family in all European Kingdomsfull of intrigue and killing young infants so your wifewhos 3rd in the line to the throne can become queen. The AI is buggy and makes ridiculous decisions
Its sure feels good to be king!
I have after some consideration decided to edit my review of CK2 and change my recommendation of the game.   If you buy Crusader Kings II you will be buying a lemon.  Most of the content of this game is locked without DLC's each coming at $15 dollars US each. You cannot play every playable character in the game without at least 6 DLC's. The DLC's are overpriced and have far too little content.   This game is just another Paradox game filled with micro and not so micro tansactions taking your money away just to buy the actual games content even after you have purchased the game itselfwhile at the same time features that should have been in from day 1 are still absent. They advertise it as historically accurate as welldon't be fooled
I had 3 sons whom the kingdom was going to be split between on my deathso to preserve my kingdom I made my ruler depressed then went Benoitmaniaimprisoning the two fuck?ier of my sons and executing them before killing myself to avoid any consequences
Keep your friends close and your siblings in the oubliette.
Can start off kinda slow. But its a nice pace to just relax while doing other things.
10/10 best House of Cards game on Steam.
My bloodline ruled in the Duchy of Tyrol for centuries. Each ruler was well-liked and successfulhaving sons that went on to rule after them.  Of coursesomeone took it upon himself to take over my land. The jealous
I bought this game specifically for the game of thrones total conversion mod and it did not dissapoint. The mods on this game are second to none you can play in middle earth or Westeros or Thedas as well as in the real world it takes a while if your rubbish with technology like me to work out how to add them but once you know how its pretty obvious. But even without mods its a good game. I do wish they wouldn't go so mad with dlc's to get any money out of the consumer I can understand adding continents as dlc's but the nordicceltic faces etc feel like they should be part of an update. My advice is buy the complete collection with all the dlc's while its on offer as induvidually the dlc's add up in cost and you will want them to expand your play.
One of the greatest game's i have ever played in my life. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys history or any sort of littlefinger schemesthe only problem i have with the game is Conclave DLC is broken in my opinion atm.   will edit when i believe the dlc is fixed.  Edited - things
EDIT: OK! So after changing distrobutionthe game works! It even works better than it used to on windows. It seems the problem was on my endpossibly with a malfunctioning KDE/Plasma settup. So my apologies to Paradox
Don't hesitatebuy itlearn it. Rule an empire.
Although you need to spend big to experience this game on its highest level i'd recommend it as Raradox uses it's gaming engine well to give you one of the finest medieval strategy games out there.
This game is slowly turning me into a monsterI just had my first born son murdered because his younger brother was superior to him in every way.  10/10
I recommend it for people who like strategy games it has a nice long gameplay and a nice little just 5 more min. foctor.
Not like any other strategy game I played
This game is the perfect intersection of Grand StrategyHistoryGeography
I still have no idea what I'm doing.  10/10
I own all of the major dlcs except conclave and horse lords. I've only owned this game for like five months. I didn't even start playing on ironman mode until 200-300 hours in. This game actually peaked my interest in history. Its like civilization Vtotal warand the sims all entered into an open relationship with eachother and this game is their lovechild. Just an awesome game.'  EDIT: I think it is important to note that I bought this game on a massive steam sale (and all the dlcs except conclave
Great game. I especially like the Game of Thrones mod for this game. Crusader Kings 2 is one of my favourite strategy/simulation games ever developed. I give it a 5/5.
Crusader Kings II is a fantastic game. While the initial learning curve is very steepand it can take a while to understand the gameit is definitely worth it. I've put a lot of hours into this game and I still feel like there's a tonne I have left to do.   The best part about the game is that while it is historical stratehy
Great game
The best strategy game I've ever played. Period.
Interested in real life historybut also being able to marry your cousin? Like Game of Thrones and the drama surrounding succession/power? CK2 is the game for you.
-Playing as Frodi of Austisland -invaded Vestisland to create duchy of Island but doesn't have enough money -Frodi died with what ever reason my land splited -After succesful invaded Vestisland again Viking Age Event fired -Buldli of Nidaros invade my land -I lost -Became Buldi vassal and his heir due to him doesn't have any son -Assassin Buldi and became Jarl of Nidaros 10/10 would have been invaded again
great game. Its simple yet challenging and immersive for the right kind of person.
The best stategy game I ever played. Content is enormousset up is infinite. We can play as europeanvicking
marriedshagged and murdered my own daughter for an alliance with an one provinz minor 11/10 would rek my daughter again  ''    mariébaisée et assassiné ma fille pour une alliance avec un mineur de province 11/10 risquerait à nouveau ma fille
To hell with your moral compass. Be the tyrannicalinbred and very prolific monarch you ever wanted to be!
I have no idea what i'm doing
Great game but limited without the dlc´s of which there is plenty to buy.
A grand strategy real time character driven historical soap opera roleplaying game. Also the closest thing to Game of Thrones you'll likely play.  You should probably buy it.
Built myself from the lowest count into the most powerful lord in the land. Regent of the Kingfather of the Queen SpymasterDuke
Love this game
Overpriced DLC simulator of the year.  Buy if you like buying too many overpriced DLCs.  Paradox has lost me as a customer. I won't be missing their games knowing they will deprive them of content to sell as DLCs.  I will wait for years and getting their games on 75% discount instead.  Screw me onceshame on youscrew me twice
I was going to do my usual pro-con formatbut I simply could not think of enough cons for it! It is an excellent gamethe best medieval strategy game on the market
Great strategic game. Deeptime consuming and moddable!
A game that teaches you that failure in a game is acceptable as long as you understand WHY you failed and HOW you can get better.   A steepvery steep learning curve that pays off once you are able to scheme your way from a lowly pissant count to a powerful war lord emperor that has many people under him. Watch as you manage a family and have to deal with unexpected outcomes such as bad heirsgenetic breeding that goes terribly wrong
Make scandinavia great again. 10/10.
Too much of much of my life has gone to this game. Too much of my money has flowed into the pockets of Paradoxand I know more will follow. SomedayI will transfer to Stellaris
I have played nearly 40 hours and I still have no clue what I'm doing but it's still fun and enjoyable. I'd wait until it was on sale for the strategically challenged people such as myself though.
Even if you are dissatisfied with the current gameyou can play on any god damn major patch of the game essentially. I mean jesus christpeople.
Editing my review because new analogy:  My Empire is a neighborhood.  Each kingdom is a street.  Each county is a house.  Each castle/city/bishopric is a room.  Let's say my Empire has Butt StreetNut Streetand Gaben Street.  The King of Butt should rule all the houses on Butt Street
I only ever played the Game of Thrones Mod. Buy this game and play the mod.
Still recommendedalthough RECENT DLCS AND PATCHES HAVE SERIOUSLY DIMINISHED GAME QUALITY. Likethis game gets more and more complicated and annoying every month. Ex: shattered retreat. Before the patch
Very good game. well-designedhighly complex and yet not too difficult to get into.
It takes time before you might get a bit of knowledge about how to play this gamei'd suggest watching some gameplays of it and when you understand the basicstry to explore the other things yourself
My wife had an affair and gave birth to the daughter of another man. Executed other manexecuted wifethrew baby in the oubliete for the next 16 years. She survived
Good stuff
Steep learning curvebut once understood a very deep and entertaining game. Playing as multitude of dynasty players over the agesfrom more of a social view point than anything else
Seduced my sister and made her my Queen.  10/10 for inbred Prince of England
A great game that has issues. The biggest is diplomacy is very weak in this game. This is not a war simulator but a dynasty sim. The only issue is that both diplomacy and war helped build and destroy dynasties.  Update 2 Years later: They have add several more DLCs that have removed the need of my need for major overhaul mods. I recently came back and this game even better.  My only thought is you need all of the DLCs and content packs to have a good time playing this game. But that puts you at a $100+ investment. You will get your moneys worth.
I got killed by my sonbut since he was my heirand he owned lands I didn't
Simply the best Grand Strategy game out theresteep learning curve but oh so rewarding when your enemies dynasties crumble before your eyes. My hours on record say enough.  Maybe wait for complete edition because half of the released DLC is not worth buying.
As you can seeI already played this game for 680 hours (that equals 100 days)and I still love to play it for an hour or two every evening.  I exclusively played the AGOT mod (  https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/  )
I love this game! yes there is a huge lurning curve but once you get the hang of it there is endless fun. theres no better felling then when your getting attacked by heathons on all sides and the pope sends a huge army to help you out!
I really can't pin down my favorite moment in CK2 that will both make people laugh and accurately display what the game is like for people. SoI'll just list everything that's happened to me thus far.  My wife cheated on me with her brother.  My son summoned an army from hell and murdered me.  My daughter got siphilis at the age of 2.  I got naked and howled at the moonbelieving I was a werewolf.  I shagged my cousin.  I shagged my neice.   I shagged my wife's neice.   Never shagged my wife.   I castrated my son by accident.   One of the randomly generated character's I played's name was fuck? (I did not name him this
10/10 Would eat the pope again.
I played this as a pirate quite a while Saw a sale and buyed it right away Takes a while to learn the game even with the tutorials 8h
unlike EU4 they're actually paying attention to balancing this game well as they update it and making it both challenging yet non-tedious
I only write reviews if i reached over 100 hours of gameplay. CK II is such a gameand i can expect to spend dozens more time with it. Thats rightthis game has the potential for a lifelong replayability. For maximum enjoyment
What's your excuse for not getting it yet?
Want to find out how horrible a person you really are? This is the game for you.
Great gamebut with the latest updateI can no longer play the game of thrones mod. Assistance would be greatly appreciated.
Love this game. Went for a quiet game as the Emir of Jerusalem. Roll on the Crusades! :)
Paradox games great games and I highly recommend this one. They made this game so it is easy to modand fans of the game have made tons of mods to play with once you get bored of vanilla. GoTLoTR
Great Change of pace! Save often as history has a way of making you say DOH! I love it!
Get the Game of Thrones Mod and never look back. This game and that story pairs swimmingly.  What is dead may never die.
The game has taught me no matter how wonderful a parent I am my son will demand landslower crown authorityhave a triple chin and seduce my wife. 10/10
Make sure you get the CK2Plus mod from the paradox forums. without it the game is for middleschoolers.
This game made me a catholic.  I was an atheist.
Fun filled strategy and politacal motiveslots of hitched breath from the battle moments as at any time you could lose spectacularly!
This game is brutally difficult when playing on Ironman mode and trying to turn a 1 county Count into even a small kingdom. The random event generator will have your leader falling ill every few monthswill randomly decide to kill off or take all your councilors hostageand will have a viking raiding party land on your last piece of kingdom after your other two counts declare indepedance from you.  Overall
After playing this for over 400 hours i now think im worthy of having my opinion on such a big game! For me this is by far the BEST GAME on steam!! EASY.. if you have the patients and tactical mind to stick with ityou will not be disappointed and will easily get value for money and so much more! it takes alot of restarting and trying new tactics but its all good fun and challenging and with that comes a very rewarding feeling once your dynasty has ruled europe or the middle east or scandinavia for centurys and every royal blood line wants their children to marry yours even your distant kins men who have no claim end up with royal marriages! until every king and leader is a relative and a possible strong ally! I have nothing but praise for the creators of this fantasticly made game and the thought that went into its development.. :D 10/10 Will spend another 400 hours playing this and more :D ps unless a number three is made :D
it's ok.
Great game but the AI is hell bent on your destruction and will kill every memeber of your fsmily 90% of the time
Vikingsthats all that needs to be said
Beware Syphilis!
Check it out. It's very addicting and loads of fun. Look for punsironyhilarious outcomes and watch as the immoral person in you comes out to play. :P
CK2 is an endless adventure where you will never play the same game twice. Each time i play im amazed by the differences even though i play as the same person. this is one of the best games I have ever played hands down.
An interesting turn on Grand Strategy. People might complain about this game not being as good games like Europa Universalisbut I honestly say this game is a unique experiencenot directly comparable to EU4. Unlike most Grand Strategy games
Hey its pretty good! (The game is a bit bland without DLC but with around 25 bucks you can get the collection on fuck You are welcome :) )
-married princess of hungary -got my son to marry princess of danmark -got my other son to marry princess of sweden -fucked both of my son's wives and my own -get confronted by son's about affair -plot to kill both of them -both ded -muslims jihad my nation -muslim kill all of my people -they take all of our wives for their harem -10/10 would decieve again
gave the queen of france aidsmurdered her husbandand invaded after she gave me a fuck son. had them both executed. and died insane after i fucked myself to death. 10/10
Forms Roman Empirefulfils Alexander's wish to conquer Indiadefeat the Mongols
Probably one of the deepest strategy games out there. Could you expect anything less from paradox? great for history buffs and strategy fans alike. a solid 9.5/10        im CUCK
This game ive wasted alot of time into but. This game is unique and diffrent compared to other paradox titals and this game does get bland but its get better with mods
This game will take over your life !!!!!  the changes made since the Rajas of India expansion have been hit or missbut the mods truly make up for it. This game truly is amazing.
I play this game far too much. great game that is even greater then it's origanal greatness when you play with mods.
Like Game of Thrones? buy this.
I recently crossed 1600 hours in this game. I decided it needed a thumbs up now that I will phase it out for Stellaris and NMS. Will come back periodically until they take it off Steam. One of my top 5 of all time.
Definitely a noteworthy game. I'm editing my review after a ragequit and uninstall. I've had a lot of fun with this game. The stories can be amusingand it has a unique gameplay to it. A high difficulty leveland lots of possibilities. Yes
Even though I got it when the Assasination button was removedI can still plot to kill people.  It is a fun game if you are in to the 4x type strategy gamesa thing I like to do is start from count and work my way up all the way to king and even emperor.  I would plot to kill those that are against me again 10/10
Great game0/10 rating on gameplay. If you get the right DLCyou can be the most cruel emperor in history as you climb the chain an murder those who stnd between you and the throne. Grab some friends and you may fight for the throne in a competition of assasination
This is a great gamebut I am pretty fuck??that there is no collection containing every DLC. As it is
Sothis is the first time I feel compelled to write a review for a game. Crusader Kings II is no doubt my absolutely favourite game right now. No matter how much time you invest in itit will keep surprising you
I LOVE THIS GAME!! I play this game with my brother and sister and even though there is always some kind of problem whenever we try to play itmaking us waste some of our time trying to connect and other stuff...its so perfect we keep coming back!!And we wll always keep coming back so we can manipulate or conquer or even assassinate our way to an empire! P
I started off as the Byzantines and hold off the sejluks till they give up which was a shock then I manage to take places up to the HRE and other kingdoms north of me and with my empire doing amazing I stop the wars for a bit and work on making my empire better but then I see jihads being called like crazy on other places but I ignore it and all of a sudden one is called on me and I think 'ha my empire is huge these infidels wont be able to beat me.' then I start seeing more and more muslim places joining and I use up much of my money to build a 5000 man army and by that time antolian lands mostly where occupied by the jihadists and my army takes down a few of the armies but then supplies were lost and within 2 months the men were constantly attacked and out of supplies and were only 20000 left and then they attcked my men and that was when I said 'huh well ****' But in all honesty this a great game but very overwhelming at first. while writing this I realized I played 10 hours already and I got it last night good god but that should tell you its a GG
This is one of those games that you just keep coming back to. In my opinionany game gets tedious after a few hundred hoursif not before. No matter how good the game is.  I like strategy games
Amazing game. Could not recommend more!
One of the best games on steam.
very good strategic game.
One of the best games everso much depthso awesome
I don't even usually play grand strategy gamesbut I love CK2 because it's one of the best emergent narrative games I've ever played. Your brain will make patterns out of random events and an engrossing multi-generational story will take shape. It adds a real human element that you don't always see in strategy games. If you're like meyou'll fall in love with it before you can even get over the learning curve.
The game is certainly funas it has endless replayability and a huge selection of mods. The game has a huge tendency to push unnecessary DLC'snewer DLC have added new rules to the game which have made the game into a confusing mess of strange rules. The other thing about the DLC's is that the newer ones cost one half of the original game. The gameplay is not something to be joyful about
Ehit's alright.
If you have both this and EU4 if you are going to pay for anything pay for the EU4 converter well worth it to form ireland in CK2 and then destroy everyone and become #1 colonial power in EU4. Now back to this amazing game. For my leader to become better at intrigue there was a set of events that came up. First a noblewoman and nobleman came to visit and my character noticed the nive necklace the noblewoman was wearing. I decided to steal it while she was asleep and then give it to a lowly peasant for him to take the blame. Now my character has better intrigue and a peasant is left to the will of my noble guest.  Great game well worth it.
Whoever wants to buy this game and doesnt own PC supra machine for at least 2000 dollars - dont!  Designers instead of improving performance of the game do the complete opposite: they add more and more useless stuff (like India) You play as a King of England in 9th century. Do you care what happens in RussiaSiberiaIndia? No? Too bad
Just a counter to some of the recent reviews.  It's probably the best strategy game I've ever played.  The fun is what you make of it. If you have a good imagination and like a challenge you'll get a lot more out of it.  It will keep you amused for hundreds of hours.  It was never 'half a game'. It's always been very much playable and enjoyable.  It's not a $280 game. For onebuy it on sale (it gets heavily discounted)but also you don't need every single bit of DLC to play.  Conclave isn't as bad as people make it out to be - it's actually a good balancing mechanic.  I *like* that they keep releasing DLC. I don't mind paying for it myself.
Once I finally grokked the mechanics of CKII I really got drawn in. Very cool and unique gaming experience. I would highly recommend giving it a tryespecially if the idea of combining RT strategy with a bit of role playing appeals to you. Granted the learning curve is a bit highand the built-in tutorials don't really do the game any favors. Rather than the built-in tutorials
This game used to be fun before they ruined it with Cossacks and the later DLC.
10/10 ... This game any Fan of History or the Strategy genre could want. I meanthe options are endless and it really formulates the backbone of how brilliant Paradox are in there orchestration of their game franchises. Bravoand can't wait for the new one.
I love this game.
boring
If you have a family leave themyou don't need them anymore. You gonna fuck yo cousins and kill kids to get to the top. You will suck fuck to get all the dlc. Pricey but worth it. incest is wincest/10
I have bought and refunded this game four different times and I can't find what makes it fun.  Edit: Bought it a 5th time and I fuckin' love it.
A fantastic entry into the Grand Strategy Genre that is unfortunutely being slowly eroded and destroyed by content updates containing completely untestedunbalanced and complete garbage features. The theme of these content updates seem to be 'upload them now and fix them later.'  Couple this in with fuckt DLC at exorbitant prices and you have a great game that has been turned to fuck. If you buy this game I suggest you set your game to the legacy versions pre-conclave update.
This is a game where you can easily spend 1h finding the most appropriate bride for your eldest son.  10/10
I plan to keep playing this game for a long time! It has a kind of steep learning curve on itbut once you get a handle on all the stuff it is a lot of fun. I love the generational aspect to itthat is a great feature that is actually the reason I bought the game. I can't wait for my life to settle down some so I have some more time to keep exploring this game.
Such a great game...I've spent waaay too many hours ruling the kindoms (R.I.P. my social life).
Great game... Sitting there taking over the Bengal Empire killing off small Duchies... Figure well hell how bad can a little bugger with 677 troops be?? Well concidering AI gains troops at 0 cost and can magically summon armies of 10k+ with 0 cost 0 mercs 0 holy orders and get a +100% reenforce rate with a teir 3 military tech value fighting gets touch and go at some points... :D still can not figure out how the fuck they do it but hell when you make 100+ a month speding 98.87 for 29k troops is not half bad... 10/10 would be confused fighting lesser duchies
Very political ... Very Complicated (Watch videosits not easy at all) ... Funny... Game. Its not action packed... wish the DLC would go on sale... It is Game of Thrones the game.    King Conan Petty kingdom of Mumu... almost becomes king of ireland... Maimed in battle dies of his wounds shortly after.   Rise king Vutch heir but his brother Clausewitz gets 50% of the realm... Clausewitz plots to kill his brother. The youngest Brother Lucilius becomes of age... is a great warrior and commander. Vutch promises his younger brother Lucilius the land of CLause witz... Vutches wife Queen of Oxford also brought her armies to the aid of Vutch. War is declared... Clausewitz is defeated and put in prison. Vutch &amp Luclius rule the realm in an alliance currently.   Vutch is having problems having a son.... the realm is at stake. Lucilius has no children either... The families bloodline is in question. King Conan also left a fuck son somewhere... his lustfulness... may come back to haunt the true heirs.   To be continued...
Love this game. HoweverI was not a huge fan of this game on release. In my opinion it requires most of the DLC's (the aztec one is really rather unimportant.). In its current state it is an absolute dream. You can play as any one of tens of thousands of characters from history and change history as them. The latest DlC's have also much expanded the Roleplaying element of the gamewhich is always great.
it's really good.  CK2:AGOT mod is awesome.  I gets to make many fucks w00t
This game is very historical (At least at the start) and anybody who likes commanding a nation would love this truely wondrous game.
Complicated but fun
This is a truly fascinating gameonce you get past the somewhat steep learning curve that is. Guide your family through the generationsbuilding your own kingdom and plotting the downfall of your rivals. Keeping your scheming vassals under control
simply remarkablefor those of love history or Game of Thrones xD aka (agot mod)
If you've ever loved a medieval conquest gamebut thought it too easy to be a kingthis is your game. You can start off as the poor
All the hours i have in this game is deciding who to play as.
Deep and immersive game.
This game is awesome. if you like RiskGame of ThronesStratagy games
One of my favorite gamesthe sheer hours I have loaded into this game. Now I know when most people see the amount of DLC for this game they can be a little turned offbut I still recommend you try it out. Most of DLC is cosmetic and you can pass but the bigger ones actually add gameplay.
One of the most well thought out games i've ever played. Love it!
It's ok.
Great game gets even better with Ck+!
One of my all time favorites. Combines storytellingroleplayingrng
This gameit is extremely time consumingand fun. But! You will need a lot of game time
Unique in style and gameplaycrusader kings lets you do stuff you cannot elsewhere. Such as inbreeding and plotting the murder of an entire family that has insulted your honour.
Time eater!
I executed my son because he looked too much like hitler.  11/10 would kill my son again
Even though there is a lot of DLC I wouldn't let that discourage you from trying this gamethe base game alone will keep you entertained for hundreds of hours if you like medieval stratergy games. Buying the DLC does add a lot more replayability if you get bored.
At firstthe mechanics (and the game itself) appears to be confusing. But give it a try and start a new game as an independent ruler in Ireland or as a vassal of a larger realm.   You will be able to understand the relationship between rulers and vassalsthe investments in technology and the marriage and warfare systems. After that you will be addicted and willing to further expand your domains by means of new casus belli
Great gamebut be warned it takes a lot of time to be even remotely acceptable at it. Butbelieve me when I say all the work is worth it once you murder your first child.
44844will have 5 kings on newbie Island murdered in 1 year again
When my friend showed me a picture of Crusader Kings II a few months agoI promptly told him I don't like itas I was never a fan of strategies
The best dynamic storytelling with lots of possibilities.
Great game . Crusader Kings II perectly shows medieval times. I like it !
At first the learning curve is ridiculousit'll take a minimum of 10 hours before you have any inkling what you're actually doingat around 20-30 hours you'll have a much better grasp and be enjoying yourself immesnley whilst learning more and more as a much reduced learning curve.  at this point for me
Started Crusader Kings 2. Played as a poor Count Assassinated Dukeand Duke's family Conquered Duchy Conquered surrounding Lands. Not allowed to play Republics: Game over.  Would lose because Republics again.
Crusader Kings II is an addicting game and well worth anyone's time and money. DLC is numerous and cost a ton overallbut it adds even more hours to the already great base game.
There's nothing more satisfying than being a Venetian Doge and spamming doomstacks of mercenaries against ragingterritory-hungry royalist scum with your endless funds and Freedom.
Married my daughter to to King of Fance. The moment she leaves my court she starts a plot to kill me. My wife approves of this! Told my wife to stop this nonsense and immediateley started to put the wheels in motion to get rid of her. Permanently.  10/10
I really like this game it's not too hard to learn and countless hours of entertainment
Minor Lord of no name province. Ambition to make Great Britaingreat again. Killed in my sleep by my demon child.  10/10 Realism 10/10 Blindsided by history 10/10 Repress the peasants
If you want to take over the world as an incest-lovingsatan-worshipping cult then this game is for you!
Huge amount of free modsinfinite replywhat's not to like?
Multiplayer is ridiculously unstable. It's a good game but don't buy it for the multiplayer.
Really good game. I just wish the declaring war system was more like the Europa Universalis system.
Amazing.   New updatenot so much.  Old versions are amazing. DEFINITELY buy the old gods DLC and legacy of rome-those are SUPER fun.   What's not fun? Spending 450 gold assassinating your non-genius sons.   Wellthat's what looting is for! XD
For me it just seemed like a toned down version of Civ:V upon opening. (opening sequence took forever to load) Might give it a try again at a later date.
As I played this game more and more I became more willing to subject my family to cruelties in order to further the goals of my dynasty. My descent into darkness was complete when I started an euthanization program so that all my heirs would have the genius or attractive trait.  I love this game so much. 10/5.
Made myself Doge of Venice. Youngnewly marriedwith a bright future. My wife is soon pregnant
Proof positive that I'm not as moral as I thought I was.
Erik the Heathen of Swedenneat alright lets become king because that filthy Catholic king Stenkiling is not truly king capture much land for Sweden become Commander for all of Sweden hold Great Blots where I have many human sacrifices from my prison attempt to take the throne realize i can't attack the king since he is married to my filthy catholic half-sister assassinate my half-sister the king dies convenientlycausing Sweden to lose it's allies new king is some 20-something loser that I annihilate with my Pagan allies sit on the sweet new throne of Sweden as a true viking lord realize Norge is a bit miffed at me being pagan Norge attacks me on the basis of Holy War with his buddy France Hey
Best game I have ever played. Hands down.
pretty good
Was playing a multi player game with two of my friends. One friend started complaining about how much his king sucked and couldn't wait for him to die so I quietly started a plot to kill his king. A little while longer he yells 'Oh wowsomeone assassinated my king' in which I repliedYou're welcome'. He has never trusted me again.  10/10 would assassinate again.
Amazing paradox gamemy favorite &lt3
This game is amazingespecially with modsbut I am seriously annoyed that I can no longer play the game... if you wish to know what has happened the game itself will not load
Get Maried as a count then get killed by your child because he wants power   11/10 would get killed by my child agian
Don't let my playtime fool youI've sunk many more hours in this than is recoreded (Offline Play)  This game lets you follow a dynasty fromdepending if you have dlc
This game is amazingwith depth you just don't find elsewhere. The learning curve is dauntingbut stick with it and watch the great video tutorial series produced by Arumba on YouTube. It will all become clear.  Treat yourself. You too can have your 19 year old wife die of syphilis and make The Pope mad when your dad gets caught assassinating a bishop for you.
By far and away the best and most detailed politics sim out there with a near obsessive attention to detail.   After several years still my go-to game when I want to flex my imperialist muscles and plot the downfall of my neighbours.
Great game. Don't buy it unless you plan on buying the DLC s as well. It's fuck?? without 70% of them
I love this game. There is enough depth to keep the game fresh forever.
Like Game of Thrones? There's a mod for thatbut pretty much plays as GoT in a historical setting. Amazing game. Micromanage everything. Intrigue options. Play how you want to. Marry off your sons to old widows so they can't complain or have children to rival your chosen heir. Kiss the Popes . Have affairs with your son's wife. Assassinate the King of Francebecause F France. Merge 2 countries that don't belong together culturally. Amazing game.
fun with friendstry using a kingdom with others as vassals #elective monarchy
The Non-Aggression Pact between Ansur Venigomez and Eneko de Haro has been desolved as they no longer have any marriage ties.  You have 18+ other messages of the same ilk. Tomorrowyou'll have another dozen before breakfast. This is my one and only complaint.
Pretty good. Pretty pretty pretty good
its 2016 get a window mode.
Enjoyable gamebut you can spend a lot of time making decisions and forget to keep the game moving along. The DLC's certainly add to the depth of the charactersand the mods are fun to experiment with.
Very easy to lose track of timeextremely engaging.
I like this game. I enjoy it. I always love to play pardox games.
Married my cousin Plotted to kill my brother  Imprisoned my son's (all 3 of them) while waiting for a daughter heir Then got killed by my sister   10/10 would be a tyrant again
My First game went as could be expeted:  I began my lineage as the 'Earl Osulf of Northumbria'. A small landholder in northern England. With this Being 1066there are 2 invasions taking placethe Norse Invasion and The Norman invasion. As I was nice and safe in the north I began plotting my rise to the top. Starting with me leige
Love history and have a secret love of well written drama? Strange humour and situations amuse you? This might very well be the game for you.
Okay so this is how it goes... I was petty king of mumu in Irland. I some how got my daughter married to the empire of romes son!we became allies and he won like 3 wars for me! he broke our alliance because my daughter died (selfish prick) and so i had no relatives in his family. Later on the i managed to take 3/4 of irland land and things were going pretty well! Until some prick of a vessal managed to get a faction against me turned the other 1/4 or irlands people on me so i was facing a full on 4v1 battle! I managed to kill 2 of them off but it left 2 more petty kings left. in that short period that had pretty much killed memy dynasty was all over the place and i couldnt handle getting chain whipped by my son who hated me so i resigned and now have to start all over. So yeah pretty good game.
One of the bestengrossing gaming experiences you will ever find. I have put in over 350 hours into this bad boy with good reason!
The only thing better than crushing my foes with strength of arms is ..... conquering the world through diplomacy! Diplomacy isafter allwar by other means. Struggle to manage your dynasty through bitter setbacks and treacherous progress.   I love 4X games but
Super fun medieval politics simulator. Howeverdon't try to learn via the tutorial. You need to actually find a long tutorial on YouTubeit's that complicated. However
This game is incredible. It is a difficulthistorical dynasty simulatorwhere you steer your family to fame and fortune in an unstable and war-torn Europe. Experience fratricide
one of best strategy game i ever played. first you have to raise to power from no one to someone.  -From count to duke - Plot to fabricate the kingdom for yourself - Join one of the faction in the kingdom to seek help from other duke - Plot to kill the king's heir or you can plot to kill the king himself - The king is dead long live the king - Once the king's weaker than you. get ready to take arms! - Present ultimatum to yur king - Taddaaaa.. you got civil war (or if you lucky enoughking will abdicate to you) - Win the war bruhh.. *viva la vida is playing* - And the crown is yours for the taken - Beware of your kingdom claimant (advice : kill them) :) - The Pope/Caliph called for great holy war!!! (crusade/jihad) - Prepare yourself you grace. the real game is just about to begin.. - Deus Vult!!!  And that my friend thats how my dynasty claim the crown of England :D
Probably one of the most enjoyable strategy games i've played in a while. While it may have a rather steep learning curve that can be solved relatively easily with the use of console commanding gold and prestige until you're comfortable enough to take the training wheels off. In my eyes it's a lot easier than EU4 and easier to understand and i just enjoy the rpg aspects of the gamealso trying for generations to breed the perfect heirs is pretty darn fun if i have to admit.   If you're going to play and are a fan of Game of Thrones i highly recommend the GoT conversion mod for this game around 100 or so hours of my time have been a result of that mod in particular. I hope this was helpful and don't get discouraged by the menus and mechanics it's a lot less scary than it seems.
10/10. Picked up CK II on the recent Steam saleowned CK I previously. I am blown away. The gameplay and graphics are so much better.  Before you buy a Paradox gameunderstand what you're getting into. There's so much to know
I am going to take my review into a slightly different direction. I will be giving my impressions from a roleplay perspective. The scope in which you can play over and over game is directed by the characters trait systemeach character can be tailored to a different playstyle whether you are a gluttonous lunatic or a honorableattractive dwarf. You can break your character down most simply into two types honourable or decieptful. You can lead by example
Great game.
Decide to focus on building the kingdom of ireland Start out strongplay two generations of well-liked dukes who bolster my economy Playing as original duke's grandson For some reason choose to fuck all my hard work over the coals Anger my brother by taking his land for no reason Have him killedeveryone knows it was me His 3 10-year-old daughters become my rivals Have them all killed in turn
10/10 would execute everyone again.
Plays AGOT :  Goes as house Dayne in war of nine penny kings. Character dies after a few years. New character(heir) can arrest wife for plotting against him. Does so . Holds trial. She demands Trial by combatHer champion is our son. Im sad. I choose a champion with less Duel-score. My one winsso my son died defending his evil mother :(. new heir is the brother of Arthur Dayne . My other son is killed in war. I die. My heir dies for some reason (I got him killed) Arthur Dayne truns 16 now and is the leader of the Torrentine. He(me) becomes Sword of the morning and a great leader. I start claiming lands as quikcly as possible. Other rebellions start
Great game and enjoyable defenitly recommend it! But i do have one issue i can't seem to join any of the multiplayer servers i just get kicked when i join any help?????
Edited: I'm leaving my original review below this new one as it shows my first impressions. However this new post covers my thoughts having learned to play it.  So this game is worth buying if you like micro managmentkeeping track of dynasty and bloodlinesmaking sure your own family is kept in check as you slowly march through history in a attempt to re write said history. For me
Lots of time consuming fun!
If you like strategy this game is amazing. This game is more person centric where the managment is interpersonal relations. Which is way more fun that it sounds. If you are more interested in country on country battles then try Europa Universalis.    Pro: Like Civ with emgergent story telling. Simply fantastic. Makes history fun.  Con: Hard to learn. Suck up your time.
Crusader Kings 2 is a rather interesting experience of a game. Unlike pretty much every other game I've seennot only does being a heartless sociopath not always get you punishedit's pretty much required at some points. Of course
This game allows you the freedom to pick any ruler from the timeline of the game and take the dynasty through the ups and downs of the period in pausable real-time grand strategy. Different religions and cultures allow for a wide variety of gameplay styles. Its challenging and you can play as much or as little as you want in a session and you will still get something out of it that will make you smile. This game focuses on character interactions as much as warfare and you will need to balance the two to be a successful ruler.  I will admit it is not the easiest game to understand at first and the vast amount of DLC can put people offbut if you purchase this game in a sale and invest some time you will really enjoy this game and keep coming back to it.
If you are interested at all in Medieval history this game is great fun
Great gameactually my favorite game from Paradox. Don't listen to all of the negative reviewsyou don't have to buy the DLC to enjoy the base game. Although I would recommend getting the culture portrait packs. 1000+ HRS invested into this game and I still find it enjoyable to play it and they're constantly updating it. 100% replayability. There is a Game of Thrones mod
This game isn't for everyone. It requires a big time investment even to learn how to play it. But once you get over that initial hurdle this is one of the most interesting strategy games I've ever played.
I tried to write morebut it makes the game seem more confusing and crazy than it actually is.  Ill just point these 3 things out:  -Without mods the replay value is vastwith mods however
You can marry your daughter to your cousin. 10/10
I like this game
Would play this homicide + eugenics + incest simulator again! Throwing little kids into the dungeons never gets old.
It is astounishing how this game handles the random event. If you are a novel writer who are depleted of idea. Not to worrysit down and play this game and the inspiration will come to you. Let's be honestsome of the randomly generated character interation are way better than the script of any of the latest Assassin's creed.
Its better than shagging your fuck with a jaggy stick.
Paradox created one of the best base vanilla campaign-esque games I've ever played. I would say I've played CK2 every way imagineablebut I'm still finding new ways to play. I highly recommend it for roleplayers as well. I have lost so many hours of my life roleplaying in my head while playing. Yesthere is an overwhelming amount of DLC. Yes
YoloShemp and Jazzhands have become family names.
Awesome game if you have time &amp patience - wish I had more time!
This is the kind of game that epitomizes the PC master race.   You will never find this game on a consolenot only because it would be a nightmare to control it without a mousebut because even the mightiest of Google supercomputers will collapse under the sheer overload of keeping track of your confusing family tree.
So this review used to be positive. I used to love this game. I've spent countless of hours playing it and having fun and now that's not possible anymore. Why you say? Performance issuesa ton of them. The developer team has continously ignored the request of fans to get some optimizations. Answering their posts on the forum is not the same as fixing the problem.  And so on to the second reason. It has become evident to me that the skilled designers are no longer working on this game. With new games such as Stellaris and Hearts of Iron 4 being Paradoxes priority they have unfortunately let this game into the hands of incompetent people. They have left it to die. Perhaps there is a crusader kings 3 that I don't know about and they are simply trying to keep milking the 'greatest' medieval game some more without any effort.  This brings us to my third reason. The milking. Instead of creating content with real valuewe get empty filler content like the black plague. Something that was already in the game
1 person found this review funny
1
became king of wales had four kids - a btardtwin boysa girl made btard a small lord as he had some good stats  twin boys squabbled over petty stuff - called them bob and rich married the girl to english king to cement alliance i die  immediately quit the game
Who needs Europe when you have Westeros to conquer.
One of the best games ever. I have burned up so much time.
one time i played 500 hours of crusader kings 2 in one summer  it's fun
Everyone starts in Ireland. I've had a pretty good run for my first game. The first earlbecame a duke of four counties before dying and leaving the Duchy of Mide to his skillless son. He turned out to be pretty smart toodespite the stats. He had the highest piety
I was really excited to play this gamebut was very dissapointed. Tutorials would not work correctly and wouldn't let me past Tutorial 1 page 4. I tried to learn the game while playing but it didn't make any sense to me at all.
Killed my wife because she turned out to be a lesbian that got some STDs from banging other random womensmothered my 2 year old grandsom with a pillow to make sure there wouldn't be any succession troubles further down the lineand abducted the king to claim his crown. Then I ransomed him away for 150 bucks which I used to throw a massive feast that made me a depressed drunkard and gave me a crippling
The game crashes on launch to many times for me to be able to recommend it. But other than that its a good game if you're looking to sink some hours into somthingAnd if your a fan of in depth diplomacy im sure you'll get a kick out of it.
-Play this game -Got full mark on history class 11/10
Excellent game lots of replay value!
I dont usually do reviews but this game at this moment is so ridiculous it has made me write a review rant. So first off this is one of my favourite games... Or it used to be. Somewhere along the line paradox thought of an ingenious plan to harvest money out of their loyal fans. Albeit you dont need to buy the newest dlcs but the dlcs just DO NOT WORK ON ITS OWN!!!! So thus they are forced to release patches into the CORE game to help the TERRIBLE dlcs make sense and work IN A ALREADY BEATIFUL MASTERPIECE and now the results is they literally fucked up the game by trying to make the game work with their very depressing dlcs that I and many other suspect is some paradox devs retirement fund. Making dlcs that add NOTHING but only change MANY aspects of the game is NOT A fuckING DLC AT MOST ITS A fuck?? PATCH!!! So excuse my language but summary they seem to be abandoning CKII and EUIV and making the last bit of cash they can on the two games with what i feel little to no effort on them actually creating decent dlcs. I actually thought they were a good company but... I was wrong again. Have fun fighting 6 rebellions and the Abbassid Empire while youre ruler yolos and dies for a several generationswith their heirs and children in general always getting a negative traits whilsts also suffering 10-20 negative event panels and vassals even with content trait start fabricating a claim on one of your  cheeks. Oh and btw winning is overated so lets give the enemy army random buffs with 5k soldiers fighting 5k soldiers should be an even fight ehhh? No fuck you youre gonna fight 7k now! Thats right! For free dollars were gonna have enemy numbers skyrocket by 2k during the fight for no reasons at all! If you act now and defeat them no worries theyre going to return with more than they started! Yes i know right?! Happy times oh happy Paradox times.
A fascinating grand strategy about poloticsreligionbackstabbing
One of the best games I have ever played! Took me a while to understand its workings but I find that games with a steep learning curve usually have good longevity.
Where to begin? Amazing game with amazing gameplay.  PROS:  -Good (and replayable) gameplay -See your family grow for generations -Sleep with other peoples wives -Cheap DLC -All around good game -Amazing mod community with MANY amazing mods on and off Steam  CONS:  -Some DLC should be in the game already -Multiplayer De-Sync should be fixed by now -Have to learn the keys on your own (or online)  FINAL:  I would give this game a 9/10 just because of how much fun it is with and without friendo's. Get this game if you are into managment type games on a deeper level. Just don't get this if you are expecting a Total War experience when it comes to battles.
There's a Game of Thrones mod! Conquer Westeros!  Very cool
Kill the women. fuck the churches.
Crusader Kings II is brilliantly deep and complexthis can make it intimidating for newcomers and the tutorial really doesnt help enough. Its also important to understand this isnt a Total War gamecombat is very basic and really isnt particularly interesting. This game is more about character traits
So I've owned this game for a couple years and have played it a lotso I thought it was finally time to write a review.  I love this game. Basicallyyou choose any medieval fief from among hundreds
This game condones the killing of muslims
Ahh Crusader kings what a game where to start. to start it has mix of sandbox strategy and its historical so that cool! you can rewrite history the way you want. form kingdoms and empires! reform old religions! there lots to do in this game. so i do recommend this game if you like this sort of game.
Married my inbred cousin who's parents I murdered to inherit their duchy.  11/10
Finally finished up with the tutorialthe game is alright I guess.
Played as a Duke of Apuliaalmost reformed Sicilyallied with the Most Serene Doge
i haven't played this game for an hour and haven't even done anything and have no idea what i am doingbut i conqoured something and had lots of fun with my friend so yeah good game
A good game if you're willing to sink the money into the DLCother wise its okay at best. As far as the DLC goesthere's a large amount and a fair bit is just cosmetic.  A solid 8/10 with DLC
Would pay thugs to shove the Emperor into a bagthen execute him to become Emperor again44844
Steep learning curvebut it's a glorious day when this game starts making sense to you. Don't expect everything to go smoothly. You'll deal with many crises. But It's deeply rewarding start as a humble dukeincrease your prestige and power over time
Excellent role-playing grand strategy game. A fairly steep learning curveespecially those new to the genre.   The 'role playing' bit is limited in scope. It is a grand strategy gamefirst and foremost. I prefer Paradox's other titles over this one
One of my favorite games. if you are like me and enjoy lineage building gameswhere building families and running a kingdom can be a problem then this is your game. i have enjoyed every game that i have played by Paradoxthey really know thier stuff. not one have i run into the same issues while playing through and the game is so in depth that i don't think i have come close to taking over the world once yet. the best i've done is take over Ireland or England :). i've sat back and run my kingdom for 200+ years watching person after person in my original family have children and die off. And i enjoy it very much so. trying to keep an hier and make sure things run smoothly. the battle system is simple and very easy to understand. the economy part on the other hand not so much
Amazing Grand Strategy gameover 1200 hours playedgoing to be many more with the brand new expansion. Playtime speaks for itself
Crusader Kings 2 is an extremely fun strategy game. There really is no goal except to earn achievements with iron man mode. Going on crusades is difficult sometimes and that is purposefulonly a single crusade in one of my games has succeeded out of like 6. One of the problems Is that some of the DLC is necessary for a much better time. Alsocivil wars are sometimes extremely powerful
I've played this game far more than could be considered healthy. You have to take some time to get a handle on the mechanisms of the gameespecially combat. But once you dothe world is at your feat. I've always wanted to be the king of Andalusia or the Emperor of Italy. And now I can
Pros:  -Good for roleplay  -Reasonably good strategy-wisewith large reverses common (both for good or bad)  -Extremely replayable (espcially with DLCthough the DLC mostly opens new types of characters to play
I really need to write my dissertation but steam sale just make me spends last 35 hours as Duchy of Tuscany. 10/10
Why you should buy Crusader Kings II  -CK II is not your ordinary strategy game like Civilization or Endless Space. You play as an individual leading a nation instead of the nation itself.  ---This means that you have a dynamic game in which you can 'game of thrones' the ckii and secure lands without declaring war.  -CKIIPlus (Mod) expands the game dramatically and gives more depth to your empire such as coronationspolitical factions (More than succession factions) that you can use to your benefitand an improved pre-1066 religion system for Europe.  -CK II has been patched to where it isn't the same game as it was on release. There are bad things such as defensive pacts but these can be removed with modding.  -CK II mods besides CKIIPlus can have you play as a one living in a galactic empire
Greatin-depth strategy game that will bring many hours of fun once you overcome the steep learning curvestick with it and watch a few videos if you find yourself struggling early on.
I have no idea what I am doing.....
Playing CK2 plus  plays with friend. Surprised at how much of a tyrant I am. Still becomes my ally. Fabricates a claim on rome. I'm in Italy. My king dies and we all join this huge empire. They give me to the pope as the paple states. So I go to war against the pope for rome. Excommunicates me. Takes rome. That huge empire declires war on me. My friend and I go to war with huge empire ready to die. I have 54 marshal. IN battle i dule the emporor and I'm like 50. I kill him. Their army routs. We win. Then another empire goes to war against us. We quite.  10/10 would get fucked again
Such an epic game in every sense of the word. You really feel like your dynasty matters and end up emotionally invested in each save!
My son went to join the Varangian Guard in Byzantium. He came back many years later castrated and blinded.
great game although still confusing after 100 hours of play. many of it was the game left on accidentally though
It is pretty gwape
Okay. I've played a little bit of this gameand will continue to play itbut I have to get this out here. First of all
This game is okay without modsits good with mods and its great with some of the DLC.
this game is aweomse !! fantastic i luv it
This is one of my favourite games that I play. It's build solid-ly (just made that word up to add some jazziness (made that one up too)) and I don't recall encountering a damaging bug at allyes there are a few hiccups every now and then but nothing too bad. If you buy this game you're getting a lot more content than what the base game included at release. Each DLC releasestuff' is added to the base game like a few new features and extra stability.  Also
Step one of the game:- find a tutorial on youtube and sit through the 2 hours of videos explaining how to play and use the ui....   It is not an easy game and the ui is very difficult to navigate. The tutorial is pretty much non existant and your often left wondering what to do or how to achive your goal.   Saying all that once you know how to play the game is a lot of fun and you end up in some odd and crazy situations. If your playing this game prepare to play for the long game you will play though sevral genarations of the same family and at some point you will be screwed over. You will be murded and your brother will try to steal your crown.   The graphics are nothing amazing and it has a total war feel about it (with the exception of combat as this game does not have rts battlefield gameplay)  This game is full of funny moments and is better to play with freinds. I really did enjoy it although i really think the ui needs work and a lot of the game needs explaining.   It is another time sinkexpect to lose sevral hours of your life to this game and feel like you didnt achieve very much
It was initally hard to get into. This game is extremely complex with a lot of different systems at play. I started playing again the last couple of weeks and can't stop. It's evolved into a really interesting game. I've invested in all of the dlc (except the music) and can gladly say they are all great (except maybe conclave and that aztec invasion one). Conclave broke the game for me. It was just not fun anymore. They might update it down the road (fingers crossed). In the meantimepick-up the vanilla version of CK2 and all of the major dlc. It's totally worth it. The sprite packs and picture packs do add immersion. I'd say that a new player could probably skip the music dlc. You can easily add your own music.
Very good game. Only downside is that there is a lot of DLC to get a full experiance. Otherwise a good game to play.
One of my favourite games of all timeby far the best strategy game I've ever playedalong with the other paradox games. If you like strategy
it's good
Valar morghulis  (This Review is mainly based on my experiences playing the Game of Thrones mod for Crusader Kings 2. The key mechanics are the same with some differences here and there to create an authentic experience of Geroge R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire)   When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. This is how long it seems to take until a GoT game is madethat satisfies our lust for adventureepic wars and the great history of Westeros and Essos. And these were also exactly my thoughts until i bought Crusader Kings 2 and started to play the GoT mod. After that I came to the realisation: We already have the perfect game.  Well maybe not entirely perfect. First of all
I have played this game longer than any other on my Steam profile and just love it! I have every DLC except the E-bookssome soundtracks and the scourge called Conclave. I would definitely recommend buying this game and not just the vanilabut the whole Crusader Kings 2 Collection
Real bantermarried my cousin then fucked her sistersick game
An engaging game where a lot of the fun I had was to make up my own storylines and roleplay with the traits a bit.
Huge fanParadox is pretty awesome. I love reforming Germanic Paganism and marauding all over Europe.
To say the learning curve is steep would be a lieit's a cliffand the game throws you over constantly. That said
My favourite Paradox Interactive gameCK2 utilizes the Clausewitz engine to beautifully realise the intricacies of being a king and show you how to plot to kill your closest friends.
Deus VultInsha'allahby Mjölnir doesn't matter. I just love conquesting.
Crusader Kings II brings innovation to the grand strategy genre through its hyper-realistic strategy simulation: the do nothing and fast forward. Be prepared to do nothing and fast forward through the entire game. This is how strategy was meant to be played. This game is not for your regular gamer who enjoys fast paced thoughtless shoot em ups. This is for the casuals and the house wives who don't really have much time to play the game. They are content with watching the game play out for them.
Royal family incest simulator with hot excommunication action
The sheerinsane number of utterly ruthless things you can do make this game for me. I was put off at first because I couldn't work out how to playlet alone win. I finally learned to start as the lower county in Ireland
This is the best game everthere is so much gaming hours that can be put into it. there is so much warincest
Love the details in Paradox Games
THIS... is a HELL of a game. I still honestly barely have a clue how to play it though.
This Paradox grand strategy has more depth than any otherat least diplomatically.  Managing a title (whether it be a simple county or a large kingdom) in the dark-medieval ages gives one of the most addicting experiences in the grand strategy genre. You can really invest yourself in your dynastyexpanding it large enough that even your kin become foe. The strategy lies in your court
Just look at the hours I've spent. CK2 has a steep learning curvebut once you master itit will suck away all of your free time
This used to be a good gameI have *some* downloads for it but have read so much negativity about new DLC that there seems to be a clear theme - Paradoxstop breaking your own games with relatively pointless updates.  If you buy the VANILLA game mechanic (and all the extra songs / flags / faces you want)
I have played this game for countless hours and it still does not seem to end amaze me. It's an absolute gem for history buffs and especially for those who love to think of alternative history. The second installment is such a huge improvement on the firstbut holds all the key elements that make this game so amazing. Biggest props to the team at Paradox in Swedenyou are the best
fuckin' awesomea grand-strategy masterpiece. Great for weekend binging!
For meits the best Paradox Strategy game. Interesting Dynesty System let me get more into the gamethan into EU.  Bad Fighting and Troop Recruiting. Confusing and unlogic economy. Like i said
Basically a hardcore and mostly historically accurate version of the overworld in Total War
Crusader Kings 2 i found a little confronting to begin withhowever as i learned to manage my vasselslands
Since conclave the game is onplayble!!!
One of the greatest games i've ever playedthat simple.
10/10 would waste hours of my life while simultaneously learning how fragile and quick even a full life can be again
This game is just a little addicting. There are no real set goals or targets for you to achieve in the gameonly the ones you set yourself. It's up to you if you want to start as an emperor and conquer the world or start as a meagre count and forge a new empire of your own. Crusader Kings II is a hard game to learn to play (the tutorial is very basic and not especially helpful)but there are plenty of gameplay videos on Youtube where experienced players explain the intricacies of the game's mechanics. I'd particularly recommend Arumba.  If you enjoy strategy games and have an interest in Dark Age/Medieval history I'd highly encourage you to buy this game. Just bear in mind it will take you a long time to learn how to play effectively!
Game of Thrones sandbox only with You caught in the middle of it.  Complex. Glorious and Bloody as ****
Mehnot great
This game is awesome. Why? It focuses on the choices you makeon how you run your territoriesand how you spend your old man years becoming a focal point for all the combined hate of an entire realm so you can set up your children's future as Kings
it was ok until it disappeared from my library
+Loads of realistic content to this game  +True events that CAN play out throughout your rule +Hilarious circumstances that somewhat questions your own sanity  +You're drawn in with each character as your goal  is to ensure the survival of your familys dynasty +Hours of fun and over 100 Steam achievements +DLCs have promisedepending on what you fancy-  but wait for them to be on sale +Mods such as Game of Thrones (amazing!) is available to download +Worth the $40USand usually on sale every month +I've recommended this game to everyone-even my mother  - As there is lots of content
Super complexvaried and 'fun' medieval aristocratic simulation complexity - 10/10 Instruction for what the hell you are doing - 1/10  My inital review for this game was negative......but after 78 hours of gameplay I am beginning to get a better grasp of the complex web of cause and effect in this game.  This game require A LOT of patience to learnthe tutorials are ok as far as they go but only explain about 10% of what's going on. If you buy this you will think it is cool for the first hour
Really good. Playing as a minor character such as a count and then turning watching your entire dynasty progress and become kings and emperors is really fun. I would recommend this game for people who are into A Game Of Thrones because it suits the ideal of AGOT and you can mod the game tonreach your personal requirements. Buy it if you can. Enjoy if you do.
I think I might actually be addicted. And I love it.
One of the few truly fantastic games out there
This game is the Bee's knees.
One of my all time favourite games. The only thing that would make it better is incorporating more role play elements like making the spy elements a little more interesting... give the player more control of their actions and let that fire off an event. Current spy actions are a bit inane and hit or miss. Add a castle/palace building element that you can invest in and get extra abilities (kind of like what The Guild did with their buildings). The modding community is great and goes a long way to adding interesting twists to the game but I wish some these could be incorporated into the base game. Also having to fork out £10 every time a DLC comes out just to get more features that should've been released with the game is a bit annoying.   I also think it's time that Paradox start looking at CK3 now and stop trying to milk us for new features for CK2. How awesome would this game be as an RPG first person?!?!  Can't recommend it enough00/10 :)
Backstab your friendsmurder children and become your son when you die.
I am someone who gets bored of a game very easily. Getting over 50 hours in a game is rare for mebut this one is 200+ and going strong. I don't see myself getting bored of it anytime soon.  The basegame is goldand DLCs give so much more for it.   I mean
I crucified a guy's entire family after he murdered my daughter.
It's a really good game with a lot of optionstherefore a lot of possible gameplays. It might be a little long and complicated to earn vasts landsbut I think it simply adds to the challenge!
Excellent game. Unlimited amount of replayability.
Slow learning curve but once you get startedit is hard to shut off.
438 hoursnot one achevment.... DAME YOU MODDING COMMUNITY
Complex strategy at its best.
Used to love this gamenow i feel really frustrated everytime i try to play it thanks to the horrible DLC politic of Paradox.
Games varying from reforging a Catholic Roman Empire from the ERE and simultaneously fending off an Aztec invasion and the Golden Hoardto raiding the entirety of Europe for hundreds of years and sacrificing the Pope as a pagan vikingto getting absolutely roflstomped by Byzantine doomstacks within the first year of a game as Venice
This game has its ups and downs but over all it is rather good. However you can largly skip any DLC that you dont directly want.
1. Started as a small Norse Duchy 2. Take over half of Scotland 3. Attack tiny county in Wales 4. Find out that that 'tiny county' was allied with West FranciaAquitaineand Navarra. 5. I continue to attack and get a 99% victory 6. Get destroyed by the allied kingdoms. 7. Character dies of old age and land gets split between greedy sons.  Great Game!
This game is just amerzing
Years of inbreeding havent yet caught up HA!!!!
After playing this game for 464 hours I believe it suffices to say that I love this game. In one play through I united the most glorious Russian Empire and conquered the dirty Europeans. To do this I murdered familyfriendswives
My playtime says a lot.  Control a medieval dynasty in order to rule Europe and Asia Minor.  Very fun and addicting. Character and family events are varied but once you've played for awhileyou get to know them all quite well.  With some imagination you can get yourself and your family members into some pretty wacky situations! Brothers and sisters having children (watch out for that Inbred malus)! Sons killing meddling mothers! It's all here!
Best game out there.
the best strategy ever.the end.
Medieval European Dynastic simulations. Steep learning curve.
Overly complex political simulator with terrible combat. Naturallyit's an amazing game and dangerous time sink.
Screenshots of this game make it look like some kind of medieval geography lesson but don't let that put you off! If you're a fan of strategy games this needs to be in your library ASAP. The mechanics can be a little overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it you'll be plottingmurdering and invading your way to greatness.  There is one problem with this game however: DLC. Seems like the developers just kept adding more features and slapping ridiculous pricetags on them. Give them a shot if you want to expand your gameplay but it's probably best to pick and choose the ones you want otherwise you could end up spending over £100 on the damn things(that's not including the £30 for THE ACTUAL GAME).
If you like Game of Thrones and strategy gamesthis is a great pickup. It's really fun to play and you'll learn even more about Game of Thrones the more you play. Also great fun with friends in multiplayer.  Overall 9 /10
So many good things to say about this game..   Long story short: Must BUY and an AMAZING game!
Just buy it dude. you want more info see review above &amp below.
This is in my opinion the second best Paradox title everjust behind Victoria 2. That saidit is also quite different from other titles. Imagine this is a historicla Game of Thrones
Great Game!
Very Nice!!!
I am literally only writing this review to get a steam badgebut you knowit's a good game as well
Started as Duke of Spoleto. Became king of Lombardy thank's to a elective monarchy revolt.  Three generations of my family have died whilst fighting against against Mauretania. I've now finally conquered Tunis. Declared war against Serbia thinking it whould be easy. They call in PolandAvariaHungary and Bohemia. I get wrecked.  11/10 Whould get wrecked by LUCKY Serbia again.
Its a good. but it sucks if you dont have dlc
If you love Riskyou'll love CK2. My only gripe is how much the DLCs costand how many there are.
Game of Thrones the game. Nogh said. It's that awesome!
I challenge any and all of you to beat my court's enviable collection of inbred dwarfs! I breed them for sport!
great game
A haiku summing up my feels on CKII:  So much potential My kingdom will never fall Oh wait... gavelkind.  (10/10 would divert civil war through fratricide again)
I don't really know what to do besides having fucks...
If you get to the stage where you have played 500 hoursyou might...just might about have a grasp on how the game works.
This is quite possibly the best game on steam.  Its hard to play and learnbut once you get itit rewards 10 fold.  Ive been a tyrant and slept with all my vassals wives
Compared to some people I'm still new to this but I think I can say its a great game... however being a cheap fuck I'd say wait for a sale or get someone to gift it to you
Quality game. Much modding ability. Much fun. Many hours of replayability. Protip: Stay away from Mongol Hordes.
Attempted to restore the Roman Empire as the Byzantines.  Failed exactly as hard as they did irl.   11/10 would incest again
an amaizing game I highly recomendthough if you dont get the dlc in bundles it can get quite expensive. Though it is very much worth the price
Vikings French Byzantines Muslims And aztecs  All share a border with eachother   10/10
Fun game takes awhile to learnI just started gettiing the basics down.
Great game with infinite possibilities. I like it!
SOS. Please help me.
the only time i get to bang all 4 of my sistersmy neighbors daughtersand my son and get away with it. 10/10
Huge! Sophisticated! Profound... really not a game for beginnersbut after some hours of testing it is real fun!
Great gameminus the occasional crash when you start it up.
Conclave sucks fuck just give up fam
Best strategy game i've ever played. 100% recommend purchasinghowever be prepared for the usual Paradox Interactive bug fest every time a DLC is released...
Never before have I played a game that makes infanticide such a useful tool to achieve your goals!
Bought this cause i liked total warand generally enjoyed politcal sciences.... So i sat down and played the 'How To' missionsafter that i still had no real idea How...to...not die
( ?° ?? ?°)
Edit 2016--All of the below applied 2 years agobut DLC hell never stops. Boycott this BS  Original Review 2014--  Don't let the steam hours fool youI've put at least 1000 hours into this game on the old Gamersgate version
Becomes incapable fighting someone i know is trying to kill mepoops in tubgets drowned in tub of poop 10/10
Ya knowthinking back 2 years agomy Islamic Caliph that ruled over from Morroco to India was a homosexual... now think about the S*** storm in the Middle East today and let these two sink in for a while...
I can't help but to recommend this game to people who likes strategy gamesespecially grand strategy games.   The main fun of the game comes from how you try to keep your dynasty intact for years to comeovercoming both internal and external threats which may or may not
The game itself is goodlots of achievementslots of possibilities
Spent way too much of my time playing this. Love it.
Mostly playing the AGoT Mod but the whole game is just AAA.  Playing a new little House in Westeros Decided to attack my liege My Sister-Wife kills my only heir from another wife I get imprisoned and killed by my liege Game Over 10/10 everytime!
I love this wonderful game but it has some down sides such as having to put on a special gamemode to get achivementsan empty steam walletand a gmail full of norwegian streamers.
I got this game. Played it once. Had no idea what im doing. Left it for 2 months. Then it consumed my life.
One of the best Paradox games there is.
50 hours in less than a week should give you an indication of how much I enjoy this game. That doesn't include the many hours I have spent on the internet learning about the many parts of the game. The detail is absolutely staggering. I don't remember being this addicted to a game since Final Fantasy 7 in '95.  I spent a good 2-3 hours watching online tutorials. Paradox makes an amazing grand strategy gamebut there is a steep learning curve for newcomers. I reccomend watching tutorials onlineas well as starting in Ireland for your first game.  Start small as a count
Tony sucks at this gameHe thinks hes the best but he actually sucks.
Now I can finally live out my fantasy of killing children and seducing family members!
Crusader Kings II is amazing dynasty game.
Probably the most addictive game I have ever played. I can't even enjoy other strategy games anymorethey simply don't have anywhere near the depth. Civ V feels like a kiddie game to me now.   If you want other strategy games to be completely ruined for the rest of your lifebuy this game.
This is basically the Herny VIII simulator. And is increddibly fun. Unlike other Paradox grand strategy games you controll the head of a dynasty not a country or empire (With RPG elements.). Obviously your character can become all thesse things but you are not always the leader of your realmwhich can be super fun. The DLCs add a lot (look to pick them up on sale.). You have to deal with everyday buisness of your court and the people within it. Your brother wants to kill you? Wellkill him harder. I all around recomend this game!
Gameplay 8/10 Atmosphere 8/10 Music 8/10 Graphics 8/10 Replayability 9/10  Overall 8/10  Good game from paradox.
Almost 500 hours in and I still find news ways to ruin my family.
Very Good Immersive game
The ultimate Kill-her-husband-and-then-marry-her simulator
Great game for patient players.
This is a good gamejust don't buy anything for less than a 75% discount.
Crusader Kings is my favourite game of all time. It's a game I can keep coming back toeach time finding new aspects of the game to focus on. I love the dynasty buildingand I love the strategic gameplay and the fact that you can play this at a high level
Hard game ? I don't know. But you'll need at least 20+ hours to understand the gameplay. After thatthe fun is on. Do you want to rule Poland as a Cathar ? Leave the coasts of Scandinavia to carve your viking realm in Spain ? Be an open-mindeddiplomat Shia Caliph ? You can ! You can also try to spread Hindouism in North Africa
A game that cause such a crippling addiction that it should be showcased in schools all over the world with a grave warningdo NOT start playing it! You will lose touch with the outside world and you will slowly fall away from family and friends and if you have a career or studies going on you might as well kiss them goodbye. TrulyCrusader Kings 2 is a whole new kind of dangerous
One of the best games of all time.
My mother had affair with king of Poland. I exterminated his entire dynasty including few of my kinsmen #justwendishempirethings
Physician cured my cancer in 780 C.E 10/10
Enjoyed creating stories of an upstart noble. Might have to read through the lines to see the stories unfold though.
This game is very good. It's a combination of strategy and management of the State. You can feel the role of the ruler and head of state. You can take the fate of their favorite characters. I wonder how many players will devote time to reach the power of his country. I can honestly recommend this game to fans of strategy games. I can give this game 9/10.
Nice game for diplomacy and politics and stuff. The agot mod is good.
Third Edit: The converter DLC is now getting some attention making that product legal againas it now actually does what it saysso I am returning to my reccomendation vote. The game (and others in the Paradox range) is really very good high strategy
I bought this game and I was frustrated that I couldn't figure it out so I set it down. And I kept hearing about it. A whisper here. A murmur there. So I decided to sit down and force myself to learn it.  1200 hours later and I think I'm starting to get it.
CK2 is absolutely amazing. The only thing more amazing than this game was the incestuous strong genius children that my king and his daughter had.
Best game i've played in years. If you have the time then this game is deeply engrossing.
Sowhat would you do if your first son became a monkyour second son died in war
It's ok i guess...
I've been trying to really like this gamebut I can't. For meit's overly complex to the point where it's just a headache. There also seems to be a lack of any believability within any person in the game. There were times where my super loyal vassal decided to start a fucking civil war with me for no reason. Just before you buy
My favorite part about CKII is the massive canvass upon which you create your own little dramas. The game invites you to write a story in your head and I find myself wrapped up in characters and plots.   I've also learned more about feudal succession law than I ever thought possible.
If there's one thing I learned from this gameit's whenever your uncle tells you to clean the rooftopsdon't go.
Can be complicated to play but it's fun to learn how to bumble your way through. It can be tricky wrapping your head around the economy mechanics and so on but it's great to bring your dynasty to power or to increase your power and rise from kindgdom to empireor with the case of a Byzantine playthroughfrom empire to the sole super power with a demesne force larger than the next rival's entire army.
I've been playing this for a few weeks nowits a big game... i love the grand strategy
CKII complex and takes ages to learnbut no other game will let you create the insane situations that only this provides. Build your empiremarry a horse
Fun Game for Strategists and History Buffs
Good  Edit: After 1000+ hours of gameplay I feel the need to upgrade my review of 'Good' to Very Good.
This game is a great mix between strategy and rpg. It's quite funespecially if you are in to history and want to rewrite it! It get a little easy after you figure out the mechanics but picking a harder start in ironman keeps it interesting.
I haven't played the base game in so long I've forgotten what it's like. Now I only play the AGOT mod.
44841it's alright.
This game is awesom. Suits fine to those that relish slow game tempo &amp unpredictable AI. Lines up with the best strategy games. Maybe Crusader Kings III will introduce sea batles?

Amazing game - hard to learnbut well worth it if you have time. Really wish Paradox didn't pull the DLC fucktthough(Not the expansions
Great game. Dynasty approach to medieval politics.
One of personal favourite RPG games out there. Fun to play a game of thrones mod with it. the game is challenging when a beginner but is easily learnable
A superb romp through medieaval times.

Fun Game for Strategists and History Buffs
really good but bland without dlc
Look at all this time I have spent inbreeding.
I have such a love hate relationship with this game I can't even properly explain it...
10/10 Great game
This is actually the best game ever.
I've been playing it since the beta and it just keeps getting better and betterspecially with all the cool mods coming out.
This game is a great addition to anyone who loved playing the old AoE games but a whole new twist on itI highly recommend it.
A lot of time spent learning to play the game and mastering it.
Medieval incest and politics simulator. 10/10 would ck2 again.
it's great
Very fun incest simulator with a bit of Pope-sanctioned invasion
really good but bland without dlc
Medieval incest and politics simulator. 10/10 would ck2 again.
it's great
Very fun incest simulator with a bit of Pope-sanctioned invasion
100% Steam Badge received - The game is also good. You can murder all your family and die alone.
Awesome game that I have spent lots of time playing.
Today Crusaders kings II stands as the best grand strategy game from paradoxand at the same time it is the simplest for new players to grasp the basics. The expansions add a enormous ammount of content and there is great variety in gameplay depending on your culturereligion and government type. Be prepared to log hundreds of hours into the game and not having explored even half of it's options.
this is a v good game
The worlds greatest eugenics simulator. Goodclean fun for all the family. Until they start making demands for more landthen it's off to the oubliette.

Another brilliant grand strategy game by Paradox Interactive. Shame about the boatload of DLCbut the game is fun even without it. Best of allif you have a friend with the DLC
Currently a demon possessed Jew ruling over all of India and the Middle East. Would rewrite history again. 10/10  Alsofor DLCI'd recommend getting the ones that allow you to play other religions FIRST
Really addictive and tactical game. It really feels like you are a king of a country when playing it. 8/10
I've spent nearly 30 years dismissing advances of my three daughters-in-law. I was tired of it so decided to assassinate two of them and bed the third one. Unfortunately but not surprisinglymy wife met my lover during a party and decided to get rid of me. Before she had a chance to assassinate me howevermy son rebelled. Soon all my vassals followed. Apparently Pope decided to excommunicate me. Assassinated Pope but alas! The rebels killed me in battle. That was beautiful experience.  10/10 recommended.
It's alrightalthough lacking in longevity.
I've played CK2 for years nowif the hour count didn't make that clear. The Conclave update earlier this year turned off a lot of people--it fundamentally changed core mechanics and made the game significantly (arguably arbitrarily) harder. The most recent update The Reaper's Duehowever
Absolutely brilliant. Conquer India as a Viking invaderor create the first Aztec Empire in France. Marry your kids to your parents and then marry your own sibling-grandchild. Go nuts.

Create an empire and then die in mysterious circumstances. Plot to kill my brother to gain back half the empire again.  10/10 Would assassinate people again.
I never seriously considered actively killing a family member until I played this game.
One of the best and most addicting strategy games (and of all games in general) that I have ever played.
Personally i prefer EU4 but CK2 is still an excellent game
Whenever you play you act like someone from the purge
I bought this game because of the Game of Thrones mod and I was certain that's all I was going to play... I was wrong. I was so wrong I feel ashamed. This game made me fall in love with Grand Strategy genre and I bought many Paradox games after this one but CKII will always have a special place in my heart. Also this game served as an eye-opener for me. I thought I was a light side person. Oh how wrong I was...
Best game I've ever played where you will murder your first son because your second son has the Genius trait.
Solid 8/10. Paradox gave it more than enough support for most issue to be fixed over timeand improvements in abundance. The bite is that you have to open your wallet to get the juicy contentthough you rationalise it after the fact since it's so damn fun once the ball is rolling.
Ever wanted to know why the middle ages were so terrible? Play this game for an hour and I bet you'll have killed at least one relativeor a childcommitted an act of gross religious intolerance
Crusader Kings II is the best real-time grand strategy out there. As much a political simulator as anything elsethe dynamics of this game allow it to be played at various degrees of depth that are proportionally rewarding. I'm doing this for the badgebut that doesn't undercut the fact that I've probably played this game more than any other.
I keep coming back to this game. New releases come and go but Crusader Kings is forever.
For award purposes .
This gameis like Risk the tabletop game. only with politicsPlague
Fantastic game with endless possibilities. NUmerous different outcomes and adventures can be created. Hundreds of hours of fun have been had in this game.
One of the best grand strategy games on the market. Paradox has supported the game with a variety of DLCs that have expanded the scope and mechanics of the game. Incredibly indepthand at times a bit overwhelming with windows and spreadsheetsbut it is immensely satisfying to plot
The stories this game produces are without comparison.
its good to be the king
This game is harder to put down than that illegimate son of your only child and daughter who has ran away with her lover to another kingdom. You have no idea how many times times I've pulled up the Steam Overlay to look at the timeshrugged and said 'heckI'll stop playing after I end this war'
This game is very interesting and funny! In this game you play not as a countrybut as a character. It give you the feeling to be really a medieval count/uke/king/watheverand every game is very different from the others.  Also
Great game.
This is by far my favourite game in the genre. It doese need a learning curve but the payoff is priceless. Would instantly recommend to anyone with a interest in history as a best strategy game.
This game is about madness. Why? Just look what you can do:  + pillage as a true viking + become king + praise the Sun + kill infidels in the name of Odin + bring slav religion to the british isles + marry possesed person + die from pneumonia + kill your relatives + burn churches + enlarge your demense by inheritance + lost whole empire thanks to the inheritance + kill your wife + take Jerusalem. Deus Vult! + crash infidels with holy order + smile while huge empire going to hell by inheritance and vassals wars. And its not your empireofc. + set horse as your councillor + lead your army to the victory while being pregnant and blind + take money from Pope + save the world from Chtulhu + watch anime on your second displaywhile sieging another infidel + become buddhist + kill tiger with your hands + other stuff  But to be honest CK2 a.k.a DLC Kings 2
Insanely funand not as inaccessible as I would have first thought. There's definitely a learning curvebut if you're willing to stick through a few hours and do the learning scenario
This is game is excellent. Simply putI don't know of a game that offers so much replay value. As you'll see from others' (as well as my own) reviewthis game can be played for literally hundreds of hours (and that's without indulging in the multiplayer
Unfortunately Defensive Leagues has slowed down pace of game at very early stage of playingbut Crusader Kings II is still one of best strategy games so far. It's trend of specialising unique ruler-profession events and adding new features keeps it at top.
Probably the best thing about this game is the emergent stories - after finishing a day of playing you come out of it with a timeline that nobody else has experienced before with many of its own unique quirks and details. This is definitely the game to get for anyone who loves a game that is truly dynamic.

Very detailed strategy game. If you've played any Total War gamesit doesn't have the battles that you may be familiar with. The game plays out on a grand scale political map (essentially)and you can do a great number of things within the game. Alliances
Custom Kingdom as Ukrainetook all land in the Empire of Russia.   Bahahaha
This is my favorite game. I have had it since 2012 and its never left my favorites tab. Game of Thrones Simulator
It's ok

It's for the badge
Purchase Crusader Kings 2 Play a few hundred hours Purchase games during Steam sales Play a few of the above games Finish even less than a few of the above game Notice Crusader Kings 2 on the Library Play a few hundred hours  Repeat from step 3  Test of Time achieved
Bred a bunch of dwarves into my dynasty. Unleashed them into the gene pool across Europe. Inspired a revolution.  Would play again.  Played again with the inclusion of rabies. Couldn't cure it through amputation. Diedpassing dynasty on to inbred son. Highly recommended.
The year is 1252. One Indian nation at the foothills of the Himilayas is all that stands between the resurgent Roman empire and complete world domination. When news reaches the capital in Constantinople that the last beleguered defenders have fallenthe people erupt in a shout of joy: 'Roma perpetua! Roma omnipotens!'
I love this gamethe vanilla is always fun but feature-mods and mods like Game of thrones makes it so much more enjoyable.
You like plotting against the familymedieval politicssieging defensless neighbours
A superlative game by any standardone that (in typical Paradox fashion) keeps getting better with each DLC. The only downside is that all the DLC collectively is prohibitively expensive at this pointbut with few exceptions it's well worth it.
Out of control good.
One of the most immersive and best games I have ever played!
Excellent grand strategy Game. Haven't experienced anything like CKII before. The game continues to excite for serveral hundred hours of multiplayer Gameplay so far.If it wasn't for the annoying desync Problems (that force you and all your mp mates to shut down and restart the game all over every few minutes) and the DLC policy of Paradox this would be as good as Grand Strategy gets.
This game made me understand society's relationship with women 10/10 would resent my wife for only providing me with daughters again
As the game is nearing completionI have sppend more than 1k hours on it and can honestly I have never been more facinated in medieval history and now know geography
so much stuff and even more so in the furter but be carefull it will cost alot even with out inclueding all the others
Highly addictiveextremely replayable.
The only game in the world where the Mongol Horde will convert to Catholicism to protect itself from invading Vikings.  10/10
Forget CivilizationCK2 is the new king !
Becoming a Viking god? Whats not to love? No seriously pleasetell me!

It can be difficult to learn the mechanics of the gamehoweveronce you understand how everything works it can be very addicting. There are many different ways to play
Although it has a steep learnign curveit has huge rewards.  Its my nomination for test of timeI just keep coming back to it
This game is one of my favorite games ever. It may take time to learn it but it is definitely worth it.
I've been playing this game since it first came outand it has never once been boring. Some players may find it frustratingbut I love how the game mechanics can completely throw you off track. I have at different times been thrown out of my kingdom
I may have played this game a bit. I guess you can say I enjoy it.  A lot.  It truly belongs in the category of games where you just cannot help but think: Just one more turn/five more minutes...
Lunatic is best
One of the greatest games I've ever played. Not only is it an in-depth political simulatoryou also learn about medieval Europethe political mayhem that could ensue
I've played videogames for nearly 20 years now. From the humble Nintendo classics to overly ambitious money-grubbing MMORPGs... I was thereplaying them. Hundreds of games boughtprobably. Thousands of hours of fun (or not).  And Crusader Kings 2 is the best damn game I ever played. No regrets.
Great gamestill don't know what I'm doingbut it seems to be working
Brilliant! Just try it and youll see. Grand Strategy-RPG hybrid thatll eat up your life if you let it.
A very goodconstantly improving game. If you can get past the learning curveyou're in for a treat.
By far my most favorite Paradox game to date. Love the mix of RPG elements in a grand strategy game. Gotta love startingas a one county count from a minor dynasty and building that dynasty into a grand one in control of many great empires through marraigewarfareand intrigue.
Best Paradox work yet imho! Try it out!
Challengingbut definitely rewarding. If you've the patienceyou can do anything you like.
The only game I passionately come back to play it againand it never failed to surprise me unexpectedly.
I've completed one full playthrough so far. 867 - 1453  Started with one county in Ireland. Within 50 years I had united all Ireland into the Kingdom of Erie and feudilized. 100 years laterKing 'Aed the Black a kinslayer
-This game rocks my socks
One of the best games to play with friends I've found yetyou really find out who is your friend when you have a succession crisis.
Alrightpretty fun but takes alot more time to have a quick game than I have
I forgot to eat the day I bought it.  10/10 would  again.
Still one of my favorite gamesare there frustrations after some patches or changes? yeah maybe? but honestly I've been playing it so long and enjoying it so much that I dont think I could possibly say theres anything wrong with this game. In my opinionparadox's best game made to date.
This game is complicated at firstbut worth every penny. There's a lot to keep track of and learn when you first start each gameand it can be a bit daunting
This is the perfect game to live out your sociopathic phantasies of killing family membersbabieskings and queens to make your way to becoming emperor of the world and initiate peasant holocaust.  Really needs an update to get its performance up though.
I'm starting to get the hang of it I think...
