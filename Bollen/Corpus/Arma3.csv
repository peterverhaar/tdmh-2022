lots of fun to be had )
A very underated game definitely deserves 85+/100 just take some getting use to and adjustments!
The newest installment in the Arma series has shown itself to be capable of becoming a valid successor to itself. The new features in this game can make an interesting urban firefight into a strategic and well-thought out plan. In Arma 2 there were very little options for infantry mobility in  consider that no problem. Enhanced moving capabilities make popping in and out of cover much more intuitive and conveinent than in Arma 2.  is rapid growing game with a lot of different gamemodes too. Worth every penny.10
great combat sim be it as infantry or pilot big platform beautiful engine lots of mods different MP gameplays great community lots of sleepless nights when conducting large organized warfares it's the closest sim to real life u either love it or hate it - there is no in between ;)10
the most realistic army simulator/game of all time SCREW COD
this game is amazing :D 10/10 btw u need a good pc to run this
Proper sick game innit bruv
Beast game if you have a comp to support it. If not you can still sit in spawn and pretend you are doing something useful 10/1010
There is no comparison
I camped in a Gunstore for 5 days and it took 3 tries with a tank and MG crew to dislodge me. 11/10
I mostly play Wasteland and King of the Hill but with its mod support and range of in-game fidelity I'm surely to play this game for a very long time.10;1
Kind of glitchy but a load of fun and an insane amount of depth.   If you are a fan of games with a good amount of tacticality this is a must buy even at it's pricepoint.;10;1
Amazing realistic shooter.
I cant fly nor do I like to annoy people..  Only kidding I lurb arma!
Probably one of the best games I've ever played.   The amount of mods and features in this game is great And if you can pick it up on sale it's a bargain!   If you're expecting to just run around shooting That's not going to happen. This game is a lot slower and requires tactics and intelligence to succeed. A great addition to the Simulation and Shooter genres.   With the open world which could only be compared to the size of maps such as DayZ's you'll be completely immersed and entertained somehow by traversing and exploring the map in the different game modes online and offline.   With mods like Altis Life Breaking Point Wasteland Invade and Annex You'll never be without a new game mode to pour hours into with your friends and the modding community is truly amazing with the singleplayer missions and sandbox scenarios available and being developed.   I could not recommend this game any more than I have. It's my most played game on Steam and will stay that way.10;1
This game copied off of call of duty. Run and gunners get 37 kills while the 37 campers scratch their balls and die. Then they have these a.i missions made by babies for babies. Easiest game I have ever played gonna have to give it 0/10 no quickscoping.
this game is the worst game ive ever played
This game is so much fun and each time i play it i cannot stop playing it.. If you play with friends it makes it that much better but without friends i have the same amount of fun.
Perfect sim for those wanting something more than casual games such as COD or Battlefield offer. Arma II is still the big boy but 3 is shaping up to match or exceed the older (but still massively popular) sim. The engine is a bit smoother and the setting more futuristic but other than that it plays very similar.10;1
Great
Pretty fun game and it runs better than Arma 2
t looks sweet runs good but the controller layout is all over the place and you cant change it :/10;-1
day 5: still have no idea how to shoot... 10/10  This Game... I love it
ecent game although a bit graphics intensive. Uber-realistic. Have fun finding enemies...10;1
eally fun especially if you play Arma life or altis. Its a little hard to run so make sure you have the PC for it.10;1
he thinking mans shooter. Also hilarious physics glitches AND one of the most active and diverse modding communities out there. If you like shooting things but dont have the reflexes for CS anymore get this. Its amazing!10;1
I love this game... Its the best game has everything you want in a game and is just so much fun to play with your friends.
f you like anyting military than this is the game for you!! There are tons of fun multiplayer game modes ranging from RPGS Sandboxes and Sector Controls. The single player is just as fun using player created missions and mods. Or you can spend hours just messing around in the simple to use misson editor. The devs are great and keep supporting and updating it  is more like a platform than a game.  Overall Its one of the best games ive ever played and has the most content ive ever seen. Worth every penny!!!10;1
I have put about 500 hours into this game. that speaks for itself in so many ways.
The most dangerous things in  are as follows. -Stairs -AI -Rocks -Teammates -The car you are driving -The Enemy
 love this game and have played with it for almost a year i do recommend for anyone who is into tactical and teamwork based fps;1
I Love this game.
 can't complain this game delivers on what I was exspecting. I have all other games in the Arma series aside from a small few of the Arma 2 expansions. I love the ballistics you get a more realistic feel for how a real firearm operates. There is much more to take into account than your simple fps. The series is great and worth a try the controls can be intimidating but they are managable if you invest some time in training and getting a feel for it. This is a simulator so things are gonna be alot tougher than your typical war game. The AI friendly AI could use some more fine tuning and tweaking I have had to put a few bullets into a couple insubordinate AI team mates for laying fire on targets a 1000 meters away thus helping bring more aid and attention to the base we were originally assaulting. The game is not without its bugs and it is also a heavy on your processor much like Arma 2 was but indeed it is definatly a step up in graphics. It could use a larger armory but there is a great mod cummunity that works on things like that to help the process along. Can't wait to get my Saitek x55 Rhino pro H.O.T.A.S. to be able to enjoy the helicopters alot more.10
Found a tank Killed a naked guy Made millions :D
I absolutely love this game mainly for the mods to it. I really enjoy playing rounds of Battle Royale. It is even better with a few teammates. It can get pretty intense at times. I do like their Breaking Point mod. It can get pretty intense.  10/10 gameplay experience
is a very diverse game with many different games modes and mods. Some of the popular gamemodes are King of the Hill Battleroyale and Wasteland. There are also many co-operative mission you can do with people if you choose to do so. You can instlal different mods like guns vehicles missions and other things. Then theres Breaking Point a mod that involves zombies (be warned it is a very big download like 20+ GB) it can be hard to survive people and most people will try to kill you so be warned. Last note is there is going to be a  Epoch Namalsk map coming.10
his game is one of the rare game that has always something new the community is big and has a lot of modders. You will always find something to do but I warn you it doesn't run smoothly often and for me this is the only problem. I hope you will consider buying it if you are looking to play for tones of hours and fun! See you on Arma!10
Great game! I always loved the Arma Series it begon with OFP First Arma and the graphic's of this game are stunning! but i don't like the future vehicles ect but its awsome with mods :D
this gotta be one of the best games i have ever seen
y first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game ever.  We're on our way to the objective a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.  I run my SAW gunner runs my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.  Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?  The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling drenched in his own blood. 'SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!' he died after that. I cried and he respawned.  I would recommend getting :)10
dont hesistate buy it!
This Game is a fun open world game if you have money and you like military play this GAME
It's one of the most accurate action/mil-sim game i've ever played. There is nothing else like this out there.  10/10
Awesome game if you like arma 2 you will love  despite the amazing graphics it plays pretty well and there is a ton to do. I'd say buy this game but at a risk of you may not be able to run it considering its such a cpu intensive game I hope you enjoy It like I have though Have Fun!
very good and fun army simulator. Never get bored.
From riding in a go-kart attached to a helicopter to stealing peoples organs for money(not that i do that :P). One of the best games ive ever played!
t's really cool like I really like I played the demo and it's really cool make a update where you can shoot threw a door :)10
fantastic game love every minute of it.
Very nice game and very good!
f you liked ARMA 2 then you will love !  Because it is ARMA 2 with better graphics and less content. I bought it so should you.  10/10 will have to create your own game to enjoy the game you just bought.10
his game was a bit frustrated after Counter Strike but after a few hours of playing I realised it is not so bad. It is a totally different and I must learn how to play this game.  After a while I understand the flow of the game so now I like it much better.  I recommend this game for those who like open area combats and slow gameplay compare to Counter Stike. It is more like real world.10
on't mistake this game for an FPS some people enter into this game expecting COD ...it's not. ARMA is a full battlefield simulator which it does well at. In ARMA you're not meant to feel invincible if you don't take cover you'll die if you don't communicate with your squad you'll die. It has an insane learning curve that will take most people a long time to get used to but only makes it very satisfying once you finally figure out how to fly or use artillery or...anything. The complicated controls at first can seem annoying but once you're used to them you'll be grateful you can stick your head up just enough to see an enemy out of a window without exposing your whole body.  The games mod-ability makes it possible to play an infinite array of game modes making it difficult to get truly boring. While there is a battlefield like mod called king of the hill the size of the maps alone makes the game vastly more complex and that's saying nothing of the array of vehicles that can completely alter the game from just one player knowing how to fly or range a sniper rifle.   Unfortunately the ARMA engine is well known for how glitchy it can get Most of this has been ironed out and the presence of hackers ruining servers has been greatly reduced since early access. At times clipping through a wall or falling through the floor of a building still happens but it's not so common that it ruins things.  At the end of the day the game requires being patient and on your toes while communicating what you see with teammates. The different mods and game modes give the game infinite potential but the glitches can create issues sometimes.  is a military sim not 'insert FPS here' don't get attached to scores and if you find yourself complaining over global that someone using a plane is 'cheap' or a 'noob' close the game and reevaluate who you want to be in life.10
SO much fun playing the game along with friends. The Single player has alot of fun working with players to take down your enemy.
 personally don't know what to say because writing a really long review is stupid. But i highly recommend this game by far one of the best games i have played in my lifetime. The great mod support the variety of gamemodes to choose from. Its just simply great. Buy it10
There is nothing more to say about Arma III than WOW. Ive been an owner of every single installment in the franchise from the days of the original Operation Flashpoint. The leaps and bouds that the developers have made over the course of the years is astounding. Arma III is absolutely astonshing as an improvement from the rest of the series. Its far less buggy than its predecessor and is updated very regularyl. The multiplayer capabilities are awesome and you can lose many hours with your friends developing all kinds of scenarios. If you were a fan of any of the previous games this one will not dissapoint.
Very fun game and good mods !
 really do love this game. It's great when you have a group of people to play with but not so much for solo play. It lacks a wide range of weaponry but the mods help fill in the gaps left by BI. Recomended if you have friends toplay with.10
eally Good game with a large number of mods! Buy it and play it!10
Man where can I start. This game has made me forget any other game out there (including BF4)...so many options and possibilities.   After surviving a really intense firefight our squad made it out alive. We requested to be picked up and the nearest vehicle was a M939 truck I believe. We replenished our ammo and equipment and on our way to the next target our driver fell asleep and we all got killed in the crash...good times.   WARNING: If you do not want to spend hours and hours playing do not buy.
This game is almost the perfect PC game (in my oppinion) however it would be great if the game ran a little bit better but apart from that you can mod the living  out of it and spend hundreds of hours playing the various life mods!  12/10 - ME :D
hen I first played ArmAII I barely enjoyed the game nor did I stay for too long simply because I didn't like it. Coming to ArmAIII I felt a whole different experience a new environment like never before. Something attracted me to this game when I first played it during a free weekend; a feeling of excitement fear and all sorts of emotions of that nature. I felt like a real soldier in an actual militaristic environment. Months later when I actually bought it I got hooked again with the same elements as before. Here are some of the pros and cons after a good 15 hours on the game:  Pros: -Somewhat real life experience (i.e. running (actual stamina system based on how much weight you carry) driving aiming and firing etc.) -Weaponry (Different types of ammo explosives range from mines to grenades Launchers etc). -Amazing Teamwork -Vehicles -Both a Third Person Shooter AND a First Person Shooter  Cons: -Unstable FPS issues (literally stay away from this game if you don't have a strong CPU since this game mainly focuses on more CPU power than GPU) that vary depending on either campaign or multiplayer. I seem to run better on multiplayer for some odd reason but sometimes it's the same as single player on certain occasions such as driving. You literally have to deal with it. The lowest FPS I get on Ultra Settings with a Nvidia GTX 770 and i7 4770k is around 30 tops maybe a good 25 sometimes (like I said when doing various tasks).  -Unreal Physics at certain times. So basically let's say you climb a 5 foot ladder inside a building and fall or you leap from a 1.5 foot distance from a flight of stair in general. Picture the size of 5 feet. That's 60 inches. Jumping from this distance= death. Yup. And even a slight bump from the rear of a car can kill a player (around a 10-15 mph car can kill a player in this). These are some small things to overlook by BI but still I face palm sometimes at the unreality of the physics. -Difficult controls. It took me some time to learn all of the controls and almost 5 minutes to figure out how to aim down the sights. Simple things like these can easily be overlooked but are for sure some of the things to know when coming into ArmA. It ain't easy to get into like Call of Duty or Battlefield.  Neutral Comments: -One last thing to say is that this game can be a running simulator at times. Although you have to travel far distances sometimes on foot (and waste a good amount of time) the game provides a lush realistic environment that contributes the beauty of nature. It compensates for all the running that has to be done but allows you to explore the wilderness of a massive island.  All in all this is my review for the game.   TL;DR: Good military sim one of the best out there. Gives you good feels but lacks on certain parts. A 'deal with the graphical issues' game. 10
If you love military simulators or just plain out love the military this game is by far the best out of any other game to play. I have played Arma 2 and OA and ever since  came out I have not touched arma 2 or OA. This game has a learning curve but ask people in multiplayer or play the campaign for help. Overall 10/10.
Always a fan of the arma series and i love to support their games and continue to be a supporter for a long time. Keep up the good work! &lt;3
aving played ArmA 2 for almost two years before  came out I had high expectations for . Now Before I get into specifics about the game I have to say  is one of the best games you can get without having to buy any DLC to enjoy a full experience.  is an amazing first person shooter that involves a bit of strategy to win. Whether it means inserting into an enemy camp via SDV or hiking it across altis just to take an enemy helicopter for a spin You have to come up with a plan to have a successful mission. Now  isn't just about objectives and killing virtual entities. ArmA is about a massive multiplayer community made up of players Mod Makers Scripters Cinematics Creators and many more. If you think vanilla has an extremely large amount of content Wait til you get a look at all of the mods and missions created by just the player base.   Pros  Extremely fun and adrenaline pumping gameplay Crazy amounts of mods available Extremely large and diverse player base Very well made models and objects High end graphics Not very many hackers Large amount of servers to choose from Lots of updates  Cons  Physics can sometimes be a bummer when attempting unusual missions or actions Can be hard to run for some people Can be a little hard to learn how to play Again Physics  Overall I give  a 10/10. This game has exceeded my expectations. I can replay this game everyday for a week and still not want to put it down. If you are looking for a first person shooter that involves a crazy amount of strategy and content This is the game for you.10
Even better with the steam workshop addons. Highly reccommend.
According me it`s the best game in the world. I love this game.
 is a awesome very worth the price game it includes great graphics and fps it supplys realistic good gameplay that will make someone go to the edge of their chair constantly updated 10/10
Its just Arma thats all
hat i can say Arma is always Arma the ultimate war simulator if we make a difference with Battlefield well....BF is for casual and arcade player10
Best war simulator
s a battlefield fan for its slightly more tactical approach to combat (if you play it right) then Call of duty i can say ive never played a game like this its more tactical then any game i could of imagined being. I love this game and would recommend it to anybody who isnt a Call of duty fan.10
it's good game  with friends only
One of best experiences in multiplayer in my life. Most of times i do mil-sim coop so this game is worth all money if you don't expect cod or bf like gameplay
un game a step up from the previous title10
uns smoother then the last and theres already alot more diverse mods and game modes.10
his game is a whole new meaning of Awesome. The succesor of the very fun Arma 2  is beautiful and lively yet at the same time can become a giant battlefield of fun and thats why i love this game. If this hasn't convinced you to get this amazing game well you're missing out.10
reat game especially enjoy the Role Playing servers. The only place someone will scream Bib;ical scripture at you and shoot out your tyres outside of the USA. 10/1010
most satisfying game to win at!
ith all the addon mission files mods and different game modes this game is like 5-6 shooter games in one. Can be a very different experience every time. Also there's skydiving.10
For all ppl who love military this is (for me) the best game you can find. Using tactics and strategy to win. I really enjoy the Tactical Realism Servers you need time for this but its just a great game. You almost think your in the fight ;) Oculus Rift and i think you have amazing fun and maybe some scary moments too :D  Sorry for long review and Greetz from germany :)
Good game cars break too easy though
The best Fps Sim ever!
un game I find it better when playing with other people 10
Huge Map Awesome Graphics Only in Arma moments  Not recommended for those that want a fast paced shooter or dont have a reasonable PC  Sweet game Thumbs up :)
Excellent graphics and fantastic team play. If you want a game that is realistic and fast paced then this is the one for you. There are also chances to go solo in several multiplayer servers if thats your style!
I THINK IT IS A EPIC GAME
I love this game but i think alot of people underrate it.
un and open world game with really good gamemodes and lots of fun Make sure your Pc can Handle the game before you get it though.10
imply the best Military Simulator/FPS/Strategy game out there..  Stunning visuals immersive gameplay and endless hours of missions mods addons and DLC's  Some people may experience problems on older machines with FPS and lag .. but majority of people will experience nothing but gaming pleasure and a game that will continue to expand and develop over the coming years.10
this is an amazing game as a fps as well as enabling the player a truely immersive realism experiance the multiplayer experiance of the game is truely second to none with community members contributing maps and missions to the steam workshop as well as community modders hard at work the potential for this game is quite limitless
is a really good game. If you feel like a real army game go and play arma good tactics etc makes your team win. For the RolePlayer's out here they are also at the right addres arma has an RP mod called 'Altis Life' this is fantastic for people who love RP with good graphics. I really recommend this game for actually every player who loves an army game and for people who seek real RolePlay10
ve had tons of fun in this game already and I'm far from done. Singleplayer can sometimes be a hassle. I've come across a bunch of issues in missions forcing me to restart them but I suppose that goes for every advanced simulator.  If you're playing with friends you'll never get bored. Any sandbox gamemode will do. Wasteland Altis Life Invade &amp; Annex and so on...  This game does require an above average gaming computer.10
This is the best military sim
Really good game I give it a 10/10. After the heli dlc I havent been able to play it though it keeps crashing :( 0/10
Needs less war
:3
ig and Beautiful. Great military simulator i only recommend you have a mic and join into a clan server where you can take part in some very realistic and large scale operations.10
NUMBER 1 FAVORITE GAME!!!
So you're laying behind a rock listening to bullets crack by and looking out a few feet to your side at the body of your buddy wondering if he's just passed out or if he's been killed like the rest of your squad was. Suddenly all you can hear is the roar of the A-164 cannon as it screams overhead and the sky goes red with the fire from explosions. You peek out at the burning remains of the enemy forces and breathe a sigh of relief for the first time in the last hour. Those moments are why you play Arma.
best army game ever 10/10 trust me must buy!
his game....Ooooh this game...Is amazing. It's a first/third person realistic tactical shooter. If you are a person who plays Call Of Duty and think you can run into a room witha sniper rifle and 'G37 Th053 SW33T YY360QuIcKS20p3S 1adDerSTA1ls' then this game is really not for you. The campain is 'meh' but the multiplayer is where the fun comes in you have Altis life a sort of rpg gamemode Patrol Ops (My favorite) where you look for enemy encampments or chemicals and deal with them teamdeathmatch and tons of others. If you have played previous ArmA games you will know that the controls are a bit...odd...Well in  they are still kinda odd but they are better. There is an entirely new mechanic in 3 called the 'stance system.' Basically if you are standing you have four different poses that can help with almost each and every situation same goes for the four crouching and four prone. There is a decent range of weapons and atachments and no limit to clothing options.  The one big and noticable problem with Arma...is it's optimization...The game doesn't run well on some systems for seemingly no reason.10
est military sandbox out there. This is not just a game. It is a playground where you can wage war in any shape or form (with great graphics btw):  -Use land water and air vehicles.  -Control a team.  -Use UAV's and stationary weapons.  -Play through immense maps from  arma 2 and others (like the new Bornholm). -Use gameplay mods that change drastically the way the game is played (Wasteland Epoch Life Hunger games...) -The Zeus mode will let you create and edit any part of the game on the fly (be a god). -The list goes on and on.  The only thing that is not as polished as in other AAA war games is the cinematics this is more a simlulator kind of game. But then it's like comparing a toy car and a toy car made out of lego. Take it apart put it together and you'll have a completely different toy.  Just to finish: DayZ came out of this concept (in arma 2). What else do you need to know?10
This game has so much to do and is a realistic and very intense simluator. I love it!
someone buy this for me
Game of the year!
Great game. DL the Breaking Point mod.
Best game in the world !
ice game controlls are a bit ed up but you get used to it :D10
love it simple as that. :)
rma3 I must say is ummmm...  Lets start over Arma3 is a well thought out game by far. The mods are wonderful and most of the time you can't go to sleep after logging on :).  My opinion.  I believe with a little more optpmizing on server side/ Company side this game could not be beat out by any other game on the market. Arma3 is a mix of things.  If you want fast paced. BAM - ARMA3  If you want slow paced. BAM -ARMA3  If you want great and releastic gun fights/military simulated. BAM - ARMA3  If you want a very minimum amount of hackers (as in I have encountered 0 YES 0 in 258 hours time played. Then BAM -ARMA3  If you want great AI encounters. BAM - ARMA3  Want to pick from many different mod's... Epoch Battleroyale Altis Life RP Wasteland King oh the hill choose what you like best.  Choppers military vehicles awsome guns what more can you want.. oh yea 1000000 FPS :P  A few negatives are the bugs. 1. Dying randomly from stairs getting in vehicles falling 5 feet falling 2 feet running to fast :P  2. vehicles blowing up for no reason blowing up in garages from spawning in diferent directinons. 3. umm nothing else i guess :)   Arma3 I would by far recommend to any and everyone my first hour of gameplay I quit uninstalled and did not try again for 4 months. Well then I was hooked. As long as you can run it due to the optimization your good to go Hopefully in the future the updates will get pushed faster and less bugs but that wont stop me.  Give it a try you wont regret it.10
i love this game mods are the best way to make this game one of the best
This game is simply amazing.   I know the FPS may be bad at stages and the bugs and glitches may be annoying but hey it's ARMA. A3 is an amazing game and even more amazing with mods. Never can I say I have seen another game where I can screech in my F-18 Super Hornet over a bunch of ISIS Militants in a fictional town in the middle east. The multiplayer is simply amazing as well however buggy at times. I did not enjoy the gameplay very much at the start but when I added the necessary mods it was a master piece.   9.8/10    TLDR -   PRO: Amazing game with great core gameplay  CON: Minor and Major bugs and FPS Issue Tip: Accompanied with right mods it is a master piece10
Great game very tactical.
 had a friend gift me  and I always wanted to play it. Despite all of the negativity some people give it I enjoy the game myself. There is so much you can do in  that sometimes it is hard to name them all. Having 893+ hours I think it is safe to say I would recommend to anybody. From super serious to very calm game modes Arma has it all. If you choose to get Arma3 see you on the battlefield.10
Doesnt get more realistic for a military sim than this!
Easily one of the best shooters I have ever played. More Simlator then most claiming to be out there. Nothing like a 'C.O.D' or 'BF'. Great Game Highly Recomend It.
he interface allthough improved can still be overwhelming. I don't know how many times I have reloaded my weapon when I wanted to open a door or how many times I have thrown a grenade when I wanted to look in my backpack. It doesn't help that Bohemia changes the default keys for every installation of ARMA. However this can be changed to your preferences of course. Another factor to consider is that it is HEAVY on your computer. Make no mistake about this if you want to view all the bling-bling it has to offer. It seems that it's terribly hard for Bohemia to optimise their engines. This is true from the first Operation Flashpoint to DayZ SA. You need spend some TLC on the options to make it run smooth and even with a beast of computer ARMA3 can bring it to it's knees without sweating.   With all this said I have played all the ARMA games in the hundreds of hours per installment. And except for Operation Flashpoint which had an excellent campain mode the single player is not the reason for why I come back. Quite frankly they might as well have left it out.  No it's in the multiplayer mode (being Wasteland Life Zombie Nation or just a regular all out war session) that it really shines. It defines sandbox fun. Rarely does a game cause so much emotions and I frequently end up sharing 'warstories' with colleagues and friend. It has the feature of drawing you into the gameplay and no other game gives me sweaty palms like the Arma-series.  So if you are prepared to spend some time to learn the game you will have a gem that litterally has a mod for anything you can think of. Kill zombies? Sure. Want some stealth play? Sure. Want to live your life as a drugbaron? Of course. Want some chaotic all out tank/air/land battles? Definitely.   And if it doesn't have what you can dream up you can always create your own content.10
 really do like this game as it has open world maps tons of content mods stuff like that. I recommend this game because of all the features it has its overall a great game. 1 problem fix the optimization! I honestly have a pretty decent graphics card but from what ive read no matter what kind of computer you have its just not gonna work out @ 60fps. Ultra settings: NOPE! Very High: NOPE! High: NOPE! Medium: NO WTF IS THIS BS? Low: YES WTFFFFFFFF! no one really wants to play a game that utterly looks like a pile of trash you know what i mean? Everyone says this game has poor optimization. even if you have a super computer still doesnt work? what is this B.S? all you need to need to do is update it for better fps so that no one needs a NASA computer to run this game Ultra 1080P @60fps.10
eally good game.   If you prefer a realistic slow phased FPS game with a real feel of war this is THE GAME for you. Insanely large map and plenty of different gamemodes to choose from.  There is also a nice RP server hosted by killernetworkgaming.co.uk where you can be a civilian or cop - choose to do real work or crime.   The possibilities of this game and its mods are endless. Looking forward for ' dayZ ' mod also.  My recommendations!10
 give this game a 10/10 I have 400 Hours on this game 350 of those hours I've played. Other 50 hours went to AFKing. It's well worth the money becasue you can use mods on it and run different missions the re-playableity is endless. Now I only played wasteland but there is more things like Life and stuff. Now I have played Arma: 2 Free so I know how to play the game. Only thing I don't like about it is the lack of firearms cars Helis and Planes. If you look past that though it's a great game over all. It's quite social.10
This is the best game it's just gets boring when you dont play with friends.
he pre-eminent military simulator. Multi-player and the mod community are where this game shine. Incredibly deep and sometimes frustratingly buggy persevering lends a rich experience.10
f you like shooting guns driving trucks driving tanks and flying helicopters and planes then this game is for you :D10
bsolutely love this game a must have for everyone. 10/10 &lt;310
Abosolute must! This game is so fun in so many ways! You should definitely try it!
This is the best game I've every play for 20 years.   10/10  ;)
o i reccomend this game? Yes. Do i reccomend it if your not on a powerful pc? HELL NO. This is a great game with big ideas and lots of potential.....the only thing holding it down is the down right terrible optimization...This game randomly lags whenever it pleases. Most if not all Bohimia Interactive games have similar problems to just keep this in mind if your looking to buy this or DayZ. Then again great ideas alot of fun and great graphics. (If you have a PC that costs more than your car.)-10
eally Good Game. REALLY recommend playing Role-playing mods They are SO MUCH fun.10
f you plan to have any free time after buying  forget it way too addictive. Brilliant Game. Many hours spent so far many more to come....Highly recommend this game 11/1010
his Game is amazing it's go looking that i wish i had it but I played like 8 hours at a friend's house. This game is like many games in one game becuase all the mods you can get and like LIFEWastelandDayz Exile.10
its in  m8 wont run on my 1987 computer my friends are  for buying a 60 dollar game thats 2 years old id rather  in my own urethra and  that  back into my own . its not the worst tho.
ore game is a little bland but when you get mods like Altis Life  Life and Nerds RPG make this game amazing. Some great Realisim units out there as well.10
Amazing. Best game I ever saw! It's a must in the video games world!
It truly is a amazing and fun game. Now if only they would fix the FPS issues especially on multiplayer.
Great game if you like big maps and roleplaying as a soldier. Great variety of what you can do.
 YES! Aint got nothing more to say.
Definitely worth the $60. Been playing it ever sense I bought it. 10/10 would buy again.
I have this game on my other account and its amazing :D
 beautiful looking game with realism at it's finest. Great Gunplay and well polished campaign. Multiplayer is incredible. Tons of Mod Support through Steam Workshop and countless support for Third Party mods like Battle Royale. It's worth the money if it's on sale and I couldn't recommend it enough.10
What Call of Duty wished it was.  What Battlefield strives to be.  What Arma already is.  Czech Republic/10   Two developers got wrongfully arrested for taking pictures at a Greek air show because of this. If this game can spark a coupe then you know it's good!
best game ever i love it but dont buy the game if you dont hav a high end pc ;)
xcelent simulator game really fun if you are a military type.10
Great game
Makes COD and BF look like sad shadows of military shooters. The quintessential military simulation experience. Buy it.
yes i recommend
uken climb in the bushes m8 shoot the biches get the girl alright10
RMA III is not a love hate relationship it is a relation comprised of ruthless and merciless defeat and frustration. This game made me pour hundreds of hours of my life into a virtual world where i only die. I could not recommend this more to someone who wishes to experience what it's like to be a complete failure. Playing arma is like when you swap from COD to Battlefield except you are being constantly reminded that you are vulnerable. 10/10 would bearing 00000010
ne of the greatest games ever made makes Battlefield and CoD seem like kids games.10
 a very good Open world shooter and a exelent military simulator  Even that i have less then 50h in this game i would say this is a very fun game to play 9/10  9/10 becouse some bugs that can kill you  P.s - DONT GO IN WATER
is the ultimate open world game with some amazing mods available however you will need a powerfull machine to get high fps out of this title!10
one of the best games ive played
ust just buy it.  But seriously this game is crazy good. I love it.     IT'S NOT A SIMULATOR IT'S A SANDBOX.    However the modding community for this game is amazing.  And if you are reading this you can probably run it. I run fine Standard settings with a Pentium G3258 @ 4.0Ghz and an Nvidia 9600gt 512mb. I admit I had to spend at least an hour doing tweaks and optimazations but in the end it was worth it. Even on lower graphics settings this game is still beautiful. Just buy it!  10
lot of strategy involved in this game. I bought this game because I knew it would have great mods and I was right. King of the hill is such a basic mod but it sure is really addictive.10
This is the best millitary simulation game out there
a must have for any milsim fan
 is an excellent game  and one of those games I keep returning to after playing something else for a while. For anyone interested in realistic combat games this game ticks all the boxes and is definitely worth the cost. I think it’s also worth a quick mention that when buying this game you are not only buying into a combat simulator with a ten hour campaign. Upon purchasing this game you will have access to a staggering amount of (very engaging high quality) community generated content that will keep you playing for a very long time.   It’s difficult to point a finger at the exact features that for me makes this game stand out among a mountain of other games. However for the sake of this review I’m going to point out a few of the details that keep me coming back for more.    1. The game itself  This is a very good combat simulator. Obviously it’s nothing like putting your boots on and heading into a real conflict zone. It is however everything I want and expect from a modern combat game. The graphics are great the audio is great and the primary storyline is interesting. This game is also huge giving you lots of room to play around with the tools you are given and going about things in your own way. The AI is fairly good for a game of this size as well. In certain situations (inside buildings for instance) the AI doesn’t perform very well but overall the AI is a good friend to have and a dangerous enemy to have shooting at you. This game is basically a playground and a toolbox. You’re given a huge area to play around in and the tools you need to have fun.    2. The user generated content  Done with the main game? At the point where most games would have you restart the game and try this gun instead of that one for the exact same results? No worries – in  you have hundreds of hours of user generated content to play with. There’s a lot of exceptional community created content out there and some of it even rivals the main campaign in quality and fun. The user generated content is where this game shines the most and where you will get the most out of your well spent cash.    3. The Editor  The editor. What to say about the editor? If you like combat games and you are a creative type the editor alone is probably going to be worth your money. The editor is probably also where most of my registered play time has been spent.  The ability to create any scenario you can think of on any number of different maps is great. Create any kind of mission any kind of conflict and play it. Have you made something cool? Great! Release it on Steam Workshop and allow other people to play it too. In a lot of other games I find myself wishing that the missions were a bit different or wondering what would happened if this or that happened. In a lot of other game your thoughts are left to die as the awful story rumbles on. In  you can simply jump into the editor and create the scenarios and situations you find interesting and see what happens. I love the Editor and when I say I keep coming back to the game I really mean that I keep coming back to the Editor to create more scenarios and missions.    Cons of the game.   Yes. This game has cons. Yes there are things that could have been better. However if you’re already a fan of these kinds of games you are probably already aware that the AI is still not a challenge for the human mind. You will be aware of the limits involved in such a huge game.  I have spent a lot of time playing this game and in all that time I have barely noticed any of these problems at all. Because of this I don’t really feel that these hiccups are rally worth a mention. They won’t hamper your enjoyment of the game in any way and should definitely not have any say in whether you get this game or not. Besides if you’re really into reading about the downsides there are plenty of other reviewers detailing them.    To finish this review  I think that I’ll simply say that any one of my points above are worth the price of the game. Each of these points will give you far more enjoyment than a lot of other more expensive games will give you in their lifetime. If you want my opinion and you obviously do you should definitely get this game if you are into realistic combat games.10
y far one of my favourite games!  I've been playing Arma since the good ol' OFP series and have truly enjoyed each new addition to the Armaverse. That being said the game and series are not without its faults. Luckily the faults are often overshadowed by the large modding community which in my opinion is one of the best communities out there. Kudos to the devs for creating a game that encourages modding. If it's not in the game yet you can be almost certain that someone will mod it in.  If you like milsim or just want to upgrade to something more tactical and realistic than the COD or BF-series well give Arma a try. Initially the game might seem confusing but with the introduction of Bootcamp new players are guided through the basics of the game and get a chance to test their skills before taking on the full Arma experience.  A lot of players play the games single player campaign before embarking on what truly makes Arma great the multiplayer experience. You'll find a large number of Arma groups all looking for new members and no matter what you prefer be it Marines Special Forces or Insurgents there's bound to be a group for you too.  Some of the drawbacks about  is that it's set in a not to distant future and thus the developers have chosen to 'futurefy' the units and vehicles. Some like it some don't. In previous installations of Arma the conflict areas somewhat resembled ongoing conflict areas in the real world whereas in A3 the conflict initially takes place in the Mediterranean and covers a conflict between CSAT (Iran and others) and NATO. The island of Altis does look great though and offers plenty of space for combined warfare. If anything it lacks a bit of forest.  One of the higlights of the game to me is the editor. Anyone who's played with LEGO as a child will love the editor. It gives you the chance to create your own missions and the possibilities seem endless from the easy and short missions to the vastly complex ones that require a good amount of scripting. Arma has it all! Plus with Eden coming along the editor is about to get even more awesome. A full featured 3D editor so no more guessing if you've placed the units at the correct spot or if they're facing the right window etc. Eden delivers big time improvements over the 'classic' 2D editor.  Now I could go on for ages with this review but essentially here are my thoughts on the game if you're thinking of buying it.  Buy it: - If you like to play in a more tactical manner than COD/BF - If you like being a part of a massive community where something new is always being modded in - If you can live with some of the small errors and restrictions by the game-engine and realizing that the game is under constant development - If you like large scale combined warfare - If you have ever played with LEGO and enjoy creating stuff - If you're looking to get into an Arma group and anjoying the MP community - If you want a game that you can play for ages  Don't buy it: - If you think it's anything like COD/BF/CS:GO - If you think you'll learn the game in 30 minutes - If you can't live with AI that sometimes is  - If you have a low spec PC (Arma is horrendously optimized as of yet and your FPS WILL drop)10
ne of the best games I have ever played. Former military got into gaming with Americas Army. Im very selective about the games I play and happy to have devoted most of my gaming time to . Strongly recommended.10
any many mods for this game from Epoch (like DayZ) to Paintballing and Go Karting. My personal favourite mod is wasteland which requires no additional downloads (other than the data file which automatically downloads on joining the server). If you liked Arma 2 you will love . The one thing I dislike nowadays especially on Wasteland is the the new Marksman DLC which has basically made Wasteland pay to win for those servers that allow the DLC weapons to spawn randomly in vehicles though some don't so it isn't a HUGE issue. £11 for a few more guns? No thanks Bohemia I'll stick to my trusty Mk18 and Lynx 12.7mm :D10
Life is extremely fun to play one of the best games I have seen!10
great game without bugs.
The realisim in this game is intense! This always has my heart racing and puts you right there in on the action. Love it great job.
!
i do like the game but when is the damn amd patch coming in sitting here with a beast pc and i can only run like 30 fps with amd the f is this
Great game with a HUGE mod community. love it and recommend it to all my friends.
Fully recommend this game definatley get this game it is the best ffps game out there in my opion the amount of  servers now probs like 5mil or something this game is like a part of me  Pros -Good graphics -like 60 fps on my LAPTOP and many more...  Cons -when i first got this game i couldnt find any servers but my reselution was not to get P!ssed off but i waited for a forknight and the game worked fine  FULLY RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE DONT LISTEN TO THE HATE REVIEWS THEY R WRONG
*clears throat* WHY DOES IT ALWAYS SAY ITS RUNNING EVEN THOUGH I CAN PLAY OTHER STEAM GAMES *breaths deeply* FIX YOUR GAME PLEASE!!! :but i do recommend the editor mode.
I think the best tactical team based game. Is fun for singleplayer and multiplayer  The best gamemode is Wasteland  BEAUTIFULL WITH VERY HIGH SETTINGS  10/10
 really great and realistic game but do NOT buy this game if you are not patient because you will have to wait alot of time for a enemy to shoot or to get a chopper car etc. sometimes.10
 love this game SOOO much its the only game I have played since i bought this. This game has tons of this to do from role playing to full on combat in king of the hill or wasteland! I would Highly recomend this game to anyone that is wanting to buy it.10
reat game with GREAT Modes Everyone should buy it.   Huge maps with up to 100+ players online.  I recommend geting Battle royale mod which is a 1 vs all mode last one standing wins the game.10
Nice Millitary Simulator
 was pretty good at arma 2 so I thought the  campaign was going to be fun and really easy.   Iv'e only raged quit to one game in my life That game is  I struggled through the tutorial and quit on the prologue.  Now I'm a lot better and the game is super fun!10
Armed Assault 3 is the very best tactical first or third person combat simulator on the internet by far.
ery big step up from Arma 2 well optimised and fun to play!10
his game is amazing. I know that it is by no means finished but at least BIS has been giving us updates on its progress fairly often. If you get the right mods right now such as Voice Activated Commands and TMR this game can be insanely fun TODAY! Hopefully BIS will get around to getting some of these great mods implemented into the Vanilla  but until then the modding community has us covered. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in some tactical realistic teamwork oriented and some crazy fun gameplay.10
WESOME GAME MORE AWESOME mods my Fav is A3L right now i also like Battle Royale Breaking Point Altis Life and Epoch would recommend buying the Game WORTH every Cent of it.10
Great game i cant wait to bay it i playd it only when it wos free for a weekend and i had so mush fun. I recommend this game to everbody!
I love this game the online suervers are full of pople to have fun with
ood graphics  very realistic plenty of good mods.  apart from having to part with money to get it its an awsome game10
robs the best game i have played i really recomend trying all game modes they are soo differnt and all soo fun!10
ne of the most challenging and satisfying games ever made I can not praise the ArmA series enough in general and  is the pinnacle of how good a military simulator can be. The learning curve is steep and at first you will be frustrated but if you have the patience to learn and master the technical aspects of the game it rewards you with an experience you simply can't find anywhere else.  Add on to this the mod support with new game modes weapons vehicles missions and so much more this is a game that keeps on giving.10
Epoch. Should I say more?
n infinite playground. Feel like some competition play? Boot up multiplayer and hop on Wasteland or TDM matches. Scenario play? Join one of the massive missions kicking around online. Extremely cool and unique singleplayer experiences? Hop on Steam Workshop and get one of the top rated missions. Want to goof around with your friends? Fire up a co-op mission. There's no game that offers you this much flexibility and this much room to stretch out in.  If you're an ArmA vet you know this already. Unlike the previous ArmA games though despite some bugs it's not completely inaccessible to the public. The server system is incredibly easy to use. Steam integration is fantastic. The player models and controls don't feel like operating heavy machinery (except when you're operating heavy machinery). Infantry controls are fluid. Helicopters take time to master but are a joy once you do. Tanks and armored vehicles are appropriately weighty (if a little low on torque and climbing power at times... I often wish I had manual gearboxes).  Play ArmA III. You'll have a lot of fun.10
hat needs to be said this is Arma the penultimate of military games. If you are looking for a military game get this one it's based off of actual US military simulations. It can't get much better than that!10
he best $60 I've spent. This game offers SO MUCH content for the money it's ridiculous. Not only is the campaign challenging and pretty interesting but the multiplayer game modes that come stock with Arma are a blast. But on top of this it has incredible mod support where players have literally created their own new maps brought maps like Chernarus from the original Day Z mod added weapons that weren't in the game via Bohemia's addition vehicles enemies etc. It is incredible. Whatever you want to do as long as it's in the realm of guns or cars there's a f**king mod out there for it. And that alone makes it worth full price any time. This game makes all AAA titles charging $60 + more for DLC look like .  If you think you can hang and stay aware of your surroundings buy A3. It's fantastic.10
Great game.
rma III....If you like detailed enviromentsLikeing a game FOR what IT is.(scaled down mil-sim).If you enjoy VAST community projects and mods.Tactical realism and interface.The riveting feeling of being picked up or dropped in a hot LZ...Then this game is for you. Since arma II to arma III things have been made more user friendly such as enabling modsstreamlined editors etc.Any questionsask away.10
Love it!
This game is great it's really realistic and has that Rainbow Six feel to it I reccomend this to people who like to play competitively or for people who want dayz
fter 650+ Hrs of gameplay I can thouroughly say that this is one of the best games I have ever played. The DLC for Helicopters is a little overpriced there are some bugs that still persist occasionally but they are paled in compairison to the fantastic gameplay realism and fantastic community. When I say fantastic community I do mean it but be aware of the  who like to hang out on the wasteland and RP servers. Other than that it's an A++ game and I highly recommend it to all.10
rma3 is a great experience of real battlefield with all the advantages and disadvantages.10
000000000000/10  By far one of the best games I've ever played. There is just so much you can do in this game. Wasteland King of the hill Invade and annex altis life and those are just a few of the game modes not counting all the mods this game supports. And the graphics of this game are so realistic and stunning they can be compared to that of real life graphics on ultra settings. This game captures every detail of modern-somewhat futuristic warfare from the mechanics of flying a helicopter to bombing an area with mortors. And if you stuggle with flying choppers or jets or just need to practice your close quarters combat they have an editor mode which can serve as training help. This is probably my favorite game right now and i reccomend it to anyone with a good stable computer.10
ts a great game. Better running and looking than Arma 2. Tons of mods you can download and install. Lots of variety when it comes to multiplayer servers that run various mods. Got  Life (Role playing) Dayz style mods - Epoch breaking point etc. Battle Royal (last man standing).   Buy it on sale. Usually 30 bucks.10
ours on the editor learning from the showcases this game is truly a sandbox experience. Better interface and controls make this Arma compelling to anyone.10
though a simmulation game has some very strong points. Mostly being the modding community. The engine its self is built to be as realistic as it can be. It does well it looks great and gives you a real presence in the game. I would recomend it for anyone that enjoys playing with friends in FPS.10
Love it
ont even look at the price just buy it its to good to even call it a game. its a simulator .......10
f you like a realistic military experience this game is a must have! The Alpha release is just as good as the final release of Armed Assault and ArmA II.10
LAYED DAYZ GOT GHILLE SUIT SHOT A CAR WITH 5 PEOPLE.  ME AND MY FRIEND GOT STALKT BY 5 GHILLIES EPIC GUN FIGHT GOT KILLED.  GG WP SO FUN :D10
haught me how to use a grid properly failed miserably due to lack of understanding of geometry. Education has failed me on geometry.10
his game is really fun with a good camapaign fun multiplayer and other cool features.10
reat game if you likfe military sim type games this is for you!10
his game is amazingif you like military simulators this game has it all from realistic gun play and simulator controls for air vehicles. Also what this game has that the other FPS's lack (bearing in mind you can play in 3rd person) is the vast community with community made gametypes such as Altis Life in wear you play as a cop civilian or rebel in a huge roleplaying surver.Or wasteland where you scavenge for loot in a mass sandbox map killing other survivors on site or you if that's not enough you can download scenarios (single missions built by the community in editor) in which you undergo a mission that someone else built! And if all of this is not enough you can even download the breakingpoint mod a dayz esc mod with the polished look and features! There is also a very rich campain if your looking for a single player experience.  Hand down the best game i own to date i seriously reccommend this for any true gamer. Master piece!11
first time i had ever played arma but instantly i loved the game and its interface brilliant game and lots to do its the best game for a reasonable amount of money.
ots of fun to play with friends. Amazing graphics and attention to detail! It's realistic and every move counts like atcually being in a war.10
Gnary &lt;3
A3 is gorgeous. Bohemia really did a good job with this game. For now I play the Epoch mod &amp; anticipate all future updates to both the mod &amp; the game itself. Would like to see more DLC.
y opinion about arma3:Its a very cool first person game in wich you can do a lot of stuff on multiplayer.On singeplayer tho i havent played it yet so i have no clue :D.Just buy this game if u like carsairplanesboats and strategics cause this game needs a lot of strategy.10
/10  For those who played the dayz Mod you will enjoy more of  than Dayz SA this game has some mods that will blow you'r mind completly.  PROS:    OPEN WORLD    MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER    DEATH REALLY MATHERS HERE    HARD AND PAINFULL SOMETIMES    AWESOME GRAPHICS   CONS:    IT TAKES ALOT OF CPU TO RUN IT    GETS ANOYING WHEN YOU DIE    HARD AND PAINFULL SOMETIMES  10
definitely recommend!
his is the best military first and third person shooter i've ever played. If i had to recomend this to a stranger and or friend i would do it in a heart beat.10
after a few hours played I think I like this game specially because of the mods and communities.
i like the way you shoot guns
The one of the best game EVER 4EVER!!!!!
he Arma series including  is a very flexible and diverse game series. I would highly recommend this game because it offers a wide variety of fun ranging from MMORPG like game modes such as Altis and Stratis Life but also more FPS\Shooter sort of game modes such as King of the Hill Wasteland. Not only is the range of genres that Arma covers quite diverse but the communties are as well.  The main communties in Arma is the Modding Community the Hardcore Role Play communities ( Life) and the Tactical\Milsim\Realism communities. After being part of all these groups it's safe to say that it's been one of the best online experiences in my life.  as a game is buggy not well optimised and can just be a pain in the  sometimes however none of that matters since it's all made up in the community.  Arma as game hasn't impressed me it hasn't made me love it but the people who play it have.10
ecent game might do it again10
... Enough said.
good game bought in the summer sale lots of cool mods 8/10
i like this game becuase me and the boys end up killing each other..
If you've ever played and liked military shooters BUY THIS GAME NOW
ne of the best FPS military simulation game i have ever played. Awesome stance options incredible missions and the ability to expand and grow outwards is overwhelming. Lost every day im in the environment. This game is the only game i have ever been able to find in game north using the face of a watch and a tree's shadow.10
t does not have the best graphics and its a bit clunky. BUT it is great fun. i strongly recommend the battle royale mod by playerunknown10
Every military simulator fan must have this game in their library.
This is one of the best simulation game out there
is a very well made and addictive game.   If you're looking for a game with a lot of playtime then  is a game for you. There are tons of modifications and different gamemodes you'll never be bored in arma. Some of the better gamemodes are the 'life' mods when you have to use your Roleplay skills.  I personally haven't played the single player / campaign because in my opinion it's not that great but the multiplayer surely makes up for the singleplayer.   If you're a gamer then this game is a MUST for you.10
OKE OKE   This game is ing awesome when u know how to do it. So take time when u are new and play the Bootcamp and the campaign .  For veterans its just join the battles and Multi sandbox modes in multiplayer mode.
whoa.
his is a great game for anyone looking to have a hardcore realistic feel. Its customization is the best I've ever seen including everything you can think about However my only complaint is it requires a lot of power to run. My laptop met all the minimum and recommended settings except for the reccommended graphics card and I thought I would be fine. But I was very wrong because when I first launched I multiplayer I got a very unplayable 5-8 fps. Now things are a little better if I join a low populated server. I usually play KOTH and nowadays I am lucky to get anywhere near 20 fps without joining a server with less than 30 people and having the settings the lowest possible. So if you have a powerful machine I would go for it. However if you don't have that fastest PC on the block then I wouldn't be too hasty to get this without doing some research. My final rating is 8 out of 10 but in the future maybe with some optimizaton tweeks that will change.10
Asked an AI to 1v1 me and his buddy killed me. freakin noobs.
ove this game the variation with the various mods is great...10
I now have PTDS.
Add me on steam if you wanna do missions I have a group.
This game is very entertaining  Altis life is just so much fun
ice game love it the mods again make it much and much better10
and absolute major achivement by Bohemia Interactive! I am glad to say that this game has been my favourite game for quite some time and i strongly advise you to purchase this product if you have't already. Buying the digital deluxe edition of this game gave me all the  game music which i thought was pretty cool considering the music is high def.10
ello I'm a noop So far I'm the bootcamp is giving me a headache. I'm trying to figure out how to figure out bearings and how to should my weapon if any one would like to help it would be appreciated. Have fun   Hiker195210
 rampaged a complex alone killed 8 guys met up with some dudes walked through a mine field for one bullet in the head. Restart mission. This game is cruel and merciless but it feels so freaking rewarding when you do something right :)10
 is the best game i have purchased from steam. There is such a wide varity of things to do weather its playing through the the campaign shooting at others on King of the Hill or my personal favourite Roleplaying on AltisLife. This game may have some bugs etc but still that dosnt pit of the many laughs and great memories i have had during my gameplay. During my time on Altis life i have met a great community of people who welcome all.  is a great game and if you are negotiating weather to buy it or not i would defonitly say Purchase this game 10/10
Best War Simulator on the market....

war simulator gone wild
it dosent let me play i when i get on it says no entry?
This game is Mad. Best Army simulator thing ive tried
ou will have many many sleeples nights with this game. If you can take a few well known  glitches you will have a blast with this game. But just 1 thing dont play it vanilla. The mods are what makes arma so great!10
Its ok.
ndescribably amazing the best experience of any PC game in my opinion. This military simulator can be turned into virtually everything through addons and simple mission scripting.10
It's OK I guess......
this is a ing good game! i love it!
A really good game that can get boring at times but over all id give it a 10/10 !!!!!!
over all very fun game  very few bugs  10/10 on most servers that are high quality  1/10 on  servers

Since vilence n stuff in da game is not so gewd for the yungins.
Best military simulator game out there!
Great Game - Love it
One of the best Army Games I have played with a wide variety of weapons and vehicles to choose from. So many gametypes to play and mods to enjoy.
ithout A doubt my favorite computer game to play as of now.  TLDR: If you are under the age of 16 Don't buy this game You will not have the paitence for it and most likely get extremely  off that you won't be able to hit an enemy from 15 yards away.  The Multiplayer has SO SO many games modes my favorite being Alits life and the way you can mod all types of different vehicles into alits life.   Like all other games ARMA has it's problems but they are too small for me to really explain to any potential buyers. This game is a MUST HAVE without a doubt.10
nce you get used to it it's simply an amazing game.10
mazing title with amzing graphics. The difference between this and Arma 2 whilch i also owned is unbeleivable. New features include the option to attack from water with scuba divers 230km open world with most buildings enterable a definate must buy for any FPS fan.10
If you can squeeze over 1000 hours of fun on a game then you should probably get it.
its worth a try :D
he best simulator of soldiers. Is not that frenetic combat as BF and COD which are also good. A coherent simulation and soldiers. Fatigue and weakness if you suffer non-lethal shot are also important. The best war simulator ever made.  10/1010
 is the best
This game has completely taken over my life. The war game to end all war games &lt;3
44844
 veary realistic war game that can either be for a realistic roll play to have a fun shooter or to mess around with mods on sandbox  10/10 would break again10
When you buy this game you must know that you are robbing Bohemia Interactive of their Money. It should be worth more than it is priced out to be.
. By far the most addictive game I've ever played. Something new with every mod! The only game that get my adrenalin pumping for real in the middle of a gunfight!
10/10 Would play forever
nly need a command to scratch your head when it bites you and it would the perfect real life simulator.  11/10   Serious review:  This game is great it can be somewhat buggy but it's good I just wish this game was some kind of open world/rpg with free roam and random encounters/npcs kind of Fallout but with military missions and well complicated but anyway this is a good game that I'd suggest to any military simulation fans.  WARNING: This game is NOT Call of Duty. This game is NOT Battlefield. This game is NOT Counter Strike. This game is NOT Unreal Tournament. This game is NOT Barbies Simulator 2015 or maybe it is not so sure yet I'll have to discover that by myself.  8/10 10
I love this game :)
ts cool. You should buy it. Now or later but now is better 10
This game is one of the best ive played its got ... let me think cause theres a lot. lots of online game modes map editor realistic things um yea its just fun over all. I recommend this game also yes it does have ZUEZ!!!!
If you want a realistic military simulator then buy this game.
Fun game and many different game modes. WARNING: BEFORE BUYING Make sure your Computer/Laptop have the right specs for running this game.
000 hours 2000 hours and I've hardly scratched the surface of what this game has to offer10
Not your Grandaddys Call of Duty.
or those who haven't played the previous ARMA incarnations and Operation Flashpoint this game aims for very realistic modern/futuristic warfare in which you can use almost all arms (land sea &amp; air) and gives it to you on a modifiable game engine (see mods on greenlight or google it!).  I've only seen it beaten for looks recently by GTA V prior to that my biggest problem playing it was I'd spend too much time looking at the background going 'Wow!' to notice my surroundings and get shot! ;)  Well worth checking out if you have the time though it will consume time quite happily!10
ilitary simulator with a steep learning curve. By far the most realistic shooter ever made. I love the game but it is no run and gun BF game.10
Best Reality Game
I am a huge shooter fan. You name it and I have played it....from CS 1.6 to HALO to Advanced Warfare. The ARMA series has always been one of my favorite. There truely is nothing else like it. Played with the right group of people in a co-op server and next thing you know 4 hours have gone by. I love this game.
10/10 would play with low fps again
hen playing singleplayer the game runs as it should on your average gaming rig however when playing on multiplayer server even the most powerful machine can struggle running this game well.  On an i7 with a 980Ti while playing KOTH on high settings I get an average of 25-40 FPS though on other servers I can play on Ultra with 60 FPS; so it varies.  The gameplay itself is enjoyable there are many game modes for you to choose from and I can easily see anyone buying this game getting at least 500 hours out of it.10
Really good game!
he default stuff isn't the best but with mods this game is awesome.10
I just bought the game and wow this is awesome. it requires a good system to play but besides that this game is the best fps game i know of wish i knew about it earlier
 great shooter and combat game. Unlike Call of Duty and Battlefield they do not need to release a new one every year.10
 solid upgrade from its predecessor (Arma 2) the new movement system is outstanding and a really great edition to the game the new engine really brings the maps to life espically at night time more enterable buildings then ever before makes for better gameplay and more care taken when clearing towns/buildings once the mods that made A2 so great come across and get upgraded this game will be complete BIS ADD A BIPOD FOR CHRIST SAKE!10
The long awaited sequel to ArmA 2 is finally here! It brings what made the previous titles great into a modern military shooter with more features than you could possibly mention in a short review. Worth full retail price and a must buy when on sale.
i LOVE THE GAME. i recommend to the people who are into rp and who has a good computer to run it.
Its hard on noobs. It was for me. But as soon as i found out the basics i had so much fun!
THIS IS WAR
est game ever can't get enough of it. With all the mods and missions for this game it has endless potential and opportunities. Must have for shooter fans.10
War. War never changes.  Really great game despite the tech issues it may have. You need a pretty good PC if you want to run on decent settings at a good framerate.  Gamemodes vary from milsim to dayz clones to gamemodes such as king of the hill to far out  such as Altis life...  Worth every penny and I'm a tight git :P
for the ppl who are tired of cod and bf because this is 66x better than both of them if you have a good computer to run it. 10.5/10 amzinggg
es this is the best simluation game ever made10
so much to offer. a must get if into simulation what so ever.
Best Games in realism/Milsim ever played.
Honestly I dont know why you are reading reviews. Buy the game. There is soooooo much you can do with this. Everything from wasteland servers to Epoch to Altis life. It can be a zombie game. Or it can be a Mil sim. It can be a non broken form of GTA. Or it could be a racing game.  Only con is you have to pay for DLC. The content in the DLC should have already been included -_-
mazing installment to the ArmA series. Great variety of mods to keep you playing the game and to keep you satisfied. My experience so far with graphics gameplay etc has been everything i have expected. I reccomend you buy this game if you are in to warfare styled games and in-depth game mechanics.10
bsolultly love this game 10/10. The moding aspect is awsome if you want to add some real units and some different maps it makes the game just that much more realistic. would highly recommend.10
10/10 would buy this again but with the pain of buying all the dlcs that u need to access majority of the game
est Game in my library alot of people wont like this game cause it isnt easy like CoD or Battlefield well they need to learn what strategy is and Skill and simulation. because this is top of the line!10
 have had Arma III for about a year now and really engoy the game. The graphics and overall gameplay is amazing and well done. I do suggest you have a higher end computer to play this game though or play on low settings. I would suggest this game.10
10/10 Only bad thing. Maybe the optimitzation. But keeps on getting better. I've played it over 500 hours and i don't regret it.
ot this game installed a mod didnt work loaded the campain and got killed by a pterodactyl 9/11 IGN Like down's syndrome sheep on heroin.10
olid 7/10 Definatly has some flaws movement system has definatly improved alot but is still kinda clunky at times. I love the new stance system they have added. The clipping is still a problem and is kinda t the amount of keybindings in this game are ridiculous and seem like they have not been very well implemented sniper rifles and mgs are still a bit ridiculous and need some balancing(in terms of movement and how you ADS) not as many weapons as Arma II Inventory pretty good for Arma seems like Arma III has good bullet and shooting physics(im not much of an expert they seem pretty good) im kinda annoyed that you dont have different ammo for suppresed weapons and suppresed weapons seem to behave the same way as unsuppressed weapons AI is better than Arma II but is still pretty  and almost usless in when it comes to CQC(would definatly reccomend getting mods to improve the AI) and i'm pretty much done Big improvement in terms of the map design I do enjoy the new Altis and Stratis maps I would definatly reccomend this game if you enjoyed Arma II.  Also link below on some of 's cool features   v  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHYUYOR0mw0   Linke Below on how 's keybindings could be improved  v   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryxXLJoGLqQ 10
he only problem with  is... the lack of content. The arma 2 had such a great community and mods and even the game had more guns and armor at the start than . I just can't understand why devs did not put in stuff like bipods advanced first aid helicopter features portable MG's and on and on that arma 2 had. So if you buy  you get a bit more 'polished' arma but with the lack of good multiplayer servers and simplicity in game experience. So if you are new to the  its fine you wont even know what im talking about and go ahead its a great game. But if you were a fan of arma 2 like me you will just be dissapointed about the multiplayer content and community pick. And Bohemia Interactive seems to like EA principles of marketing game. Its hilarious that they are trowing out DLC's that enable you so basic thing as a rope hook on a helicopter for 15$! Which it should have already be in the game?! So the final tought is still a good game but the devs ed it up big time. 6.5/10 So wake up Bohemia and stop being so lazy and dull to the fan base. And if you have to rip people off with DLC's put at least a fair price of 5$ instead of 15$.10
Really good game some bugs tho
reat Game. It is not a 'just shoot' shooter no this game has some very advanced mechanisms which bring this game up to a new stage of depth. Certainly worth the money10
Stop trying to look for bad reviews; Positives: It's not CoD. It's not Battlefield. Holy  I'm actually having fun. 10/10.
Extremely frustrating at times but well worth the buy.
Great game And Very Fun. Altis Life Is Great You will Love This Game.
Best damn game out there. Just get it. Now.
Great. and its only going to get better!
h where to begin with ....   I had just landed on a beach in a rubber boat with my four man team. We are assaulting enemy positions to capture intel and eliminate a HVT. Soon after landing we are ambushed by an enemy assault boat that promply decimates my team. I manage to land a rocket hit on the boat and incapacitate its crew before it can annihilate me. With the boat disabled I am now on my own. Do I continue the mission by myself or do I abort and let my team die for nothing? I choose to continue using a silenced weapon to help conceal my position. I call for friendly reinforcments to begin the assault on the town. A convoy with friendly troops starts coming down the road. Suddenly rockets from a hilltop position begin to rain down on the convoy disabling several vehicles. Everyone dismounts and begins engaging the enemy on the hilltop. I use the distraction to flank the enemy position and eliminate the fireteam. We proceed towards the town eliminating small pockets of resistance along the way. Suddenly we are pinned down by enemy machinegun fire that kills several friendlies. I call in an airstrike that levels the houses containing the position eliminating the threat along with the HVT. I then see a target of opportunity: an enemy cargo truck. I align my sights slightly above the target to compensate for the distance and fire. The truck erupts into flames. This came at a price as my postion was compromised and drew heavy enemy fire towards my position. We have no choice but to engage. After several bloody minutes four enemy fireteams lay dead on the battlefield with only light casualties on our side. I decide this is the moment to assault the position containing the intel. I successfully acquire the intel and call in an evac chopper to extract me to a safe position. We extract under fire and secure the intel dealing a severe blow to the enemy.  10/1010
This game is amazing. There's just no other way to describe it.
it is a amazing game butt it has sum hikups
Great game! I have a Military Simulation unit called the MSOT 8203 and the mods we use with  are sick! One of the best games i've played hands down.
I really enjoyed this game i love of the possiable missions the easy editor the amazing story line the only part i dont like about this game is the fact that i have to pay another 32 dollars for marksman dlc and helicopters dlc which should just be a part of the game where i dont need to pay another 16 dollars just to be a sniper as i loved to be on arma 2 i do highly reccomend this game its a must play
 is a great game it allows you to witness the harse conditions in war .
omparing Arma 2 to . Arma 2 has more content but  has more features. Once it has all the content it will be fantastic10
Very fun game that you can loose yourself in the country tiles hours of game play all thanks to a great community that keep putting one great mod after another
Where do i start?  Overall A great game! Allthough the optimization is not too great the mod support on this game is amazing The campaign somehow makes sense and comes together The new Go-Kart DLC is also great aswell!  10
really good game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a few bugs but great1
This is probley the best game iv played. Good graphics and realisme!
wesome game updated recently. Endless hours of fun.10
11/10 I once got into a fight with a cow could not defeat him 2 strong 4 mi!
Fun game A3L Mod and altis life (No Mod Needed) RPG Are in my opinion the best i would reeccomend this game to any and all gamers!!
this game is the best
ust &lt;3 it. Will still be playing in a year maybe even two.10
reat servers to play on but it is not optimized very well.10
 was killed and i spawned in the middle of nowhere began running to god knows where suddenly i heard the sounds of a plane looked up there it was it landed smoothly in front of me 2 men came out i was cautious but i didnt shoot just yet 'would you like to join us on our space adventure?' hell ing yes i will we got in about 13km in the air we're struck by lightning pilot says 'dont worry i can land us safely' alright ok cool pilot turns off engine we crash into a mountain they both died but i survived looted their bodies  note to self: never go on space adventures10
.5/10 not really a sim but it's pretty well made and there's a huge community.10
Not a game. It's a military simulator.
Great game I have had many hours of fun. One of the best military (if not the best) i have played.
Awesome!!! Cant wait for Arma 4!!!
ven though it's not as optimized as it could be this game is an absolute gem. I remember that scene from Black Hawk Down where they call in a chopper throw a IR grenade on the roof and the chopper comes in to save the day. i experienced that on a normal public server and that is the thing about Arma. whether you're in to competitive pvp survival mods usergenerated singleplayer missions or HUGE COOP operations this game's got it 10/1010
I think this is the only game where I feel satisfied with every frag of mine and don't ragequit after every 100 death streak.
his games is awesome just the amount of stuff you can do because of all the diffrent mods and game modes there are. if you like first person shooters this is the one you should get.10
games sick
This is the most realistic game I have ever played. Controls are hard to adjust to but if you like military simulators you will love this game 10.5/10
 is an heavly optimized Arma 2 but still with bugs that are not getting fixed and in some 'game modes' there are some heavly Over Powered weapons but nobody cares about this because its a game that can make your whole day if you play it with 1 or more friends. Also  is a Military simulation that also has a singleplayer that is quite interesting and on its own way difficult!  8/10 would recommend
Good game Nice to kill all the time
get mods makes the gmae way better.
reat fun if you like role playing or if you love realistic combat.10
Stunning Graphics! Realistic game play! Total Emersion type Training!
o fun so many mods this game is awesome.10
Good... I brought for $30 gameplay is not for cod kids or team fortress or Counter strike. It's slow-paced and is very fun when the action gets going   But this isnt Bohiema's fault.... It's steam so i wanted to get a refund on it because i couldn't run it becasue i played on the free weekend thing... So i keep playing this game even though i told steam the reason. But really good game
Really awesome game i give it a 10/10 for gameplay. There are still many issues with this game though. You constantly fall through stairs and break your legs randomly. You just have to be really careful with stairs.10
This is 1 of the best military games ive seen yet
Goodbye fps.
A great addition to the arma series! Great gameplay and controls with an ever expanding arsenal and range of vehicles. Graphics are top notch with tones of new mods coming out all the time too! A must buy for fans of the genre.
Highly suggest getting this game. I found it highly addictive and love making new missions. Also if you dont have a decent PC dont bother  is best at its full quality and i couldn't stand playing it when my old computer couldn't handle it.10
What more to say about a game that has been critically praised by everyone! The one gripe I have about this game is the ridiculous server optimization that it has!!! BIS should try and fix that and then everything is golden! :)
i shoot stuff 10/10
It's alright.
If someone is looking for a military shooter where they want:  1. To make their own Campaigns 2. Experience Realism as well as absurdity 3. Mod Support 4. Replay Value  This game is for you.
WARNING : Do not buy the EXTENDED Edition for 59.99 Euro unless you want to waste 23.99 / 29.99 Euro because the upcoming Extension called APEX is NOT included.  The developer already took the Extended Edition off their webshop and is selling the APEX Edition (like Extended Edition + APEX extension) for the same price : 59.99 Euro.  APEX is an extension coming out Q2 2016 and is not included in the Extended Edition.  You will have to purchase it seperately or purchase the APEX Edition of the game.  You can already pre-order the Extension at the developers webshop with 20% discount at 23.99 Euro.
This is a very awesome game. It should be called military simmulator because it is very realistic. Also it is a very demanding game on your hardware Loved it. I will buy it in the next few weeks.10
Needs more goat tho 10/10
Action packed game. (it Works best when you are in a comunity) Come joing  IGGHQ.com  TS:  eu.igghq.com
Absolutely fantastic
Great game to play Strongly suggested to play with a clan for best experience10
fps drops in multiplayer and nobody cares about it i can say its still on beta version
Where do I begin?  ARMA the top game for being the only realistic war simulator sadly it makes you enjoy it but hey virtual reality is for that no?  ARMA does give you this expierience where you fear a bullet where flanking smokes aiming actually matters I have missed so many shots for not adjusting my zeroing or not thinking about bullet drop since you get a panic reaction shot.  I have been in a ARMA unit which taught me the basics like using the compass bearing for pointing out objects enemies tactics and callsigns. I would say the game is best for the unit deal since that way this game is pushed to its true meaning.  We have ARMA life or so called 'Altis Life' which esentially is a roleplay quite weird and difficult but if you get used to it you will enjoy it as well  The game is well optimised but there are certain glitches through it I have to be honest I don't kind of like how the movement feels limited but you get used to it and with some new things added it feels more solid.  The mechanics well they feel real. Sound weird now? Well the thing is a bullet will usuallu kill you mines will destroy cars and 50. cals will make you  bricks. You can simply get a chopper down with a decent rifle just by knowing where to shoot you can bring down a tank with the right way and you can survive a fight by using tactics and patience. The game plays like nothing else. You will deal with fatigue you will deal will bullet wounds and you will panic. But with time you will learn how to handel it.  DLC oh how I love DLC.... No it is not worth the time grab it on a good discount since it just feels lame the only good one is the Marksmen DLC which does add some new mechanics and weapons but over all it is just not worth it.  In conclusion the game is well made not the best maybe but still this is something better then your CoD
Its a great game buy it
This is better than Arma 2 FPS is boosted depending on the server you joing though overall 8/10
Hello  Let me start this out by saying I myself have played 1372 hours of this game from the date of this review.  or Armed Assault 3 is a sandbox military simulation.  has a variety of game-modes ranging from Invade and Annex (A more objective based team oriented game-mode) Altis Life (A game-mode that is basically well... life you can buy cars houses boats guns etc. You can have many jobs such as Police Officer Rebel Drug Lord or anything of your imagination really.) Wasteland (A more survival based game-mode where you can team up with friends or other players to survive complete objectives earn money kills others and buy equipment) Along with a variety of other modded gamemodes ranging from Milsim type game-modes to more casual game-modes. If you are into any sort of military simulation survival or roleplaying type games you should definently give  a shot especially with the new Steam refund policy so you can try it for up to 2 hours and if you like it keep it. Now is it worth the $60 dollars? For me it is well worth your $60 as I got a lot more out of this game than any normal priced $60 game. Now for the DLC that is totally up to you as you can play on any server and even ride and even sometimes pick up the DLC content it does not separate the community at all. Though depending on your system hardware the game may be very hard to run though with some tweaks found in forums and videos it can improve your framerate by a lot. To sum it up  is a great game for what is it.  - TooSpooky
Excellent and fun game that gives you a lot of fun and options for the price. However the engine is rather poor making catching as stable framerate or even a decent one can be difficult sometimes even with some fairly high end rigs.
amazing game for roleplayers and pew pew survival
just noticed i had never written a comment down here so let's write.  so i'll good points bad points.  good ones:  It's an arma game. It was made by bohemia interactive. there are guns. God damn CHOPPERS Dev care about the community The community is freaking good well... most of the time DLC don't penalyze anyone and the features of these are free  Dev still add new things (for instance DLC marksmen tomorrow adding working bipods resting on objects new guns and all this kind of ) they're currently working on a new map they'll surely add many unknown things.  The freacking mods i mean in this game if you want a ing private jet riding a horse with a sword there's probably someone who made it and if not you can do it yourself (it's a long  work but you can).  now bad points:  Physics you make a vehicle explode by driving 3mph towards a rock but you won't explode if you make a 180 landing on a spruce tree from a god damn ac-130 which comes from a mod...  Some people in the community especially the ones who complains about DLC's that add free content..  Not enough planes there are several choppers civilians and military but there are only fighter jets and drones as fixed-wings.  And finally hellicopter advanced physics which is some kind of weird crossing between the  style and some kind of reallistic but not too much physics i find it pretty weird but meh..   So buy this game this was an order 
I could write 10k words about how awesome this game is. But I am just naming one example for now: You can be the leader of an entire Army - in underwear.
An impressively complex and yet easy to enjoy military sim game...you can spend your time designing massive battles and engagements or flying around as a helicopter pilot...or covertly leading a squad behind enemy lines....or directing mortar fire....a really great game.
arma is life life is arma!
Its alright yeah.
very good game cant just run around like a headless chicken and shoot everything. If you want to spend hours on a game andto have a real tactical battlefeild experience this is the game for you
An amazing game. Was able to play it free for a weekend. Had so much fun! Anyone who can afford it should get it IMMEDIATELY
I just started playing and I'm hooked.This is by far one of the best simulators I've ever played . I am recommending this game If you are into shooters. The realism of  is amazing. This is no Call of Duty or Battlefield.
Amazing game great community. It can be modded easily allowing wide access to user-made content.   DLC isn't mandatory unlike a lot of games and there is frequent free updates adding new features.  Well worth the money that it's being sold for.
Its a great game to Role-Play.
Great tactical shooter/sim . The game needs more team on team . Im not a big fan of playing AI .
; is simply the best tactical shooter available to the general public at this time.  9.5/10  If you want a realistic virtual platform to practise and test real-world military tactics this is the one. Plug in TrackIR or Oculus rift and you'll soon be working harder than you have in your life to move your squad 20m deeper into a heavily defended enemy town whilst your attached armed personell carriers volley in suppressive fire from the elevated position you stationed them 1 km South. And when you need those APC's to prioritize their fire onto an enemy weapons squad that's pinning you down issue the order and they will comply.  On a less serious note if you want a great multiplayer combined-arms experience which feels less 'gamey' than the generic FPS this will also satisfy you. Want an fast-paced urban-combat experience where real skill is rewarded and spray and pray is punished? This is it.  In reality ARMA is somewhat difficult to compare to anything else available because there is nothing else with the level of detail that ARMA has when it comes to weapon models ballistics wounding systems (in ARMA there are memory locations for each major bone in the human body which means you can break your lower arm bone upper arm bone lower leg bone e.t.c.) AI material penetration (walls do not stop large rounds) and the maps are pretty huge. 270km squared is bigger than a lot of real-world cities and often having a skilled pilot who can get your squad to the combat area using the terrain as cover so as to avoid lockon by enemy AA missiles will be the difference between a win and a loss. ARMA is actually not even a video game in many sense. It's more a realistic training tool which can be played as a game.  Teamplay. Nothing like it. Struggle together or die alone. The level of danger and lethality in the ARMA series has always promoted teamwork and cooperation leading to incredibly satisfying experiences where you and friends and sometimes total strangers will overcome staggering odds. The combat medic drags a wounded teammate out of an open killzone. He's taking fire. The wounded man remembers to give his contact report - he saw muzzle flash from an enemy weapon 0.2 seconds before he went down and he knows to use muzzle velocity to calculate the distance; 'In the building two-hundred-and-fifty-meters to the North. First floor.' His radio goes silent. He has passed out from a combination of blood loss and shock. You realise the passed out man is your teamleader so you assume command ordering your machinegunner and grenadier to direct heavy fires into the first floor windows and smoke grenades in front of the enemy position to suppress and reduce the accuracy of the enemy shooter keeping your medic from catching 2 lethal 7.62 rounds in the torso. The enemy shooter is determined and smart. He's moved back in the room and is firing through a sliver of window. He knows your machinegunner doesn't know exactly where he is. The fire is still coming in. The enemy shooter hits the window rim and the round deflects way off target. His next shot is interrupted by a hail of incoming rounds from your teams machinegunner; blind-fire still kills but after ducking for a moment the shooter is back on target. As he aims he is shook by a 40mm grenade exploding on the exterior of his building but he knows high explosive ain't getting through a concrete wall and an enemy medic is a prize target. His weapon raises... Your medic is only 25 meters from cover now but that might as well be a mile. Dragging a 90kg man along with a combined total of 50kg of weapons and equipment is slowing his movement substantially. You know if your medic goes down it's game over. Your team will scramble to treat the two men become combat-ineffective and be surrounded and killed in that construction site. You know you can't go to help him because the first rule of infantry combat is use cover and don't get shot - the last thing your team needs is two men wounded instead of one. You know your machinegunner doesn't have an exact target and with the amount of fire he's putting down he'll be lucky to hit anything. You know 40mm high explosive grenades don't penetrate concrete walls... It seems like the medic will go down soon. Surely the enemy machinegunner will deploy and deliver grazing fire across the field in a matter of seconds cutting down everything under two meters for a long long way including your medic. You lean out and blindly fire to the North feeling in the back of your mind that the mission will soon fail. Unless... Suddenly you hear a single shot from a rifle. It sounds very different to the machinegun fire that has been crackling for the past 10 seconds. A second shot a moment later. Looking over your left shoulder you see a trail of smoke disappating around a tree about 30 meters behind your position. The smoke is from the business end of the rifle of your teams designated marksman. 'Enemy marksman neutralized North building first floor. Enemy machinegunner neutralized West corner of that building' he says on the radio. Enemy fire starts coming in from the North-West but its sporadic and innacurate; the enemy squad is trying to keep you pinned whilst it reorganizes after having lost its long range and volume-fire capabilities but those rounds are being deflected by the wind and they're landing way off target. You calculate from the delay between impact and report that it's from over 600 meters out. Your marksman reports on the radio again; 'Engaging enemy rifleman. 550 meters North-North-West'. You smile watching your medic treat your teamleader both now in cover. Your marksman will be on the radio again soon you feel...  Another amazing thing about  is its versatility; you can load up almost any scenario imaginable and jump right in - there's a reason the militaries of the world use software from the same development house to train real-world troops.  The level of support from the developers is also unparallelled. At the time of this review it's 2 years after release date and they are about to release the 2nd of 3 major updates which add massive value to the game and they do it free.  500 000 Euro's prize money to the people who develop the best content for ? Yes. And what great content it has been. Years of campaigns and multiplayer gamemodes and thousands of kilometers of official and community terrains.  In short it's the best realistic military simulator with more gamemodes than you could imagine and more than 1000 square kilometers of map to run swim drive fly and most of all strategize on in around through and above.  If your interest in or studies of military procedures and tactics is urging you to test your mettle  is the place to do it. I even know some real-world soldiers who train with friends on the ARMA platform.  Do it.
If you played Arma 2 and loved it there is a solid chance you will love . They are two games that have so much in common but  offers new and unique features all at the same time.
I just played this game for a few hours by now.  Besides that I still want to review the game and will edit this post if my opinion changes within the near future.    GAME MODES/MODS I PLAYED
Everything I expected over the years of not having a PC strong enough to handle this has now come to light and it is everything that I expected. Nothing more..
Great.
Fun milsim with great comunity servers and gamemodes
The Game is quite fun but you shouldn't olay it alone it's more fun to play in a squad. This game is based on Roleplay and patience don't eypect everything to work a 1st try.  
Finally a game thats actully realistic not like cod or battlefeild this game is fun to play the game has a variety of cars planes helis boats subs cars tanks and trucks if you like shooters but like realism i will recommed this game
I have gone through a lot in this game. From going to war to surviving in a Wasteland to outwitting a mugger trying to take my money. It has taught me so much that it has turned my real life situtation around in my favor. It taught me the doctrine of the military and even though I have no military service now I went from seeing war as needless bickering to it as a absolute need for Humanity. Fun fact (Have a bunch of these thanks to  but curiosity got me on this one) Parabellum (from 9mm ammo type) means from Latin to English: if you seek peace prepare for war. Now take this or leave it but I get chicks like crazy now thanks to  (Not joking either). Now you can sit on your butt and wonder what the heck your doing on this godforsaken planet or you can play a wonderful game that is in favor of everyone. Your friends will see a new you and you'll know how to shoot a gun even if you never have shot a firearm. You'll also know how bullet ballistics work and how to do everything military. Warning: Saluting to yourself in the mirror will occur if overexposure to  occurs. Withdrawal symptoms will occur which include talking to one self talking about survival of the fittest and how you know how to shoot a rifle without ever having shot one. Now I'm not saying to go sign up to your nearest recruiter but this game will teach you not only how to become the best soldier ever but your perception on war and life will change FOREVER. Also you are going to need a MONSTER of a computer to get good looking graphics like the screenshots. War is hell and this game will teach you that. Be careful and see you on the flip side.
95/10 great graphics and gameplay. buy this game if you want to: -make your own mission -be a solider -be a pilot -be a tank crew -be a civilian with a better life then you :P -die of mines -want to move from bf 4/3/hardline -love teamwork  if any of them over match what you want/do buy this game
 is an advanced military simulator wiht a fairly good story. Hours of content. A massive online community. Thousands of mods to change and inprove the game and finally a massive fanbase. There is not much I can say about the third installation of Arma that hasn't been said. The graphics are beautiful. The AI are amazing once you learn to control them. The story is decent and the community is not garbage unlike what you'll find on some games. I 100% recommend  and will say for all my friends who have asked me recently  is worth $60+ dollars for the game and DLC.
After the 523 hr I have played  I have meet new friends I have joined and made groups and had some epic battles Its an amazing game every thing is at it best in  the pyhisics combat movments wepons and many more!  10/10
brilliant time for all the family diverce game type etc. would recommend
A must to have if you like combat simulation. To increase even more the immersion i also suggest to install mods like ACE3 or Task Force Radio
 love this game so much. The only downside that I have about it is when I join up on an Altis Life server a lot of the police will just shoot you on site without you doing anything illegal. There are other servers though that the police are actually amazing and will role play well with you as long as you are not rude to them. Overall it's an amazing game and I love it so much.10
Arma3   where to begin well I know i've only clocked up 254hours i know that does not make me a expert at this game but i have say in those 254hours i've had a blast in playing this game the single player gameplay is great and the mulitplayer is ever better there is a number of mods your can get from the steam workshop some of wihtch look fantastic.  the pros  great gameplay both in single and mulitplayer  the cons  price is a bit high at over £30 and the dlc's are high as well  P.S i would recommend that you get this game yes the price tag is a bit high but atm the game is 50% off so go buy buy buy
this is a great game
Awesome fun with mates 10/10 wud play king of the hill again
Real Life Cartel 10/10 Would scream Allau Akhbar again
ts a creative game you can do just about anything you want Open sandbox it's about an endless amount of space you can do anything you want pretty much. Thers the missions that are with the game that are part of the main campaign or you can pretty much create your own missions.     If you have the time you could probably create your own campaign for . The amount of Freedom that this game gives you Is crazy cuz I mean after you're finished playing with the campaign and all that you can edit the world build your own bases make your own factions and basically change how the game plays.    So when are really comes down to it it really depends on how you play it how you play the game what you do with the game because it's not just only a military simulator it can be just about anything you wanted to be. This would pretty much what makes this game unique and fun. I would recommend this game to just about anybody.10
ts ing dope if you have a community like me to play with!10
Probably had some of the most fun with this on Wasteland. Totally worth every penny!
Superb quality military simulator. 10/10
One of the best games ever IMO. I personally play to much of it.
Looks fun...to bad I just played for a little bit
Really great FPS game if you are looking for a realistic shooter.
Get this game if you don't have nor want a life.  :'-)
this is really fun the best modes on multiplayer to play are altis life takistan life wasteeland on both stratis and altis and my favorite is invadeand annex preferably on altis but still fun on stratis too.
 have played  for a while now and feel like I should give it a review.   is basically THE war SIMULATOR! If you are looking for some awesome realistic wars you have found your game. There are A LOT of gamemodes online each on is different. The amount of mods and user created content for the game is insane. You can create your OWN missions and play the with your friends or share them on the workshop.  There is only one HUGE drawback to this game. Due to it looking so good you will need a GOOD pc. That's the only the biggest issue I came across.   The interface is one of the things I think could be different but I dont know how. Mabey with the use of a some sort 'action key' could make it a bit less gimmecky.  Afterall I would totally recommend this game but DONT expect it to be anywhere like cod or bf. Its totally diffrent.  Worth the price I paid with the summer sales! :D10
is not a game is a platform The ingame editor and the steam workshop together with the realistic graphics terrains and ballistics provide enough content to keep you playing for years to come and yes you can also play day z mod on .10
Great game. Love it !!!
Great game with a lot of amazing mods. Definitely recommended to ppeople looking for a realistic shooter.
Great Game!
Do you like milsim? Do you like steep learning curve? Then this is the game for you. pew pew
hat a game this is! been playing it for years now and there's constantly new stuff to do! If you're into shooters army simulators and RPG then I'd definitely reccommend this game without a doubt!!10
his game is very fun! Both Singleplayer and Multiplayer. However it depends on what server you find you may find a  one at first and rethink the choice you made about buying this game. Or you can find an AMAZING server and absolutely fall in love with the game. If you find one of those bad servers keep searching! You can find that one server that is fit for you! Best Army Sim you can find out there! This game is a BIG $60 but trust me it is worth $100!10

I just think this game is the defenition of best gunplay in arma. It has a mixture of realistic gun actions and (if you like to ruin the game) you can flay it like a twitch shooter.
I rate 10 out of 10 good game full of action and tons of feautres
ell having clocked nearly 1300hrs on this game I have a great idea of what this game can and cannot provide to what a player would expect to find inside. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a team based game if you run solo you will most likely end up dead very soon. This is nothing like the Battlefield series or CoD.  is it's own type of game. It takes hours to march from one end of the larger map Altis to the other. The vanilla  is good as it is but the sheer volume of mods and community created content will ensure you almost never get bored of it. Arma can provide everything from small 2-5 man squad insurgency operations to 100+ player all out war to post-apocalyptic survival in the Breaking Point mod. This game is however not without its bugs; take for example when I tried flipping an MRAP with a tank only to have my tank launch in the air 300m and kill me when it landed. But good and bad combined this is by far the best game I've played in a VERY long while. 10/10 would recommend.10
 love this game. I cannot stress that enough. As a major fan of sims(especially military) I just can't get enough of playing it! Love HUGE maps? . Love to make scenarios that can pan out differently every time? . Love being shot from a mile away never knowing who hit you? Then  is for you! And thanks to the intelligent and creative community we never run out of stuff to add to the game to make it more enjoyable. I bought it during a sale but if I had to I would pay full price.10
has got to be the greatest open worls fps/Third person shooter on steam. It's combat is realistic and satisfying especially in vehicle like jets because of its challenging but rewarding flight model. This game also has a brilliant modding communtiy and it keeps the game fresh and excititng. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has interest in fps/ third person open worls games.10
ts like sex If you get with the right people you'll be hooked-11
un game to play especially with friends. I seemed to have been having lag or sensitivity problems with my screen movement but other than that it is a really cool military simulation that you can really get into. I would recommend this to anyone that likes real immersive and tactical combat and who also even enjoys a bit of role-playing. The graphics are great and the content is pretty cool. I've only played a few multiplayer and mission games with friends but I definately enjoyed myself.10
is a very intense and beautiful game. If you've ever played arma 1 or arma 2 you would know that it is a huge game from its single player campaigns to multiplayer modes and the community with their custom missions scripts and mods. This game offers the player a good fountadion to a war-sim game especially if you're playing with people and even better with a clan. All u can say is if you like war games and into simulators you'll definatly like Arma!10
very cool very nice i like it
I find the controls a little complex and weird. Only get 30 fps ;-; but graphics are beautiful  In terms of actual gameplay I don't really know what to say yet (20+ hours when writing this reiew) It takes a lot of patience though
 very good game for either playing properly with tactics or just having fun with friends. even the campaign and scenarios although difficult they can be a good pass time.  Although it is a very realistic game in terms of physics and pretty much everything. this isnt a game for those who wish to fly around the map and do whatever they want because they can you are bound by the laws of physics. you can still fly though.10
Very Good and Fun Game
wsome game most realistic game I have eaver played love it! 10/1010
ery nice fixed what ARMA 2 had problems with. Still has some small problems. -Physics -FPS -Lag But really? Its Arma get over it. 10
This game is the best war simulator i have ever played. I feel i'm in the field and danger is everywhere around. Its about tactics and COOP with your teammates.
My hours in game alone should say enough.
Another great game made by Bohemia.
IT IS AN AWESOME GAME I WOULD KILL FOR IT
ased on a true experience...   My friend Kevin one random solider on our team and I hopped into an attack helicopter. Kevin piloted us towards the daunting airbase that was invested with opposing fighters. From high up in the sky we saw tiny dots of soldiers moving about alongside menacing tanks. The sound of explosions pierced the early morning air as we flew. Shrouds of fire illuminated the sky. We were attempting to rendezvous with our other teammates when...all of a sudden an alarm broke out in our helicopter. A missile was headed right toward us. As soon as the missile hit our perception of sound was overwhelmed with whirling wind and explosions. We had to make an emergency exit parachuting to the dangerous battlefield below...    10/1010
Best Game In The World
this game is incredible!
rma III takes a very realistic approach to military shooters which leads to having the player formulate advanced tactics and communicate with his allies to execute said tactics. Shooting mechanics feel great and different from what players are used to. Player movement is rigid and limited just like a person's would be although these restrictions can be annoying at times. The way Bohemia Interactive managed DLC for this game is also absolutely amazing since their strategy doesn't divide the player-base and still earns them profit. The only downside I find is how unpolished it feels. There are numerous visual glitches the game runs like crap on most devices and the animations are a bit hard to look at. It's overall a fantastic game/simulator but it desperately needs more visual polish. 9/1010
there is another world wich  is a Dice game and produced by Frostbite. then i have +1000 hrs on record and i write here 'great game-great servers-no bug'.
hat a fantastic game!   The gameplay is fantastic and the variety of things to do is amazing. The graphics are stunning however it is more difficult to run at a higher FPS than other games (because there are lots of things going on at the same time). The maps are huge especially Atlis and there are many ways to get around.  However the 'lagginess' depends a lot on the server you are in and your latency so it sometimes takes a while to find a good server it is best to find one in the same country as you are.  I would totally recommend this game! 9/1010
. What is ? Is it like Counter Strike or Battlefield? A. Nope. Its more akin to GTA or Saints Row but with realism instead.  Q. Say what? It's open world with missions and stuff? A. Yes totes!  Q. So it isn't an FPS? A. It can be played first or third person.  Q. What stuff can I do? A. You can use tanks apc's helicopters boats submarines cars jets UAV's rocket launchers machine guns grenades command troops and a whole bunch more.  Q. And game modes? A. There is a campaign with a storyline there are single scenarios you can play there is multiplayer with all kinds of co-op or competitive gameplay and there is even a mission editor and extensive mod support.   That means the community (and you!) can create any scenario you have in mind in the editor and play it in singleplayer multiplayer against other players or AI.  Q. Wait.. what? I can make my own stuff and play it with friends? A. I know right!  Q. So.. how would you rate it? A. 7.9 aubergines - get it!10
One of my favorite games of all time you can build bases play campaign multiplayer all that good stuff i recommend!
Game =  Mods+Game = Good
est game ever.. hands down the most realistic first and third person shooter ive ever played just get it.10
By far the best game on steam i think 10/10
great game and would recomend
reat military game with loads of gadgets Vehicles and customization!!   10 out of 10!!!10
I would totally recommend this game for those who have the money :P
nother amazing game to the Arma series fully supported for the modding community so there is always fresh and new ideas and game modes coming into the game amazing simulation and realism.  10/1010
My computer is in the 99th percentile on 3Dmark and this game still lags.  10/10
THE best and most realistic combat simulator ever created.   Nothing compares.
Great game and wouldn't swap it for any other and I got a great community to back me up on that
ove how I can just open Eden Editor up and edit a mission In live 3D so many great mods and much more to this game then first glance I love infantry battles and tracers at night are beautiful till one hits you in the face!10
hen I got this game I thought it wasnt going to be that great and figured it would be one of those games that I play if I can not think of anything else to play. But now I am 700 hours in and I still play it almost every day. That being said I highly recommend this game. There is a lot of different things you can do in it like wasteland roleplay stuff and many other game modes. There is also a lot of mods out there that make the game completley different and make it even more enjoyable. The game is very CPU intensive though so make sure you have a good cpu and a decent graphics card and the game will run fine most of the time anyways.10
ook cool kill people be in the future. Reload keep looking cool be in the future.10
tacticool dogs need to be added 90/1
Played first 150hours without mods. Then installed mods and realised mods are ing great and plays 300hours more. Then I managed to break the game with mods and cant join online sessions anymore. 5/5 would break game again
I probably spend more time finding and downloading mods than playing.
Wasteland 100% fun and annoying at the same time
possibly the greatest game ever made....
I deeply reccomend this game to people that love realistic fps games :)
his game is amazing now im kinda late to the reveiw cause I have almost 2k hours but the game is really good and the modder community makes it even better10
AWSOME GAME with many MODS :D
lays wasteland server for 3 days straight and has every gun armor piece and driveable piece of  in game. goes on next day to find its all been stolen. 10/10 would buy new break hand destroying moniter again10
ery good at what it does which is being a mil-sim. You'll be dissapointed if you buy this expecting it to be like any other fps.  Best looking game of 2013 so far.10
f you want some thrill and reality frustration along with good graphicsthis is your war game. Good luck avoiding those bullets flying over your head. Teamwork is a must  If there is a (-) here for me is that you really need patience and hours to master the controls in order to enjoy it.10
ase game for a hell of a big community of modding and custom games good fun was a bit bit pricey but sales happen alot.10
amn is this a fun game. I love . While it still has a few iffy features from ARMA 2 like the all terrible context menu this game is a gift that keeps on giving. If you like mission making this game has one of the best mission makers I have ever seen. If you like tactical shooters this is one of the best. Get together with some friends or randoms and do military like operations. Or maybe you like a more casual shooter this has that too. With modes like King of the Hill or just plain deathmatch you can play it just like a shooter albeit way more fun. With modes like Zeus you can make missions easily on the fly with friends and have great fun. I really recommend this game as it has given me many hours of entertainment.10
 loves me some ! Tons of custom levels on Steam Workshop and an ongoing episodic campaign and other single player content - showcase and challenge levels. There are a lot of controls in this game. My winning combination for controls is a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro for flying and a Razer Hydra motion controller for on foot. Another great thing is even though there are a lot of controls in this game you can dual purpose a lot of keys/buttons such as one key/button can mean three things depending on if u hit it once twice or hold it.10
robably the most realistic game out there Well most of the time... great for hours of fun. I have played Arma since Arma 2 free.10
et me just start by saying brillant game best i have ever played. Great military simulation but the game is like buying servral games for a good price because of the varities of modes and missions such as all the workshop mods missions campain multiplayer modes like wasteland king of the hill and the vast amount of missions. But what i loved the most in my 120 hours game time was the multiplayer mode Altis Life as it was such good fun and so much roleplay you could be anything a criminal cop civilian rebel and even a taxi driver and i find this amazing. If you want servral games for cheap then  is just right for you. military simulation or even a realistic life simulator then this game is for you. Beaking point (zombies) Epoch (post apoch) Life (real life sim) many mods and already built in game modes are waiting for you. I totally recommend it to anyone who likes FPS Multiplayers CO-OP Sandbox Simulation and Roleplay10
ne of the best shooters out there and very realistic an outstanding game.10
It's cool
sunk way to many hours in to this and still yet to get board
est military sim game out there . But alot of bugs and you need a beast pc to run this. The game itself is like 4-5/10  but when you get some mods (breaking point  overpoch  epoch  wasteland etc.) it becomes very fun and i rate it a solid 8.5/1010
.. a briliant simulator! A finely made game and detail is top notch. The game is amazing to play with friends and just members of the community good communities are rare to come across but Arma has always delivered a fun experience balancing realism with fun aswell.10
reat game with many diffrent ways to play it MILSims RP or just target practice with your friends you can do it all in .10
This game looks great and its all you need in a millitary game now a days so i might buy it
bsolutely the best shooter experience I've ever had bar none. 10/10 would recommend fifty more times. Take my hours as my seal of approval.10
After many months of waiting we all have finally a good product in line with others arma serie sims....i can say without hairs on toungue...yes...it's a game to purchase absolutely because it's the only simulation that give to all players who want some in more about realism and gameplay.Can be a bit frustrating at start cause it's a sim and not a game but anyway you can also set it as a game ....more easy as you want .It is a sim settable really as you desire in all aspects...so...now there is nomore excuses for to say i wait a bit for to have it Finally the second island of the game called Altis it's a capolavour of design ...go to check there all the hundreds of things into Altis map and you ll see the delicious attention for the more fine details.The AI is improved as sound 3D and in general all you did like into arma serie is here in more detailed graphic and sound with a new engine.
Buys Game Spend 30 minutes optimizing. Goto to mission maker. Work on mission for 5 hours Gets 2 fps Crys Deletes mission and never talk about it again. Friend ask me to make mission. Flashback Cry  10/10 would get ptsd from mission making.
It's like Arma 2 but the 3'rd one
good game  very decent mods   but car physics are ing   recommended.
 is a very good first/third person war simulator that successfully simulates what is actually like to fight in battles. And lets say you getting bored with some of the standared war scenarios then you can easily download a mod off of workshop and play that instead.  is defintely for you if your looking for a fun game that really captures good gun play and enhanced environments.
his is one of my all time favorite games. It is the most realistic shooter that you can buy. Prople are writing that you want your money back after 2 hours so get ready. Well thats just stupid to write because most if the time when you buy this game. YOU WILL LOVE IT. ALTHOUGH I cant tell you how annoying this is is when people dont look at the systen requirments purchase the game and then give it a bad review cause it cant run. SO PLEASE go look at the system requirments. People complain about the dlc. Its not a problem. They are discounted more now. And they add somethibg worthwile to the game. More helicopters snipers etc. I say you go and buy the dlc. I recommend Apex and Marksman DLC. Although I bought everything cause this game is that good. Also this game is one of the most moddable games and that makes it even better. And the 3d editor is one of the best ive ever seen. So now if you think ot can run GO BUY IT!10
Great Game. Even better with friends. Best experience.
ne of my top games for the past two years! A must especially with all the mods (Life TacBF Epoch etc.)!10
?t's a good RPG game.
i recommend this game.
 have spent a good amount of time in this game both singleplayer and multiplayer. And I have to say this game can literally become any game you want. = Obviously  is built for epic tactical action gameplay. The base game involves around military atmosphere: tanks attack jets attack boats armored cars soldiers and helicopters; all of those can be accessed right away after you purchase the game and install it. = The game has many complicated systems and machanics such as commanding the AIs (it's a real pain in the butt) seats in vehicles stances movements interaction menu etc. This is why many new players feel disencouraged and quit playing the game. But if you are a tough gamer and able to deal with difficulties then this game might be for you. = As I said earlier you can experience this game in unlimited number of ways with or without mods. Mods play a big role in the game but I will say about that later. = Without mods the player can still join several multiplayer servers both PVP and PVE which has different gamemodes too. But if you want to play singleplayer this game can serves you well too. = Singleplayer in this game has 3 forms: campaign scenarios and editor. -Campaign is pretty much self-explainatory. You play as a soldier on the island with your fellow army teammates and go on an adventure with wide-open levels and a simple set of story. You can play the original  base game's campaign or the ones you download from Steamworkshop (or others) which are user-created and some of them are really enjoyable to try out. -Scenarios are short  missions that usually made by  players and can be downloaded from the Steamworkshop (or other  community websites) Some of them are really enjoyable like custom campaigns. -Editor is a very powerful tool in . In this mode you can create your own mission in any style you like. as long as you know how to do it. I suggest going through the  editor guides and  community websites to learn more about the editor. = MODS Mods are the wheels that keep this game running. There are countless of them and a lot of them can improve your overall experience in the game some can change the game completely. For example the mod 'Altis Life' is a multiplayer total conversion mod. It features the role-playing multiplayer experience from normal civilians to police forces and outlaws. Therefore even if you prefer a role-playing multiplayer game you can play this game just with mods. But if you are here to be a soldier on the battlefield fighting bad guys with fellow soldiers you also have a lot of windows for modding. Weapon mods vehicle mods faction mods etc. can be downloaded via Steamworkshop (and other websites) to add unlimited variety of reallistic content to the game. = MilSim MilSim stands for Military Simulation which in the context of this game is a style of gameplay that involves around serious and reallistic gameplay. Every player will act like a real life soldier and work together as a team. Usually MilSim servers have mods to make the game more challenging and reallistic and admins of the servers or the head of the army will only pick players who are old enough and can play appropriately in their servers. So far MilSim gameplay is the most accurate experience that  is trying to offer to the players. = Thank you for reading the review. I have to manage all the mods and watch some editor tutorials.10
actually wanted to kill my self
Great game with a good story. Big community support means there are a lot of mods out there to use and get even more hours out of the game 10/10
Great game with endless possibilities. Great community. Great mods. So beautiful to look at too. The DLC has just enhanced this game more. 10/10
Outstanding game. A must have!
Great game 10/10 would IGN again Graphics are amazing if you can run the game at high/Ultra settings which i can with an i54690K and a 750ti OC gameplay is way more solid than arma 2 (Less glitchy and buggy)
 great game with lots of potential. I love the combat vehicles and customization goes as far as your heart's content. With the open world maps there are almost countless places to fight. The A3Launcher is a must-have if you want to go past the limits of the default game. It will give more content and new servers to play on.   The community varies alot. There are so many different types of players on this game. It'd be a lie if I said the community's great. Honestly it needs some major working on. There are some players on this game who are helpful and more friendly and there's some who can be rude and oblivious. It may be different for other players who experience with otherpeople. But this is just my opinion.  The gameplay adjusts to your environment. You must use it to your advantage if you don't you'll probably end up dieing. If your on a team based gamemodes like king of the hill and invade &amp; innex and for example; Your in a car and driving down the main road with passangers and the main road is guarded by tanks and infantry. You should probably go around the main road onto a side road to lower the chances of you and your teammates dieing.  Overall I would give this game a 7.5 / 10. 10
I have just done the tutorials i think i am ready to play the game 10/10 love this game.  If you dont have it yet you are missing out.
Arma III is a combat simulator like no other simulator I've played. I like the deep mental involvement. Very immersive game.
*hears people walking in room* *leans into wall and kills* *dies from same person 5 seconds later...* 10/10 best shooter ever
o drugs not Arma. You can thank me later.10
imulation isn't the defining aspect of Arma. It's scale.  The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios topographical maps binoculars and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes tracers gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot. 10
This is simply the best simulation game ever and is very realistic. There are several amazing aspects of  including the graphics they are amazing at max settings it is just so impressive. The gameplay nails the realism but dosen't get too frustrating and the sheer level of interactivity is staggering. The scale is another defining aspect of Arma the huge map really is impressive and anything can happen from small pistol firefights to tank battles. Modding is siply amazing with this game it's easy to mod and installing them are quite easy too. Really good stuff but it is very intensive on ur system
ell as most have probably said this game has almost complete limitations. You can fly a helicopter on your own or join a police department in some advanced roleplay communities. This game could be considered a 'simulator' to some but to those who play it understand what it is a game where you can literally do what you want. Mod support through the community is amazing and the servers are pretty great aswell.   As for singleplayer I have not touched it once. I played the singleplayer within Arma 2 the previous version of this game was not the best thing in the world. The communities for this game are endless as I said previously there are vast online communities that are based on roleplay such as Critical Gaming but also communities that are more based in hard-core military roleplay which use radio-codes coordinates and more militaristic banter these are communities such as Shack Tactical.  Another cool this? If you do not understand the game on how to do specific things check out the steam workshop! You can find mission style tutorials on there where you may find yourself very interested. It has limitless possibilites.   Now that I have said all the things good about it let's get to the cons and yes this game has a few. Graphics you do not need a beefy grapahics card although it does help. You need a good CPU though as this game basis almost all of it's functions off of the CPU. You can adjust your settings which will help in some cases but alot of times not in others. Errors are a common thing if you are interested in mods if not you should be good. This is a very specification intensive game which most would not consider this a bad thing but in my book it limits the playerbase.   Well that's really it for my review. At the end would I suggest this game? Absolutely if you are looking for a game that provides almost COUNTLESS HOURS this is your area! Remember how I mentioned modifications previously? Not only are there software mods but also hardware such as TrackIR and you could also use a joystick with advanced piloting mode.10
I guess bohemia thought human eyes are 15 fps
eautiful graphics incredible content in game and via steam workshop a lot of mods available online a must have for people looking for another kind of shooter or military enthusiast not fast paced incredibly insane feeling when you cant even see the enemy and youre being shot at   10/1010
id have to say this is money well spent
Awsome Game   -Altis Life  Make money get robbed  Get run over by a medic  -Epoch Awsome  Awsome Awsome Recommend  -Exile Bad  -KOTH clusterfu*k    21/10  PLEASE HPDATE MULTIPLAYER FOR MAC
Arma3 Is a must buy. Period.
i love this piece of 
n a lot of games I like the idea of teamplay and tactical combat. Usually though it's just fun and not functional. With just 18 hours played I can already tell that in this game that is not the case. Teamplay and command structures are necessary and rewarding; I found myself giving medivac extraction flying an A10 surviving solo in a harsh environment and so on.  The game does come with some of the problems inherent to the arma series with some slightly off animations and clunky controls (you get used to them). Of course if you're not a fan of hardcore shooters this is no Call of Duty: it's not easy or forgiving although there are a huge variety of gamemodes with some harder than others.  Despite its problems the game is definitely worth buying this is what I've been looking for for a long time.11
his game is great. first i thought it seemed kind of dull looking then i bought it.i played vanilla for a while. then i got the real game the mods. epochexilebreakingpointand battle royale are all incredible. Cant forget life servers! The modded game is uncanny and incredible10
I love . Not only the game but the vast communities for this game. modded or not the game is fun and challenging.
11/10 really good game i think that anyone that like dayz the game will like  the fps is amazing good game!
ought this to play one of the best millatary simulators and get the experience of being a man on the front line. i instead played arma life where i was robbed by two men wearing nothing became a pimp and even started my own fight club damn broke the 1st rule.  11/10  would pimp again10
is an engaging thoughtful first or third person military simulator. It thrusts you into the near future with a variety of next generation weapons and current ones and having you fight with generalized (factions essentially being generalizations of regional areas (middle east nato etc etc)) factions. This game will reward you for taking the time to learn its complexities and for you to engage and interact with the community. while the single player is fun and well done it is well surpassed by the dynamic content and communities of players you can find online granted this does require your effort into finding such communities and actively engaging in them.   Overall I would recommend  to anyone looking for a military sim that does a good hybrid between realism and game-play and has a community that supports engrossing organized multiplayer game-play.10
great when playing with friends or on a server with other people but can get boring when you are just playing by yourself.
is a beautiful game. Except when I get killed by a tank from 3 miles away on a hill at Camp Rogain or something along those lines. Many different game-modes to play and a thriving community.10
his is the most realistic Modern military game to date. the game is abit expencive at the moment but what ever right?  has Awesome graphic kinda buggy at times but it's constantly being updated. There are alot of diffrent types of servers RPlife types Realistic military inde. type of military operations wastland i.e survival w/ a group of friends or a team of random and it's all %100 free roam. The singleplayer isnt perfect but it's OK although it keeps reseting my progress so I didnt try to complete it But it's one of the best games I've ever played it if you think it's boring play with some friends it is WAY better with friends.    P.S dont buy the DLC not worth the money just play on modded servers or get mods10
erfect hardcore military simulator   has a very realistic modeling and massively open-world dynamic game play spent more time looking at the guns in editor mode and firing off thousands of rounds for my viewing pleasure.  Graphics are beautiful on ultra settiings and runs at 40 fps badly optimised I am guessing.  Not a game to play when you are drunk due to the high levels of focus needed10
Perfect !
 bought this game a couple of weeks ago when it was on 50% off sale mostly because I run native linux and wasn't sure how well the 'Experimental Beta' was going to run on my rig. My fellow Linux users told me how well it ran so I figured I'd support Virtual Programming's effort by getting  and hoping everything ran fine.  Pros:  It runs more than fine it runs 55-62fps with mostly standard settings. 100% stable for me thus far no freezes crashes or other bugs at all. With over 15 hours into the game (mostly single-player campaign but several in multiplayer with other Linux-users) I can honestly say I have not run into any functional issues thus far.  As for gameplay well I suggest you watch some gameplay videos on youtube if you're on the fence. This isn't a casual pick-up shooter you play for 20-30 min and go back to work. It's so immersive and in-depth that's because it is a tactical combat simulation more than just a shooter. The replayability seems limitless and I can see why a lot of reviewers have thousands of hours of gameplay into this.  Cons:  For the Linux client there is no official support (yet) and there has not been made any announcements that there ever will be any release from Beta. That's cool I like what Virtual Programming is doing and I'd like to support their effort (and help convince Bohemia Interactive that Linux Gamers are Gamers too and our money is money too).  As such there is no game-launcher making running steam workshop mods very difficult. I mean I've figured out how to change launch properties but it's hard to find out the correct launch-tag name/syntax for each mod and really I'm having plenty of fun with the Vanilla game (for now) but would hope that Bohemia comes to the descision to plan for official Linux/SteamOS release (after all Steam Machines are about a month away from full release!). So really this is only a con for Linux-gamers (at the moment) but not having a functional launcher makes running mods extremely hard.  The only other con I can think of thus far is the AI. It seems pretty shallow and I could be wearing a full ghillie suit proned out under a pile of bushes and trees and tall grass and an enemy soldier half a click away sees my thumb protruding from a branch in 1/4 of a second and 360 no-look jumping headhoots me &lt;/hyperbole. At other times I can walk up right behind them have them not notice me as I pull out my pistol and execute them like some contract hit. And let's not get into your friendly AI...sheesh talk about real REMF/POGUE types.  Anyway the AI isn't as bad as I make it sound it's just fairly crude and pretty much the only un-polished part of this game and could use some serious attention.  Final Thoughts:  Beyond that I plan on sinking tons more hours into this game and REALLY hope that Bohemia Interactive throws Virtual Programming a bone on their eON Wrapper (translation layer?)...it works seriously.   Just watch this youtube video for a side-by-side comparison  Linux to Windows:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nASDQCPjxOg   For Linux gamers currently totally worth it if you can find it for 50% off or more. If it is announced that it will ever exit Experimental Beta and one day Linux will join the official ranks of  support then the full price is more than worth it and the future fun you'll have. Outstanding game been waiting for something like this all my linux-life.  My Specs:  Linux Mint 17.2 'Rafaela' Cinnamon 64bit loaded on Kernel 3.19.0-25 Intel Core i5-4690 Haswell 3.5Ghz Quad Core ASRock H87M-ITX LGA 1150 Intel H87 MOBO Nvidia Geforce GTX 760 4GB w/ Proprietary Binary 355.11 drivers 16GB System RAM 250GB Samsung EVO SSD (for all installed games)10
You can be a rabbit 10/10
 is pretty good. DLC is a bit pricey.
I really like it. Htere are a ton of diffrent mods and things to do.
fter playing  other FPS games feel too arcade-ish.10
Having put a fair amount of hours into this game I have realized that it's not the core game that I play but the game with mods. And everyone complaining about this has a point but I believe that Bohemia has integrated this into their development ideals therefor making the game to be modded. 8/10 would play again.
Honest Review? Review is based on current state of game.  Game Pros • Open World • Mod Support • Multiplayer • Realistic Mechanics • Vehicles (Air and Ground) • Day/Night Cycle • Weather System • Frequent updates  Game Cons • FPS is spotty (Depending on server and your computer specs) • Server list has trouble loading sometimes  Relateable Games • N/A  Conclusion ArmA III is a fantastic and realistic war simulation game. With a ton of mod support and game modes you will surely get a ton of hours of enjoyment in this game.  (If you found this review helpful consider giving it a thumbs up!)10
The combination of unforgiving realism along with sheer difficulty in this game forces you to play tactical and at the same time acts as a repellent for most of the y twelve year olds that would swarm call of duty or Battlefield. It's really a thing of beauty.  The DLC seems to be an unfortunate sideffect of no competition in this specific genre. Still recommend though
i played this game when it was free and it was great
awesome game. realy recommend if you like tactical shooters
.66666666/10 cause my well trained sniper can't hold his breath.10
t'll be in Alpha until June so if you're interested you should purchase it now. The interface in improve and it's a little easier to move around and engage the enemy. Not many vehicles weapons or missions at the moment but the multiplayer is rapidly expanding. Plus if you buy it you can hand out free Alpha passes to friends on the 14th of March.11
I jumped off a roof when I couldn't run this on my old computer...
ts like Call of Duty but with  Drivable tanks Flyable aircraft acutal gameplay mechanics  a good community lots of free user created content  actual good dlc Extremely good graphics  poor optimization (That is acutally a legit similarity) Realistic audio wide variety of locations a okish campaign An extremely large amount of different weapones   actually now that I think about it it isn't like Call of Duty.  10/10 would buy a non COD clone again.10
 great Milsim  mod friendly shooter that has depth and plenty of gameplay variety .10
Terrific game!! Played other PC games that have same them but none compare to . Community has been an improvement too! Good teamwork on multilplayer. For serious gamers that play with strategy and cooperation. This is not a shootemup kamikaze respawn game. This one requires a more serious approach to playing which makes it more enjoyable. LOVE THIS GAME!!!
Very fun lots to do and is a great experience
Awesome mechanics
Brilliant game when you can find the right server with level headed people.
very time i play this game is a new story to tell.   cons: 35 fps on low settings...   36 fps on ultra settings...  pros: there are a million ways to play it.  i really wanna know the PC specs of the  team fix the damn game10
Love This Game Soo Much &lt;3
irst of all: If you're a Cod fan get the hell out of here...  Now.. This game is amazing!   Pros: Realistic Gameplay(mostly) Huge and accually rather accurate Map. Amazing Mission editor Great graphics 10/10 in Immersion amazing campaign Mods.. (even has Zombies!) If you like jets (which I do) I must say this is one of the best flying games out there if you can run the game with very long viewing distance.   Cons: Poorly optimised Multiplayer is unplayable due to optimisation issues. a few DLCs are utterly overpriced. Not easy for Casuals ( this is a military simulator you must say ' Hostile Sniper Spotted bearing 205 1 click out' and then answer 'Roger!' Dunno why but it sometimes is hilarious doing it.' No nudes.    Haven't played the new APEX expansions (or whatever that is) but i'm not going to touch it because at one point you have to save a Frenchman. Not going to do that... 10
ROS  This is a very indepth game for thos who love role play and the adrenaline rush of battle that comes from an lmg supressing you behind that one rock. The feeling that one bullet can literally take your life a way a commanding a squad or even an army with a rich modding community to keep your interest peaked this is a very fun game.  CONS  Now i cant stress enough this is no console game no call of duty no battle field. A well thought out but sloppily put togetehr Battle simulator. You will find yourself forgetting the controls unless you play faithfully everyday. You will be imersed in this game but trust me you will know its a game you cant evem jump in this game but i t didnt stop my purchase.  Its awe inspiring and overall a very good game where they lack in proper control scheme and polish they make up for with dumping content and realism in your face.10
his is still the janky-as-hell Arma that we all love and hate at the same time. Single player is still terrible as always so be sure to bring friends.10
good tttt
i love  and it is the best game i have played in a long long long time
his game is really what you make of it (the mods you play the people you play with). The groundwork has been layed the maps the models the netcode (...still pretty bad lol). You have to find the gamemode that you can get into and only then you really understand what arma offers. The entertainment from this game is a rollercoaster no scenario you encounter is ever the same.  And no buying a $4000 computer will not improve your fps in multiplayer...10
i would recommend this game however you do need a good cpu and graphics card to run it .
 have several hours in this game. My friends got me into it a bit after it released and although I'm not the best this game is always fun. I love playing the mods like Epoch and Exile.  This game is a must have for all gamers. You can really benchmark your machine with it. So photo realistic even on the medium settings.10
fter 432 hours of playing this game I have to say it's by far the best milsim out there. Sure it's not perfect but it's a challenge for sure. Its more or less a thinking man's game if anything else. Rambos and gun runners won't survive too long in MP. Teamwork is essential for survivability. It has a steep learning curve but it's not impossible to digest. A word of advice to the new player you will die many times in MP. Dont become frustrated play with friends or better yet join a milsim group. Ask questions and stick with it and youll be fine. The user community is somewhat salty but hey it is what it is and there are many willing to help out. There are tons of user made mods and scripts for you to use should you be so inclined to create missions. Overall this is about as close as you will get to being a soldier without enlisting in the armed services.10
t's an amazing game. The campaign wasnot boring at all and some Co-ops are challaning and fun. But it needs massive PVP official mods/games  more complex maps(or objects) and official co-ops which is as good as the campaign.10
I like this game because you can create any scenario you want in the game but the controls are confusing. I still recommend this game to others though
enerally a good game but I wouldnt play it for the campaigjn For me its just a fun game about city life (not military)10
Unique storyline and even better multiplayer. The possiblities are truly endless.
look at my hours tho +1
This is rly good game :D
y name is Dry and i approve of this game. :P11
ou will get the most out of this game.  is ten times better than the beautiful ARMA 2 design. Better graphics better engine happier players.  ---  This game was originally created as a military simulator. The developers of the world have created multiple different mods and addons you can explore for the most entertainment. Games such as Altis Life RPG have been a huge support structure to this game.  ---  You get much more out of the game instead of the original package of Campaign missions.10
This game makes me and my cpu feel useless.  11/10
i love every thing about it i dont have any dislikes i mean there is one thing i want to be in it i want motocycles and stuff like that i dont want to download mods and stuff i mean ant nobody got time for that well alot do but it jest takes forever.
t's only in Alpha and it still walks fly's drive's and dive's all over all the tunnel shooters!  A real improvement over Arma 2 which i loved for all it's faults. Get it try it now!10
ood Game Would Recommend10
ust be one of the best experiences of my life. If it wasn't for this free weekend i wouldnt have found it and i wouldnt have played it so thank you Bohemi &lt;3 You made the best 3 days of my life and now im off to buy the bloody game because i think im addicted.. i only buy games im addicted to Thank you from the bottom of my hearth.10
his is one of the best games I have ever played It makes you feel like you are there with its outstanding graphics and gameplay with added mods also you can play with modern gear which I prefer. The Game is HUGE with potential to run massive missions be them PVP or PVE. Its f**king SWEAT!11
rma... that is a soldier and one life lots of helicopters tanks and other things10
naked men with high powered assault rifles
layed a bit really enjoyed it.10
reat graphics superb realism excellent multiplayer. All and all just a great game!10
here is so much to do in this game it's insane. I would go so far as to say that it's an adult Garry's mod due to all the different possibilities with Arma. Every gametype every mod has a community to go with it. You get so engrossed into any good server you could easily invest 50+ hours in one week when find something new. You can play at least 100-200 hours of Battle Royale easily or maybe 50-250+ on invade and annex (depending on how hardcore you are). Maybe king of the hill is more of your thing? Go play 300 hours of that in a week. Or possibly you want a better DayZ than the standalone? Go spend 600+ hours roaming a single map looking for loot and building up your base +more hours for every map. You like little kids screaming at you because theyre a cop and are immune to the rules? Waste your life away playing any of the life mods.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg and I think this is the perfect example of that saying.  There is just so much to enjoy about ARMA3. It's a lot more user friendly than previous titles and is much improved from previous titles as well... didn't substanially change anything so veterans of the franchise will miss it but rather they worked on it and added more. Nothing about this game did they mess up making the previous ones better it's still ARMA.  It may be a little hard to learn at first as the IGN review gives it a 7/10 because the reviewer simply did not give it enough time to learn it but it all pays off. Once you learn to think like a member of something bigger than you or even that youre bigger than a group and learn how to manage everything you'll be having a blast.   THE LEARNING CURVE IS WORTH IT!!!    When you find games with people who have thousands of hours on it (ie CSGO SKYRIM ARMA...) you know it's a good game why else would anyone spend 1000+ hours of their life playing something? Because they think it's okay? NO because they love it.      TL:DR Just ing buy it already you pleb    10
wsome Military simulator game I enjoy all scenariosStory ModeCustom Scenarios  Speciel is the Rolelplaying servers are awsome :D10
Arma is a is an amazing game the multiplayer is filled with fun and outstanding and unlimited options. On the other hand the story is not as great as expected but still the multiplayer defently devilers. I rate this gate 5 out of 5 stars due to the comnplex and outstanding multiplayer.
i was on altis life and i looked for the cocaine.....i started to rise to the top and then the damn feds came after me.... i escaped but my wife and son died....i recomenddd
If you are into the arma series I'd say give this one a try it's much more in depth and a bit more on the graphics than the rest so you will need a computer that's roughly 2012 or later or you will lag a lot even on low graphics. Solid gameplay and it is pretty fun with friends.
this game makes u feel like its the real deal this is a great game
nyone into Realistic FPS this is the game for you. You can add mods to make it more realistic than it already is and you can find a lot of clans/squads who do real training like you're in the military.10
he game is a little overhyped in my opinion and is missing a few key features but honestly If you want a game where you can take it seriously have fun and or roleplay without the t of other games its here. Arma is unforgiving and somewhat difficult to get a handle on but you will be able to find fun and the cost is worth the upgrade from similar but ier games.10
est military sim on the market and it's not even close.10
ncredible game. Incredible replayability. If you like shooting things this is your game!!!10
This game is really fun to play with friends! I enjoy all the realistic aspects of the game. It is also one of the best sandbox games I ever have played :)  10/10 would play again
ery good game! Im not even going to explain. Buy it check it out! Its really good and I have it on all of my steam accounts.10
Great game!!
is a very unique game. I've been playing since the beta of Operation Flashpoint (the original). I have nothing but good things to say. This game is an amazing tactical infantry simulator. It does lack in the quality of planes as they are simulated a little more on the arcade side rather than realism; don't expect DCS style flying. Helicopters are alright but lacking some versatility. Overall as far as air flight is concerned it’s not bad at all the feeling of being inside a chopper and seeing your fellow soldiers mount in is great. In regards to maps there is a HUGE land mass to play on you can also download extra maps. Making your own missions is very easy you can setup some great CO-OP scenarios against the NPC or other players. The game features the ability to mount mods there is a great variety from Exile to Altis Life there is allot of options outside of original ARMA and its set gameplay. Multiplayer servers are generally very full and there are allot of different types of maps and styles to choose from. If you want a very detailed and solid purchase game then this is a great buy. Infantry styled game play is really realistic great scopes range of guns (especially with APEX) and you feel like an actual soldier going into battle.  The only down sides that I see are to do with the mechanics of the engine. Like I mentioned before I would've liked better airplane mechanics and physics same with helicopters. The engine itself isn't ultra-fluent it's very 'sim like' so don’t expect “Call of Duty” styled gameplay. The controls are detailed but once you set them up it makes for great gaming. Lastly to any other old ARMA fans ARMA 2 has a huge amount of assets  is lacking in that department quite significantly. The futuristic take on warfare might not be to everyone’s taste (it certainly didn’t sit well with me).  Overall I would recommend this game it's expensive maybe get it on sale but well worth it. 10
he best game I have ever played  its just so addicting &amp; emersive  the game may run bad but for all the content you get &amp; map size its hella worth it  but for me the game runs decent as I have an Intel proccessor . The graphics today still look good  and the zues editor is the best part in my opinion as you can create random events while playing with your friends which adds a whole new feel to arma  look I can go on &amp; on about how good this game is  but here is a 10/10 arma  u deserve it :)10
All round good game but at times i felt alone in the game world
WARNING* Before even considering this game ensure you have a powerful pc. I can barely run 40 fps on medium with an i7 4770 16gb ram and an oc HD7950.   Simple review:  Pros: -Environment is amazing -Gameplay is extremely realistic (expect one shot kills from an AR)  -Srategy must be utilised to gain results -The addition of the workshop is what really makes it shine (mods scenarios weapon addons and much more!)  -Interesting missions gamemodes and campaign is decent -The difficulty of the game makes it highly rewarding (subjective)  -Mechanics is great from the physics to the UI -A ton of vehicles to learn to use if you run out just go to the workshop -DEFINITELY NOT a fast pace game like COD or BF (subjective)  -I can be here all day listing out the pros as there are so many features   Cons: -Takes a while to get into especially if you haven't played previous Arma games -Frustration and rage is common (especially on hard missions) (subjective)  -UI can be a bit complicated at first and takes getting used to -Large game especially with addons (shouldn't be much of a problem)  -Gameplay takes a long time to adapt to and learning to fly planes and helis well takes ages  Proper review: This game is probably one of the best military game I have ever played. It is far different to your average fps and aims for realism. This means it is not suitable for everyone especially those who love fast paced gameplay and do not want to patiently learn how to play.   It surpasses its predecessor Arma 2 in almost every way. There are significantly LESS BUGS and mechanics UI AIs movement and vehicle control is improved. The misfortunes of getting killed in doors from arma 2 are gone and so are many other issues.  The gameplay is extremely slow and maps are simply massive. The one thing that I find annoying is dying to a sniper after running 2km on foot in a mission. I guess it adds to the realism and when playing singleplayer there is a 4x time lapse button.  Strategising is key and it makes this game even better when playing with friends. You must learn the best ways to clear out buildings find the best angles of attack and you must learn to work as a unit. If your ever going to use those high school geography skills its going to be when you are using the map is this game when finding grid positions finding hills and valleys using contour lines and using the compass.   Weapons and their mechanics are well done. Running makes your gun unstable and requires time for you to steady it when you rest. Guns have extremely high recoil which renders automatic fire almost useless unless you in extreme CQB. Also weapons are loud and the loudness depends on the weapon and if it has a silencer or not. Loudness translates to detection which the game implements perfectly gunshot loudness will disappate the further away you are from the shot which makes it realistic. AIs also detect you at different rates which depends partially on how far you fire your gun from them.   Vehicles are a major aspect of the game and each type of vehicles needs to be learnt how to be used effectively. Land vehicles are quite simple and there should be no trouble for anyone there but air vehicles is where it gets more ticky. They take time to master and must patiently be done. Vehicles range dynamically from suvs with 50cal mounted MGs and tanks to civilian hatch backs and trucks.   Lastly the implementation of the workshop was genius as it made modding extremely easy with a launcher that is simple when disabling and enabling mods without deleting/unsubscribing to them. There are mods which surpass all expectations such as the OPTRE halo mod which adds a ton of content and a weapon pack (I forgot the name) which adds like fifty weapons. The user made scenario missions are very fun to play with friends and difficulty ranges along with the themes of these missions. The mods are essentially unofficial DLCs because of the quality and quantity of thr content they add.  Verdict: All in all I recommend this game to someone who wants to try something new/different and wants to learn how to utilise new mechanics and play with friends.  offers many things that are not present in many games.  9/10 definitely worth the price tag10
It's ok
If I've spent 1400+ hours playing  over a period of just six months that must be a good indication.
Arma is what you make of it. I mostly just play missions and play 'Grown up toy soldiers' where I mash armies of AI against each other. I've gotten hundreds of hours out of that.
ery adicting realistic teambase military simulation highly recommended! &lt;310
Pretty cool i r8 10/8
.9/10  This game is really a harcore FPS. The moments you get stem from bullets whizzing by as you just entered an ambush! You hear your friends yelling over the mic  JACK IS DEAD! Every encounter is slow and planned and if it gets big enough becomes hectic. It encompasses BF3 and 4 and even some COD aspects of action (much less COD like .05%). The adrenaline rushes when you see an enemy are astounding and get amplified as you understand your utter mortality.  The editor is great and I see amazing potential even full fledged campeigns from users! Albeit it is hard to grasp and understand and requires constant bug testing from the users side to make sure that every trigger etc. work properly. Its as simplified of a complex editor that you can get. Once fully mastered allows for some amazing missions!    The downside is the optiimization when i first got the game and did multi at the lowest setting i was getting 5 or 10 FPS. Now Im getting a solid 30 the Dev team truly listens. I like that they released this fix before they went on with their campeign etc. Since they realized that the community discovered a game breaking issue (kinda discovered they already knew but did not excpect this to affect so many people).    All in all the game mught have its bugs but its a fabulous and hardcore game with an in game editor that's as simple and proffesional as it gets and a dev team that offer full support to thegame and are constantly improving it!  8.9/1010
Very Good  Love It
0/10  great game extremely  customisable to your  gaming needs great replay value.  highly recommended 10
it will NOT START and i dont no why
 love this game can't stop playing it :D10
This game has over a dozen different ways to crouch and lie down.
This Game made me realised you can still play with 10 FPS. Great Game for all people who are into realistic First Person Shooter games.
10/10 my favorite game ever walked down the street in rpg some guy knocked me out robbed me and then cut out my kidney then out of no where he just shot me in the head and the tdm/ctf/etc games are fun
t's alright I guess.10
reat game overall needs some optimizition though10
A real military simulator..not that Battlefield/Call of Duty Crap they dish out.
0/10 This is a great game if you are looking for something alot more realistic than COD or BattleField or anything else along those lines. From the campaigns beginning to end you are spending time to even get to the primary objective this is great because you get to see how much time and effort went into this masterpiece. Then we get into the firefights every thing from learning how to shoot to mastering the ammount of bullet drop for each gun you can spend hours and even days mucking around with the hundreds of controls. On top of that there is DLC and user-made content and I for one cannot describe how much I am anticipating for a dayz mod for this game it would be amazing. 10
Tekodian's Rating    (1) Doesn't work (2) Not Recommended (3) Buy on Sale (4) Worth your money  (5) Must buy
I always come back to this game. Great Co-op features.
The gameplay is great ! But stability :/ with a gtx980TI and i7 4790k I get alot of frames drop ...
mazing game. Great mods great gameplay. The variety of weapons is rather small. but easily over come. Once again amazing.10
most realistic game i have ever played it has the best physics and to say the game is still being developed is such a good sign of things to come in the future keep up the good work  i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys realistic combat simulators and has the time to spend on this game
Probably one of the best games I have right now! Great graphics Great gameplay And very realistic  Definite 5 stars
good game to bad i suck at it XD
here is nothing like Arma. While 3 is the smoothest yet it's still clunky but that doesn't matter at all once you've seen what it can do playing in a group of 40 all communicating to complete a mission.10
its good
Great game !!!  A completely grown up man stuff fps right here  words cant express
is my favourite game. It offers such a platform that allows tons of mods such as DayZ Overwatch Epoch Exile etc. While still being great on its own!  Make sure to have a few friends to play this with as then the experience is better.   10
f you can get past the bugs and community this title will surely leave you satisfied without costing an... arm and a leg.   ...When do I get paid?10
It's good.
Guys and girls.....just buy this game
ruly immersive experience full of amazing content that will have you playing for hours definitely worth a buy.10
rr.... the campagin is complex... welp its still good.  more the graphics are good but its better if you get a mod.  gg  life and exile dayz mod gg.  i rate this game 8/10  you need good computer  if you have a bad one put all of your settings to disabled and low.10
n in depth and expansive third/first person shooter with the amazing capabilty of catering to multiple different interests and game genres at once  is a pretty good time as long as you have the buddiesa to explore it with. Most complain asbout game performance and that is because this title relies heavier on your CPU than your GPU meaning that people with the beastliest of graphics cards can still have issues. This is the only major bad thing about Arma everything else is fun and accessible even if there is a major learning curve at the start. If you want to explore vast open worlds mod the hell out of something play insane hundred player multiplayer battles or Role Play as a lone soldier behind enemy lines  is probably for you.10
8/10  It is an amazing game but it is not so good on you CPU
I love this game. It might be hard to drive for more cheap computer but I had a ok time running it. There are so many different things that you can do in arma I only have a few hours but I already think I'm addicted.
 Very Good First Person / 3rd Person Shooter  The Eden Creator Brang A new level of creativity I cant get enough of it and learning basic coding from mission files too whats there to complain about this game? o also the underwater capabilities of this game are well done too.10
andbox &amp; Editor what else could you need more?  MP Armaholic Workshop10
his game is great! I love this game because it's not based around one thing. You can get seperate mod packs that change the game entirely! It's amazing! I highly suggest this game to play with friends if you don't have people to play with this game may feel a little boring for you. But other then that I highly suggest this game!10
eally realistic War Simulator game lots of action and no russians Kappa. Nice graphics and gameplay.10
ow I'm not that much of a gamer I play a little fallout and some old subsims NO call of doody. I got so into this game that I had to by a new rig to run it correctly. The level of realisim available in this game boggles my brain. For the first 2 months or so I'm pretty sure I spent more time learning then I did playing. Thats what a lot of games are missing now days. The people in the community great albeit a little hardcore sometimes. The mods that are available are worth alot more then the $30 bucks or so for the game and Bistudios doesn't seem to be on the 'Charge you for content' greed train everyone else seems to be on. Check this one out if your ready for intense team oriented milsim fun.10
f you dont mind a slower experience this game can provide a massively varied experience.10
It is really a great ecperience with friends and foes It gets my vote that is for sure
 am very very conflicted while writing this review. I really loved playing . I've had some good times and made some good memmories. And I still havn't even fully explored all the mods that are available! But like I said I'm conflicted. And here's why.   -No Real Solo Play Online   If you plan on playing alone prepare to not have fun. Unless you're a gaming golden god with the reaction speed of a gerbil on speed and the skills of a pro you're going to be  off a lot. Especially in specific mods that pit you against other players (Wasteland etc.) you will get angry. Playing mods like this you really shouldn't be someone who gets attached to anything and is basically entertained by anything that goes beyond finding things go 'boom' interresting. If you want to spend quality time find a MilSim group. But you'll have to spend a good amount of time on  figuring things out and also trying to actually get INTO a MilSim group.   -The Single Player Campaign   While I found it fairly entertaining certain points get tedious and annoying. Especially since the AI have special eyes that can see you from 2KM away as if you were 2M away. But all in all; it's a decent campaign to go through once. (quite lengthy too with about 5 or 6 hours on average.)  I don't know if it can be counted as SP but the Eden editor can be really fun to play around in! Getting actual things done and making a working MP map is a huge challenge though. It will take many many hours to get a MP map working and onto the steam workshop!   -The Community   Ehm how do I put this... The community is... different. While it has the internet classics such as rage kids and memelords it contains a more rare breed of internet personality; the elitist. Don't be fooled by people saying that the community is mature because of it's learning curve and MilSim niche-ness. Personally I find the elitism to be the most annoying part about . The players who find the need to rub in their kills. The players who have the humility of a peacock. Which also brings me to the last group of people I'll talk about; the die-hards. We all know them. People who have 2000 hours logged in  and eat breathe and probably excrete Arma. While I don't really have anything against them (They're better then me. Oh well.) but it does get frustrating when you have people that are making their tea and at the same time headshot you from 3KM distance.    Ratings    + Delivers a MilSim game + A decent amount of equipment variety. + Loads and loads of good mods. + Group fun! ;) + The game is pretty stable in my experience. (Bug wise)  +/- Community can sometimes be frustrating. +/- The game itself can get quite frustrating. (unless like I mentioned you're MLG pro JesusFPS.) +/- Steep learning curve to not-scrubness.  - Requires a lot of time to actually get into the more MilSim multiplayer parts.    Summary    Pretty gud gam. Buy.10
A massive improvement from arma 2 (especially the voice acting). But i find the main dissapointment is the lack of weapon diversity and choice unlike arma 2. Overall an amazing game well worth the price.
evert 100 time in Campaign sooooo.. not bad for the first time in Arma seriesbetter then Dark Soul series10
dis is bolshit
he Most Realistic Military Simulator EVER. Nice Optimisation (much better than Arma 2). Also good graphics and gameplay. The Flying Experience goes from a 4/10 to a 8.5/10 IF you map a joystick to the contols. Though the Game might be a bit pricey but for 50% off is definitely WORTH IT.  10
 think one of the most incredible factors of this game is that it serves as more of a Base for you to create your own ideal game from. The amount of addons/mods avaliable on Armaholic and on the Workshop allow you to pretty much tune  into whatever type of game you desire be it Survival RPG Real Time strategy Civilian Roleplay e.c.t. the list goes on and on. As do my countless hours playing this game. The majority of my hours have actually been spent within the editor making my own missions.   For people who own Arma 2 and still haven't decided weather to make the jump the new engine while it wasnt greatly optimised or particularly incredible back in early release after constant changes and tweaks as well as enhanced features which come with the DLC's that you dont even need to pay for (you just have to buy the DLC for the actual assets themselves) the engine makes huge improvements in almost every area over the old Arma 2 engine.    Apex itself is a tricky one its a great addon and adds in some interesting new vehicles like the VTOLs which although I dont normally go for the more futuristic style of gameplay they are indeed awesome and most of the assets included in Apex are beautiful quality although the map Tanoa to me has a truly unique vibe with its dense jungles and volcanos e.c.t the map doesn't seem designed with larger scale engagements in mind more of your behind enemy lines recon style missions which is still great of course. But is it worth the money? Well that really falls down to you and what you value in a game.    9.0/10 Apex 7.5/1010
This game is very fun to play with freinds and is worth the time and money i spent on  huge success and many opportunities to come.
is a great military training game or representational life like army game. There are a few nuts and bolts that need to be tightened and bolted into place but overall it's a phenomenal shooter. It's a first-person and third-person shooter you can interchange what visual aspect you want to be in inside the game. In the campaign you play as Ben Kerry a U.S. Army soldier that is a component of NATO peacekeeping military force. The game and online proceeds in the year two thousand thirty five. The campaign and maps made for the game take place on Aegean islands of Altis (Lemnos) and Stratis of Greece in the Mediterranean Sea. The game itself has many DLCs that you can buy on G_2_A for very cheap(nickel-and-dime) prices. If you have a moderate(regular) computer or PC(Program counter) then this game should run fine around 35-45 frames. If you have a crappy computer or PC then I would suggest sticking to another game. You learn a lot about the military air force delta units and more in the campaign and online. It gets too the point were you start talking like a solider and forget(draw a blank) that it's a game. You can also have large indefinite amounts of fun and dip around with your friends.10
Greatest game ever!!! The best by fare simulation game. All trhe games from Arma all the way up to Arma III are top notch and have more game play in the form of mods to last a lifetime.  This is my got to get listed game! So go get it.
: A triumph of programming this improves on the old in every way looks farking fantastic on a good system Im sure I will spend many many hours exploding incinerating and pink misting bad guys. Slightly more modernistic gear and weapons and the new large map is farking insanely huge. Great job Bohemia!!!!!  - APEX:  I in all my countless of hours playing this series under various names since the year of our lord 2000 have never been so highly impressed with the work done for a single map and cannot I stress CANNOT say enough high praises for the latest campaign that came with the initial APEX release. Particularly the 'Hearts of Darkness' mission.  Pros: -use of lighting is just fantastic mind blowing at times.   -Overall graphics feel well optimized(finally) with continuous 60fps on ultra settings and high vis disance (machine specs at end)  -Again accolades to the lighting team- when used properly its so close to real its staggering  -the preconfigured campaign with it respawn feature make this combat simulator a little freindlier for MP play  -The campaign is well done mechanically that is to say the gameplay missions are fun and challenging with plenty of replayability.  -Added set of new vehicles elements items you name it. Very comprehensive addition of props and other 'life adding' features in the editor.  -In all my years of playing only one other map has shined so brightly in my mind Kunduz Afghanistan. (Mod) This one is better in nearly every regard to all that have come before it especially in the way of textures and sound. Just flying around it is a real treat. Way to go Bohemia!  Cons: -MP mission feels somewhat limited as to loadouts especially by the end. -Its still ARMA so high learning curve for being able to do all the things you need to know how to do. (Once mastered the rewards are amazing.)  -As a fanthing I have a hard time finding cons. Ive made solid friends from this game over the years playing in online communities playing tactical cant be done any better. This game is a true to life military simulator. In fact it is used under a different name for training the military. Being deployed to Afghanistan I literally sat through a theater specific IED threat briefing that was entirely an ARMA video. I was jealous of the units they had to use. ;)  Asus MB air cooled system i7 3770k 3.5GHz  16Gb Corsair Dominator 2x GTX 970 SLi 850W psu 500Gb Samsung SSD + others some usless leds and the like10
this is 11/10 died and waited 5 minutues only to drown 9 times in the corner of the map. Would Reccomend this game to those with Aquaphobia. 11/10 would drown again
In altis life cops arest you for no reason 10/10 buy this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
till a few bugs bouncy servers and could need a better server browser but  is a very good upgraded compared to earlier releases and one of the best 'simulators' out there. The community keeps this up and running and their doing a good job.10
oo cool and awesome to explain every little detail of this massive game!  This game is never ending and what u think you know is nothing compared to the amount of awesome mods and online mulitplayer aspects of this game That is even without including the strory mode which will widen your knowledge even further and give you inspriation to come up with your own cool and unique senarios!  Once you've downloaded this game the controls may take a little while to get used to however once you've learn what every little button does there's no looking back.  Personally my favourite thing about his game is the online multiplayer aspect which has a never ending list of servers with different RPG elements. And if thats not your style your sure to find fun playing servers such as 'King of the hill' or 'Exile'.  Finally to really experince most of this game is to just download it and have fun! Don't get salty if you keep failing in action and have to walk 2km to your destination everytime you die in story mode just simiply go play an online server and once again be wanting to play this game for hours more. :D10
One of the BEST shooting games there is on the market!
verything you wanted a combat based shooter-sim to be. Fly a helicopter and do strafing runs? Sure. Lead your squad to do breaching parties? Why the hell not? Scuba dive with friends and clear our enemy positions? Very fun.  This is probably the best shooter i have played. And i am looking forward to the full development of it.   you have my respect Also iit's visually stunning and it's either 3rd person and 1st. 10/10 10
his is one of the best games I have ever owned and the game ive had the most fun on. It might have its glitches and meh optimization but its still a great game. just buy it.10
Awesome! after all these years still fun to do
ade me learn to play with 30 fps. Great game totally worth it still if it has low FPS. On singleplayer i get 90+ fps on high settings 1080P. Probaly the server's issue or the dedicated server file which bohemia gives to the community. Hope it gets improved in the future10
fter many years this game is still 32 bit. If BI wants to take advantage of larger terrains and objects they need to advance themselves to 64 bit. This would give users/gamers better quality. 64 bit is the way to go period.10
est army simulator on the marketplaceidk its rly fun10
I just bought this game to be a drug dealer in altis life. My life is great right now. I would smoke weed again.  10/10 (we just need one more dlc with lsd on it)
itsamust have for PRO gamers!
This Game is SUPER fun if you like RP and playing with friends the price is a little high but its still really fun. Also what happend to all the servers there are bearly any with people on them? And what happend to  Life. Still super fun though deffinently reccemended.
esides having to pay to get most of the game's content this game has so many possibilities and gamemodes to play. It is lots of fun and keeps me coming back.10
Gained alot of cancer from this game but its the good type of cancer  13/10 wouldnt play with the gingers again
ot to play the game for a while.... it was great until it started to crash like five minutes after i got into a game. still havent found a solution to it and would love if someone inboxed me on how to fix it please10
hy is there no furniture in the game? Like all the houses are emtpy the most you see is a bench really.10
Very good game to all military lovers
This game makes my nips hard WOOOO!
Rocks still screw up your life 10/10 would run at 10fps again Get it Rocks won't dissipoint you
ot into the game joined a server but the name of altis life walked across the road and got arrested for jaywalking.10
Lots of Fun with a group!
is a good tactical shooter it has fun game modes like zuse king of the hill and altis life. If you have friends who have it you should buy it and play with them it kind of glitchy sometimes but overall its pretty good10
1000+ Hours of awesomeness
is a great advancement from arma 2 it still holds the fun aspects of gameplay but comes with bigger better more modern equipment and rifles. Also it comes with a wide range of aircraft including remote control drones i would recommend this game to anyone wanting to have fun for a good price as there is many different types of severs.10
Quality game with good development.
Its a very good game! Specialy the Altis life mode on some server! Great Game!!!!!
It's okay I guess.
amazing game full of combat. nothing like call of duty were you run around and shoot many people. This game has so much land to explore and camp in maps to kill your enemies.
is probably the best war sim game on the market right now the gameplay and graphics are beautiful the new physics of the game are amazing single player is challenging but fun and awesome the only thing id wish they add more of is vehicals and weapons but the ones they have in the game now are cool too.10
awesome game!!! .. even if you buy it just for the Breaking Point mod.. it is worth it!!!
 realy like arma and for me the best simultaion of war possible. but  is uniqe its has a great engine and a great story. i hope the developers will continue to make games like this  9/1010
not too bad not too good just give me achievement
Open  Join King of the hill server Yell allah ackbah Gifted Tank by teammate for valiant warcry Kill enemy infantry from 2k meters out Jet flys over me  pants Scream 72 virgins or no deal Friendly jet comes to rescue New Intel Comes to my tank Play 301 hours straight  11/10 would allah ackbah again.
is by far one of my favorite games in my libary with 1000+hrs I have yet to get bored with the game it's self. This game provides endless mods and fun! So what are you still reading this for. Go buy it!10
Grate game
f you are looking for a really realistic game this is perfect for you. It is probably one of the best games ever made can be a bit hard to learn due to many controls10
Best decision game ive ever made in buying a game. 11/10
 have played ARMA III for about a few months. I really enjoyed it Bohemia Interactive actually made a better ARMA! It has perfect Voice Overs instead of ARMA 2 where they read grids lke 2- 1-5-3-5 but in different voices instead of one. I also like the movemet it is great if you want to see over something all you got to do is hold control + w or any wasd key to go in other positions. I onl suggest this game if you got a great computer C: G'day.10
It's a shame that its not for OS X! But when i played it on my old windows laptop it was fun. So overall its fun but it has some downsides to it.
is obviously a better Arma 2 in many ways. Many positives to the game. One of which is the addition of the Steam Workshop. To download missions for Co-Op and Singleplayer. There's no hastle of going to  www.armaholic.com  and downloading missions.  is overpriced though...10
un game with a huge sense of realism mods help make the game you want it to be..10
its good game with a  engine
ery nice looking game based on a real greek island what makes it really cool. Outstanding game and I would definetly recommend you to buy it.10
verall great game nothing else like it. Bohemia Interactive have made one of the best game series ever made and is a revolutionary game company think about this Bohemia interactive update their game for free I'd say about every month or so with MASSIVE amounts of new features bug fixes new things to do and new ideas. When Bohemia wants to make a DLC they only put things that are not going to divide their multiplayer community (some people not being able to use important things because they do not have the DLC) in their DLC's along with coming out with new features for the community as a whole; such as shooting from vehicles advanced flight model and bipods. Take a look at any other triple A game company and Bohemia Interactive is on a completely different level than said company. There is always something new to do in ArmA especially since the new Eden Editor came out which allows for the community to make missions in a 3d environment with scripting timing individual attributes the Eden Editor provides the community with a way to make their own content allowing for ArmA to keep getting refreshed; just look at the workshop. In the end   ArmA III is the best game Bohemia Interactive has made so far and will continue to provide me and my friends hours of fun in times to come.     TL;DR: 10/10 IGN buy this game because its the most functional piece of art on the planet.10
lmost 1000 hours in and most of it was spent on modded servers. Please explore the communities surrounding this game with a realism roleplaying exile etc server/s. Don't just stick to KOTH... Explore what the community has done and have fun.10
his game is great and very realistic but you definitely need to play this with friends and it has a definite learning curve.10
roll the Police what more could you want?10
Was given this game as a gift from a friend and would say that I would pay for it if I had not gotten it as a gift. The game is worth retail to anyone who enjoys playing First Person Shooters as well as strategy as you will get nowhere with just trying to point and shoot. Physics and Bullet dynamics are all very realistic and can be affected by many things. This game is on the top of my list. 5/5
reat game! Awesome server base i would use the a3launcher if you buy thus game!10
Great game for those interested iin tactics and strategy and not run and gunning!
he game I will always come back to for the shear amount of variation in what you can do at any time. Constant updates and inventive mods make this game (platform I should say) a must have in anyones library. It also happens to be the best looking and most responsive playing game on my computer. There is a learning curve like with anything but after 6 months of action I can hold my own quite well depending on what Mod or Scenario I am using. Notable Mods: Epoch Breaking Point Altis Life/ Arma Life server Exile Wasteland Kinjg of the Hill.   When i first built my computer in june of 2015 I built in with Dayz in mind. I have forgone Standalone for this i regret nothing.10
buy this game
f you like realistic army games this game is for you!10
Very nice game i like it!
his may very well be one of the best games I have played this year. One thing which is sure about this game it has unlimited content because the community behind this game is hands down the biggest one for any game.    But be advised this isn't just a FPS it's a Simulator.     is still in development and will never be truly be finished because the community will make heaps of content for this game even now when the campaing is only 2/3 finished it already has loads of content.  I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a realistic game.10
well wtf this game is amazing its hard AT TIMES but over all really good i have a  pc ok 20 fps is ok but over all u can run it and its a sick game
ood but there is a lot of controls to remember....10
wesome game sandbox immersion and tons of excellent mods make it THE best fps and its flexibility allow you to get you in both arcadish missions as well as some realistic mil sim missions. Flexibility of missions is so wide that in any other game we would have called it mods. But in arma its only autodownloadable missions no need to suscribe to gigabytes of mods to have a real variety of game types. Mods can adds some very nice units or maps if you want to go deeper.10
 can't say enough about this game. So fun. My system isn't a super gaming machine (i3 6gb nvid745) but after a little tweaking she works fine. I play multiplayer the 99% of the time and it's just fine. The most 'realistic' military game I've ever played. Take your time to learn it - it just get's better and better.10
It's very pretty and does it's job as my benchmark tool for computer hardware.
Arma III is a great versitile game that will provide you with hours of fun provided you find the right server. Be warned however that it is taxing on even the best of rigs at high settings.
.5/10 Good: Huge open-world map variety of community content improvements from ARMA 2 Bad: Lack of official content some promised features scrapped short campaign with convoluted plot10
This game is awesome
 absolutely love this game its got a great campaign and also you can have open world to look around for resources to help you on your next mission. i really love this game and recomend it to anyone who is a military fan-boy10
This game is epic battleground. Worth to buy and play. So many different maps and mods.
this game is gr8 m8 because i r8 is 8/8. King of the Hill is best tho
one of my favorites
If you have a good enough computer to run it then its definitley worth it.
Can only say that this game is amazing.
 great all round game that can be modded to do almost anything you enjoy there are servers for RP mass carnage and then there is the popular Exile mod that i enjoy playing alot on as well due to the crazy amount of weapons that extra mods can bring to the game and various new ways you can hunt other players.10
ery good game you need a good Computer to handle the graphics. Some bugs that can be fixed. But still one of my most favourite games.10
hat how Arma gose . in the first 24 hours you dont know what the  you doing i\or how to move and try to jump. aftar the 24 hrs you releas you cant jump but you can use  with all the cars hllicopter and more i have 1300Hrs on the game and i am still learning . good luck   10/1010
AWESOME GAME !!!!! 100%  Too bad i got it only for the holydays
Breaking Point Mod!
The ammount of fun you can have with this game is amazing!
One of the best Fps games i have ever played! Really fun with friends.
i dont have the game
eeds a pretty buff computer to play well I had a lot of lag because my computer didn't reach the requirements. But that's pretty much my fault not the game's. It's pretty good.10
reat game with plenty to do will never get old/boring.10
This game lead me to my breakup as i gave more time to it than my bae :D Its worth it :D
I really enjoy playing  love it thats it lol :P
Can anyone tell me how to sort this out please it everytime i go to play a game i have 16gb of ram and a 2tb hardrive it says 'The instruction at 0x01630984 referenced memory at 0x00000088. the memory could not be writen i cant play the game at al its a great game just dont understand why it does this only started last week :(
Loved the game! Graphics are beautiful and is fun to play with friends!
1000 hours in and still learning  about this game daily   Love it
Love it !! Don't have it? Get it!!!
as been playing this game from v1.14 pirated version so my actual hours I spent was more than 15k hours maybe. Bought the legit copy on 2015 worth the full price but I'm just broke lol.   The game itself is basically a sandbox with many potential scenarios and situations the only limits was your imagination and your will. Once you finished the campaign you probably trying any casual gameplay like Wasteland Altis Life Exile etc. Or if you like zombies you might like Breaking Point Exile with Zombies and many variation of them until you don't even know what do you want to play. So much things to do.  Or if you into realism or immersion of military simulation you can join any Unit and play like actual soldier in battlefield following some protocols radio and . It maybe sound so serious but trust me it was fun. There are many things you don't expect to be happen but turns out it was a hilarious experience with your teammates or some dumb acts someone did makes you laugh.  For regular player you might found Arma have complicated action button on the keyboard a lot of it but you will get used to it. And Arma have REALLY BIG maps like dude it was 20km square ! people sometimes joking about it called 'asthmatic jogging simulator' because you will mostly run one to other place very often. even running 1km take a few minutes on foot. But if you playing a scenario mission it wont be matter as long as you put some vehicle in advantage point and keep the immersive gameplay.  what its good about Arma ? its THE MODS. the community keeps growing and there is some awesome authors put their effort and times making cool mods like new maps new weapon and etc. You may ended up having mod running 50gb on your disk.  Lets talk about downside. Some people complaining about its performance on multiplayer like having very low fps although you running a monster pc race. Well basically arma is calculating everything ingame your character the environment weather time bullet trajectory ambient sound animation AI etc. It's not suprised if you lagging if you put too much mod and a heavily scripted mission because the server or your pc calculating every script on air and sync it to every player so if the server have 40 player on it its like the server have 40 time load than regular one. Its logical i think but I hope BIS would improve their coding so we have a better fps on multiplayer.  Also if you even enter the forums.bistudio many people complaining about BIS didn't looking after problem that existed but focusing on adding new feature. Well there is some demand from player to fix some their basic feature I hope they listen to their community.   So overall verdict from me:  Graphics : 7.5/10 (gettings better) Sound : 8.5/10 (just like real life) Gameplay : 8/10 (just what I am into) Overall : 8/10 (recommended for you if you like gameplay like arma)10
A must buy 6/9
ell look at my game hours.   This game played in vanilla isn't very realistic i suggest getting a couple mods installed and search for a clan.  Well in all of my game hours I played in many clans many gamemods and a lot of ranking up in certain clans.  Have a good game if you'll buy it :)10
his is one of the most fun games I have played and with the amount of custom created content I can imagine I will be playing it for many more hours.  Only downside is this game is not optimized too well and has a prety big list of glitches/bugs.11
 Have over 1100 hours on record with this game since Early Access.  The game has become much more user friendly since coming out if you want a casual to all the way hardcore MILSIM experience look no further.  Pro's: Huge Scale  Gorgeous visuals  Large selection of weapons  Realistic Ballistics physics damage implementation for various calibers realistic Flight model including but not limited too advanced flight model implementation such as stalls vortex ring state damaged instrument panels and etc.  Welcoming community  Insane amount of free mods and maps (Including weapons textures sounds for weapons such as DragonFyre sound mod and etc..)  Tutorials that actually teach you how to play and how to not only react to contact and ambushes but also teaches you how to team play as part of a larger assault element and also combined arms (Ever wanted to be in the big boy army and participate in a large scale attack? look no further).  Good single Player Campaign.  Con's  Can still have a steep learning curve mission making takes practice more advanced missions scripting requires a decent concept of game script writing  Very very un-optimized for current Gen CPU's. Single thread performance only can be resource intensive recommend a i7 CPU for decent game play takes a beast of a rig to run with everything maxed out in multiplayer (FPS in multiplayer is based off server side FPS and NOT client side aka your PC FPS hence even powerful pc's can get stutter in large scale multiplayer games).  Can get pretty big in size if you subscribe to a large number of mods  Some mods can interfere with others.  TL:DR Since coming out  has become much easier to learn and grasp with new and improved tutorials and scenarios amazing mod support and close knit community help overcome and issues with this game such as optimization issues and map creation tools. If you do get this game highly recommend finding a MILSIM unit and or group of players to help guide you in starting out in this game.

I have over 320+ hours in this game and i can honestly say that it gave me ptsd.... but seriously 10/10 great game has a few bugs but no game is perfect. also it is the most accurate representation of combat in any video game i have ever seen.
/10 for being a one of a kind game. It is a massive scale realistic military game with a developer that generally listens to its community and embraces mods. Also Tanoa is flippin awesome.  -1 for the action menu not being replaced  -1 for no ability to play as female player model in vanilla game. It's 2035 Bohemia!10
RMA is demanding on systems and has a high learning curve but offers more options than any of its competitors - making its mastery uniquely satisfying. It simulates combined arms (infantry armored vehicle air and sea crafts) combat with a high degree of realism. A version called 'VBS' is even used by multiple NATO militaries as a training aid. What content isn't provided by the publishers can be crafted by users with the in game editor and modelling tools pack and shared in the community (see below).  Compared to previous iterations of the series; the action and command menus have been reconfigured for more generalized pointing and clicking spacebar use supplements the mousewheel and middle mouse button leaning can now be fluid (similar to Rainbow Six 3) if the function is bound to devices like peddals inventory swapping has been made easier and quicker uniform and armor peices and weapon accessories can be changed out mirrors and water reflect the ability to dive and to man submersible craft has been added. Weapon sway has been increased and body armor provides greater protection. Weaponry isn't depicted entirely accurately but is based on existing designs so isn't necessarily unrealistic.   https://community.bistudio.com/    https://withsix.com/   http://dslyecxi.com/    http://www.armaholic.com/    http://www.armedassault.info/    http://www.ofpec.com/index.php 10
1. Too much Altis Life 2. I hate Altis Life (My option dont try changing it) 3. Everything beside Altis Life is fun 4. Altis Life as Server name takes around 400+ servers 5. There are 4000 servers in total
his is a fun and clever military experience that does a great job at making you feel like you're on the battlefield. It is hard to get use to a first but in time you will learn the basics of 10
hey should really make this game free because it is awesome and alot more people wil play the game i played when it was free weekend and it was awesome.10
est War Simulator so far after Arma 2! If you love sim or maybe you love realistic system or maybe you just love to setup your own epic movie scene this is the game for you! :D  SIMPLY THE BEST10
ella Fun with friends. Looks great plays great online works and the action is intense!10
Made an ac-130 with tanks and a small plane... 11/10 -ign
his is THE game! If you had military training you play milsim games such as airsoft or paintball  you are a fun of modern warfare you want to experience a real life combat situation this is the game...  gives you unique experience adrenaline rush a bit of frustration and great satisfaction with the completion of the given task.   if you have military training you will find that it gives you an actual advantage in this game!  Bullets will pin you down and they will determine your next moves. Its a total military simulation I totally recommend this game to players that are not fun of 'arcade' like FPS or consider  battlefield (which is a great game) realistic.  10
its the perfect mil-sim game ever .... i just joined and i lost my mind .... really good game worth it ....
This is a good game.
Its a cool realistic game! i love it!
not your regular fps there is a base game but people use mods so its like many games in one  that being said some mods suck some mods rock i have nearly a thousand hours in and i have to be honest out of those hours i spent half never seeing a soul lol its true but none the less its fun addictive and as you can see you can waste tons a hours
his is the best game out there so download it now or u will be depressed for the rest of ur life. The mods for this game are great too! Like Breakingpoint Epoch Battle Royale and many more great mods!10
he perfect military simulator.  I was on a tank we ran off from a cliff and got stuck on a tree we had to shoot the tree to get free and in that moment a rocket made us blow up. 10/10 would blow again.10
is incredible. If you are looking for a game that gets as real as possible this is it its not even a game its a war simulator. Missions are satisfying and even when they go bad its an unforgetable time.  Dont play arma without mods you are missing the point of it.10
THE best military combat sim on the market
This game is great. I have dedicated all my free time to playing this. When it gets boring just download some mods!
10/10 Would Recommend.
Great game it is the most realistic game i have played. The bullet mechanics are amazing such as you can only penetrate through an amount or a type of wall with types of guns as a sniper could go through 7 walls about but at that amount the bullet goes down a lot and makes it a quite horrible shot though can still lead to death. The helicopters are good as well so are the jets as helicopters can/may have flares which deviate from the jets lock on and will miss which is a good way to nerf the jet without actually nerfing it. Game has a lot of game modes and even game modes made by the players themselves which make it more fun E.G Altiz Life.  Though a thing that should be removed is the DLC as you need to pay to actually get the full game really. You want to snipe? That's an extra £7 you want more choppers that are better than the default? That will be an extra £7. Though there is an exception for one DLC that does not matter the go karts DLC as it is just there for people that would like it though the rest should be removed.  I would recommend this to people that like realistic games and not games that are just run and gun.
n modern war you will die like a dog without any good reasons.' The first thing i've learned in  online battle is surviving not shooting and that is what real war will teach you.10
This game is really fun to play with friends and yourself and a great shooter game.
rma is a game that takes a type of person to like it. It has its glitches and its awesome things. Altis Life is something you should check out if you are more of a casual RP player. If you are more serious try out a mil sim server where literally everything is simulated like the military. There are also domination servers where you capture towns from enemy NPC forces. If you have no patience there is always wasteland or king of the hill where you can shoot people on sight without worry of a ban.   Personally I think arma is a great game. I would give it a 8.5/10 due to the 'arma glitches' and learning curve. They are working on fixing the learning curve though. I would like to see more out of the devs even though I believe they are working hard.   Most of my time is from playing on an altis life server - Therevolutiongaming. Now that it has closed down I play other gamemodes like exile KOTH or random missions with friends.10
It is was a really nice game and all the stuff you could do. man i cant put it in words just buy it.
ilter for TF1778 and try domination on that server easy to play without stupidly accurate AI getting you right away.10
 pre-ordered  deluxe almost as soon as it was available i was hyped for  and despite what my hours reflect (steam is weird with offline hours) i have played the crap out of this game; i want no i NEED to love this game day 1 i convinced 3 of my friends to buy  so we could play co op together and i'm regretting doing that.   The Game:  The game plays just how you’d expect from an arma game some bugs it's weird quirks like you can vault into a wall and kill yourself despite walking 10 feet and laying idle for half an hour my trained military professional can't stop from shaking around like a heroin addict. Still its arma and i enjoy the game i would recommend it it’s really fun.   Unfortunately the one thing i was super excited for was under water combat water infiltration etc i was sooo hyped for it and then i played the diving showcase and i was miserably disappointed. First off there's only 3 positions you can be in standing straight up and down on your back or on your stomach is there a guy directly above you you want to shoot? well that sucks embrace your impending death. you can't move 360 in the water which is just terrible the underwater combat and movement is miserably disappointing. A massive massive massive let down.  Still there's hope!!! who doesn't love helicopters in arma right? i'll just wait for it to be released… oh cool! just got a notification that helicopters have been released let's just jump in a- wait what? i need a dlc? to fly a helicopter? well that’s weird but okay it's probably like 99 cents or 2 dollars nothing maj- 16 DOLLARS!!!!!!!!! WHAT!!!! okay maybe it's justified there's probably like at least 15-20 helicopters right? 2 helicopters for 15 dollars? are you kidding me? what the hell is this no discount for deluxe owners? so i payed all that money for a map and an easily stolen mp3 files great.   alright there’s still one thing i like in arma sniping! it’s so much fun to sniper in arma we all know it soon they’ll add sniper rifles and i'll be able to run around ghilling it up picking off opfor. alright! marksmen weapons added 5 marksmen weapons added too!! sweet i was worried they would add one rifle at a time. let’s just load up a game and get sniping away 16 DOLLARS AGAIN ARE YOU KIDDING ME 16 DOLLARS FOR 5 RIFLES 2 MACHINEGUNS AND A GHILLIE SUIT!!!!!!!!!!!  oh also they added a go kart dlc which is really fun and worth the 2 dollars it costs like all dlc for this game should but doesn’t.  In conclusion it could have been a great game murdered by dlc preventing you from using things in the game i can’t wait for the bullet DLC to let you use Bullets. it would be different if it was something not crucial to game play who wants to do a mission on a massive island without helicopters? who wants to stealth around or take out targets without marksmen rifles? go karts? yeah it's nice cheap DLC not crucial to game play. so so game mechanics if you like arma you'll like it disappointing diving and be prepared to spend at least 32 dollars extra just to play the game. also thanks for charging us extra for trusting you and pre-ordering the game if i had waited and bought the game now it would've cost me less. thanks.   oh yeah and good luck getting more than 30 fps on your thousands of dollars in hardware this game has about as much optimization was windows 10.-10
I have to say I don't know how play this if I haven't a team .so I think if u want a good game time you must have a team together .
 is a good military simulator although not in the real era of Arma 2 it still uses real world models to base their weapons and vehocles off. The game does have its flaws but with a bit of modding you can make it ANYTHING! Seriously you can. It's a great game which you should enjoy if you like real military themed games. Also you will need decently fast internet otherwise things can go all.... lets say.... potato. But overall this is an amazing game and very fun when playing with friends.
First off if you like any sort of realism in your gaming experience and like military shooters ARMA is the absolute best. There's no comparison with anything else out there period. Not even close. The scale at which ARMA does what it does is astonshing. Finding good multiplayer matches and taking place in large scale battles is the coolest experience in gaming. Just get it!
i just play it for the mariokarts
est game NA. Versatile engine amazing graphics and ongoing workshop content and user made MP missions. Only downside is eats a lot of resources. Not for weaker PC's. ++++110
Only fun for about 20 mins.
The only game that I know of where the performance is better the higher your graphical settings are.
reat game love it!10
t's for men but I'm a  but good game :) I rate 10/10 IGN k bye.10
. Been with you since Alpha and now Apex is coming. It's a great game really isn't much more to say. If you want a challenging time consuming and at the same time fun tactical shooter this is the game for you. If you expect CoD or BF go away right now.  Pros:  - Great mechanics - Huuuge detailed maps with so many towns cities and etc - Enjoyable vehicular combat and mechanics - Great (but cliche) single player campaign for a first person shooter - Fun multiplayer with unlimited gamemodes to download as mods - Eden Editor makes it fun to set up your own missions for training/fun - Great modding community  Cons:  - The engine should be replaced for the next title very unoptimized with huge frame drops even on good PCs. - The action menu needs to go seriously. - A bit of a pain to set up a joystick for fixed-wings/helicopters - Rain/storms could still look better happens you see patches of blue sky right above your head  For any tactical shooter fan out there this is a must have. But try to go into the game without comparing it to other FPS games. Just because it can be hard and has complex mechanics doesn't mean the game sucks10
his is a great game highly recommend this to any fan of military shooters. Do yourself a favor and try and get a few mods that's the real heart of the game. Think of Arma as a sandbox you can play whatever you want to in it...10
800 hours of gameplay and not nearly seen or done everything the game has to offer
ing amazing havent played any other game since i purchace it!

This game makes me wet.
Most amazing game out in my opinion. I purchased a gaming pc for this game.... ?? I'm sure alot of people did ??
is awesome game that is very fun to play with friends and also go download mods for ive been playing  since christmas and i found this game to be amazing but i guess its good because of the player that i play with and thats what makes a game really awesome.10
It's a game.
Arma is great to play with friends and there so many awesome mods out there to play i would definitly recommend this game for you to play with your friends :D
his game singlehandedly ruined my life one of the most addicting games ive ever played. 10/1010
hough it is sometimes riddled with goofy bugs Arma (Apex included) really shines amongst the games available in the Steam store. Great great mil.10
This game is actually really fun. My pc was pretty dang bad when I looked at the specs so that's my bad for being stupid. I decided to get a new pc and now its fun.
oo real for me i hear gunshots outside and i think im high af10
when you get 60fps in this game. 60fps=cheating in arma.
Joins Exile Has nothing but binoculars Right next to a whorde Runs Finds a friendly guy in his humvee picks you up teaches you the ropes prepares you to survive gets bitten is infected zombifies put a bullet in his skull rip helpful guy 420/10 would help again
ell Arma.. is it good or not? I think the Arma(s) are great because of the community. Arma III is here with us since 2013 and it has changed a lot. When it first saw the Sun light it was buggy and badly optimized. I know. I was there at the begining (not with this acc.). After a time it started changing in a good way. Many new things have come: updates fps improvment bipods! mods. Mods changed my way of thinking about Arma III. I used to be pessimistic and I didn't play a lot with it. But as these things came I started beleiving Arma III is good it's getting better. I started using many mods tons of maps and so on. Arma III is a great game so as Arma II. The main issue with this game is the people who can't see that this is not a COD or a BF. There are people out there crying about the realism of the game. I think this is the main reason why many people play it: the realism. It's great playing for hours in a milsim or in a CTI game. I can only recommend this game for people who loves these kind of games. It's not that expensive as it used to be but I highly recommend firstly download this game from a website try out if it's working and after that buying it. +thing: the camera mode. It's a great fun for people who are take shots with there camera in real life.10
esides ARMA physics blowing up your car because you hit a curb or yout lightly hitting a bush and your tire commiting suicide this game is fun as hell and gives you more content than you could ever ask for with mods. Great communities and there is something for everyone. Milsim fun games racing or even roleplay! Great engine and fun as hell with friends. 9/1010
ost realistic shooter out there. will take a bit of getting used to but its worth it!10
Best game in the arma line sofar.
heck out my Friend's review who is the best Arma player I have ever seen or known I cant explain it better than him. Steam name: Divercsip10
Huge game and many things to do. Highly realistic. The game amazing and looks great. i can run it on Ultra and have well over 80 FPS (see proflie for pc specs)... Very happy with it
robably my favorite game. i give it a 8/8 its great m8.10
his review will consist of both the famous Multiplayer as well as the amazing Single Player experience but first the old school rating standards:  Graphics: 7/10 Sound: 8/10 Voice Acting: 10/10 Content: 10/10  Learning Curve: Hard  ---------  Single Player:  No spoilers so read ahead.  has an amazing single player campaign that most  players do not even care about because they get right away sucked into the Multiplayer. Big mistake. Although the missions are extremely challenging even at regular/normal game settings the story line (for the people that are into lore etc) is amazing! I wish I could write more but I already warned of spoilers so I won't do it. All I can say is that it is fantastic the way it starts all the way to the way it ends. However new players be prepared for a difficult campaign. I recommend to play it on easy mode. On regular mode 1-2 shots and you are dead and enemies hit you from long range. The tutorial although well made still leaves to be desired for the very new players it just barely gets you the feeling of what it is you need to do. The voice acting is top notch something rare a real gem. Amazing voice acting with the right music at the right time. If you have  and have not played the Single Player Campaign you are doing it wrong!  Multi Player:  I mainly play King of the Hill Infantry only server. The MP is top notch too (it has its flaws more below). I chose the infantry and light armored vehicles only because all other server versions is mainly a BF/COD fanfest. You pull out an expensive vehicle and it gets blown up instantly once leaving the safe zone because aircraft have a much larger FOV and thus can easily take you down from long range. Yes it is supposed to be real but it is frustrating because the aircraft pilots are usually the more experienced guys and in the few King of the Hill servers it is always the same guys hour after hour farming transport choppers vehicles etc...Well it got on my nerves so I left to the infantry only servers. Great stuff here. Good team work less trolls/griefers and the community that runs the servers listen and help out dealing with abusive players. It is a great experience from long range sniping to being a grunt assaulting and holding a tower or riding people into the hot zone via a chopper there is plenty for you to do and to choose from. The ranking system is neat and does not take brutally long to get you started with the right modified weapon and cosmetic clothes. No zebra weapon skins or any of that none sense exists here. Maybe there are mods for it I don't know but here nobody cares how your weapon looks like.  The Map:  Altis and Stratis are real locations amazingly made. The only downside is that the interior of buildings are all empty but given the fact that apparently each house was placed there exactly as they exist today it is understandable. The Devs put a lot of work into it and I have been to Greece and yes it looks exactly like it. So do not expect to find a BestBuy Dennys or Jamba Juice there. All I can say is AMAZING huge map!  The Bad:  FPS is an issue. Sure it is no issue if you turn the graphics to low but I play on an i7 5960X with a 980Ti and this game is NOT playble at Ultra settings and even at high settings FPS can be horrible. I refuse to play this at medium settings thus I do get killed a lot due to FPS issues. There appears to be graphic related lag too from time to time. Lots of people will go on and on about end-user settings being the issue well I play a ton of other games that are much newer in ultra settings and no issues there. For people that want the above 60 FPS experience on their 27' 144 Hz screens this game is not for you unless you want to play it on medium to low settings. For my rig that is a no go so I play it at High settings and accept that I sometimes die because of FPS related lag. Also the weapon sound in terms of hearing enemy weapons (hearing own weapons etc is fine) is abysmal. A guy can shoot at you with a machine gun from 20 yards and all you hear is a soft 'tick tick tick'.... you need to download player mods apparently to make that better but I don't use mods so I am SOL I guess.  Game does sometimes have its bugs they do not occur often but they are there. You glitch through a wall at certain angles when you are inside a building and a sniper without AP bullets outside shoots your butt that is sticking out of the wall and you die these type of bugs. Easily avoided however.  Mods:  Speaking of mods. I don't play mods but that does not mean there are no good ones out there. There are a ton of mods single player multi player the skins of your country's army you name it it is all there.  Overall:  I rate this a 8.5 and as an old school player that to me means AMAZING. Got over 100 hours into it and looking forward for Apex next! The single player campaign is also present there and apparently it is affiliated with the one from . Looking forward to it !!!  To Conclude: Hard game to master but rewarding once you know the ins and outs of it! If you are into these type of games give it a try!10
+One of the best war simulator games ever! +Very easy to install mods +Nice world interactive (about 80% of the buildings can be destroyed) +Nice maps +Cool Graphics  -Some bugs -Hard to control by newbies  8/10

f you're looking for a smoth 60 fps multiplayer experience then go away.  Unless you own a NASA computer.10
Love it one of the best out there
ltra realistic military game unlike anything I've ever seen10
f you are into Military Simulation this is the game for you! First Bohemia has made the gun sounds and Gun physics are amazing! That is not the only thing Arma is good for.  has many game-modes such as Altis Life Wasteland Domination King of the Hill and so much more! One more thing about those game-modes. They are community made! Trust me this game is amazing!10
Very realistic video game
Best game ever. Can do alot very realstic.
mazing Game honestly. Its a very fun game to play with friends or alone.   10/1010
un realistic shooter get friends for max fun.10
ery fun and emmersive especially when you a group of friends get together and work as a team. One of my favorite games of all time.10
uper Tactical need to be in a team though no singleplaying on servers! Super Fun10
I love this game there is always so much to do I never get bored.
awsome game the graphic on this game is just so beautiful free open world with big map and awsome vehicles. Buy this game trust me its worth the money!!
wesome. 30 FPS with mario graphics .  I Can only compare how hard this game is to run .... like a boner  hard at first  then after a while you just deal with it10
a very good game just takes some time to get to grips with
n my opinion  is the best military sandbox currently available on PC.   The game has a bit of a learning curve and the base game can leave something to be desired but the sheer amount of mods/custom missions available add countless hours of gameplay which is almost as staggering as it's expectional predecessor (Arma 2).  10/10 Army Men for Adults.10
All i can really say is that this game is really amazing ithas just about everything youu could want in a game about the military but there is only one complaint that i have but dont be deturd because of this this game is extremly poorly optimized and no matter what kind of rig you have its just about impsossble for this game to run at what people say 'optimal' but my computer is terible and i havent upgraded it at all and i can still run this game but at the lowest settings 2-30 fps but aside from that this game is 100% worth $60 when you buy it you will not regret it!
ing amazing! with all it's mods! 10/10 would buy again
mazing Game Totally Worth Getting  Graphics 10/10 Multiplayer 10/10 Campaign Not Finished/10 DayzAltisLifewasteland etc mods 10/1010
AMD is for 
im ing love this game
Very good game 10/10 would kill again
Appreciate the fact that I could download it for free for a given period of time. Too bad I can't fukcin' run it.
his game as the best fire fights they really get your blood pumping and its not about running and gunning u got to use strategy with your buddys. You got to be patient and wait for your target its really a good looking game when your on a hill sniping down in to a town or in a jet or helo up above the clouds.10
he Good The Bad And The Ugly.  The Good: The level of realism.  isn't absolutely perfect as a simulator as a stand alone but with mods it's something to behold. Customizable weapons Customizable Outfits A huge sandbox world Clans  The Bad: Many of the players they just want to play Rambo and not coordinate or communicate with anyone making the game harder for everyone. Most servers are just Altis Life Wasteland or Exile. Not a whole lot of pure military combat going on. Idiots who like to fly helicopters full of people into Areas of Operation (AO) and get everyone killed.  The Ugly: FPS can get pretty low very easily. This has more to do with your computer but the game very much tailors to next gen PCs over some of the older ones. Content. They really expect you to pay $15 for a damn rifle pack (or the other packs). If you begin to use content that you don't own you will likely get an obnoxious (and I mean all over the screen) amount of messages saying you don't own it and you need to buy it. Either don't let me use it or stfu. Seriously.  Overall I think this game is very solid but it's not free from frustration.10
good game mediocre performance
f you enjoy military sims buy ths game. If you enjoy sneaking around a giant map engaging in combat with up to 64 other players in a fight to the death buy this game. If you enjoy multiplayer on a massive scale that puts both Battlefield and CoD to shame buy this game.  If you enjoy a zombie filled wasteland buy this game. If you enjoy a game that went from $60 to $40 in the course of 3 years buy this game.  In short buy . It is one of if not the best FPS's out there.10
ow where do I start with this game? There is just some much to it that its hard to narrow down the game to your basic FPS because its   MUCH   more than that.     Basics10
is a beautiful game it has realistic animations and much more! It is a open world combat simulater and you can move around the map by land sea and air good luck on the batttlefield. 10
ARMA3 is such a great improvment over ARMA2 it's....Amazing  If you're looking at the price and you go...ohh It's a bit much...  Factor in how much time you can waste on this game over some cheap POS on a steam Sale  It truely is an awesome game!
his is not your typical fps If you played the earlier Rainbow six titles SWAT series Operation Flashpoint or other simulation based tactical shooters this is the game for you.10
tunning Game i guess the one thing i've always loved about the ArmA series is the  MASSIVE   range of community mods.   So many new gamemodes are developed every few months you can never get bored.      9/10 (DLC's bit stingy)        Stay Spooky   11
The best game in the world
A great game with extendability
ery fun and gripping i do not recommend for older or less powerful computers.10
ne of the best games on steam. Countless hours of fun so much worth.10
Really nice game
his is the kind of game that PC gamers should be proud of.  There is a hard learning curve when you start with it but the options you get the possibilities all the mods game types content is worth enough for the sacrifice.  The game is best played with friends theres plenty of communities out there to joi n no matter if you are new or a veteran most of them will welcome you.  10
A+++ Must play
his is a awesome game! It's a Army Simulation based game with no white dot on the screen to help you hip fire you won't be seeing much of that. The vehicles are smooth with a steady internet connection. I would recommend that you practice your flying skills on single player to get the hang of it so when your in battle with 8 guys in the back you know what your doing.10
Sick game bro
 is most likely to be my most favorite game ever. I have put over 2000 hours into the game so I know a lot about it. It is indeed very buggy but its super fun. There are tons of things to do inside of   I spend most of my time playing Battle Royale. I would really recommend this game for people that like Army sims.
It is a great 3p and 1p shooter and it has really awesome graphics and has the best gameplay it is a game that can only be made in a dream but it turns into reality. I love it so much because I love these types of game.
his game is great. I come from Dayz so I love mods like exile. If anyone plays this mod or similar mods add me and let's play.10
nyone who thinks about buying the DLC bundle for apex you dont get it. Apex is an expansion and you do not get a expansion in a DLC bundle they are two different things I don't personally own the dlc bundle so I can't write this on the dlc bundle page. If you already bought the dlc bundle I can't argue with people being mad but people are buying the dlc bundle after apex was released but it specifically says it comes with Marksman helicopters and karts that is their faults for not paying close enough attention.10
reat game great single player and mp great community and great mods.10
mazing game the new APEX DLC is great the maps are so big!10
he community has a powerful effect on the game. Different game modsmapsaddons and alot more. Definitely worth it.10
his game is a game that pumps your blood through your brain so it can keep up with the amount of planes cars and trucks that exsplode next to you while you and your freinds are stuck in the woods trying to find a sniper 2 miles away. then you make a 2kilometer run to a gun store so arm and protect yourself lon enough to get out of that general area. I love to play this game with my freinds it is a great experience  and if you have a good computer this game will suprise you in many ways.10
UPA HOT FIYA I SPIT THAT.10
5% of the hours I've put into this game have come from the Multiplayer aspect alone. It feels like there is always fresh and new content constantly being made by the community coming out everyday. The developers are also what make this game great they always listen to feedback to constantly improve this game.10
A really good game for people that like War mods and other things vehicles Helicopters and tanks   My Personal Favorite Mod: Overpoch  http://customcombatgaming.com/forums/index.php?/page/index.html   U can build bases on it theres lots of different guns a lot of war 10/10 mod
I have acute PTSD  10/10
 want to start off saying that I absolutely love this game.. However I've managed to log a fair amount of hours and I've noticed that with every update that bohemia puts out this game loses playability. Fps drops glitches screwed up animations and exploits. When I first started playing  it was beautiful. I had no problems running this game at all. With the last three updates it has gotten worse each time. Bohemia needs to finish the game and test their content before the release it to ruin the gameplay experience for their hefty price tag on this title. When this game is functioning properly it's by far one of the best games I've ever played and by far the most realistic. It has very diverse gameplay with many mods available via  armaholic.com  and the DLC that they've released with the game.   So in summary if I'm paying 59.99 for  and also buying their DLC along with all of the other paying customers. The developers of said title should have enough funds and the ability to ensure that their game works properly.10
bsolutely excellent. You will not find better mil sim than this game (after some addons of course). There is the occasional clunkiness but this is a direct result of the intense realism. Buy this game install realism addons join a realism unit and welcome yourself to the virtual military. haha. Seriously though. Buy this game.10
reat for its expansive multiplayer communities and units. Bad for its underwhelming vehicles but of course mods make this game truly great.10
Fun to play with friends ;)
is amazing. While the story is a bit bland in some parts jump on any combat servers and you'll have a blast.   Pros -Amazing weapon/vehicle system -Destruction (Nothing like BF4 but its good) -Doesn't run like a piece of  (Like Arma 2 or Dayz) -Amazing game engine more pretty than Arma 2 and optomized better. -Lots of gamemodes including Altis Life and Wasteland  Cons -World's Most Original Story  -On servers the fps is determined by server fps. -Hard to spot Ai (Maybe thats just me) -Killed pretty easily (Again maybe thats just me)  Overall it's a pretty good game. Pick it up on a sale if you can or want.  8/1010
when i got  it was on a diffrent computer it worked fine-ish (i had a bad computer). today i have a great computer that should run it but the last update wont finish. it went up to 99% pritty quickly then stoped and eving when i have perfect internet conection and can run all my other games it dose not download.
I liked the game but the fact that i payed for it a week ago and it when up for sale the next week is anoying
Best game I've ever purchased in my Lifetime. The modding community is off the charts along with the game itself. If you have the money. I reccomend purchasing it with no regrets. Best on steam in my opinion.
Increadibly realistic the best game i have ever bourght!
Game is amazing and makes me really horny
A great game very fun for life servers and Milsim things everyone should Play.
Very suspensful campaign. Only thing I could ask for is a expansion the ending. I recommend this to anyone with the interest of a military simulator and with a rig that can handle it. You won't regret it.
I absolutely LOVE arma. I am particularly a patron of Exile and TLS. It's an amazing game with something like 2 cents per hour of entertainment. Definitely recommend if you like milsim or roleplay. :D
Awesome game with loads of great mods
ne word to describe this game 'unreal'. this game is amazing it not only has an incredible story it also has a vast range of mulitplayer gamemodes like; atlis life invade adn annex king of the hill gun gamewastelanddayz(epoch and such) and many more.  This game also looks incredibly the only down side is that you need a beastly PC to run it and even then if you get 100 fps on high settings in singleplayer for soem reason multiplayer just eats FPS thats the only major problem   The game has very few glitches (of the ones i have found/coem across)  overall the game is a blast and unlike other games whic are just story based and you could only get so many hours out of it this game (like csgo) you can have unlimited amount of hours but its up to you what you send thme doing10
wesome game. Single player has a pretty decent story to it although its constatly forcing you to learn new things which kinda breaks the flow but otherwise alot of fun and very immersive. Multiplayer is massive and endless. So many amazing mods to choose from. Ive been playing a crapload of Exile. Game also look beautiful would definatly reccomend. If your looking for a modern shooter to play while Battlefield decides to go to WW1 then this should give you your fill.10
Bought . Got . Sold cocaine. Killed friends and foes. 10/10
he campaign was hard for me at the beginning but if you take some time to learn those tactics and be patient about it you will find yourself enjoy the experience that is different from any other fps games.10
 love this game because it's the only one of its kind. I hate this game because it's the only one of its kind and I need to swallow all the terrible flaws this game has ;_; &lt;3 Thanks bohemia for making the best poorly designed master piece there is.  Pls write a new engine from scratch for the next installment with all that DZ and Arma monies you have so you'll actually know how everything in your engine works. You don't fool me there is tons of files names .ofp or ofp2 (Operation Flashpoint Operation Flashpoint 2 [Arma 2] )10
Don't even know where I'm being shot from 10/10 Will Continue getting Kapped
Really good game. Got over 700hrs and still not bored. Only thing is it is purely optimised and as I have a AMD processor I only get 17-20 fps
This game has become my life I REGRET NOTHING!!!
ve always looked at it like this...  Call of Duty is for kids. Battlefield is for teens. Squad is for adults. Arma is for veterans with PTSD.  In all seriousness this game has so much to do and play when you add up the RP games the actual Arma gameplay and modded gameplay. You will like playing it alone you will love playing it with a friend and you will hate playing it with several friends because no matter how much you vet who you're playing with you will always get a  friend who is a team killer. 10
The best war simulator ever!  8.5/10
mazing game mostly play for the roleplay but the campain is phenomanal -good graphics -strong multiplayer and campain -good roleplay10
fter playing arma you will never complain about low fps in another game again.10
 played it as a steam trial so it was pretty good10
Log into an exile server for the first time. Guy comes up to me and says he's friendly. Shoots me in face. 0/10 would be friendly again.
10/10 Game been playing this for awhile and can't stop playing it.
Pretty good game! Running on ultra settings and is very smooth coach!
This game is a must buy. I normally play wasteland and it the most fun ive had on the game. If you want to have a crazy experience play with the new apex update in the tanoa map.
ery fun mil-sim/shooter/sandbox lots of user content the dev content aint that great but user gamemodes are fun10
rilant game  but its not good for king of the hill any more as there are hardly any servers10
This game is very beatiful so very dinamic and very realistic.  Graphics 10/10  Dinamics 10/9 Optimise 10/6  So if you have bad system get 20 fps in altis life if want play other mods up to 30-40.
This game is one of the best games i have ever played. It has a large selection of mods that keep it fresh to this day. The multiplayer is amazing with game modes verying from TDM to large scale combat.
Alright so this game is a fantastic tactical simulator but besides that this game comes stock with more modes than just competitive basic modes like TDM and CTF. This game comes with wasteland and altis life without any mods in place it's worth a look no matter what.
Top quality army simulator
ea Quite fun...  Would be killed again sort of...10
is a well made next game in the Arma series with many options you can do. Now I played many different modes and mods that I should give you a decent review about this game.  Story  I do know that there are not many people that want to buy  because of the story but it still has one and isn\'t bad. It is a new story and does not have something to do with Arma 2 or else. The story starts with a mission for you and another soldier to help out another Camp but on you´re way there an invasion of the AFF starts over the hole Island and you and you´re superior that is with you at that time try to get to a safe place to reform their allies. This get´s harder than though because the AFF troops are anywhere but helpfully there were some units from the UK that helps out and you can regroup with them and so the story starts where you try to get connected to another safe Island and do many different tasks.  Gameplay   You can control land sea and air craft vehicles or go by you\'re own foot on the maps Stratis or Altis and many modded maps. There is not rally a task given to you by the game besides the story there are many different tasks given to you by community made co-op missions or PvP modes and also the complete different thing like a real life in modes like good known \'Altis Life\'. But besides Altis Life or other similar mods this is a military simulation game and give you many possibilities to let it feel like that. In co-op missions in a group of friends you need to make a briefing of the situation and make a plan or just go on patrol and get surprised by an attack of an opposite fraction and many more kind of situations. There are too many different gameplay methods given to you by the community that I can not listen them all up here.  Pros: -maybe one of the best military simulation games so far -many and sometimes comepletly different kind of gameplay methods -good graphics  -game gets upadatet by the developers to fix bugs and make the game just better -active community -Steam Achievements -you can use the terrain to your advantage  Neutral: -KI is okay as an enemy in co-op missions and is not completely stupid but also not perfect right now  Cons: -hard to remember all the keys for new beginners -many bugs(like falling trough some stairs and die or looking trough a wall) -the game has FPS problems like FPS drops   Conclusion: This game has many good things to offer and is one of the most realistic games so far (especially with mods) but it still needs to get patched and fix bugs.  is a game you should buy because of the game play you will not have in any game I know right now and you get to live with the bugs and learn to avoid them as much as possible and if you have friends to play with this game can get you many hours of fun game play to get.  10
i spend over 6 weeks playtime with this game.  10/10 would waste more of my lifetime
Life? what life. My life is gone. One of the best games to date. Watch yaself a youtube vid then make your self a mission or jump onto a server with 100 other people and die from lag. But you will stall keep coming back for more.
Amazing game. If you dont own it your missing out
it is a realistic simulation game cross from military combat to roleplay enviroment interesting and you won't find another game out there like this one
LOVE !!! Endless possiblities in this game!
It's relly fun gane i have over 600h in it there's atis life &amp; life mods &amp; King Of The Hill &amp; wastland
ust as buggy as ARMA 2 just as fun though10
Totally worth the arm it costs to buy it.
Absolutely great game from all aspects. Best to be played with friends and mods but requires quite the rig to run the game stably.
reat military simulator I'd recommend after you're used to controls to join a community. For me the best fun you can get is playing co-op/PvP missions with friends. If you're feeling hardcore join a milsim unit or if you want something a bit more casual join a casual community/unit. You'll meet a bunch of new people and hopefully have fun.10
retty solid game I wouldnt say its totally better than ArmA OA but theres definitely some better aspects to the game.10
Noice Game
rmA III?  THIS GAME IS AMAZING! ok ok let's get through the points: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What is this game?  is a military Sandbox. It contains many resources to let the community create something out of them. Is it fun? Yes it is a ton of fun though it is a very hard game: Hard to master hard to get into. Is it beautiful? YES! BUT you need a beefy PC to run it smoothly. Is this better than Battlefield or CoD? Yes! Everything possible in these games can also be done in ArmA and even more! What do it need? A good PC Roleplay mechanics patience and because you will fail several times: persistence. Is it worth the price? Yes! Do I love it? Yes! How was my day? Yes! ARRRGHHH WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? CLICK THE F***ING ADD TO CART BUTTON AND PROCEED! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 10
ny other FPS is just a toy.10
I wish they would make the game cheaper because people want it really bad but because of its price less people actually buy it. If they would make the price lower I bet more people would buy it. But overall It's my favourite game ever
fter coming from DayZ Standalone I was pretty excited to try this out. I first play a co-op mission and meet really cool guys and made a friend. Next day I played battle royale...  Let's just say I might die with my fingers on the keyboard.  Buy it.                                      Why haven't you bought it yet?                                                                                   Seriously? BUY IT.   10
 is probably the Best game I've ever played! The creativity of this game and the options available to you are incredible. I'd seriously suggest people buy this game and get involved! Altis Life I would say is the best Community made thing to try out!
bets game evr i love this game to death i would play it everyday
yes Lenny must get his game
his game is absolutley amazing in just about every way. The game itself is pretty good and has a brutal campaign that will last you a long time. But the true ARMA experience is the multiplayer which delivers time and time again with players even making their own regimentscompanies and divisions. And if the game gets boring like it did for me there is always the steam workshop with a never ending amount of mods to keep you interested like new nations weapons vehicles maps functions characters scenarios re skins and much more.10
ue to my  PC I did not play much of this game but let me tell you it is great. The game is a simulator not a normal shooter. The game only has 3 maps however they are huge. Bigger then the maps in GTA and the such.  I am not in the service so I do not know the specifics of combats however I was in ROTC which is owned by the US Army so I know a decent amout about formations and things of the sort.   You can salute. Saluting is exactly like it is in the United States Military. Your ring finger touches you eyebrow. Your hand should be canted at a 45 degree angle. Your elbow is also paraell with the marching surface.   The formations are also very realistic. Line Collum Wedge and Squad formations are done perfectly. Well the AI is kind of  and gets out of formation quick but they initially get into correct formation.   The guns sound horrible however they sound weak and nothing like the real counter parts. The standard issue weapon is not even a real weapon used by the military. However weapon balistics are spot on. Yes I even talked with my SAI in ROTC about this. The snipers has bullet drop that depends soley on distance and wind. This is not like battlefield which is static bullet drop. It actually depends of the weather and bullet drop is different for each sniper. Assualt rifes has reacoil and require precision to hit.  Overall if you want to realistic experience this is the way to go. This is a simulator however so don't go into this thing thinking it is going to be easy to learn because it is not.10
his is a great game and well worth the money spent. However since I've been playing from the begining of the Alpha it's not quite as fresh as I'd like.  Good on it's own but far better with friends a dedicated server and some decent co-op missions.  The DLC is not worth mentioning unfortunately.10
This has got to be one of the best games i have played graphics are stunning and the combat amazing reccomend the rp servers :) as this game is very good for people who like to rp hope this helps
very good and fun game! highly rercommend
Emense with so many possibilities with Mods.  A great game any way you want it....    Yehaa come on in..
 Lots of versatility and tons to do extremely moddable and a lot of fun to play with friends. Overall its a great game for military simulation or just messing around with friends... Maybe role playing? A ton of fun.10
hings go boom. People talk. You have RP. you have a HUGE map and plenty more HUGE maps and also small ones.  BIG thumbs up in MY opinion but every one has their own opinion.10
ell since Ive logged over 1500 hours in this game I figured I cook up a review and maybe these types of reviews with people who have more than 500+ hours can be trsuted more than the common 2hr junky and already talking  about the game.  Anyway as a military veteran this game has never fell short to living up to the expectations that I had been hyped for when I first purchased it. Mods mods and many more mods that can sum up what I do mostly on this game and if you have the pastience for mods and and server hopping every now and then then this game will suit you well. I have no complaints for this game because it is always being updated almost 1 a month and mods just keep rolling in all the time. Community is as cancer as any game community half of them are trying to be trols and the others just dream to big to be like the big youtubers.   10
he first person shooter for those who dislike the far fetched things in games like call of duty and halo and who want the expansive enviroments that put battlefield to shame. While the Arma franchise prides its self on being a simulator it still has it's gimicks and comedic hickups be it some very interesting animations ragdolling or just physics occasionally breaking (  see here for example  [embed.gyazo.com]  ).   Don't be put off by that if you're looking for the ultimate military simulator however as when it works (which is does more often than not) arma offers some intense fighting with a range of weaponry and veichles. Arma allows you to operate ( with multiple people) veichles such as the standard civilian cars trucks and jeeps as well as the more traditional viechles seen in warfare games tanks APCs AA viehcles and artillery. Arma also offers a range of aircraft veichles ( be it more helicopters than jets) like the A-10 warthog bomber and the huron heavy lift chopper. Each veichle type follows its own set of physics which are relativley accurate to that of the real thing.  Weapons are o'plenty in  but I see little point in detailing every weapon in the game. In short theirs everything you'd expect to find soldiers armed with. The weapons in  offer different fire modes and caliber of round different calibers doing specific penetration and damage for example the 5.63mm Katibla rifle hardly scratches anything armored where as a well placed shot from the 12.7mm GMB Lynx sniper rifle can disable a chopper or jet.  there are a variety of game modes to suit your liking and mods if those are your thing. The three most common game modes you'll see on the server browser are     Wasteland    Altis life    Warfare  They are all distinctly different. Wasteland offers you a choice of 3 teams to join with preset load outs. You then scavange veichles and weapons from the veichles and attempt to do missions on the map to raise fun for better gear to wage war on other players. In short its sandbox survival. Some servers also include a base building function.  Altis life is something a lot of new players seem to enjoy both playing and watching people stream. Personally I hate it but thats just my opinion. Altis life is a role playing community that aims to represent some form of normality. Civilian players work to earn money and Police players enforce the laws. Civilians can make money through illicit activities as well as legal ones the illcit ones paying more. Each server is different so I won't go in to too much detail.  Warfare is what it says on the tin. 3 factions battling for contorl of strategic points across altis. OPFOR BLUFOR and Independant. These servers tend to be a lot more formal and require much more teamwork than the prior two baisically you have to know what you're doing on the game before venturing on to one of these servers as Armas combat system is like no other first person shooter.  I reccomend this game as something to play with friends and enjoy discovering it together as playing it alone (at least I find) is incredibly dull.  The dlc for this game is not essential to play on servers that have the dlc enabled. However you will not be able to pilot DLC viechles or use DLC weapons ( you can still enter DLC veichles as passangers) . In comparison to Arma 2 the DLC for  is very lackluster.  Currently  needs a pretty decent computer to run and even then you're likely not going to hit above 60fps. The game is very poorly optimized  My other fued with  is that manually dropping bombs from a jet is a task that is near impossible. The only way to drop unguided bombs is dive bomb. Using a strafe approach is difficult because the interface on the jets no matter what type they are is configured to that of a fighter jet.   These are all small disadvantages to a game that is so fun with friends  However due to the game only having two maps that are pretty similar it can get repetive very quickly  Over all I say 7/1010
This game is totally KEK!
Its so realistic its scary!
his is an amazing game it's swallowed up a lot of my life with a lot of different servers to check out and explore ranging from Roleplay servers to hardcore Military simulation.  The  community on the whole is great however if you are looking for 'Community spirit' when playing a Roleplay server such as the 'Life' series I'd go ahead and not even bother purchasing the game.  Otherwise this is a very good game and I would reccomend this to anyone who has the spare time that it will consume.10
RMA3- Best milliatry simulation sandbox game/ shooter.   The game campaign is not with amazing plot or something but very fun to play. Online is huge-there is Role play servers and team play mods. You can find anything there. 8/10  The only reason I gave this game 8 - it is very hard to run the game the cpu usage is massive  I have GTX980ti 16GB RAm and Intel i5 4440 CPU The Online mode is using the CPU more than your GPU.10
lot has changed since I made my first review about the game and I guess that sometimes changes are good in the case of ARMA III they did improve the overall experience and that is good enough for me.10
Most realistic game ever.
Realistic shooter
It's an awesome game
his game speaks for itself. The gameplay is authentic the atmosphere pulls you in and the possibilities are endless. Can get a little pricey but if you can grab it on sale it's even better. At stock prices it's still worth every penny.10
un simulator good graphics BIS is good people.10
Fantastic MilSim. Invade and Annex is a great online mission i play with friends and everyone works together for the objective  10/10 would recommend
It's ok I guess.
great game fluid controls has exceptional mods
Most fun I've had in a game in years. Realistic bullet physics. A+
i love it so realistic want to check out some gameplay? checkout thedevildoggamer on youtube
 There is so much to do in this game. I highly recommend it; however if you are new then watch tutorials on the internet or the first weeks of owning this would be frustrating.10
ve only played a little so let me tell you what I've experienced so far (please read all):   Gameplay: The gameplay is addicting rewarding and almost painfully realistic. You hear gunshots but don't see their source because the many trees rocks bushes buildings and obstacles are hiding them. The enemy NPCs are quite accurate and it takes a couple good shots in the chest to kill them.   Weapons Vehicles and More: The weapons look sick and the vehicles do too. One thing I did not like that much was that there seems to be no vehicle 3rd person view. I guess that can be easily overlooked. Weapons look really nice too. Clothing is a bit funny sometimes such as when I had shot someone wearing a bandana in the head- and they survived. Bandanas are terribly bulletproof somehow. The game is very specefic with everything. There are at least 5+ choices of: helmets night vision goggles rifles vests backpacks handguns scopes clothes artillery cars helicopters planes jets weird combat trucks boats and more.   Content: You get quite alot of content for the price of the game. EA charges $60 for an incomplete game- while ARMA III supplies you with more than a complete game. The MAPS ARE HUGE! (Yes there are two maps totalling in over 200 square km!)   Overall: This game is more than worth your money. BUY IT NOW if you enjoy FPS games- and can handle the challenge. You will die a LOT. I promise.10
Highly recommend the game ! Awesome with various modes and really fun to play.  8/8 'Would buy again' - Bonito
Great Role playing game i have been addicted to this game ever since i got it :D Kill everyone in kavala AND REBEL MY PEOPLE!
Really cool u need a good computer to have good graphics and make it smooth
ts real good buy now10
If you have a pc you need arma
This is so good!! So realistic omg!
I love this game
Very good game when playing with friends and by far the most realistic one I have seen
m not someone who usually do reviews or something like that but i think its my obligation to do so...  is for sure the best 'game' you can take if you like realistic combat / physics / balance / aerodynamics / tactics. i've been playing arma for years since Arma 2 and this serie is just awesome you can play it in many styles and combat aproaches. Arma is the only 'game' that you really fell the danger and the strategy in every step of the mission while you proced further in the AO.  i say 'game' because well after all it still a game but is the most realistic experience you will ever have without being in real combat and real danger. i understand some of the complains about the game such as the 'hud is not so friendly' but well this is part of the Arma Experience.   is a Real Mil Sim.  for me its the best of the serie everything was improved from Arma 2 to  the difference is HUGE !  so if you're looking for a REAL Simulator of absolutely everthing and you like War Games Take it With no Exitation.  Thanks to Bohemia interactive for bringing us this Master Piece of Art.  See you in Altis.10
This game is amazing I only have a few hours in it but IM IN LOVE !!!
ne of the best games ever under rated 100%. its just ing fantastic... if your in to awesome fps mil sims10
The best Army games and best czech game.

 Simulator running waiting and where I was murdered?10
This game is really good if your like war and action games this will give you so much joy in it.
Great game for shooting sweaty fat scrubs in the face.
Love it can't get. Enough of arma
 would recommend this game only if you plan to play it online. I haven't really played much of the story mode. That being said... Not only are there the game modes that come standard with the game there are mods! I'll just tell you a little about the 2 I've played. Overpoch (Not sure if there's an E at the end of that word) which is a survival mode where you can build bases and sell weapons you find to buy all sorts of stuff. Lots of fun especially if you wanna spend the time to build a base. The second mod is Breaking Point. Similar in the survival idea but completely different. Lots of fun even if the spawns are just about as bad as you could make them. (They've made sure that you spawn at least 5 minutes from the nearest building. Most of my spawns lately have been on the literal edge of the map as far as can be from anything... I got side tracked...) Just google it.  There are more.  In general this game is awesome. There are so many things you can do. It's a little ridiculous but that's what makes it good. Just get it and if you're cheap get it when it's on sale. It's worth it.10
It's just really good.
C tro cool ce jeee!
It's decent if you have a monster computer otherwise it's a lag-fest and it'll be hell to get it running smoothly.
y the time you see someone you're dead.10
This is a great game to play with friends
best game there is
in this game you know that 20 fps are playable.  10/10 would glitch in stone again.
The only action Game that got me scared to 'Die' in-game'.
n extremely large amount of stuff to do in many extremely large environments. Campaign multiplayer roleplaying co-op side-ops helicopters tanks lots of other vehicles including go-karts bullet-dropping weather wind wildlife etc. I had not played the campaign yet so I cannot say it is good or not but the game itself and all the content is worth what ever it is priced now.10
Keep in mind that this isn't a game that focuses on targeting a large public. Controls take a lot of time to master but to be honest it totaly wroth it. The game sure has a lot of bugs but you realise the scope of the game it isn't that much of a deal. My advice: ArmA takes its sense when you join a large scale mil-sim unit. With all the mods that are out by an insanely active community you cannot jump in this jungle alone. 10/10
i don't even have this game but i still can review it uhhhhhh
 really love . All around it is an amazing game. If you spend most of your time on regular Fps' this is NOT the game for you. Keep in mind that it is a military simulator not a first person shoot.10
ought it this morning pretty good so far 10/1010
Many different kinds of modes and experiences in the game!
I think this is one of the best games i can i imagine right now... i freaking love AltisLife
Really good all round would strongly recommend
The BEST shooter around. End of story....
his game is simply amazing let me tell you why. If you buy this game for it's default gamemode just don't do it well if you want to you can but it's really boring i bought this game mainly for Battle Royale and Roleplay (Arma Life Altis Life). I suggest this game to be played with friends so it won't become boring. Roleplay is love Roleplay is life.10
is a great military tactical shooter simulator that has ALOT to offer. It has a great community that is putting much time and effort into modding and creating missions for you to enjoy. it also offers a great deal of ways to approach the game if you like flying choppers you can take your squad to the objective and give them cover from above or you can be the jarhead kicking  and taking names on the battlefield. Ever wanted to drive a tank / armored vehicle? enjoy rolling around in your beast!  I recomend this game to anyone with a little bit of patience or more. This is not your everyday Call of duty or Battlefield This is a 'simulator' game.  See you on the Battlefield!10
Hard to run on  pc == Little to no 10 year olds! Yay!
The single player is hard as f*ck. Multiplayer is amazing. Great game so far though.
0/10. The best shooter game and one of the best sandbox games. Who needs call of duty when this game exists?10
10/10/10/10/10/10/10
Game was the best purchase i have had in many years and i look forward to playing it in the future.
T-bagged someone with only a combat helmet and night-vision goggles. 12/10
Well Built Game Worth The Buy. Hours Of Fun
10 out of 10
I love to allah akbar in t4 with my mohawk on KoTH
11/10 get 10 fps on multiplayer
reat game one of the most realistic  however it leaves alot of space a great game for modders.10
10/10. A bit compicated. Great value for your money!
is the gmod of military simulation. There are many game modes and communities which you can join and have many like-minded people around you. You can make anything from a small mission to mods that change the game. If you like milsim you like Arma.  10
 have been playing Bohemia Interactive games since 2001 Operation Flashpoint. Spent large portion of my life with them I treat them as a part of it. This game is pinnacle of what Bohemia has already offered us and it will be further expanded possibilites are limitless we should be very excited. I rate it 100/10 if you want realistic shooter for productive adults this is the game for you.10
t's a great game for gamers who enjoy RPG MMO FPS and Realism in games Arma features alot of realistic moments (exept from the bugs) and high quality screen reallusion. And it has a huge  3D map called Altis. It's about 270 squarekilometers And it's inspired from the island... yeah Altis10
uick question. Are you a simulator guy but also a big fan of FP Shooters?  If you answered yes this is a game for you.   It looks amazing just look at it LOOK at it. I don't have the new Apex DLC but the more i see of it the more i think its worth the full price but i will wait for sale cuz i ain't got that much money.   Multiplayer experiance is just insane you can do anything you wish to do and there are some Roleplay servers that are equally as fun. Communication sometimes gives me and other people problem but for the most part it works great.  If you are just a FPS fan it's not a game for you. This is mostly the game where you will run 2km only to get instashot in the head. It's that reason your every step has to be responsable and overthought. You don't wanna go rushing in.   The only part i don't like it's how its set in this 'future' and there are some weapons there that just look too familliar but are not what you expected. I don't see much point on not just all bringing a machinegun with some scope on it to battle. All weapons pretty much shoot the same but some have more bullets.  I like the pistols though people usually laugh when they see a little pistol especially in a roleplay server but they stopped laughing when i put a bullet in their head with it.  Overall this game is a solid 9/10. Buy it.10
orget CSGO and CoDthis is the real deal.10
est Milsim out there!   The only thing is optimization this game needs it bad! its been out 2 years and its still not good. 8/10 I shouldnt be only getting 45-55 FPS on servers with a Gigabyte 980 Ti G1. I should be getting 70-90FPS if they fix that i would give it a 10/10. If they change the optimization they game would be amazing!10
his game is amazing only game i played with realistic weapon battles. Also this game has many mods/addons to download from steam workshop like:  races/mini-games/maps/modes/mods/objects/many more.  Its def worth it!  PS: If u are not sure the game will run on your device buy the game and you can refund it before playing 2 hours! 10
hi my battleye dont work plz help me
still got some bugs but only on the server becuse peopel plug mods and plugins into it. its a GREAT game by it self :D
1/10 not worth it. Stole my life. Calculated out so far has taken 102 days of my life more to come. Please send help10
This game is amazing but the dsync is bad
Introduction
great fun especially the dayz version plays how they show it just need a good a good network to run it if playing multiplayer and looks great with a good gaming pc.
he absolut biggest reason why i love  and i hope if they make a sequal of the game with this i will be thrilled. It's Zues. Using Zues is like an amazing sandbox and i really really hope if the make another ArmA game they have Zues in it. Other wise if they don't add zues to the following game i will still continue playing  cause no game so far has beaten its amazing experince in the zues gameplay.10
orth a buy. SO many mods you cant even imagine. You need a goofy pc for this but once you are in and the FPS is good you wont leave the game.10
Great Game! Nuff said!
Lots of different game modes to keep you busy. it's all about that wasteland mod though
I think  is an awesome game to play. This game has a large amount of custom scenario missions which are really fun to do. I definitely recommend this game.  10/10
Simply one of the best games with the biggest moding community. If you like tactical gameplays with others or building your own missions this is it.
ealistic as .. get this game.. its a really good game it has jets helicopters submarines tanks and stuff.. its really good fun :D10
kay so this is my first review. I have played the game for a while now and i really do enjoy playing  I came in not having really any simulation experience and this game well it got me hooked. This game can cater for everyones needs it hosts a variety of mods to enjoy and much more. I started out buying the game downloading and got straight into the action i played invade and annex a mission where you have to complete tasks with a squad you get assigned to. Everyone is normally very friendly and i admitted straight away im new and got help by a very friendly group of guys and they truly did help. Next i played something that was blowing up at the time Altis Life i had one friend and at the end of 2 or so nights i left the server with an extra 4 friends who i still am in touch with  is a brilliant game/sim that truly does bring people together. The game itself is breathtakingly stunning the graphics are incredible the physics are good and sometimes just funny. The sounds are immersive and everything forms a package of awesomeness. Obviously like all games there is always going to be bugs but on this i havent run into many. So from my POV  gets a solid 9/10 GG Bohemia10
I truly enjoy this game. It is very fun. It would be better if the ai werent so strong. I swear it takes 10 shot in the head to kill one. But other than that it is great!
et me start off by saying this game is great and the workshop makes it 20x better. This game is very complex and can be intimidating for the newbie but one of the greatest parts about this games loyal community is that no matter how stupid a situation might be they will still role play it out. That is partially why this series seems so realistic. Most people are willing to help with anything you might need. Of coarse there are always those people who would rather complain about how bad someone is instead of helping them to become better. The next thing is to learn the controls. It will make your life so much easier there may seem to be many controls but you only use a few of them unless you are a commander. Also this game is beautiful and usually runs decently well on a mid range PC. I recently upgraded almost everything on my computer and I am able to run the game on ultra with 30fps constant but if I tweak the settings a little I can get 60 fps constant except for when the server lags then there is nothing you can do about that. All in all this is a great game with a wonderful community and it has endless mods from the workshop so if you are debating weather to get the game or not let me make the decision for you. Get the game.10
You Couldn't even run this with the matrix.
lots of fun for anyone who attends MilSim West events.
It is pretty good.
nly got to play it when it was free for 3 days but it was some of the best fun I had in a while. Really a game worth getting and outbeats Arma 2. It even seems better optimized since this ran better than the older games. Would love to buy it if I had the money. ;p10
This game is really fun with alta life and wasteland plus breaking point makes it worth it alone.. plus i got it when it was on sale for $35 ^_^
ought this game for RP. Me and a friend started the game with a dream. the dream was to take over the weed game. bought our first car and we crashed. after going through 10 cars we got some weed and had to spend £25000 to processes made £3000. 10/10 euro truck sim clone but with weed10
ood game I would recommend to players who are into military simulator. This game includes variety of guns and vehicles.10
his game is amazing but it's still a unfinished product so just be aware.10
tephen Hawking runs better than this game. If you have some seriously beefy hardware you can run this game 60+ fps. But for us simple plebs we get solid 30's and 20's. Fun otherwise :)-10
When i die im getting plugged into this game
Best Military Simulation out there. Large Modding community. If you want a high end tactical game (not COD or BF) this is the way to go !!!!
It's a game that opens a gateway to mods that are better than the game.
his game has great bullet ballistics  best I have ever seen in any consumer pc game... only thing. this game should have Linux support....10
ith many fun laughs to be had and memories to be shared this is a great game (so as long as you have friends to play with). While a terrible single player expierience due to extreme boredom and blandness it is terrific in multiplayer.10
ow flying UH-1 listening to jefferson Airplane - White Rabbit Sudden AK Fire begins shooting out the crew chief. Crash landing as we drag crew chief away trying to fight off enemy everyone is shot wounded screaming for medics sudden silence as 2 F4 phantoms fly over and bomb us 10/10 will go through hell again.10
His is a rly good game it has a lot of bugs but the overall game compensates for it! THe music is back chilling and insane :D really enjoy the mods!10
un but best when playing cool mods with your friends like Altis Life Wasteland and Epoch.10
I LIKE THIS GAME
 personally just picked up on the Arma series and it takes some getting used to but after awhile the game becomes incredible and I would choose it over any COD and Battlefield. The only probably I have with it is mission 13 does not work for some reason :(10
Ugh I love . I can't binge any game like I can .
While i would reccomand this game...
t's very cool game with alot of action there is also mod's where you can play Real Life - Altis Life Dayz Overpoch Breaking point and alot of other mods :)10
ction packed You can do almost anything imaginable with this game immersive campaign the introduction of steam workshop really added to the amount of fun you can have with this game. I personally prefer the RPG (altis life) or Sandbox servers. 9.5/1010
is a game I like for the vehicles and all the awesome MP games and mods particularly Altis Life. You need a pretty beefy computer to play it well and if you can manage that it's a very rewarding and fun game.10
has given me the best milsim sandbox experience up to date. you can make your own scenarios choose your own loadouts and overall a great game to co-op with. it has infantry combat IFV/armored combat and air combat.10
This game reall suprised me I plan to buy it soon and get the Breaking point mod for it.
So of my short time with ARMA the past few days since it went on sale. I tried for a refund. Ill be honest I did not like this game. I tried MP and I got such bad performance I may have thrown up a little. I did not get the refund after 3 days of waiting. So I decided I should try doing it again.   The reason I wanted a refund was because it seemed to tactical and needed alot of 3rd party software. I gave up on trying to install teamspeak (YES teamspeak...how noobish) when I decided to redownload this game. I asked the community how to use and operate teamspeak as well as how to improve performance. I was directed to a really good guide on steam to increase performacne (Gained about 5-10 frames) and another one on how to use teamspeak.   Since I got everything situated...I have had a complete blast. Sure the performacne is garbage on bigger servers. But I found that this game taught me in my 19 hours 1) 20 FPS is playable 2)This game has a great and helpful community  If you are like me and debating whether to get this because it seems to tactical or whatever...dont hesitate. Get in some of this action. The community is great the gameplay is slower paced and still a blast.   Ill leave with this. the youtube videos make everyone seem like they must have a mic or else you will be screwed on regular multiplayer. That is not the case. You just need to show up and be a good teammate. Never go alone. I would suggest buying this while its on sale. Full price is stretching it.
 like this game and it's ragdoll physics are A1 10/10 would buy again.10
e had a argument on who should be squad lead we then proceded to teamkill each other until one of us gave up. Then the GameMaster lost it and spawned in 100 diving teams (On land) to murder us all. Then aN entire batalion of tank squads and 100 paratroopers above us to top it all off. 9/11 A true military experince. -A graduated Navy Seal WITH NO FIRE SUPPORT10
I must say the Visuall update makes this game feel more alive and less dull! The colors pop out at you before it seemd alway like a gloomy day ! I think personnely there getting ready for the new map Tanoa wich is gonna make  very very great! You do need Intel and Nvidia specs to play at good framerates and suggest you get nothing less then a Intel quad I5 3.5ghz and a GTX970 with SSD! higher specs would of course be better! But this is a tactical game meant to be played within squads! I suggets Wasteland or King of the Hill! Good luck !
he Greenbacks in ArmA are smarter than the Fanatics in the East if you think I'm joking then compare them!  But seriously if you're going to buy this game then for the love of God change to controls to suit you they're cr@p10
If you want a tactical game it's a game for you
its a lot of fun how ever it needs a favorite server tab so you can find servers you like to play on easy but thats it
ent full speed down a mountain crashed into a tree and I exploded into pieces. 12/10 its okay.10
Pretty fun. Although it still runs like it's a Windows XP game.
reat game I recommend the DLC to enhance gameplay and make it more immersive. I would prefer the DLC to be free and part of the game but sadly Bethesda needs $$$ and that's the best way to get it. I'm not mad at all about buying this game and all the DLC. The developers still work on updates to the main game to add new features for better gameplay and have done an excellent job. The new APEX DLC is a must-buy because it shows the true beauty of the Arma game engine on Tanoa. 10/1010
Great military simulator and an amazing followup to Arma 2 8/10
this game is really fun on all the game modes but the best one that i have played by far is the epoch mod .
as a great leap for the engine beautiful lush lands await you. The AI needs improvement (constantly being fixed). The overal content of the game is there (with some bugs) along with the supporting community. You will get lost for hours in just about any server catering to a plethora of gametypes/individuals.. whether that be realism passing time with friends or just flying around to enjoy the scenery. This game helps build good relationships with other players through teamwork and roleplay as well as provided likeminded people with a place to call 'Home'. R.I.P. DIS.10
Really nice so far.
This is a very very powerful game it takes up room even if you unistall it make sure you have a good grafics card and its been thought out carefuly that you want this game.
Authentic.
The Arma life is a good Life...
udio 9/10 Graphics 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Action 10/10  This game is very fun and it has a lot of gamemodes for example wastleland wich is very action packed.  I Recommend this game!!10
This game is great if you want an advanced tactical shooter that is virtualy infinite.
Is one of the best games I have ever played. No matter what you want to do on this game you can do it and if someone hasn't created what you want to do you can make it yourself in this game. With the Eden Editior and the countless mods in the workshop the possibilities in this game are endless.  10/1010
nly played a couple of hours but if you have a Nasa PC or better then I definetly reconmend this game.10
he sheer scale of the maps. The roles its crazy though Villanlia is alright. Get a few mods installed and you can have alloooot of fun with it. This is the only Milsim game ik that does a milsim better though their are alot buggs i heard at least i persoanly have only ran into cliping issues. But its pretty good at the end of the day.10
My cat got PTSD from watching me play 10/10
Best war game out there
Just got it right before it became 50% off. 10/10
If you like Shooting things This is the game for you
his game is the real deal. if your expecting a COD or BF game your snooping up the wrong tree. its better with friends make sure who ever is hosting has a powerful computer (even up to 2016 spec) this game will eat your processer RAM and GPU like crazy while hosting.10
e destroyed a helicopter so hard it crashed the server  10/1011
t`s a good game if your computer has a great graphic card and etc. With the STEAM Workshop it`s really awesome like with Dynamic Zombie Sandbox. Its really fun with friends and can be a challenging gameplay. From missions to survival game modes or just some good old classic TDM`s/DM´s. Its a great game Ill give it a 9.5/10.10
erpetually broken Horribly unoptimized and at times unplayable.  is a game for wannabe operators that are too out of shape and cowardly to actually fight. Don't worry though you can expect plenty of cashgrab DLC like  Karts or the  Two Helicopters and the rest is free DLC or the upcoming  Seven Guns and a bipod feature that has been missing since release DLC.   You can't blame BIS though it's not their fault the game runs poorly the real problem is the toxic community and their poorly ported mods that cause the game to  itself.   If you buy this half-game you can expect 100s of Altis Life RP servers populated by 13 year old and 20 somethings that failed to launch. You could also try out one of the many KOTH servers for some low FPS deathmatches with people that can't fly shoot drive or communicate worth . Don't forget the DayZ knockoff servers too or it's tired older brother wasteland.  If you are too hardcore an operator for that though you could join one of the many 'Realism Groups'. It's like being in a real army man! Some of them even give you assigned roles and make you adress eachother by rank. If you are lucky you will find one that makes you do a virtual obsticle course or bootcamp before you can join. It's like the authentic bootcamp experience only your drill sargeant is a socially  teenager on such a powertrip that you would think he actually believes what he is doing isn't completely  and unnecessary. Once you are in you can look forward to a mission once a week that they will restart if something goes slightly wrong in their supremely tactical plan.  3/10-10
Buy the awesomeness called 
ought it back in april pretty bad. Gave it another shot in January holy  it is good. The custom maps and content are amazingly fun and the campaign seems pretty good as well. The games controls are horrifyingly complex and non-intuitive and the game intself can be a little buggy seeming but the combat realism and graphics are so sexy. No shooter in recent years has provided me with the proper fear of that unseen sniper 800m+ away that  has. 9/1010
his is truly the best game i've ever played. Buy it. You'll have a blast. I recommend that you take a little time to learn/tweak the key mapping (or if the default keys are to your liking keep them) and do a few tutorials on weapons. There is a lot of control in this game and it can be used to your advantage. After over 300 hrs i can only think of two things that i wish were different;   MODDERS HELP US!  1- We need knives as a weapon choice. sneaking up behind a sniper while he's not watching his back... A knife would be nice....  2- I would prefer more rudder authority on the heli's or at least a sensitivity option for it. The current seems a little bit lacking in that department.(like it was set up for first time pilots to learn to fly)  All in all I highly recommend this game and give it a BIG two thumbs up10
mazing Authentic Arma10
Great game with endless possibilities
The possibilities are endless! :D Seriously this game can do pretty much anything if you know how
he greatest military sandbox I have ever played  is a lovingly crafted game giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy.   Singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. It's a challenge to learn but well worth it. The main campaign can be frustrating at times but overall is a very excellent experience. User-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth and Zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer.    Multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. You can play it as a roleplayer joining Life servers. You can be a survivor of the wastes in Wasteland or you can join in many user-made situations. The greatest of the options however is proper team-based objective gameplay. With the right men squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. It gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling.  If you want a very-well made military simulator offering wonderful graphics processor-melting situations teamwork tension and combined-warfare operation  is for you.10
here are so many things to do in this game so many game modes and workshop items to explore.  is truly a game which can provide hours and hours of fun! 10/1010
Battle royal Get a pistol a backpack an vest shoot a afk guy shoot a camper shoot another afk guy find a SMG in the biggest building killing spree! last 2 people sit in a corner until he moves near you 11/9
hile buggy at times I throughly enjoy this game. It is an easy transition from ArmA II and is a good buy for anyone who enjoyed ArmA II.  4.5/510
t's vital to understand that this game is a platform. The things you can do in  vary substantially as you explore the well made campaign community made missions and popular pvp game modes. Without downloading any of the amazing free mods  has the potential to provide some of the greatest experiences of natural vicious combat possible in gaming. When played with a microphone with or without known friends teamwork effortlessly comes as you end up doing whatever you can to NOT DIE.   Because the game has so many options to play you may find yourself playing boring game modes or thrown together single player community made missions. This is why I'd like to recommend a couple ways for you to enjoy this astonishing. Creating or joining a group delving into medium to large scale COOP encounters is absolutely staggering. While some groups require entire application processes more casual ones exist that are still incredibly fun such as Reddit's /r/ProjectAwesome. If you just wanna jump in for a a couple hours instead of scheduling events a week in advance check out the ever present King of the Hill servers (preferably infantry only). Whatever you do USE A MIC and DON'T BE SHY! You get from this game what you put into it so interacting with others will enhance your enjoyment tremendously.  Once you find the way you like to play here I can promise despite its flaws that every facet of design will coalesce into a truly unique experience that will give you mind numbing moments you will never forget.10
playing modded arma at 30 fps on altis and attempting to get a crew of morons to download a couple of mods has never been better. 10/10
I like the ability of custom gamemodes and mods.
Huge potentiality in this one. How ever huge minus for the Multiplayer expirience. It was very laggy and desync all the time.
Love this game! just need more firends to play it!
I would buy it for sure a 2nd. time. It's simply amazing. Specially if you're playing it with friends. If you're a lone wolf you might not really enjoy this game at all.
Yeah except due to other campaign glitches we cant even make it to part 2
Crashed into a goat and blew up. It's k 8/10
this is really great game the graphics are sexy playing with your friends is mad banter yep what more do you want?
One of the best games that i have played in my little life!!
A big improvement on the previous 2. Shooting in the previous 2 games felt more like shooting a shotgun glued to the end of a broom stick.  has a great shooting model and an actually genuinely good single player campaign.
f you're into simulator games  is for you. If you're into FPS games  is for you. If you're trying to live a life as a virtual military dude  is for you. Who doesn't love a Military Caombat Simulator?? :310
ot for the kinda person who enjoys intense fast paced action. the game requires skill and practice to be compitent and a strategic quick thinking mind is of utmost importance. install the game on an SSD aswell when loading textures it laggs more than most games and a good SSD will remove that lag.10
So realistic it gave me PTSD.
 have logged over 100 hours on  and I can honestly say it has been one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have had to date. The multiplayer servers feel like MILSIM and players are for the most part willing to play the way ARMA is meant to be played. As far as campaigns go  has had my favorite by far in the franchise with an interesting story and developments in the plot not to mention a realistic protagonist who doesn't just blindly follow orders (unless you make him because you have the choice in ). Overall I'd give this game a 9/1010
hat an improvement from Arma 2. movement modular weapon attachments damage models texture and terrain detail continued developer support and a massive modding community. Crank the graphics up and the game has superior graphics of almost any game.10
Its great Buy it now.
I regret buying this game... now i dont have anymore time for anything...
eing a big fan of Operation Flashpoint from way back when this game is a great replacement for it.  If you are tired for the arcade style casual fast paced and no skill requirment of modern games. (IE: COD and BF) and want something that requires skill timing know how and realism. Then this is the game for you.  Must like OP:Flashpoint it isn't for the faint of heart at start. Lots of keys lots of actions you need to know. But with like anything else put the time into it and you can do it.  Huge Steam Workshop community lots of add ons which means more FREE content. Don't like something? Make it yourself.  This game is great fun though it may not be for all it's great for most. Think of it as the Eve Online for shooters.  Nothing beats playing MP and being a good transport pilot to get your troops to and from battle or respawns. You can actually make a difference.10
Awesome price for an awesome game.
there is nothing more satisfying then having a entire squadron behind you as you charge into a town filled with brigades of semi Overpowered AIs that attack you from a valid distance. weapon selection and all movement is as real as she gets
reat game Great Graphics Great gameplay great combat and great to play with friends(that i don't have)10
** PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW ***  Do you like army based games? Like to play realistic army games or roleplaying at it's finest? This game is something for you then. I played for a few hours yet the time feels like 1 hour. You lose complete track of time when you along with 50 other men try in a cooperative mission to take over a city against tanks choppers jets snipers and all the other military infantries guarding it!   8/10 - Great realistic military gameplay.  *** Buy it if you like army games! ***10
if you like beating people to death with dragon  then this is your game
t's Arma not Call of Duty or Battlefield or Halo or whatever... It's simulation so no 360quickscope no gender-related bashing no 'noobs vs pro' to a certain degree   Simply one of the best simulations game in existence. It's basically a military simulations with multiplayers and good gameplay with multitudes of community mods. With massive content created by community you buy this game you could play more than just 1 game. Yeah wanna play The Sims?  have it. Wanna play Tank Battle?  have it. Wanna play Ace Combat?  have it. Wanna play racing games?  have it. Wanna play... oh come on try them for yourself! I'm not paid to write long review so I'm gonna leave it here.   Oh and zombies... Hehe what's better than playing zombie in Arma themed world? Download a zombie mod use a script to spawn tank and have fun! 10
Possiblt the most realistic fps up to date
Walking Simulator! and a god damn good one! alot to do. go on and explore the amazing world of Arma3
fter waiting for so long Arma3 has arrived although it's an Alpha verion the game seems so promising!10
rilliant game. I only got it because of the steam sale (at the time) other than a bit of 'clunkiness' when driving vehicles this game is well optimised for my PC and is a genuinely pleasent experience.10
The most realistic FPS military simulatior around. The ability to mod the game makes for an endless amount of ways to enjoy the game. I have stopped buying other games on Steam sale because I find in the end I don't play them because I spend all my time on Arma!
You can basically do anything that you want.
is a game that focuses on realism without sacrificing all the fun. What you get with the game:  -Multiplayer. Many mods (or to be more accurate missions with scripts) are out there like Wasteland DayZ (the mod not the standalone game) CTI (Capture-the-Island which is like a Conquest mode from Battlefield with a huge map and ArmA gameplay) Domination (which is fairly similar only it's against AI). -'Competitive' Multiplayer. What this means is that you can experience the 'real' ArmA experience. What this means is joining up with clans and operating as a team as a real army would. This in my opinion is the definitive way to play ArmA3. Clans like this are things like  http://www.reacheliteforces.com/  . Look it up if interested. There are many clans out there just browse the Steamcommunity ArmA3 forums. -Like a dozen showcases which show and demonstrate the new features of ArmA3.  -Around a dozen challenges (firing drills) to where you can compete for a better time or train. -3 campaigns each around ~3-4 hours long (note: only one of them is out so far second campaign comes on Jan 21st.)  -Editor where you can do what the hell you want and can create your own missions or scenarios. -Steam Workshop missions! Download missions made by other players with a click and around two seconds and play them rate them. Hundreds of missions are on Steam Workshops plenty to choose from.   BE ADVICED HOWEVER: This game can be a pretty damn big machine hog. You need a pretty decent to PC to play this game appropriately even more so for the multiplayer.10
t first the pizza was good. But then I kept eating it and I found a ING olive on my pizza.10
his game definitly made my top list of greatest games. yes it may have some bugs but the possibilities for the types of scenarios that you run into is just amazing. This game is not like any other ordinary FPS. Its classified as a combat simulation game and it does not let down. So if you're tired of casual shooters and want to try something more in depth then I reccomend this game.10
 really liked this one from the first minute I joined the game. If you like: Playing with your squad tactics battle action teamwork etc... -- THIS IS YOUR GAME! &lt;--  And I am not going to talk about the gifted community we got that are making amazing content for all of us.  What I personally recommend: KOFH (King of the hill)  Exile  Overpoch.  Don't forget to buy this game with your beloved once! And if u dont have any you will make sum! ;)10
was listed as on sale until January 2nd at 35% off. Dec 31st it's at 50% off. I'm still recommending the game as it's a lot of fun and looks great but lowering a sale price two days early is aggravating to those of us who waited for the Holiday Sale to pick it up. I would have used that extra money to support an independent developer or something recently Greenlit.10
This is war! If you like military simulation games this is worth your money.
 review for people new to ArmA:  A combat simulator with an immersive atmosphere and a flourishing community. Need I say more?  If you haven't played ArmA before it is certainly not your typical first person shooter. Instead of focusing on things like killstreaks and weird camos or attachments ArmA focuses on warfare as a whole. Heavy medium and light armor supporting units like weapons platoons and engineer teams clsoe air support of all shades is all addressed in ArmA with particular emphasis on how they are connected.  A level of authenticity is reached in ArmA that few other 'war games' can qiute match. Stamina and weight systems weapon sway and actual ballistics as well as movement intertia (I mean swinging an anti-material sniper rifle is going to have IMMENSE affect on a player's aim) all play into the authenticity ArmA brings to the table. Infantry roles are not simply reduced to four classes or a set of perks but are defined by their place in the squad and their role in combat.  Putting the game into words is not an easy task and taking my word for it is difficult for some. Watch Jester814 or Dyslexi on the YouTubes to get a full feel of what sets ArmA apart from other 'war games'. Let's just say this: Once I played ArmA I never went back to Battlefield Call of Duty or Counterstrike.10
hat can I say other than this game is so amazing that it has stolen almost 3000 hours of my life #nerdlife10
cool
10/10 would shoot in game again.
this is a fun game.... wish i could afford it
Bit Fkn Pricey M8
its all fun and games until a hacker teleports everyone into the middle of the ocean.    RIP all 42 players who didn't have a underwater gun.  2015-2015
his game is great however you should get it with friends or join a clan right away.10
great game there is a alot mods
Got mugged because my car was blocking the road while I was getting mugged.  Would get mugged again/10
 military shooter that while being mediocre on its own has fantastic player-created content that makes this game a blast to play with friends but still fun to play solo10
#NAME?
his game is good u do need a great pc. but this game is good if u like cartanks or helis10
I haven't played it too much but I can safely say make some friends and make your friends get this. cause its hella more fun when you have a group to play with.
luddy brilliant game. however 2 things would make it better for me.  1. a better pc so as to not have frame drops every minute and to enjoy the full glory of a draw distance larger than 1 km 2. Friends to play taki life wasteland (tanoa) border patrol (tanoa) with along with all the other amazing gamemodes10
 Bought this game quite a while back and i am glad i did I Have had so much fun playing it with all the differant life servers and mods for the game. Would recomend it to anyone10
k this is the sickest game out... Fully modable get a bad  group of guys to rock this out and work at a team unit Semper FI 2nd Marine Div -  SSgt. Schille10
its da bomb....is good
Pretty awesome stuff but a huge lack in content. Still waiting for the update from bohemia that will finally add more guns and vehicles.   10/10 would recommend. Just keep in mind its supposed to be a military simulation game so it is a little tricky.
his game is okay said no one ever. This game is boring said no one ever. This game is too much like call of duty said no one ever. The mods in this game are awful said no one ever. This game is awesome said everyone ever.10
 I received this game for free during the alpha stage from a old friend who bought the 4 pack. (i still have the alpha in my files). This game has it's pros and cons  PROS: Great Graphics  Game feels like a military Simulator  If you've got friends you feel like you are a navy seal storming a beach  The guns feel heavy solid  CONS:  The game has Horrible physics and i mean Cars flying across the map when you hit a rock.  Your ragdoll will sometimes fly and turn into mr.fantastic.  The AI is the worst thing in the world.  Final thoughts: This game probably had the worst release besides bf4 but now that i look at it. It's a piece of art that only some people can see. If you enjoy slow but fast paced gritty military shooters you will love this.10
if you like awesome army stuff then multiply by 100 = Arma3
elcome to the best military simulator of all time how??? I here you ask. Because unlike COD and BF4 you dont sponge a bullet to the face!!!!!!!10
RMA... I play the series of ARMA / Operation Flashpoint (Cold War Assault) since ... I think more then 12 years now. Of course I had some breaks played many many other games but I keep coming back to it again and again.    is hmm how can I say - an uncut diamond. At the moment there is a great base for the community as there are many bugs annoying the community. We wanted it early we got it early so now we have to deal with the consequences - bugs beta stadium campaign / scenarios.   It already is a great tactical shooter just like the ancessors I give both of my thumbs up - with one pointing at Bohemia Interactive (I adore you guys) for wanting them finish the game once.10
Best game in the world!
his is the best game I own on the PC and is definetily a keeper.10
The Graphics was actually Good.
Its  buy it
The best military simulation! EVER!
it would have been my most played game if I haden't got global banned for getting my cd stolen. I still recommend it though. Lots of fun!
his is such a great tactical game. You get to play with players that want to play the game as if it was in real life so you get a truly great simulator expeirience. DO I RECOMEND? YES!!10
his game looks pretty good. Played Arma 2 and was not disappointed. Looks like its time to check this game out10
Is very fun
xcellent game 10/10- excellent graphics and gameplay if you get this you must try altis life and king of the hill they are both excellent gamemodes and you get alot of action from them Would recommend this game to anyone10
 ran into a rock and broke my legs. I fought battle without pants on. I drove a car at over 250 Km/h down a hill hit a rock and then flew over 100 Meters into the air.  If you like glitches times where you question your existence and you also like to see what it feels like to sprint into a full-scale war without pants then this is the game for you.  There's also realism too...  9.5/1010
his game is amazing from when I got it to now I love playing on this Lakeside server called ProRP.10
shoot men
antastic the level editor is mostly what I do. But still. Mods are great community is nice everything is spot on. I also hooked up a flight stick and throttle and did tons of dogfights. It feels great. Specs are a little bit demanding too.10
Deployment Delay Simulator 2015 10/10 would wait at base
Teleport to random places everytime while being in a passengerseat.epilepsy guaranteed   10/10
ove the game finally a realistic fps. the developers are always updating to make it more realistic. graphics are awsome! love the selection of multiplayer scenarios.10
his is a 1st/3rd person war simulation engine not quite a game on its own (yet). Arma III comes with very little content on its own and it is ripe with missing features and bugs but the guys over at Bohemia Interactive have been dilligent with patches features and support (There's an entire website dedicated to live bug tracking and suggestions with feedback from the developers which is incredibly rare). That being said many users still continually suffer from lag and crashes and the game has very high requirements to run and look nicely.   Despite the missing bugs and features the game has all the core components of a strong simulation game. The developers have done well on bullet physics and the graphics look really nice on max. On the other hand the game is very complex and the controls will be difficult to pick up for new players. Your bullets are not lazers that hit your target immediately you will need to range your target adjust the sight on your gun to the appropriate distance and lead them appropriately to have a chance of hitting them. Unless you're under 300m away then let your inner call of duty player out.   The game's built in content consists of scenarios and the recently added campaign. The scenarios and tutorials are introductions into the various attributes of the game from flying helicopters to assault diving to artillerty strikes. The campaign feels like a bunch of scenarios strung together and adds very little to the game. All things considered the campaign is bad and you won't want to play or remember it for long.   But you don't buy this game for the single player.  The multiplayer game modes are what put this game head and shoulders above other similar multiplayer games. Players can join a wide variety of different game modes that are downloaded and installed automatically for the player before joining the server. There are only two maps: A large map that bogs down servers with its sheer size and a smaller map that doesn't bog down the servers as much. Just like in Arma 2 there are many guides tools and tutorials provided and created by the community in order to produce new and diverse game modes and content. The popular DayZ mod will likely not exist in  because of the upcoming standalone installment but the Wasteland mode offers the same scavenging/survival mechanics sans zombies. There are also deathmatches missions and rpg modes to cater to every type of player.   The Call of Duty crowd would probably get bored by the slow pace of the game. The Battlefield 4 crowd will have much more common ground but might dislike the lack of polish in the game. The Arma 2 crowd will enjoy the game.  My tips for starting to play: In any game mode in any lobby in any situation where you're unsure in any situation where you have no clue what's going on ask questions. The community is incredibly responsive and helpful. They will know the game better than you and their help will mean the difference between all your shots going right over the enemy's head or right into the enemy's head (Adjust your scope's range with PgUp and PgDown).  You should probably stay out of global voice chat (Use . and  to change your chat channel stick to the blue team channel if you're not sure where you should be talking).10
he epitome of pc military sims. Looks gorgeous(ish) even on lower settings. Difficult to master for newcomer's to the genre but all in all if you put in some time and learn how the game works it can be quite rewarding. Definately a buy mmmkay?10
ig difference over arma 2. Very fun and can be challenging. Online play is amazing!10
i have no idea what i am doing but its really cool ! if anybody can help me out in game that would be great but i do recomend this you can see the effort put into this game !!
flopped over from bullet 10/10 would flop

I bought this game the beginning of the year. And i can not put it down. this game amazes me in so many ways i can not explain. From many diffrent modes of the game to the mods. i paid the full price 59.99 and it was worth every penny!
It`s a little lite on the realism side.
Probly best military simulation shooters you could buy with out going into a real combat zone. would recomend this game to anyone!
ust one of the best games ever. there are much mods and it just so realistic.  just buy this game then you will understand everyone that bought this game!10
ealism above all else.    asks a lot of its players but rewards them well.10
51 Wasteland server Hellish fun!  The game is great apart from cranky animations!  Arms 3 Editor is a blast looking forward to the release of the new 3D Eden Editor can't wait to make some mini episodes of retaking Stratis!  Tanoa looks like it's coming along nicely ready to get boots on the ground!  9/1010
ES!! Absolutely and easily one of the best games ive played on PC a must buy!!10
Great Military Game I Recommend it to everyone
Whould cheeki for breeki again 10/10
et the hang of this game and you'll have the time of your life. (if your into the military sim genre)10
where do I start?   This game is the definition of realistic.   This game is the definition of freedom.   And why is it?  As you might've noticed this is not a linear campaign shooter like Call of Duty or Battlefield. This is the game where you have two gigantic maps (soon a third but as a DLC). In the base game you ofcourse have your campaigns and all but when the game really shines is with its multiplayer and modding community.  In my entirety of my life have I never seen this many mods and custom campaigns etc. in a single game as I have in . It's excellent and gives you a large variety of options on how to play. From procedurally generated open maps with the freedom of choice where to go to the more linear - yet awesome campaigns. There's new weapons new vehicles even entirely new maps for you to download for free using the Steam Workshop.  Now about the multiplayer. When you open up your browser you'll see a lot of the same game modes. It's a shame that there's only a few select game modes which really made it through with  as I remember Arma 2 had some different and awesome game modes which  lacks. Now if you just want to play with your friends go ahead and create a server. You can even play with mods and all of that custom content you've downloaded (this includes game modes maps etc.) to keep it fresh for you.  Now that I've talked about the good let's talk about the bad.  The game suffers heavily from bad optimization. Now I'm not running a monster rig but with a GTX 770 I'm able to run every game with relative graphics. My graphics settings in  actually don't matter that much as my FPS remains around the same even if I select everything on the lowest or on ultra. If you don't have a powerful computer or just a mid-range like me you're in for a really bad time and should upgrade your PC before attempting to play this game.  To be honest I'd love to see newer vehicles and weapons from  as most of them are wayy outdated by now. Ofcourse there's the mods but there's not mods for every single thing.   All in all this is a must-have if you're into military shooters (and have a good rig).10
Love the game.
All wars should be fought on ARMA.
est Modern War Simulation in my opinion tons of gamemodes to choose from. You don't need a 2000$ pc to run it play with your friends alone or with strangers you'll always have a blast playing this game!10
lthough I like Chernarus much more than Altis and Stratis the game itself is highly improved over ARMA 2 physics being the first thing but not limited to it..  Movement is much more natural and so are voices..  Would I recommend it? yes..  But it lacks the love I used to feel for Chernarus itself the landscapes and environment in general10
Won battle royale without killing anyone 10/10
After nearly 3700 hours into this game its the mods that I love the most.
ve only played the battle royale mod on this and it's a fantastic game good graphics and realistic mechanics included with the shooting.  10/10.10
his game is just epic. just a epic war with so many mods weapons and vehicles. the graphics are awesome and you can play with friends and make fun10
ow it really looks superb. Difficult but very reallistic.10
 brilliant game well worth all the hundreds of hours I have poured into it it is by no means a finished product however there are many more improvements and features to come but for what you get it's well worth it!10
mazing game more than 1100 hours and still lots of mods and stuff :)10
un and realistic combat simulator. Strong lurning curve but when you start to learn it you can have alot of fun. I strongly recommend to people who like realistic games.10
12/10 Like skyrim with guns #IGN
I'm going to play this on my intel HD 4400! Said no one... ever...
Wow what can I say. This game brought me hours of fun. I have a crappy laptop and was still able to run a modded version of the game. (Not with top notch graphics though). I would definitly recommend you buy this game if you love the military. I played with a Milsim group and that is what made this game so much fun.
Walked for twenty minutes to car. Got hit by a rpg 100m away.  I still love this game.
coolshit
I once threw an assault boat into a town from a chinock and it landed on a tank and blew it up.  Buy the game...
i like the game 10/10 mods are the best
Bought the game 4 hours before the discount doubled. Still a great game. I rate in 3 Half Lifes out of 3
ood game everyone should buy.10
hen Operation Flashpoint came out in 2002 I was pleasantly surprized that the Bohemia Interactive Studio creators of the game managed to finally make a military simulation that surpassed all other competitors. I still play it but its successors ARMA ARMA2 and now  take this sim to new heights. As a US Army combat Veteran I can state from my military experience that  tops the list of all FPS sims to date.  involves teamwork self-discipline and developing strategy to defeat the enemy. This sim is not for 'run and gun' players. 10
ardware is neededbut it is worth it. awesome game with awesome game modes+servers 10
Absolutely fantastic military simulator!
est running simulator 2025.  the Game is great and the mod support is unparaleled unfortunetly for users with more outdated tech the game is poorly optimised however if you can run it get some friends or join one of the many groups that play this game youll meet some amazing people10
epic  realistic  and the altis and stratis is on greece  9/10
lright I gave this game a thorough try but did not like it. I went through some training and played some of the campaign. Because of the ballistics it was hard to tell how much to elevate my sights to hit something. I kept getting shot from people I could not see and when I did see them I couldn't hit them before I died. I think the controls are way overly complex. I never could figure out how to use the medical kit on myself. I think the interface was not intuitive for using inventory. I think this is a full on simulator with clunky interface and too many controls and not enough clear training or instructions. If you want to spend hours and hours mastering a complex game this is it. If you are an FPS guy like myself and want some moderate controls and be able to play quickly without mastering an interface or controls I recommend avoiding this game. It's just too complex. I had high hopes. I would like a simulator but this is just too complex. I play games for fun and I don't feel the need to spend hours learning and training to be able to use a game. Also be careful of graphics settings to get a good framerate. It can be taxing on your graphics card.-10
 has and will continue to provide me with a amazing gameplay experience. From the amount of mods that are widely available to the community I would definitely recommend  for its enjoyable experience that it has provided me for over 3000 hours (still counting)
This is the most epic fps and third person shooter game i have played defently worth getting
ith the full release of  the modding community kicked into full swing releasing stellar mods like ALiVE and JSRS2. The game can be challenging and even frustrating at times if you're not patient but rewards planning and careful engagement with an immersive and fantastic experience.  The editor gives player the ability to create their own scenarios from simple search and clear ops to convoy ambushes and combined arms operations and makes this game infinitely replayable.  I would definitely recommend this game.10
is a shooter that breaks the Arcade FPS paradigm the versatility of this game engine and features presented therin are absolutely unmatched. Worthy of the title 'military simulator' completely. Fly aircraft drive vehicles logistics with team strategy tact and disciplin this is the closest to a real combat environment you can get without selling your self to the man.  Other big title shooters out there have gone the way of the 'run and gun shoot em up' arcade styles and require very little forethought. If you desire an experience that will rock your fiber and boost your blood pressure all the while training your brain?  is the game for you!!  Much recommended for sensible mature players.10
ince I started playing this I haven't played anything else. Best game I've ever played. Great Mods like Altis Life keep me playing for hours.10
the best game i have everplay for this played 2000 hours
Awesome game. I thought I wouldn't run it on a Geforce GT 530 but I did with 35-40 FPS on medium settings.  Overall; game experience is amazing if you're using mods and of course it's a tatical military shooter therefor... amazing.
reat game was hesistant at first but have come to love it.  Come play TOP arma!10
he game is awesome though the 1.54 update completely ruined the game can't even launch the launcher from steam10
great game but needs more optimization and the modding community makes it better.
This has to be hands down the best affordable militaristic simulator you can get your hands on. Plenty to do and loads of angry mother heffers to meet and kill. 8/10
Great and possibly the most realistic war-game. With its modding capabilities it offers so much more than just a simple FPS. Highly recommended.
an into a building building exploded. 10/1010
SOF Tactical Realism
Great game. Though some of the DLC should have been included in the game.
he best military sim on the market bar none.10
Great Military Simulator
 bought it expecting my PC to handle it. It couldnt take 41 hours of island life so I went back to arma 2 for now.  Real review: Make sure your computer is good and no the one recommended to you by the best buy geek squad for 4000 dollars wont cut it. Just build your own like me but make sure your price range is over 700 dollars gl.10
One Of The Best Games I Have Ever Played 11/10 Buy Now!!!
Great game ! its a must buy for everyone who has some time on their hands !
2000+ hours played. Everytime a new game comes out I get bored of it and turn back to . It's my go-to game because it is a platform for so many game-modes. Highly recommend it!
hard to set up and get used to at first but once you get to know it you will love it!! :)
i love this game so much
very good five out of 7 stars
rma is pretty well the 'everything' simulator. Want to shoot some terrorists? Want to shoot some zombies? Want to shoot some dinosaurs? Want to run around town and get harassed by cops? Want to make some drugs and sell them? Want to build a house out in the woods and do inappropriate dancing all night long?  Sure gameplay can be frustrating at times but a fair trade-off for near infinite replayability.10
0/10 Would pay 60 for the game then turn around and be asked to pay another 60 for the dlc thought I was playing battle field for a little bit. Tighten up bohemia i can offord 120+ dollars for this game. The dlc weapons are amazing and without buying the dlc I can use them and they are a lot better than the vanilla guns for sure. The dlc Ghillie is actually a ghillie cool enough unlike the vanilla ghillie.10
 have been playing the series when it was first introduce under another name many years back as Operation Flashpoint all the way up to .  The game is a sandbox of which you can create any battlefield with any numbers of players or AI. IT has many vechicles to use from tanks to chopper to fixed wing military aircraft. The weapons in the game alsohave attachments that change the look and functions of the weapon. It is a very cooperative experence from many team oriented aspects. You can have one team member flying a jet to provide air cover to another team member operating artillery to another team member giving fire support with his 50 cal rifle to a tank giving fire support far off in the distance.  The game includes a editor to create your own mission and soon will have a Game master mode (FREE DLC Zeus) to dynamically change any mission while it is being played by many people. It also has a amazing and talented modding community to has been with this game series since its very early incarnations. The developer has also released all the DAta files from Arma 2 and its standalone expansion (Arrowhead and DLCs) to be used to important any of that content into A3. Bohemia Interactive has also provided the tools to use for this such as its 3d modeling software Oxygen.   Features -Sandbox mission editor -Developer / Mod tools released by developer to create any content the player wants -VAS system loadout -Multiplayer / Coop up to 50 players on one server. -Vehicles nearly every kind you can think of -Weight system the more you carry the slower you are -Complex weapon system and r eally good particle effects -Ballistic system and penetration -Everything nearly can be destroyed -Submersibles -Character outfits -Can command large scale armies -Optics can have multiple modes -IR laser to mark targets for Fire support -Artillery units   Negatives.. I really cannot think of any   NOTE: Some people say the movement system is slow but this game focuses on immersion into actual warfare. Carrying a lot of gear of course the player is going to more slow and have to react slower. For example the heavy gunner loadout you need to go prone and deploy bi-pods to get any accuracy. Its the same situations for heavy sniper rifles.   The possiblities are nearly endlesss in this any battle you can imagine can be created with the game in its locations and has far more gameplay depth than most shooter out there. It may be difficult to get used to the gameplay because it relies very heavily on planning observing and teamwork as characters and PC's in the game die pretty easily.  Graphics 10/10 Sound 10/10 Singleplayer Story *Feel game is not worth $60 without one Multiplayer 10/10 Reviewers Tilt 5/5  10/10  NOTE*** Singleplayer story is coming episodically with each major update to A3. I feel the game at $40 USD it well worth the money though at $50-$60 USD only worth it if you played a lot of Arma 2 / Operation Arrowhead and want a major upgrade.10
ctually played a little of it it was cool however you need god's gaming computer to run this.10
War. War never changes.
 fire yo
Addictive and fun :3
ARMA SHOULD NOT HAVE DLC.
Better than Day Z Standalone.
One of the best games out if you ask me. If you love military shooter games and love to actually play as team and not just play some type BF or Call of duty where you just run around shoot  you will enjoy this game. Campiagn is a decent lenght(if you play on the hardest settings it will take you weeks lol) but the MP is where the game shines. I personallly play on co-op servers that run Invade and Annex or Patrol Ops and its almost like playing a real war(I highly recommend the 7thcavalry co-op servers). You do get the MP servers that run stupid  like Wasteland(dayz rip off but worse) or Atlis life( Sims ripoff) but thats not what this game is about. Do you love the thrill of hearing the bullets fly past your head or want to pilot a transport helio or attack helio giving the ground forces some cover and take out the armor or maybe you want to jump in a tank to lighten up the enemies forces or a artillery vehicle and use the VIOP to have the forces closer to the fight mark or even use there laser guided scope to spot targets and light them up.  This game has finally fillled the hole in my heart for a REAL war shooter that I have been begging and praying for the last 20 years. This is the closeest game you will get to the real thing! I HIGHLY recommend getting this game.
Great for Milsim!
-Spawn -Get in chopper -Get shot down by aimbot enemies -Repeat  10/10
Great open world tactical combat game. Buy it and team up with some friends and kick !
I love this game! I've been playing multiplayer a lot there past couple of days. If you are looking for a real military simulator this is the game for you. When you find players that will join a group with you and take the game seriously it is tons of fun. This is NOTHING like Call of Duty or even Battlefield. I would recommend this game.
Pretty neat stuff.
this is a good game and had alot of fu with it +100000000000000000 should get it
I've never crashed with a helicopter so much in my life.
reat Game With Amazing Gamemodes!  Fun with friends and single. I bought this game and never had regrets.  Fun Thrilling &amp; Worth It!10
Very good game but if you don't have a good computer then don't get it because  is not optimized well.
its a great game but flying is hard and i don't know how to take off in helicopters and planes.
I wish I had the money to buy this game :( IT'S SO FUN!
it is so nuch fun and flying in a heli is awesome the plans are even better the guns are awesome all i have to do is hold down the trigger
I dont really have alot of hours on this game(only 651) but here is a summary of the game:  walking peashooter simulator 2015   10/10  would shoot peas at Iranians in Greece again
very good ya
You get to go all Army up on es
It isn't a war unless there is a road march.
otally worth buy if you're into strategic and intense FPS gaming. Take good ol' Delta Force 2 and Rainbow Six let them have fun in the closet until they appear back in modern days and you got ArmA3. It won't give you any mercy you die a lot but I'm 100% sure this game will teach you how to be better soldier also in real life. Never gonna miss those headshots again. Over and out.10
hat can I say Its one of the best games I've ever played!10
Only game I even play anymore.....
Its a nice game specialy when they did  dayz mod prob lots of players should join
Good game but optimizer is really bad.
ure you need a budget the size of the US military's anual spending for your pc to be able to play this game but boy is it worth it.10
0/10 Would get sniped out of a fast moving attack helicopter from 700 metres by a jedi AI wielding an open sight rifle again.  In seriousness though this is one hell of a game. The AI can be both incredibly stupid but also seemingly omniscient making single player a bit frustrating at times but online play is really one of a kind. There really aren't many other games that can deliver this kind of online play... This is a game that seriously wants to be played tactically shooting skill alone isn't enough (Yet you're going to need to be pretty good to even hit your target). Observe your enemies think like your enemies think one step ahead of your enemies (and lay a mine there). Just surviving is hard let alone thriving but there's a real feeling of victory after your tactical prowess unsures the fall of an enemy camp or the interception and denial of an incoming attack.   Struggling to land a shot on your target has never been so fun!10
Best game of 2014 Award goes to this withought question!
his is one game franchise ive stuck with since the start. Back in the OFP days. The game has always deliverd with the best game play/simulation of any other like it. Arma is worth its full price. Sure it has some bugs but the amount of fun this game can bring is well worth a few problems.10
his game is amazing especially the mod altis life10
ove the graphics physics and realistic gameplay.10
eriously just buy it. Best game.10
 would buy this but i dont have money10
 was never a big fan of simulators let alone military simulators but the first time I played arma 2 I fell in love. Although I never bought arma 2 I did buy  and holy crap was it amazing. Amazing graphics an amazing aresnal and an amazing game. There is many glitches and long waits to do a mission but you can see through that and notice the beauty  gives. There is many fun game modes and even mods to spruce up the adventure. So pick up a gun a helmet AND GET OUT THERE SOLIDER.10
rmed Assault 3 has a sniper rifle trained on your wallet...  The Gist:  Buy this game if - You liked pretending to be in the army while playing with toy soldiers and spending your parents' money  Dont buy this if - You like Killzone call of duty money.   Pros: - Extensive - Leaves most up to your imagination  Cons: - Expensive - Not made for average PC's - Those s who kicked you out of the sandbox are here and they are thriving.  Don't think of the Arma series as an FPS. Think of it as a simulator. Most of the fun comes from you believing. So in short dont play this if you are squidward. On the other hand you will have a lot of fun if you have a friend that resembles a pink starfish. Yes I am referencing the imagination episode of spongebob squarepants because it explains this game so well. Go watch that episode and you will understand I swear.  If you do end up buying this game I highly recommend that you google '77th JSOC arma3'. Find out what you need and play on their servers.  Or try Altis life which feels like being thrown into the desert with people who want to make your life as sad and frustrating as possible if you ever wanted to feel like squidward.   Honestly this game is Spongebob squarpants incarnate.10
n excellent military simulator has a large learning curve and requires patience inorder to to become skilled at. Like most multiplayer games  works ALOT better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination which is a very important factor in . Its fairly system intensive  but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. I would highly reccomend it especially if you have friends to play it with.10
A very fun and compelling Mil-Sim sandbox. 10/10. Would buy again.
I think this game is the best game. If u guyz getting bored in single player u should try altislife mode in multiplayer. If u guyz find the price expensive u should wait for discounts but I think this game is worth that price u should check it out   10/10   Have Fun Bros :)
ental closest thing to a real gunfight in any game.11
Best Strategy-Shooter !  buy it if you like it ;)
Good game but you need a top pc for it
Shot a Go Kart with a sniper Rifle and it took out a city block.   11/10
:)
This game is gorgeous. I love it. Get it as soon as you can!
1;1
The Most Realistic Army Simulator! The Graphics Are Incredible And The Added Features Make It A Good Game.
t's everything you love about sandbox games mixed with everything you love about Battlefield 3 but with everything you hate about Call of Duty stripped.  Buy it.10
Just Great
absolutely my favorite game ever created 10/10 doritos
Not just the most realistic modern military combat simulator.  Play however you want to play.  I may not like your strange zombie survival fetish.  Or your weird ArmA streetracing when you can just go and buy an actual streetracing game.  But you can do it.
his game is like being underwater.  But the water has been replaced by feelings of isolation claustrophobia and bullets.  Bullets hatefully fired at your face by nameless and unseen minions.  And these bullets don't stop.  Until you stop...moving.10
10/10 became is fish
hose low FPS will make your eyes burn... It is a really good game but poorly optimised/made.-10
Almost all of my hours are from editor lol
eal life military simulator.  The campaign is a little hard but it gets you used to the  mechanics which is basically you will die 70% of the time by 1 bullet.   The multiplayer is where the majority of the fun is at. Very time consuming and if you find a group you will be playing all the time. A3Launcher will be your gift from God for finding servers and automatically installing updates for online servers. Multiplayer experience can vary as the gameplay/mods are different server to server but it essentially consists of building a base making money and killing people in fun and creative ways. Some servers have zombies and roaming AI. FYI if you came here because of the DayZ Frankie youtube videos I would recommand watching un-blemished  gameplay if you want to see the reality of multiplayer.10
If you don't buy this game you are MORON. NOTE:I really love this game but I had too many problems on it. If you wanna buy this game first research it.
Better than counter-stroke.
Incredible Co-op. Good community. Best fps game I ever owned.
Military helmet cam combat footage simulator   kill / be killed
This game is amazing you must get it
side from being horrendously CPU bottle-necked you wont find another title like it any where else. If combined arms is what you want look no further.10
Amazing game! The Life mod also changed and bringed a lot of RPG + RP lovers to buy this game.
reat Game! If you played Arma 2 then you have to play . Even if you haven't play it for the explosions. I would seriously recommend you add this to your library.10
Yes it is
eavy on CPU performance but without any other option the best MilSIm you can play currently if you are into realism ( recommend mods = ACE ; RHS stuff  AIA  Blastcore )10
This game is so good it makes my  sizzle
Much realism. Pew pew.
tay low go fast. Kill first die last. One shot one kill. No luck all skill.10
est graphicsgameplay isnt as good as 2 though.10
Played it with a friend and is worth all the money they ask for! so many gamemodes so big map so fun experience
is perplexing actually. On the surface I find I tend to sit around and do a whole lot of nothing when playing. Standing around and driving from point A to point B is the norm. However there is a certain quality that makes it terrifically addictive. I don't know what it is but I enjoy the game thoroughly. There are plenty of exciting moments and when you're done with a match (that often takes hours to play) you're filled with a sense of accomplishment. I don't even need to mention the community around doing mods and such. It adds to the game immensely.  10/10 would play again.10
This game is good and a lot of fun with friends money is a bit hard to get some times.But if you play this enjoy it.
this game is one of the best games i have played with my friends i played 500 hours in total from the game by it self with no mods and another 30 from breaking point when more mods come out i am probly going to play another 500 hours
y friend and I have both loved this game! I'd also recommend checking up on the launch arguments for optimization. If you read up on the game you'll find out that it's heavily run on a single CPU core (so you need a fast processor). But using the multithreaded launch options and other arguments to the startup can help you run it better  My favorite moment in this game has been walking around at night and hearing 'allahu akbar' through my speakers then a thunderous 'BOOM' through my subwoofer from off in the distance. My friend said 'Rebel lets get involved!' Craziness obviously ensued!10
est game i have ever played i have more than 2000 hours on it and i enjoyed all of it..10
Best of it's kind! Still a bit buggy but great fun and everything is possible! :D
if your reading this scrol up and buy this game!
his game is amazing. By far and as u would hope the most realistic and beautifully designed Military sim game i have ever played. There are hundreds of amazing mods still early in developement though of course. As well as the different game modes u can play in multiplayer such as wasteland is tons of fun. When u buy this game u are really buying like 1000 different games in 1.10
f you are into military scenarios this game is great for you. With the new engine and actual physics aspects it takes a big leap forward for the Arma series. For me it has been an amazing trip from Alpha into the upcoming release an was not in any way a dissapointment. I can't wait for jets :D10
ow FPS but you can fix it by adjusting some settings and a launch option I love the game 8/1010
reat game if your a fan of Bohemia it's a must have!10
I LIKE THE DIVERSITY OF    WHAT I DIS LIKE IS THE PRICE
Game is very fun. Very realistic shooter game with many different community made game modes. I recommend getting some mods such as tactical battlefield or  life
his game epic. If you like war games (and who doesn't like war games?) then this game is perfect for you! Currently it's in Alpha so the map is 'only' 20km^2 large but the full map will be ~270km^2 large.  I personally love this game it's a MUST PLAY!10
o fun and at time realistic. Mods for world war two vietnam RPG mods the content is unlimited! Best purchase I've made thus far!   10/10  10
A bit expensive but you can find better cost somewhere. I think if you like simulators of war it's good for you. Better than Arma 2 :)
10/10 would play on my toaster again.
Great game to play solo or with friends :)
Great Game! Tons of gamemodes and tons of things to do. The campaign is awesome along with the multiplayer. I would reccomend this game! 10/10
Its a good game. Though recommeded for people who like to take millitary shooters very seriously. Otherwise the fun side its pretty 
Awesome game here it has so much more potential than games such as cod or battlefield which are mainluy liniar games on arma theres no straight line thinking its like a giant sandbox with huge maps and vast mods and gamemodes to suit everyone. I would suggest this to anyone thats on the fence about the game or prefers a break away from Cod and battlefield a solid 10/10 from me
if you like war simulaters this is your game
ery good game perfect resolutions and nice settings the game is fun to play awesome chillin' with friends but lots of glitches that needed to be fixed.10
Great game. love playing every minute of it. even better with mods. recommed playing exlie.
Really nice game.. Beautiful aswell. Just the campaign made me rage xD
reat game. Awesome alternative to Battlefield 3 if you're looking for a slower paced more tactical game experience. Amazing visuals tempt me to lose track and just fly around the map to just explore. The main map of altis has over 200km of shoreline with over 270 Square KM of map space. (arma 2 Chernarus was 225Km2)  With the new Lighting and physics added to the Engine Night conflicts are no longer a pain but Great to play. Ragdoll Physics in the game are tastefully done in my opinion.  I recomend this game the addition of the ease of modding makes this game perfect to tailor to your perfect prefrences.10
ought  a few days agoand now this 50% off while I bought full price RIP.10
10/10 game best game ever get it thats all i can say GET IT!!! :p2wheately:
Kinda like warcraft 3 no one buys it for the actual game its all about the mods.
his game is great. It needs a bit more powerful rig to play it well but there are so many mods and different game modes that you will never get bored.10
It's not bad.
Better the whole Battlefield line up....
 used to play CoD and Battlefield series and now I make fun of them. I used to think that no game will ever reproduce the chaos and unpredictability of war and I was wrong. I used to have a social life that has now been replaced by intense firefights and military operations of all kinds. ArmA is not a game like the others it will bring war straight into your living room and it will show you all sides of it: brutal cruelty the high price to pay for mistakes and the importance of teamwork and communication to achieve the objective. The Community content is huge and if you learn how to do it there is no real limitation on what you can do as far as mission building and content go. The only regret I had when I first discovered this game was that I wish I had known it before.10
his is realy epic game. You can play in Altis Life Patrol Ops and the best of all is Breaking Point (something like DayZ but on ). :D10
Be me  Sees TM get shot runs to him drags him out off fire carries him 5 km After that  Flys in osprey osprey got shot down im on ground some chinese girl helps me and my teammates i see teammate on the ground drag him to humwe this game is ING GREAT BUY IT
 fantastic Military Simulation Game. I have not had so much continous fun from a game in years since Crash Bandicoot on PS1. I cannot express how awesome the Arma community is and how much I love the game.10
This game is:  C ool A amazing N ew C reative E ducational and R ad!!
I can believe they are trying to charge $16 for vehicles that should have been included in the itemless release... absolutley terrible game. It's missing 95% of the content that was in Arma 2 on release. Garbage... cant believe they are trying to get $100 out of this unfinished game...  It's getting better but only because the modders are making content...  Make sure to grab @epoch mod.
ar is fought by soldiers not the gun it is fought by a ing tank coming down a road while you have you're pistol of doom. Ps no pants have been harmed in the making of this game10
on't waste your time reading reviews buy it already!  is a must have if you own a PC!10
this game is very good u should get it
o put it simply... the game I expected Battlefield 3 to be. Battlefield 4 has a couple steps in the right direction but the series is no longer a tactical sim like BF2. I will forever miss Jalabad but...   has great MP thanks to the community. More to come teased from Bohemia.   Right now I enjoy:  King of the Hill Wasteland Breaking Point (Much more finished than DayZ standalone ATM)10
inally a game worth spending my hard earned $60 on. A fun game! Hate it when I take a bullet in the head But hey thats realism!10
Arma is a game that absolutely demands that one play multiplayer. Bear that in mind before you buy it because singleplayer is absolutely not this game's focus.
here's something about Bohemia's world-building that inspires people. Importantly though 's vanilla content now stands on equal footing with those third-party inspirations. It's still a little rough around the edges but it's a darned impressive package nonetheless.10
Awesome graphics and the gameplay is highly realistic
10/10 i really like this
reat game one of the best on steam.10
ypical Arma: Getting better all the time. Some of the mods and addons are so clever you could be forgiven for thinking it's Arma4 not 3 ... Already with steam workshop mods and addons ranging from simple missions to mind-blowing fully scripted conversions - there are always going to very large amount of mods and missions thanks to the familiar and easy to learn mission editor (easy to learn hard to master) plus ArmaTools for free. Top quality addons from the community being added all the time- and you can use your other Arma/Arma2/OA/Iron Front/TOH content via a mod called AllInArma.  As in all the previous Arma mil-sims eventually hardware and mid range systems are catching up to it about the same time community content gets slick and plentiful (as it is now for Arma2).   Underwhelming as a pie down the trousers on first release but turning into an great game.11
I'm awful at this game but it still is a lot of fun
s soon as I launched this game for the first time I fell in love with it.  takes all of the things that Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead had and improved on it twice over. First off Altis is gigantic. Stratis is smaller in size but it's still impressively large. I've played this game for over 70 hours and I've yet to see the entirety of the map. The whole arsenal meaning the clothes backpacks weaponry and vehicles are simply amazing. While the controls are a bit simulator-ey it doesn't take very long for you to figure out the controls and before you know it you'll know all the necessary controls to play efficiently.   One thing that I do not really care for is the stamina system mostly because I feel like my character can have a rifle a pistol and 2 mags for each and after running 200 metres he would be gasping for air on the side of the road.   The developers let you play the dlc as much as you like for free but you get a big advertisment on your screen once in a while which has from what I've seen messed up a lot of peoples shots. I don't know if they're done with dlc yet or not but when they are done with it I hope to see a gold edition or something so I can buy all of the dlc for less.   If you have a pc that can run this game buy it.10
. What can you say game of the yeah. The gameplay is just so cool and stuff i can only say yes to this game.
yeah its good in everything it does. kinda a bummer that dlc is so expensive when its a mil sim and u would expect what is in the dlcs to be in the game standard unlike arma 2 had dlcs that were new games by them selves
Can count to 3
Best sandbox game I have ever played. So many game modes and objectives to complete. If you like rpg you can play that game mode or you can play a exile game mode your options are almost limitless.
ith mod tools lean serious communities supported by dedicated servers  will satisfy veteran PC gamers used to all the amenities that so many franchises dropped because the game stays true to its roots yet innovates in such a way that expands the possibilities but does not limits them.10
Where to start?   -Amazing Modding community -Huge Multiplayer (Milsim Communities eg ShackTac) -In-game Mission Maker -ZEUS! -Advaned Flight model (New to the game) -Firing from vehicles (New to the game) -Nice Campaign -2 Maps (But the modding community have more) -Tactial game Long-range firefights -Really Realistic Not like COD or Battlefield! It has really Unique gameplay.  Good Game 10/1010
LOVE HOW IT CRASHES EVERY 5 MINUTES. WANT $60 BACK
here was so many guns I is scared for my life10
F you never played operation flashpoint arma 1  arma 2  day z mod  day z standalone or any other military shooter this game is not for you and if you have this is the best military simulator ever made.10
Amazing game that always has me coming back for more! The amount of things you can do in this game are endless. There are tons of different mods and custom servers to suit/suite/soot your needs!
UP addons fixed nearly every complaint I had with this game. Still poorly optimized but that's ARMA for you.10
It's Fun
mazing. Graphics are very realistic. The Game play itself will be hard to grasp at first however after you have gotten the hang of it it can indeed be very rewarding as well as realistic. Overall in general i would recommend arma to anyone who wants a true sandbox playground to engage in different military situations and other community made missions.10
assive massive and one more massive improvement from Arma 2. I've only really played Muliplayer so I can't really review the campaign but if you're mainly after playing mods such as Battle Royale then you will be impressed by the improvement from Arma 2!10
After being eaten by some random house walls in battle royale couple of times you realise that this game is better then Call Of Duty.  9/11
ith 410 hours on record i could say this is one of the best games i've ever played. amazing mods great community and awesome gameplay 10/10  -- UPDATE--  now have 700+ hours on the game still love every minute of it. the mods are amazing and they just keep on coming. i really reccomend it.  --UPDATE--  Havent played to much after the 700 hours as you can see still the best game i own though kappa10
Wait for ACE and ACRE. The minute they both drop I'll be on  for days.
his game is possibly one of the most realistic military shooters on the store at the moment. This game has all types of mods that can be installed but just the gametypes you can play from the stock game are truly amazing. There are role play servers team deathmatches deathmatches zombies survival games ect.  The only issue with this game is the occasional animation glitch.   Overall beautiful realistic looking game and a true must have for your Steam library.10
is essentially just a major improvement over the last while also having different enough experiences to be worth buying as an Arma veteran. With the amount of content that is currently available in this game I can't not recommend it and the existing content really is a lot of fun. This being said I have almost exclusively played single player and koth so I'll critique those.  Probably the best thing about this game to me is the single-player and it's because it capitalized on the parts of Arma 2's campaign that were fun but really short and mostly just filler garbage. All of this game's missions are short-burst short-term little missions that revolve around an objective and have you return to the main hub once finishing akin to scenarios in Arma 2 other than the fact that the missions are connected. This really was the best way the campaign could've been approached since this game is praised for its gameplay and doing something as nonscripted as the Arma 2 campaign just isn't interesting enough to play and people who liked Arma 2's singleplayer rarely compliment it. Because of that I think the singleplayer alone would be enough to buy this game if one doesn't really like Arma 2's campaign but they enjoyed the gunplay and gameplay.  Multiplayer's kinda what you'd expect from this series with the Arma Life roleplaying still going strong and a few other really fun gameplay modes like Wasteland (sandbox Arma pvp) and I'd strongly recommend getting this game if you're a fan of sandbox or rp stuff in Garry's Mod or Minecraft or DayZ/Unturned (any sandbox game is comparable to this game other than the combat which makes this an interesting multiplayer game if you're into that stuff) since they're similar. Something recently incorporated by the devs of this game is koth (King of the Hill) where you go into cities from a base and siege it with manpower. It was a really nice change in pacing for this game since it's largely controlled by you (the pacing) and it appeals to more of the singleplayer fans that like the siege reconnaissance Arma 2 represented as well as taking different roles at or away from the battlefield like the snipers and field medics as well as the breachers and pilots and all that (which are supported by a perk and character system that I thought were cool for roleplaying). It's hard to say if I'd buy this game for one gamemode but the amount of options really gives you the liberty to choose what you enjoy the most and explore the content there.  Overall this game has a really solid singleplayer and multiplayer compared to most as well as previous editions in Arma and the release that is this game is justified to buy based on its content additions and a newer (and clunkier) control scheme that compliments this game better than Arma 2's did and overall improvements to the fun of this series. I'd recommend it to you if you enjoyed sandbox/rp stuff or milsim or if you're a fan of the series already.10
Is a great game and all the user made gamemodes make it the great game it is
MO this game it so cool i can be a soldier without joining a military. but this game it's so expensive ;-;10
Bought the game not long ago and now it goes on sale 10/10 its been a week and I feel like a grissled war veteran already
k so to start things off this game is by far the best millitary shooter I have ever played (and I have player ALOT). From the stunning realistic graphics to the most realistic comat you can in a game makes for this game to be a really fun exiting and realistic combat.  This game takes millitary combat to a whole new level it's massive open world landscpae provides for some hectic battles from classic dogfights to jets droping bombs on you to sniping down your foes to even just doing the classic gunsblazings tactic you'll never get board of.  So do I think this is a good game ABSOLUTLY and I 100% reccomand checking this out if you like a good old millitary shooter and yet there is so much more I haven't talked about yet and I'll leave that part up to you.  11/10: MUST GET NOW JUST LEGIT GET IT NOW RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Have a great time out there on the field soldiers... DISMISSED!!!10
f you want a game that simulates the military in a realistic and immersive way this is the game for you.  simulates the military with realistic physics like weight fatigue bullet drop windage zeroing and much more. If requires time patience and a good CPU. This game is big and the graphics are great. I highly recommend this game. It surpasses any other mil-sim or open world game I've played. Check out my youtube for  videos:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaRks8Pn0aL0Y6Y3aqaSo9w .10
This is the best military simulator and there is so much content for the game you could play a new thing every day for the rest of your life it just all around an amazing game
You can play golf in this game using a helicopter a sling and a atv. 10/10
a game really worth getting if your to mod it or just chill in the wasteland servers or just go on king of the hill
he ultimate military simulation. Vast open landscapes complete battle immersion and so many singleplayer and multiplayer gamemodes/scenarios/mods/missions to choose from! Great with friends in co-op against the AI in dynamic skirmishes across the island or teamed up online against the human enemy in King of the Hill. Runs like  but it's ArmA so I really really don't care. 5*10
If your into war games this is the one. Realistic and lots of fun with friends.
erribly optimized graphics engine but still VERY fun to play. High frame rates aren't too necessary in this game because your typical encounter is a much more realistic than BF4 distance which is usually 300m or more. Since bullets actually kill fast (like in real life) when hits are scored close quarters encounters are short and deadly (clearing a building is actually dangerous unlike BF or CoD) and usually there's no lateral tracking to be done since people move slow compared to the absurdly unrealistic BF or CoD games. So 24 fps actually is quite playable in  (I can play GTA V on near ultra settings on 1080p at 110 fps to give you an idea of how poorly 's graphics are optimized).  As for gameplay the game has a great story mode and awesome multiplayer. Dogfights in jets aren't the stupid 60 mph dogfights like in BF4 but rather you're doing 300-400 mph while trying to stay on his tail. I've actually damaged my plane (and pilot) taking a nearly 9-G turn to dodge 4 incoming missiles after I ran out of flares (yes aircraft have realistic quantities of ammo and fuel as they should). If you plan to fly anything you MUST have a mic and most servers require Teamspeak (which is lame since the game already has global side command group and vehicle channels along with direct communications (proxy voice). There is no need for TS unless if you're a brain-dead moron who doesn't know how to utilize the in-game channels. However you will find yourself short of servers to play on if you don't respect the admins most of whom play nothing but  and have a God complex. Stroke their fragile egos and all will be well for you.  Weapons aren't balanced which is nice because they aren't balanced in real life. In real life weapons are designed to be the best at the role they were meant for and that's how the weapons in  are coded. the only 'balancing' is the weight penalties. Ammo for a .50 cal or 12.7mm AMR is freaking heavy in real life and so it is in . If you want to be a sniper using those big guns to score 1-shot-kills from 2 Km away you can but if you weigh yourself down with ammo you will become easily fatigued and your movement will be dropped to movement slower than an over-encumbered Elder Scrolls character. That brings us to the map size of the most popular map Altis. Altis is big. B-I-G BIG.  HERE  [40.media.tumblr.com]  is a to-scale illustration of Altis compared to other well-known large maps. I used to try to describe Battlefield maps to CoD players by saying an entire CoD map would fit into a BF home base. Well Caspian Border fits nicely into the NATO air base on Altis. The little island-like peninsula on the southern part of Altis is just a bit smaller than Skyrim. Yeah Altis is big. 270 square kilometers of land (167.77 square miles) and a total playable area that supports gameplay on land air sea and under water of 1000 square kilometers (621.37 square miles) making Altis bigger than FUEL's map. Yeah... it's bigger than FUEL. 'Nuff said.  So I'm getting bored of typing this so I'll wrap up with saying this game is awesome if you like huge open-world simulators that openly supports modding. Speaking of which there is a Hao mod. That's right you can play Halo in . I know you can play as ODSTs and UNSC marines but I'm not sure about Spartans and Covenant as I only just got the game and I haven't tried the mods yet. I give this game a 8/10 loosing 2 points due to graphic limitations.10
est army/game ever to date! If you have not got it yet go get it now!10
his game is ing awesome.  And suprisingly my craptop is actually able to run it at 30fps 1366x768 on standard settings which is pretty cool.   Seriously though this game is amazing. You should get it.10
xtremly fun and dynamic game with endless opportunity. Yet the DLC's are so expensive its isnane and any servers with DLC items vehicles etc spam your screen constantly to buy it. Love the game but the DLC's are overpriced at $40 for a new map and a few vehicles like thats over the top10
 have over 1k hours on  and it is honestly the best game I have ever played the standalone version is amazing and now with the new DLC campaign it is just getting better and better.  also enables the player to essentially 'mix' their game which can create a better experience . Would recommend this game to any gamer at all ages 14 upwards because there is a game mode for everyone. 10/1010
is the game that will leave you endlessly for hours on end fighting and just overall enjoying the scenery!  is the next gen Military Simulator by Bohemia Interactive and features over 500+ UnitsAircraftVehicles and weapons and many more goodies ingame.  is worth buying!10
t's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need.  Over the next hour that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone I rush to the southernmost tip of the island where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point where the boat takes me home.  Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That  uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed taken as a whole  strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try.  There are also a lot of mods that can be added in to make you experience more intense and satisfying such as various weapons vehicles and missions. The mods that have got me hooked right now are the Life Mods (such as Altis Life Takistan Life and  Life) and the Wasteland mod. I wish i could talk more about them but i seem to have ran out of room in this here text box but all in all great game 8/1010
Has its bugs here and there but the fact its crafted for modular addition gameplay is what i love about it.
aiting forever at the Terminal to get a squad to head to landing zone. Found a squad went to landing zone. Asked if I had explosive charges. I said yes. Asked if I had mine detector. I said yes. Squad leader decided we would blow up radio tower. So we went to the radio tower. We spot a few enemies on hill but don't engage. We finally get to the fence of the radio tower. I check my inventory. WHERE IS MY MINE DETECTOR?! I then realize I accidently left it in a crate back at Terminal. I considered telling them but didn't want to be the one who ruined the entire mission. So I headed into wire surrounding radio tower and luckly the engineer with us actually had a mine detector so I could see some of the mines. I somehow make it to the base of the radio tower plant an explosive and get back ALIVE. We hide behind a rock I set off the charge. We hear the explosion. Then nothing. The radio tower didn't fall. So then I get to go back and place more. My luck has by now run out and I get blown up by one of the mines. I'm dragged out of minefield and saved by medic. So then I get to go back again. KABOOM. Dragged out saved my medic. Squad leader yells at me to be more careful. I reply 'I'm doing my best.' I head back in for the third time. I'm almost to the radio tower when I hear a strange noise. Then I realize I can literally hear my heart beating! The whole situation was apparently very stressful for me. I somehow manage to get to radio tower then and plant 2 explosive charges. Then I also got back out alive. We blew it up AND IT FINALLY FELL DOWN! I was rewarded with a large notification in the top right corner saying 'Enemy Radio Tower Down They cannot call for CAS.' I thought it was going to end there but nope we got sectors to capture.   We were leaving when we got fired at by enemies on the hill. Our marksmen was shot and we engaged the enemy. I tried to take cover behind a rock but unfortunately was shot. Time to wait for the medic to revive me again. So after that everyone was alive and ok and we went to go take over some wind turbines. We got to the hill where the turbines were at and more enemies were on the hill. We exchanged fire for a long time. Our marksman got injured again so we had to drag him back. Then some luckly enemy got a headshot on me killing me instantly. Before the medic could revive me I lost connection and my adventure was over.   Moral of the Story:  Check your damn equipment before you leave the base.10
This game is by far the best first person shooter so far. much better than some of the other games out there.   I HIGHLY recommend this game.
best game ever alot of fun buy now
Best tactical/realistic warfare game of our time. I absolutely enjoy Altis Life.
This is the best War Game
his game is the definition of greatness. The graphics and physics of the game are amazing! Though the game is not easy to get used to this game is a must play for anyone that like brutal unforgiving combat and realistic gameplay. 10
10/10 Wish more of my friends had this game.
f u dont like fast paste fps games but you like games that are slow paste tactical sneaky beaky stylish games this game is for you.    Pros    - Great graphics - fun to play - very tactical game - customizable weapons etc - ingame map editor - mod support +++++ - very well created tutorials - multiplayer support - etc    Cons    - only and the biggest complain about this game is the fps you gotta have good pc if you want to run this game on high. ofcourse you can do some tweaking that will give u little fps boost but still fps is not the greatest10
 Good game good graphics. Amazing variety of gameplay. Gamemodes like CO-OP Wasteland Altis and Stratis Life (RPG) and an epic campaign. There are still a few bugs here and there but actually they make the game funny. If my review didn't help you then check some videos of gameplay on youtube there are a lot of them. I recomend this Game a lot!10
its ok
This game is so mutch fun. Even with out the mods that most people play.
ne of the all time greatest military sims.  is a game for you that are tierd of short matches on maps where you can snipe another player from the other side and kids raging. The game gives you the possibility to try out many sorts of warfare from squad leader to tank commander.  The one thing  lacks is a propper physics engine tanks are not supposed to do sommersaults!  Other then that I whould recommend  to anyone that wishes for big maps and loads of diffrent gear. Buy the Apex Edition! ;)10
best game actully worth the 60 buck and im really getting into altis life.
Very fun game. Alot of game modes like Battle Royale. Wasteland and other stuff. Buy it NOW WHEN ITS -50%
ve played dayz and this Game totally beats it. With the customization available there is really nothing bad about this game. There is occationally lag spikes and fps drops but thats probably just me. GREAT GAME!10
Bottom line:   Necessary investment
xtremely good game there is a learning curve so you need to stick with it. It does have fps issues online but tweaking the games settings &amp; choosing the right server/mission type does mitigate this. The game I spent the most time on. It is true to say I am an armaholic :)10
 went online ended up in a Go-Kart with a HMG on top and then getting a nuke and exploding everywhere from hitting a small rock with a gokart.   10/10 GOTAY10
 I was playing as an independant in wasteland. (Wasteland is where everybody in placed on a large island. It has many towns and objectives). There are 4 teams to join. One of them is independant. This means that you are allowed to kill anyone you see and the whole thing is a rambo.) I had a revolver and two clips. I am approaching a gun zone that is marked as 'Enemy Territory' meaning that there are enemies that have hold of the area. I drove up until I was 500 meters from the gun zone. I then crawled all the way into the inside of the area. After scouting out the zone I had seen that there were two groups of three inside the zone. I continued to watch to see how things would play out. After one group drove off (who was later detonated by a mine that my sniper friend placed) I was left to take down a fully geared group of three. I am laying down in a field while these decked out scrubs are walking no further than 20 meters passed my head. I was within an easy 1 hit kill distance. I waited for all of them to pass me so that I could pick them off from the last man. I was watching them when I heard a loud gunshot from the hill above me. A sniper was laying in a bush and had shot the leader of the group. This was obviously my time to act. I watched as the group hid for cover and turned towards the hill. To my advantage the hill was on the opposite side of mine. Their backs were facing me. I snuck up on one guy and fired a bullet into his back and head. 2/3 killled. The last guy was now firing bullets in my direction but not fully knowing where I was. I then fired a bullet into his leg and watched as my sniper friend blew out his brains. I then faced the sniper (who was a complete stranger) and typed into global chat 'Pleasure doing business with ya' in which he then blew my head off as well. And the zone was captured for our cause.  Thats what makes Arma so cool. Player interaction gamemodes capablities and overall gameplay is amazing. Not recommended for 8 year olds or COD players.10
Really good
Really fun to play with friends Epoch and overpoch are fun waseland aswell if you are thinking of buying make sure you have friends to play with
is a great game that deserves more attention. The only downside is that you need a Jet Engine to run this game.  10/1010
t's a sim. Nothing more nothing less If you're into Military games that provide immersion as well the best experience this one's the perfect choice. After having clocked about 250+ hrs on  i can certainly tell y'll that this game &amp; it's dlc's are well worth the money.10
it is the best game i have ever played and i am glad to have it.
 have never before felt so engaged in combat best FPS out there. The only problem is DLC you need them and they like to milk you do not expect to just buy 1. Without DLC milking I would honestly give 10/10 as of now it's 8/10. I pray Arma 4 wont be having DLC issues.  COD is for kids. BF is for teens. Arma is for adults.10
what is there to do?  There is many things you can do on  here is just a quick list of things you can do and get...  1. There are role-playing servers 2. Wasteland servers where everyone fights to the death 3. There is a ton of mods you can get for this game  4. A lot of friendly people 5. Can make your own server for free!!  6. Not a lot of hackers because this game has top scripters who prevent them  So there was a quick list of things you can do and get.   Do I recommend this game?  Yes I do because this game is top knotch it has incredible views two big maps. fun game modes you can play and tons of mods!  Here is how you can create a server for free:  http://youtu.be/E3ubmiGdPVs   Thank you for viewing this review!10
: Infinite Gameplay &lt;3
:D Game is worth it
irecting this too people that are coming from Arma 2.  This game is a complete upgrade from Arma 2 overall. Graphics are better Inventory system is easier to manage and how the game runs is better. Frame rate is better and more computer friendly for people that don't have super gaming computers. AI are harder and the campaign is relatively enjoyable. Multiplayer is fun with wasteland and altis life. Wide variety of vehicles and they added new play style such as scuba diving.   9/10  -BigH10
rilliant game graphics A1 audio A1 gameplay perfection couldnt possibley be a better combat game currnetly on the market10
A game where cars fly. 11/10
retty damn good make for sure you have a good gaming PC before buying.10
Flying a transport helicopter into an AA ridden  fest AO for ungrateful s who don't understand how hard it is to dodge missiles and land at the same time.  10/10
Looks great for an alpha build. Lots of community content in the workshop. And the first Dlc/mission due soon. Great graphics etc (if your pc can handle it). 9/10
ell this game requires skill. Alot of getting used to the controls and the feel of the guns. Its not the common FPS but you already know that if your getting the game.  and the ArmA series in genral have always offered realistic and addictingly good gamemodes and mods and  has alot of them where is being a RP mod like takistan life all the way to blood thirst survival in battle royale. This game offers alot although i may have only 96 hours i have had over 700 hours on my second account. I can say this game is truely worth it.   8/10   Hit a tiny fence broke my car. Get the game!10
Best LIKE REAL gameplay! When you hear bullets pass over---- puts you in a place where you never think you be in.
 shot a bunny at 1150m with a .50cal  totally recomend this game10
44845
ing awesome realistic comanding and movement throughout the battlefield. Definitely will buy the game.
uch milsim many games much fun so ARMA.10
ve only played about 4 hours of this so far and I am very new to shooters on the PC there are so many controls in this game I don't feel at all limited like in many other shooters. I'm pretty terrible but the game is great fun being clueless I always find a bit fun and adventurous.. I can see myself getting at least a few hundred hours of fun out of this game which makes me think I'm paying maybe 15 pence an hour to play amazing value really!10
 is one of the most advanced cumbersome fun and stunning games I've ever played10
es!  is a great game as long as you have a good computer but besides that there are a ton of online multiplayer servers you can choose from such as hostile take over capture the flag and a ton of different Atlis life servers. Also with the steam workshop you can get a lot of different types of mods that can improve the game.10
itself has an amazing campaign with a flowing storyline and plenties of moments to keep you on the edge of your seat. The voice acting isn't world class but in this sort of game there's plenty else that's going to be taking your attention and immersing you in the story. The online is this game's highlight though with an active community and a fairly easy to use scenario maker people have really put some time and effort into making the best gamemodes and scenarios for you and your friends to try out. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for someone to eat into their time budget because you'll find yourself playing this game for hours. Whether you're into immersing yourself into a mil-sim multiplayer mode or out to cut down waves of zombies on mods like Breaking Point this game is for you. Plenty to do lots of fun to be had thumbs up!10
For the most part this game is amazing and i love it. My only real complaint is that the game is horribly optimized. Its sad when I can run The Witcher 3 on Ultra better then i can run this game. Don't get me wrong this game is playable and fun but you would think for a game thats been around for quite a few years they would start focusing more on making the game stable and run a lot smoother instead of trying to come up with new crap to throw at us without fixing the current issues.
t's a running simulator where AI can see through smoke insta kill you when they are in a vehicle but when on foot they don't know how to hold a gun. And don't try to remember all the keybinds you just can't...10
i like this game you should get it and you will enjoy it so give it a try
f you want a game game where teamwork is the only solution to any problem then look no further.10
One of the only games worth $60.  And it's $40 now.
ust from playing this game alone I could probably fly a helicopter better than I can drive a car.10
Great game if you like more than just your average reflex shooter. This is a war simulator not an arena shooter so it has a bit more of a learning curve but once you are into it there is nothing like it.
i've pondered purchasing this game many times over the last year. i've never played an arma title. i REGRET not purchasing it the first time it crossed my mind.
 beautiful game. really well made good graphics and nice gameplay. I strongly recommend trying the Zeus game.10
reat game fun to play with friends campaign is alright many great game modes to play on and many great mods to choose from. Rate: 8/1010
Very entertaining but has some problems such as some of the worst optimization and lack of content that they try to sell to us in dlc but is overall a good game
f you are into millitary simulators this is the game for you. I would pay 10x what this game cost just to play it!10
Men Play Arma. This is a very fun game and is really fun to play with friends.
BEST GAME EVER..... HELICOPTERS CAR ATV A VAST RANGE OF WEAPONRY
hat is it:  is not your average online fps game it is an extremely realistic military simulator that takes place in a fictional middle eastern like island. This game puts as most war realism as possible into your experience there are many things to do in  if you want to start with singleplayer there are multiple singleplayer modes theres showcases scenarios and the campaign witch are all fun to play. if you want to go straight to the multiplayer you can filter any of the avalible game modes for example roleplay king of the hill capture the island things like that those are my 3 favorites.  What i think: In my opinion the game is a tremendous inprovment from its predisesor arma 2 witch was also great it is fantastic the intense firefights when you drop from a helicopter onto the battlefeild hoping you dont get shot in mid air it is brilliant i think its definitely worth getting. Pretty much the only problem with the game is that sometimes glitches are very common much like arma 2 i cant really specify but you will know when you see them but they are not game breaking and they are easy to get by.  Pros: - amazing military experience - intense/nerve racking - alot of modes singleplayer/multiplayer - massive map (little bigger than arma 2) - hundreds of vehicles (jeeps mraps tanks helicopters jets even drones)  Cons: - every once in a while glitches (not game braking at all)  The vertict:  is one of the best military games i have ever played if you are into military realism you need to get this i am giving  a  9/10   10
lthough  offers a diverse amount of game types and a wide selection of mods if you are looking for fast paced 'shoot-em-up' play style this game is not for you. A typical night in ARMA can involve long periods of boredom interspersed with some of the most intense firefights possible in a video game. I highly recommend this game to anyone that is interested in a more realistic military shooter or someone that is looking to enjoy one of the many alternate gametypes/mods that ARMA offers.10
he mods really transform this game into one that you can play for years and still find new content. Sometimes they break it but that only makes it funnier. A true masterpiece.10
t has it's flaws but  for me is still possibly the finest war game out there.  This game is one for the gamers though casual players be warned. Arma has always and hopefully always will have a tough learning curve. Enemies are accurate and deadly on even the easiest settings and the control system is complicated enough to make your head explode. From the numerous controls for simply running around leaning around corners commanding troops and changing optical sights to the things like zeroing your sights and ranging up targets Arma will have you confused for awhile.  Stick with it though and learn the game and you will realize you have to act like a soldier to survive.  Unlike many fps's you simply cannot get away with blitzing around guns blazing. Shots need to be accurate cover is your only life saver and good use of tactics and planning will win out over Rambo-ing your way through. This makes for a wonderful game very different to the majority of other games out there and a stand alone in terms of war simulation.  Is it war? No. Is it far closer than anything like Battlefield / CoD / Heroes and Generals etc....Yes by a long long way.  Online is much the same thing although people tend to be a little worse than Ai's so you can get away with a little more. Some of the mod's of this game alone have gone on to warrant their own games (DayZ) which for me shows how different this game is compared to the rest of the market. A mod of this game is different enough to anything else out there it got it's own stand alone game not many other titles can say that.  Playing online isn't always easy. Skill is generally going to win out and that can be tough sometimes if you play online and are new to the game. The mod's (such as epoch) that start you with no gear can more be about finding the right server sometimes. I'm currently playing on two different servers one is very full and packed full of people just wanting to kill you on sight no warning no nothing. The other is a generally quiet server very friendly and much more survivor feeling. Both other great game play experiences but of a very different nature. One has you avoiding anywhere built up and laying low a lot until you manage to get a weapon then you start looking for oppurtunities to pinch gear and hold people up. The other has you heading into built up areas hoping to find vital equipment such as building materials food drink and weapons. You look to help others out and often find yourself leaving your safety to help those in need.    Now the game isn't perfect. Time to talk flaws.  Bugs. There are a decent handful of bugs. I had one mission in the main game that all the cars spawned into the floor and I couldn't complete the mission (as part of the mission was to drive one of the said cars to a location).  Another had my artillery support stop working....leaving me to try and take out 4 tanks and about 2 dozen people with what amounted to sticks and stones.  Restarting these levels from scratch fixed both but can be tough to swallow if you found it a struggle getting that far the first time.  Online has bugs too. Climbing over stuff or falling a foot or two from something can sometimes result in injury. Doors will sometimes decide they will no longer work and will either not close or not unlock. A restart of the server (most restart every 4 hours) usually solves that problem though. Vehicles can simply despawn and lose you a lot of gear. The servers tend not to remember a lot of what goes on in the last 3-4 mins before a restart.  With most of the bugs in this game though they are patched fairly quickly and although frustrating aren't deal breakers for me. You're not required to own the DLC either to play on servers that have that DLC running (or so I was told) which is good value for money if you're thinking of being more an online player.    Overall I'd give  a 9/10 ........ Bugs removed a larger single player set of campaigns and perhaps some slightly better optimising (which isn't bad) would push it to a 10.10
ptimazation sucks for AMD processors dont recommend if you have one to purchase this game. But from the few moments ive had good FPS this game was a lot of fun.  Pros: Active community Plenty of content Mods for days Great Graphics  Cons: Preformance is very unstable Unoptimized   10
ove it. 10/10. Uses tons of cpu wish it would use gpu more instead.10
Have had the best memories in this game. Have the right people you will  yourself laughing
xtremely fun and a bit of an adrenaline rush at times if you are playing wasteland or KOTH recommend playing with a crew and get some comms up for the ultimate experience! I plan to spend more time pew pewing baddies and taking their loot! Quite and amazing amount of detail in the game sometimes im amazed at the littlest things I see in game.10
t gets a bad reputation for being overly complicated but it honestly doesn't take that long to learn how play the game especially if you have friends who already play. The complexity of the game also depends on what you are doing playing as an AT Rifleman is going to be significantly easier to learn than learning to fly an A-10D with AFM (Advanced Flight Model) on. I will say that I much prefer playing with mods than 'vanilla ArmA' because it adds sooooooo much content and possibility. Honestly ArmA III is very much like a sandbox game because you can find all kinds of different stuff to do from racing go karts to doing mil-sim OPs with a A3 community.  If anyone is getting this game and wants to join a community to do light mil-sim than check out  http://ddca3.com/ 10
y experience- I have over 1500 hours invested between all of the Arma versions and their mods. more than half of that I spent playing  on Epoch and Exile servers.  The mods really do make these games come alive but if it wasnt for the awesome Dev team and massive amount of content available with the vanilla game the community as we know it wouldnt exist. I have never shared so many different emotions playing one game Anger fear frustration joy and curiousity as I let my imagination write a tale every time I log in. Of course your gaming experience will vary depending what type of mod you are playing but thats just another great asset this game has you can literally go from a battlefield 4 style game mode with 100+ players on a simply massive map to a zombie survival in a wasteland or strugling to survive as a prisoner recently dropped into a unkown island.  If you are looking for THE military simulator that simply has it all and then some.. this is it.  The learning curve is steep and there isnt much forgiveness from veteran players but how you handle being thrown into the fire is up to you. Did I mention the modding community? because its insane literally everything you wanted to create or play your own custom server is here from base building crafting farming flying weapons vehicles maps npcs etc etc etc the list is endless.  Currently I have been playing Exile servers with my Wife there is persistent base building missions trading looting raiding crafting and much more. Eventually you find the community that fits your play style and thats when you really get addicted. PVE/PVP Roaming AI Vehicles etc there are thousands of persistent servers running hundreds of variations of each mod and almost all have very active players and admins.    No Doubt 10/1010
is an amazing shooter and it's realistic as well. By far  even with it's little bugs is one of my favorite games and always will be.  is a realistic military experiance with a sence of freedom because there are so many other cool gamemodes to play Altis Life TDM Wasteland etc. I bought  early 2014 when I didn't have a gaming pc and it ran at 3 fps lowest settings it was unplayable (That was a Toshiba pc with a potato as the graphics card and 4GB RAM) Now I have a better pc (GTX970 16GB RAM Core i5) and it runs on high settings like a charm. The only complaint on graphics I have is that at distance terrain is kind of blurred but I installed a mod that fixes all of that and still works on all multiplayer servers. Now for pros and cons Pros: Freedom Open World Realistic Workshop with TONS of missions and mods Teamwork is crucial Plenty of positions to give you the upperhand in a firefight A bunch of little features that make it realistic (Breath Bullet travel etc.) Awesome Campaign gets you familiar with the game  Cons: DLC is kind of spammy the only DLC I bought is Apex but it wants me to buy Helicopter and Marksmen (Which have cool weapons I might pick the DLC up on sale) You need a good pc to run it DO NOT JUMP OFF ROCKS OR YOU WILL DIE! There are the occasional graphic bugs where players are in the ground or somthing  Overall I think the pros outweigh the cons if you like realistic military games  is for you. Servers and singleplayer missions are a ton of fun!10
Best simulator game. Like the combat beside the movement when you prone but the game and grapich is amazing.
0/10 Loving the imersive feel so far bangin game10
10/10 real life simulator in a third world Country.
Best military simulator around
reat Game But I want to get it so i need it to be cheaper 10
is arguably the single most realistic and immersive experience you can find today. It took me quite a while to get it running well however after its up and running you wont be able to put it down. The maps are insanely huge allowing for intense tactics. The realism of the guns is where this game really shines. while some may complain that the kick is not entirely realistic you have to adjust the sights for distance. If you get shot even once you will either be dead or have an injury such as a broken leg which only allows you to walk. Overall this game is a 9.5/10. aside from some performance issues this game is nothing short of amazing10
Best military simulator you can find! 9.5 out of 10!
This game is absolutly amazing. it took me about 2 to 3 hours to figure out how to play and everything but dispite that this is a really fun game and if you are looking for a Military Sanbox RPG with stunning graphics and amazing gameplay then this is the game for you
ts a great game but you do need someone to teach you the basics because its pretty complex. The only major bad thing is when you shoot at someone and they die its very awkward if you dont know what i mean watch some youtube videos about  and watch people die awkwardly10
reat game very realistic. The only downside is that it needs better optimization.10
ealistic Fun and easy to play when you know simulators. 10/10 10
o HardCore my pc melts down after playing it for a couple of minutes... So Cool that everytime you watch the trailer it gives a chill effect... So tatcital it can be considered a strategy game... So wanted that my friends tryed to stole my pc to play it... So innovative and accurate game mechanics that CoD looks like kids playground... -Its == Gentleman one of the best and most Realistic MIlitary Simulator title out there. I wish my pc could handle its awesomeness to play it...10
... Sometimes really fun and sometimes very annoying.   But better than any other Arma game in the world.   Really fun when you mod it or join a Taskforce  (TF163) :P
eview time:most realistic gamecannot even jump this gamekillslick plays it ofc10
is one of my favorite games of all time. My bro and I were looking for a coop military game with customization and this is it. If you've ever dreamed of making your own military scenerios that you can play with a friend then this game is a godsend.  is the reason I game on PC.10
This game is brilliant! Hours and Hours of gameplay
oMg so realistic even the grases moves unlike cod lol buy the premium edition for your special skull camo and ac-130 killstreak (Srsly tho it is a good game get if you think your graphics card wont melt on ultra lul)
GET this game if you are debating between this game and dayz get arma wait a little bit before purchising dayz standalone because it is extremely buggy in its state and this game has so many mods it will keep you playing for a long time
est game for team work and endless fun. Great graphics too but you need a beasty system though to enjoy max settings. CPU hungry10
here the Arma 2 campaign/s were tedious and frustrating due to bugs and poor AI.  is one of my favourite campaigns do far. The AI is so smooth its not 100% predictable and it just flows really well. Congratulations Bohemia Interactive? on really stepping up the game with this well...game (excuse the pun)10
Great for Individual play and for large group play. Great DLC's and many gamemodes.
mazing military sim. No other game compares to it and the wide availability of mods.   As of Fall 2015 this game is 2 years old but is still being updated and supported by Bohemia. They add DLC every few months and free updates as well. Campaign editors single player campaign Eden etc.  Mods are amazing such as Exile Epoch Breaking point.10
amn this is is my new drugs #LUKATDEMHRSONREKORTSON10
Tis game is the best thats why i have 2042 hours on it i would really recommend this game to people that like roleplay or millitary games
t's an awesome game!Dude the gamemodes oh my god.You really need to play this game IT'S AWESOME!10
 am used to playing the BF series CoC and other games like Titanfall. I also play MMOs on a regular basis. This game is amazing on both aspects. I can play with a few friends and do small ops or I can join massive missions and operations that are so detailed on a scale I have never seen before. I am new to this type of game and if you like BF series and you want more realism then try it out!!10
wesome game I bought it for the life servers like Altis life and  life and servers like that because thats what I find the most fun. Definitely recommend it 100%!10
I only got this game for singleplayer and Atlis Life.
Great game. A must buy for anyone looking for a great simulation first and or third person shooter. Overall great game you will not be disappointed.
f you don't like get ed at by some light wieght that took a round and your the only medic within 1km yet you can't get up to run the 10 meters to rez him. If you don't like getting killed a lot getting shot at run over shot down blown up drowned sunk blown up when you step on a land mine sniped from 2km away or shot in the face with a missle from 10 feet then this game ain't for you.   I just spent £600 on upgrades to run this game on Ultra and it is amazing looking but you don't get much time to enjoy it when all of the above is going on. Great fun when your on a team of 16 and holding down a location and its wave after wave of assualts. So much fun So much hurt soooooo annoying. Worth it. HELL YES.10
10/10 Beautiful game. I could get lost for hours.
YES I DO ING RECOMMEND THIS GAME ITS AWESOME
I like the realism that his game has.
Eden Update Came out Played for a while Quit day job
 is the new age tactical shooter with more addons to enhance your game.
Altis Life is no doubt revolutionary and game changing and I would easily pay $1000+ just for Altis life itself (An  Multiplayer Server).   Pros -almost no children  -realistic rp -realistic military sim -100% supportive and friendly community  -excellent servers  -optimized very well  Cons -none
ne of the best and must have game on PC it doesn't matter if you like Millitary sim or not.  with its mods has something especial just for you. I've been playing this game since alpha and still find something new to play and enjoy.10
Any game were I can ghost an entire squad of players and then covertly listen to them accuse me of hacking is a game worth playing.
ealistic bullet drop Too much wind sounds Realistic Terrain Custom Gamemodes This is like Garry`s Mod but merges with Battlefield Funny Players Easy to fly a Jet but hard to land LARGE MAP IS GOOD.  Should you buy this game? YES. wait... idk someone gave it to me :
Great game :D
  The soldier stalks his prey;35;3211
his might not be your game if the only fps' you play start with 'battlefield' or 'call' unless you only play on hardcore modes. If you like military sims then this is the quintessential experience. You can devote endless hours playing this game with nearly endless options. BI supports it's modding community and it is very expansive. They also occassionally have cash prizes for mods. Unfortunately the modding community isn't well represented in steam workshop but downloading mods from BI's forums isn't difficult. There are some intuitive control issues with the UI but it's forgivable. I wish I had more time to give this game so I could join a group that plays regularly like ShackTac.10
ith the amount of Community support this game is a must buy.10
he story's alright but where this game really shine's is with RP Life Talkistan Life...10
Never played it and I honestly don't know why I was able to write this review but it looks fun
reat graphics bit glitchy mods fun with freinds and you can play serious or mess around10
m going to be completely Honest I bought this game almost exculsively to play the battle royale game mod. As such i have played very little of the actual campaign of vinilla experience. I can say though that if you like or enjoyed ARMA style games you will appreciate the leve of detail and dedication to realism this series provides. The controls are responsive and the guns handle amazingly. Every time i died it was 99% my fault and the other the lag I blame and curse over the microphone as I mourn my body. If you apprciate more realism to your games then straight up over the top action I would recomend giving this series a try. I did not mind spending the money and I bought this before the summer sale. I would highly recomend looking at the modding scene as well which is normally very active with ARMA series titles (Look at the dayz mod)10

ard challenging frustrating annoying impossible infuriating still my favorite game10
layed it just a tad joined a few servers. It's alright I guess.  In all seriousness it is the best if not one of the best shooter games I have played only rivaled by CS:GO. Gun mechanics are on point learning curve is a bit much but if you are willing to grind it out and get decent it is really enjoyable. Have had a whole lot of enjoyable moments and fun times playing this game.10
the best game i ever playd
is by far my favorite tactical shooter at the moment the amount of user created content is amazing Exile mod KOTH its all just great!10
Great game 9.5/10 Don't give this a ten because of these reasons  Fps is iffy  The bushes are made of metal Thats legit it  Heres the Good things Great guns Great cars Great models Great animations Great Game in all :D  in the end its worth the money but if you're running a not so good pc idk if you should get it since the fps tends to drop at certain moments
is awesome and sucked at the same time. Here is why I think so.  basically nailed it when it comes to the new map edit. Making a battle is way more easy. The graphics are way better. I have not even ajusted anything because it looks great so maybe later. But the lack of vehicles is a major let down. Arma 2 was $20. It came with a vast amount of different vehicles and aircraft. For $20. The new $50 comes with basically nothing. There is like one gunship chopper an A-10 and one Fighter Jet. No vtol at all. No cargo plane or MV-22. There is one tank for NATO. NATO is all I can pick. The plane selection is gone and the chopper selection is vastly limited. One truck per a side and I don't like how models that you don't own are intergrated into the game. Features are all locked so its like....What did the $50 price tag cover? At the very least I would of expected them to port over the vehicles and armies from Arma 2. If you put the files from arma 2 into  they work but the sound don't match and all the features don't work but arma 2 vehicles do drive and fly so they could of spent the time they used to make DLC to port over Arma 2 stuff to  so that we could at least make a proper battle. As it stands now.....after paying $50.....you still have to buy DLC to even make a good war. I am disapointed and feel like I waisted money because Arma 2 was totally better. If Arma 2 had  graphics.......it would be dramatically better than  hands down. Yea....you can download mods to add things to . But after $50.....I should of been able to make a full scale war with  right out of the box. But I can't....Not untill I buy enough DLC to fill the void left in  by the lack of Vehicles and other stuff. Not enough puzzle peices. There are times that you and the enemy you place are using the same weapon systems cause its the only one to use at all. Untill I buy enough DLC to fill the void left in  by the lack of Vehicles and other stuff I can't really do full scale war like in basic non moded Arma 2 without any expantions. Arma 2 out the box gives you enough Lego's to build something with.  makes you buy every peice. Why didn't they port over the vast amount of stuff in the previous game? Why would you not do that but charge me more for the new game....Weird10
ery Nice Fun with Friends10
iI played a lot of millitary simulators before I started  for example (InsurgencyRed Orchestra...) but  is a special simulater because it has a HUGE map with many citiesvillagesmilitary bases... There are a lot of mods/addons.  Pros: -Graphics   -athmosphere  -huge map  -lot of mods and addons  -weapons and their attachments  -vehicles (waterair and land)  -great community  Cons: -a lot of buggs  -pure optimalization  -the game is pretty hard for beginners who never played a military simulator before...(for example to fly a   helicopter is not always easy)  I am not english so i am sorry if my grammar is not the best...10
i Love This Game :-)
 Worth the money on sales. In a nut shell :  -Its a bonafide warsim. -Good size community. -Vast collection of mods which made the game is actually multiple games in 1 platform.  WARNING : MP experience varies depending on where you live10
Mods and more mods. THis game is just fantasic.
his Game is one of the best games i have ever played. You can do deathmatchesroleplayingect. i think its petty fun.10
eally good game recommend for you to buy it. The game has extremely good graphics that make it look realistic. Once the game is out of Alpha/Beta there will be a lot more vehicles such as airplanes. I would give this game a rating of 8.5/10 as of now.10
reat game with a lot of possibilities! It´s fun and you can do nearly everything you want. But you have to play it with friends online because you can do so many stuff.10
 do recommend this game. This game is great and is very fun. I don't play multiplayer so I won't be talking about that nor do I care about graphics for those of you who only care about the graphics. I personally love open world games and open ended games. So there are quite a few missions that I love and those include Robj's missions and whole lotta altis. I don't really have any complaints because I don't look for problems in games I just play it and appreciate getting to play games.10
This Game is Amazing. Campaign - 9/10 and multiplayer is probably the best part of the game especially the altis asylum servers. I recommend getting it
RMA3 is the type of game that was built for a specific niche audience that has had the rare opportunity to transcend that audience tenfold. While vanilla ARMA contains a campaign and multiplayer that aims to bring out the tactical realism of warfare in a mil-sim style the community and its modders have brought forth countless missions game modes maps and all manner of content. DayZ and other popular games of the sort owe their existence to ARMA and the fantastic modding tools they put forth. ARMA the game might not be up your alley but there sure as hell might be a lot of other somethings ARMA has to offer that are.10
It's ok.
rilliant military simulator! Gameplay 9/10 Realism 9.5/10 - 10/10 with mods like JRSRS Dragonfyre Blastcore: Phoenix and ACE 3 Graphics 9/10 - Terrain and objects look brilliant however colour correction is dull and boring :/ Community 10/10 - Brilliant community because of 1000's of mods ability to create your own server and in majority friendly players. Imersion - 8/10 - If your a mainstream FPS fan this is not for you the vannila campaign is not cinematic. I have 250 hours on  and have been gaming on my current rig for 6 months and 2-3 years on pc in total. PM or add me if you want to play with me on my  realism server! 10
 It's a pretty fun game. I didn't really get much time to play but every second I played I enjoyed. It was surely fun. The multiplayer is fun with the roleplaying servers and CO-OP. If you are really into military games not too far back in time and not futuristic then this is the game for you. Graphics are great. These are not the best of the best but I'm actually surprised about how good it is still. Audio is great too. Some multiplayer players are really some  that constantly taze you for no reason on roleplaying servers. But I still had a blast playing it! Good job Bohemia Interactive  10
ne of the best games out   Want a classic shooter? Hardcore infantry is the best for you!  Want a badass jet/chopper/tank? Wasteland King of the Hill or MilSim has got that too.  Want a zombie shooter? Breaking point has that in spades. Want a house boyfriend/girlfriend and live the GTA life? Altis life has plenty of players.   All things being said this game has it ALL.  10
Really good game
A very great game. I love how online there are so many game modes to choose from.
hat more can be said about arma? well not much. the base game is good i went more into the modded games and to be honest its a shame the way things have gone in the modding community. the only one i can say i enjoy at this point is the exile mod. those guys are doing some great things and hopefully will continue too. so manny of the modders all have got a attitude 'this is my mod you cant use it' its actually sad. Then you got the game creator that hasnt helped the situation at all. at this point there are other games out now that i would recomend over this but it does still have some good points.10
The best combat/tactics/war game available today. And there are awesome mods where you can display how far bullets fly and how devastating they are!
ig fan of arma! buy the apex version its cheaper and everyone uses DLC so might as well10
Bought a new PC just for this game.
ey that's pretty good.  *Edit* RIP life10
This game has brought me many hours of great fun. 11/10
y favorite game of all time is also a flawed mess. Let me explain.  Similar Games: Insurgency Operation Flashpoint Battlefield (in some respects)  Pros -Unforgiving hardcore tactical gameplay. -Realistic damage model. -Intense Cinematic firefights that will have you at the edge of your seat and get your adrenaline pumping. -Co-op and PvP is amazing in this game if you play with the right people. -Has one of the most dedicated modding communities I have ever seen. -Easy to mod. -Many official and fan made gamemodes that are a blast to play. (Favorites: King of the Hill CTI Liberation Insurgency) -Detailed open world enviroments. -Destructible buildings. -Overall a fairly welcoming community. -Dynamic gameplay hardly anything is scripted. -Combined Arms gameplay. -Variety of roles to fill within a squad. (Ex: Medic Sniper Grenadier etc.) Vehicular combat is also a thing. (Tanks planes and helos are all included.) -Large scale battles among varied enviroments. (some modes simulate an enemy army moving along the map.) -Easily the best co-op game of all time. -The game is in constant development with updates on nearly a monthly basis fixing issues and adding improved mechanics. The dev team seems to listen to requests of the community as well.  Cons -VERY steep learning curve. (You will get destroyed a lot when you begin.) -Bugs. Many Bugs mainly collision issues which can be problematic especially during PvP modes. Getting stuck on objects is common in this game. -Performance varries and is hardly based on your PC specs. (Most of the performance issues in the game are due to slow server speed and the amount of AI/Players that are accounted for at any given time during a game. The faster the server is the higher the FPS.) -Single player can be really dry. You will get hardly anything out of the game if you only play single player. -Clunky UI that takes some getting used to. This has been improving. -AI varries in intelligence and reaction time. This has been improved in the recent updates but it is still pretty bad. -Only for a certain audience. -Some of the animations look rediculous.   Overall  I have had a fantastic time with this game. It is a clunky mess but at the same time there is no game on the market that provides the same amount of freedom as well as tense heart pounding gunfights that Arma does. However the barrier to entry is so high I think the only way to enjoy this game is to know someone or even better a group of people who play it regularly to show you the ropes. If you try to get into this game in any other way you will have an absolutely miserable time. As I may have said earlier a huge aspect of this game is the Co-op and if you play with people you don't like your opinions on the game will follow suit. Another thing to consider is how niche the game is. Research and/or try before you buy.  10 out of 10 -As contradictory as this verdict might be considering all the problems this game has I cannot deny the amount of enjoyment I have gotten out of this game so far and the several hundred hours more to come out of it in the near future.  This game is for: Players seeking a tense challenging stress indusing tactical shooter to play in cooperation with other like minded people.10
ON SALE 50% OFF  Great war sim.  Lots of Vehicles and Weapons.  Open world. Lots of mods.  1st and 3rd person fov.  Great with friends or find a good community server.  Low end pc may not want to purchase this title :(  edit another sale!!
his game has taught me one beautiful lesson 'You'll never know how bad you suck at being a soldier until you try.'10
One of my best games ever does not lag good graphics fun to play and good workshop items
till a bit buggy but a lot of fun though.10
he game play is simple yet effective even to the highest standards. You will enjoy basically open world with missions and simulations that will never cease to amaze you if you find the right game mode. If you look at the graphics you have detailed gun’s detailed worlds and uniforms however the game play is far from perfect this is due to the weirdness physics engine and how it reacts to you and other players but this game has been nothing but pleasure for me and with these DLC’s you simply couldn’t have non-stop fun with ARMA III!10
k where too start the game is fun and if you have a group of friends even better now with that said the game is laggy and when i say laggy i mean very laggy. I'm running a 290x with an 8320 asrock mobo and it still can't run this game you want too know why they don't give a  you got it now your stuck with it they don't fix anything just save your money and get something else maybe if you have an intel it may run better but my brother have intel and you know what he can't run it either so don't get it i'm telling you right now you will be sorry. And what's sad is i love the game when i can play it it's a good game but oh man does it suck-10
Great game. Great dlc. Best running simulator 2k16 and beyond. Mods for this game are great aswell
Great game. Realism is on point. Physics could be better. Very high replay ability.
 was on the fence about this game thinking it was gonna be like another call of duty. So i held out watched twitch and read reviews. Finnaly the game went on sale and i decided to buy it. I almost regret not getting it sooner. This game is addicting10
It Nice. Very Nice.
A game for those operators who operate operationally in operations
It's okay
his is a good buy but be warned it is not like ArmA 2 and does not have as much content. The devs have almost seem to let the modding comuunity to take over the content. Also here is a list of bad:    1)  is not optimized for AMD players in multiplayer. I can turn my graphics from low to high and still get 25 fps on all of them when i play multiplayer. My friends who actaully has a GTX card can only get 30-35 fps but switch it over to the campaign or editor mode and fill it with crap I can run 40-60 on standard both maps. 2) Go mess around in ArmA 2 then go to  there is so little content available in . I mean you had ever type of weapon on a humvee from a m249lmg to a TOW laucher and so did the other light vehicles. The weapons there was at least 30 base weapons giving awesome customization. vs what 5 or 6 that really the only wirthwhile thing that can change is the sights. 3) No bipods great mill sim there (Dayz has a bipod) 4) The inentory system is a bit wonky to me but maybe that is just me. 5) Steep learning curve 6) AI will kill you with one shot from a 9mm pistol when they are on the otherside of the town. 7) AI can take 3-6 bullets from your standard issued MX rifle that shoots a 6.2mm (Battle rifle basically) 8) Vehicle warfare is boring since even the tanks can't take but one rocket before they are critically damaged (And most launchers lock onand you can not block the lock)10
imply saying this 'game' is fantastic just doesn't quite do it justice. Since 2010 I have enjoyed ARMA II and III being introduced first into the original DayZ Mod. Experiences earned here are timeless and I have been priviledged to see the development of the series.  simply put is my favorite game to play. I have also learned a fair amount while doing so. It is an experience you can find no where else with a development team that is passionate to create the best asking for criticism along the way- with DLC you can try before you buy via the editor and nonetheless isn't game breaking or necessary by any means if you don't happen to want any extra content.   I would vote yes again and again. Participated in the  Alpha and it has been an absolute joy to see this game become more and more polished. The greatest investment steam has to offer. The learning curve is significant but completely worthwhile to learn. Do not feel broken by the complexity. It is a masterpiece of art with very thrilling experiences. And even years on from the DayZ mod I still remember my first online kill with absolute clarity.10
op shooter of all time and developers keep on improving it.  I can't deny there are LOTS of bugs to be fixed but it's still the best milsim game around.10
is more than likely the best military simulator there is. It can turn a bad day into one of the best you've ever had. Firing weapons driving vehicles learning how to fly a helicopter or jet has never been more fun. One of the great things about  is the ability to modify the game whether it be downloading from the workshop or installing mods from armaholic they add a great variety to the game. The only downside to this great game is the DLC prices 16$ for 2 helicopters (Of course different varieties of them) another 16$ for a few more guns and a terrible looking ghille suit and 2$ for go-karts.10
ell I purchased this game because of the exile mod thinking it would make a nice change of scenery I was correct it is a very addicting game although the little bugs like driving a atv into a bush will kill you dying in a house due to a millimeter gap between the wall and floor are annoying if you can look past it i'm sure you will very much enjoy it as a bonus there is a stupid amount of mods/maps/server to play so you can always get something that you are looking for.10
uring the weekend deal (waaaayyyyyyyyyyy long ago) i enjoyed the game i only did afew campaigns my friends taught me how to fly and realy its way cooler than arma 2 (graphics wise and audio) alot of new stuff  i do approve (+1 Twitch(?) follower) of this games price (kinda) but the way how tis done for me is realy realistic +110
This is my review on :  Pros: +Huge modding community +Loads of guns +Many different scopes +Quite a lot more but currently can't remember.  Cons: -Community can be cancerous at times -Game is CPU dependent meaning that if you have a crap CPU but good GPU you're in for a fun time  Hopefully performance shouldnt be an issue when Apex comes out as it will include the DX12 upgrade which is free.
Certainly the best milsim out at the moment. Has its problems but the modding community alongside joining a good multiplayer community helps. Some good steps in the right direction from arma 2.
I love this game! :D
Best war military sim game I have ever played in my life.
t is pretty good. With even only low settings on it is beautiful. Have only really played Exile and Life mods though. Great game give it a 1000/100010
This is a great game 10/10
By far the best game I have ever played. Perfect for anyone who loves milsim and playing with serious people.
his game is amazing if you are looking for a free-roam first person shooter with amazing graphics literally nothing compares to this game if you know how to play it.10
Modding community for it is great. Plenty of game modes so you'll never get bored. Bohemia is constantly updating it (though oftentimes their updates fix one thing but break something else)
y first day of actually knowing how to play le game:  On independent team BluFor armored convoy sitting on hill for hours Get into Chinook Make contact 'I'm a friendly don't shoot.' Fly over convoy Sling load their AA tank Fly away into the sunset with it AA aims up and perforates the absolute  out of Chinook Crash land on top of AA Both blow up Go back to squad on hill They talk ****  Secretly plant 3 IEDs  Trollololol BOOM Leave server bcuz tey killed me a lot afterwards  6/5 would trollololol again 10
o get dayz all you need to do is pull down your pants and bend over if a pistol comes out of your butt you will receive your own copy of dayz :D awesome game btw10
 have deleted my old review for this one. (it was also positive).  To understand if this game is worth it have a look at the hours many many many people put into this game. Check the reviewer hours.  It that doesn't sell you..... nothing will and you don't deserve to play it....10
its a yes from me
his is THE mil sim out there. Only downside is that its set slightly in the future but there are plenty of player made weapons and vehicles that is set in current time.10
 Love this game to bits love battle royale love the coop love all the gamemodes. But this game is buggy af. I keep getting crashes so buy with caution.10
Where the es at
reat game different mods such as wasteland / king of the hill.  Really enjoyable   Badly optimized (FPS) 10
It's an amazing game. A lot can be done and there is a lot of space to do this stuff. I did not play the campaign but I played a mod with friends. It's like a totally different game within a game to play a mod. Can't get better than that.
ave you ever played a modern/futuristic ( is in the middle it's in 2035 not that futuristic after all) FPS war game with a full-scale war? If you haven't then please play this game 3D art is done fantastically well the game lets you control almost everything there is a wide variety of vehicles and weapons you can drive and shoot however it was one of the most difficult campaigns i have ever played it took me 47 hours to complete with skipping ~6 missions if i remember precisely because they were too difficult if you are coming from cod or bf you will have a hard time transitioning into arma but it is totally worth the time at sometimes the AI was acting a bit stupid but not as much as arma 2. Unfortunately those AI moments where the soldiers used cover were scripted but hell the atmosphere I've never experienced something as cool as this. The game takes place on 2 beautifull greek islands Agios Efstratios (mentioned as stratis in-game) and Lemnos(mentioned as altis in-game). The storyline was also good instead of being the typical world savior you are a normal soldier who takes part on a war nothing more or less you'll love it though.   I have to mention a funny incident that happened during gameplay: I am a greek citizen and i have to point out that cicadas show up during the summer and you don't usually build a fire in the summer during day time... something that some soldiers were doing in the game. Looking forward to arma 4 being released im sure it will be as good as  and maybe even better (maybe better optimised than  since it does not sympathize amd cpus). That's it amazing game overall.10
A really fun to play if you like simulator games and there is alot of mods you can play with. My personal favorite is Breaking Point. I highly recommend buying this game
its a good game
uper fun and lots to do...   but i need a $5000 pc ok10
eally refined compared to Arma 2 they did a lot of work and the campaign is well written and a pleasure to play. UI is cleaned up mechanics are mastered and smoothed and gameplay is a lot more immersive. Great moves Bohemia keep it up.10
Just hasnt got the magic. cant really explain but the game has lost the fun.
1;0
Great game! Can not begin to tell you how many fun times I have had. You should get it for sure. You will get many fun memories for the price you pay.
once you get past the inital bad controls and the fact that it's actually quite realistic... it's actually a really fun game.. that i wish i had the money for.. free weekend has made me jelly... 11/10 would buy this is i had money
his game is honestly one of the best game you'll ever play i can barely run it (15-30fps) yet i had so much fun you have a high end intel processor you'll have a great time.10
Just as great as arma 2 :D but it's a lot better!
Amazing game with many biggest mods!!
One of my favourite games however my PC sturrgles to run it
I played it a bit. It's okay.
Loads Campaign. Plays first level saying 'this is so easy!' gets to part were captain gets blown up by landmine. main character says 'im on my own now' then it hits me... there's no waypoints now. gets exploded by more landmines. quits game.
It's a great game with friends in wasteland Altis life and king of the hill
?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????
ONT BUY IF YOU WANT TO GO MULTIPLAYER. UNLESS YOU HAVE AT LEAST A 3.5GHZ INTEL i5   The game itself is a very nice realistc game with many weapons and attachments many vehicles many unique features and 2 GIGANTIC maps (about 300km²).  BUT:  -Multiplayer FPS still not optimized (was promised) -Collision-Detection still not improved (its obvious that something is wrong with a 3d game where you cant jump) -AMD Hardware optimization not even began.... (15-30 FPS in multiplayer...they couldnt care less bout AMD users) -AI is a not-so funny joke -Ground-vehicle behaiviour is far away from being realistic or enjoyable (they obvious tried both and failed) -Official Servers????? NOPE!!!!! -Matchmaking????? NOPE!!!!!  -CoOp play singleplay campaign?????? NOPE!!!!!!  RV engine 'Features':  -bad collision detection (the most essential part of a shooter) walking on rocks = falling through them and die. walking on stairs = get stuck and die. walking towards a wall = glitch through and die  -switch weapon while walking = standing still to switch weapon (finally solved in arma3)  -no free movement i.e. jumping climbing etc.  -massive desync between server and clients  -extremely slow server browser that you cant stop from refreshing  -extremeley clunky vehicle physiks  -undynamic sound engine (sounds cant move with their source)  -massive FPS problems on multiplayer and large scale ai missions  -non dynamic lightning (flashlights throw light through walls etc.)  -several crashes  -non effective memory allocator  -no multi cpu/gpu support  -no 64bit support  -poor ingame voice chat quality   +realistic ballistic  +good sound effects  +nice graphics with huge viewdistance  +extremely huge maps  +nice 'stances' feature  +huge possible amount of players on 1 server    This list would be endless.   they should REALLY outsource the engine development due NO PROGRAMMING SKILLS.  DayZ SA is the same  but even crappier (10-15 FPS in Towns while  gets around 20-30 FPS on a 50 Player Server).  They should have learned form ofp and arma1&amp;2 that they are unable to programm a stable and performant game engine. So why dont spend some of the earned money to the development process  (as promised in the EA phase) and buy a decent engine from someone who is able to programm such an engine (UE4 Cryengine 3 Unity)????????????  they set the wrong priorities and ignore the simplest rule of programming: ______________________________ *****KEEP YOUR CODE CLEAN AND FAST***** -----------------------------------------------  they earned at least 200million$ with dayz(10mil. copies sold)  and about 30million$ with (1mil. copie sold)  what are they doing with the money?  the development team is &lt;100 persons  its not personal costs. its not sound recording. its not the mocap sessions. its not engine optimization. its not even design or modelling. its their ING OWN POCKET where the money goes.  They are taking our money with hands WIDE OPEN (spend about 50€ for  and about 23€ for DayZ) promise to use it for the game and dont spend it in the development process as promised.  Bohemia Interactive has great artists and designers + a good know of realistic weapon behaviour but the dev-team leaders and programmers are even stupid as hell or only want your money for no effort....  i really hope that they are opening their eyes and start optimizing their company or no one will ever buy another arma or dayz. i wouldnt. i made my experiences with Early Access and Bohemia Interactive and must tell: THEY ARE LAZY AND MERCENARY. Update Cycles from DayZ are a bad joke. take a look at H1Z1. It was released over a year later with a MUCH smaller budget and has updates AT LEAST EVERY 2 Weeks...10
mg have 355.9 hrs on record and this game never gets old playing with friends worth every penny just one thing if you do buy buy the bundle containing all dlcs because otherwise will cost you ALOT in future if you want them10
s a former soldier with two tours of duty under the belt I can certainly say from personal experience this is incredibly realistic. The ballistics the sounds the atmosphere. Took me a while to get into as I didn't have the best setup. Still gives me sweaty palms and makes my heart race in places. Has certainly helped reduced effects of combat stress on my mind. Unwinding playing a few hours really helps. Highly recommended. Seriously give up on COD/BF series if realism is your goal. Arma all the way!  Hoping that VR compatibility is the developers' list of things to do....   DT10
new data alocation is  it keeps making my misim missions crash and all ts plugins keep dieing
Without mods pretty   With mods best game ever 9/11
or any fan of the FPS genre (Medal of dutycall of battlefield etc.) I recommend one and only one game worth buying . This game is single handedly better and has more realism than any of its competitors. Also they have a very active mod community to ensure much replayability for several years to come (Think the original Half Life and the many many mods that were spawned from it gamer heaven). Everyone should get this game. Even as cheap as I am I feel it is well worth the $60 price tag. Buy it play it and say good bye to inferior FPS's. I'm glad I did.  Ps. It has pilotable killing drones! Hella fun!10
Awesome game having a lot of potential definitley worth playing despite poor campaign which never been though strenght of bohemia interactive games
rma is probably hands down the best FPS I ever played in my life in terms of how much time you're going to want to enjoy this masterpeice... Well worth the premium price and more. I would suggest this game to anyone who even remotely wants to enjoy a high fidelity FPS game. The community more than even the developers has breathed life into the title and continues to do so with new content coming out pretty much all the time!10
in 2 hours we bougth a car a boat managed to die 50 times drive my car into the sea then turn into a knagroo (somehow i managed to fly away with my char jumping like a kangoroo!   That's what my friend told me after we played this game (altis mode)
Fun game. Nice Realism in game. Could be difficult at first but you can get the hang of it.
ompletely realistic and fun. Needs more weapons but the realism is unbelievable. Worth the money really laggy (if you have a bad computer) but once you 'tweak' the game it will make the game less laggy. Another thing is that the buildings are so high quality that when you go near them you lag. Even when you are near hangars!10
this game is so much fun! 10/10 would buy again.
One of the most realistic shooters of all times!
This is a good game but if you do not have a trusty computer it might crash alot or lag so look at some reveiws to see what GC is good for it
this is not cod where people fly away while you shoot them. This is more realistic like Iraq.
i dont even have this game lol
its awesome controls are weird but once u get used to them its excellent
3 little words . best game ever
Why are you reading this? You should know by now this is a good game.
its a good game :)
rm I bought DayZ and I can make a review on a game I don't have. 10/10 Good Job GabeN.10
ossibly best game ever played very immersive. 11/10 'it was okay' -IGN10
hile this game had some major bugs at the begining it has started to smooth out to be one of the best simulators of all time. Lets start out with the actual simulation. Well you are defaulted to be in First Person everytime you spawn but you can go to third person if you have the keys binded. There is bullet drop weather vehicles weapons(Not real time weapons) and lots of customization options for YOUR soldier. There is tons of fatigues and weapons to choose from if you're playing vanilla. Now if you're playing with mods in your game you are going to have a even better time playing. Mods can help with AI and add new clothes for your soldier I.G Helmets vests facial protection and fatiuges. Just a really big tip is if you don't have anyone to play with on this game find a Milsim unit and I guarentee you won't be bored.  10/10 would join milsim unit again Thx Bohemia Interactive10
11/10. One of the best military sims out there (In my opinion.) Plus the controls are better compared to ArmA 2. :P
What have i done?..... The life servers have taken over my life.   Send help
f you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!10
i got shot for buying a green car 100/10
This is war and it is amazing.  improves on every past Arma game has done and puts it to the max. Aside from the price and sometimes awkward controls  is truly astonishing. The campaign is ok but makes up for it with great gameplay and graphical beauty. The multiplayer is great and after you've gotten bored of the base game there's masses of workshop content to entertain you! Overall I'll give  a 8.5/10. See you on the frontline!
ought the gaME For $60 NEXT DAY 50% off. GABEN STRIKES AGAIN10
his is hands down the best military simulator available. There is a steep learning curve and it's not very 'plug and play' but A3 can deliver an incredibly rewarding experience if authenticity and realism are up your alley.   The Arma series has proven to be both a fun combined arms shooter as well as an invaluable training tool.10
A very good game. Every soldiers dreamgame! (y)
his Game... OMG Altis life is one of the best parts of the game. You and your friends doing jobs such as: Cocaine Heroin Weed Diamond Oil and Iron jobs and much more. Then going out to be a Rebel or be a Cop or just a normal Civilian.   Me and my 3 friends are enjoying this game ALOT. And you will aswell. And if you dont want to play Altis then you can also play the Campaign and that is really fun aswell im not a big fan of it but you might be. This game is for every guy who likes the realistic military gameplay and realistic gameplay like the real world.   You can also get the DayZ mod and the Battle Royale mod. I havent tried the DayZ Yet but the Battle Royale is REALLY good. Its a great mod and it should get into the game itself instead of being a mod that you can download.   But this game is really all the money worth.10
 wouldn't see this as a game but rather a platform that offers endless expansion. 8/10 for clumsy controlls but good possibilities. (good mods can be found such as BR and BP)10
this game is glitch
ant a game you can play for years and have no limits to what can be done with this game? 275 hrs and counting and I still find new stuff to do all the time. Only cons are as always with arma optimization blows. But quite honestly I probably would've paid $200 if that's what they charged it's that good.10
idn't play too long but I liked what I played.10
ot anyting like the FPS your use to. Its much better! If you are looking for a fast paste fps this is not for you! Requires a bit of your pc but some commands can help run it a bit better!10
This game is soooooooo much fun
s long as you like heavy team oriented play (no battlefield doesn't count) then you'll love . And if you're the kind of person who likes to sit back from the action and just provide some fire support maybe artillery or just bringing soldiers to the front line and going back to base then there is a role in  for you.10
So much to do in this game. How can you not love it. Big step up from arma 2.
f u want a game where bullets actually have a penetration rate they ricochet depeding on the surface and the type of bullet an online experience that simulate real life battles that's the game for you! Probably you'll need a coolio computer for it but I think it's really worth it there are a lot of mods and game modes that keep it fresh and cool! Also you can be whatever u want a taxi driver a kamikaze an eli pilot or just a civilian who doesn't want that people get on his lawn. ALSO! LOOK AT THE GRAPH1C5!!!11! :310
- everything can be used by anyone. It's a amazing game where you can be anything from jet pilot to sniper in beautiful islands. Modding is the big part of the game. Even through realism has been dumped down in  you can get mods like ACE10
Epic Game:  -Pick heroin in heroin fields  -Get gear  -Blow up someone with a rocket launcher  -Get murdered by an attack chopper  10/10 would play again
The game is awesome. Needs alot more mods though. ARMA 2 has a better mod selection. COMON PEOPLE MAKE SOME MODS!
reat MilSim love it.10
It's awesome but it is best to play with friends.
mazing Game Jaw Dropping Graphics Tons of Fun but not worth $60. Perfect Game to buy when on sale!10
un but badly optimized for people who have more than 2 CPU cores especially if your CPU has bad single core performance and relies on the program utilizing its cores such as the FX series.10
This Game is Nothing But Amazing.... I Don't Have A Bad Word To Say About This Game... This Game is Even Better When Being Used To Play DayZ.... A Must Have For Any ArmA Fan
reat game even the base game is good but WAY better with mods. 9/1010
his game is amazing i cant believe i havent heard of it untill recently! multiplayer is where its at because on the majority of servers i play nothing is handed to you except a pistol. you have to fight and scavange for weapons and supplies. everything(especially helicopters) is extremely realistic. 9/1010
Nice game :3
 Arma III; great game but...  Arma III checks all the boxes for a simulation. Incredible graphics massive scope high level of detail everything a person would want for a simulation. The short time I played it I was blown away by its realism. Therein lies the problem.  Arma III continues a trend I noticed first with the Gran Turismo series of games. GT2 was an fun game to play. A little cartoonish with the graphics and not entirely accurate to real life but it was real enough to enjoyable. Since then the Gran Turismo games have become more realistic and I'm in awe everytime a trailer comes out. I haven't bought a game since GT3. GT3 wasn't fun to play it was too real. The cars required a level of control that I couldn't provide using a controller and TV screen. This is the same issue I have with Arma.  The first time my character died I think I was receiving fire from in front of me. Each time after that I couldn't tell you where I was being shot from. After the 10th or 15th time enough was enough. It was very realistic and very frustrating. No feedback from my speakers or anything on screen to indicate where the enemy was. Effectively I was being punished for playng a computer game on a computer. WASD and a mouse werenot enough for me to play this game.  To sum up:  If you enjoy shooters like Halo or Doom this might not be for you.  If you were frustrated by the unforgiving nature of MS Flight Simulator this game is definitely NOT for you.  If you have a thing for playing the most realistic games available this is the game for you!10
Simple review:  Nice game if you like multiplayer or co-op games and communication with other players.  Stability 7.5/10 Community 9/10
Great game so far! Loving all of the customization and community add ins. Check forums they help a ton
i have never had a game i played more than this one. this game has so many mods and game modes
 fantastic military sandbox with many addons &amp; mods to experiment with. It has its fair share of cons and pros the cons laying mostly with the multiplayer portion of the game and the decency of your PC.  If you intend to buy this game I recommend upgrading the specs on your PC to something of above average. I'm not saying that if you have a PC with not as up-to-date specs that you won't have the same ArmA3 experience I'm just saying that in order to get more out of this game you may want to consider doing so.  Singleplayer is fantastic. With the steamworks support and modding support this game has singleplayer is a blast aside from the campaign. Definitely a game aimed at more hardcore players singleplayer dishes out an amazing campaign as well as scenario missions. You'll notice that in singleplayer the game is easier to run and achieve higher fps.  Multiplayer is a piece of work it really depends whos hosting what gamemode you are playing and if your PC specs are able to handle the stress. Playing gamemodes like Altis Life and King of The Hill you'll notice that you are able to play on nicer graphics settings and achieve higher fps than playing modes like Capture the Island or Cooperative (Invade &amp; Annex). Playing the latter 2 you might find yourself having to run at lower settings and/or have lower fps. This doesn't mean you won't be able to enjoy these gamemodes for yourself it just means all those snazzy jazzy looks and feels won't be high end.  Away from the cons and on to the pros this game is one of the best military sims/sandboxes out there. With ArmA3's many details and functions you can find yourself commanding a squadron of soldiers into battle relaxing on an tropical island or even building your own mission. Whether you are a hardcore or casual gamer this game has got you covered.  All in all I'd give this game a 9/1010
ts fun and amazing if ur looking for militaryshootermuiltplayeropen world this is ur game its worth the money spent10
It's good
This Game is for dedicated gamer for first person and 3ed person shooters. its a highly realistic and srategic game. it simulates real army combat and physics. if you just give this game a chance like i did you will fall in love.
Ill write a review later I'm busy playing !
Great mods great game 9/10
Very Recommended game by youtubers and gamers
eally worth buying. You can go ride go-karts play Battle Royale with friends play Breaking Point with friends play Wasteland with friends. The only problem with the game is when you don't have any friends that have this game to play with. 9/10 from me.11
Buy this game! Download sandbox map! Play with friends! Accidentally kill everyone!
Good game. Worth getting it if you like sandbox fps games.
f you're looking for a tactical and realistic approach to a shooter this is the only way to go. If you don't have the pacience to play a slower paced shooter then you should look the other way. The community keeps the game alive and fresh either with mods missions or even game types. The size of the maps is so big you'll hardly ever repeat anything in the same place. This is a game you won't get tired of the platform just allows for new stuff getting created everyday...  ArmA is a unique experience nothing even compares with it. It's not perfetct it does have its bugs and glitches but in the end  it is worth every penny .10
Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
is a great improvement over Arma 2 and OA this doesnt have M4A1's or M16's but does have the FNX45 Masada and others the vehicles are more futuristic so no ABRAMS or Blackhawks but all of this is fine because you can download mods or get All in Arma to get ported content from the previous Arma games. Over all I think you should get this game and as it says it brings you to WAR!10
ood god the realism in this MILSIM is just incredible! Bullet drop survival and the AI is just great! ARMA 2 was good but this this is amazing! Only thing is the UI is a little hard to adjust to as I am a Black Ops 2 and BF3 and BF4 player as well.  99.7/10010
espite many of its early faults Bohemia Interactive - as well as the always extremely-active ArmA community of modders et al - really pulled the ArmA universe to a whole new level. The graphics are only the beginning of the immersive environment: realistic projectile ballistics (as well as surprisingly detailed terminal ballistic effects) well-done animations (especially of essential combat tasks like reloading) and the variable stance/lean system. Unfortunately there are a few problems that have plagued ArmA since the beginning of time namely the AI. I say this because even after becoming intimately familiar with the game and the teammate command system detailed commands are bulky at best. AI as a whole tends to be relatively oblivious when it comes to medium- and 'crew-served' weapons; the suppressive fire command does absolutely nothing with your machinegunners and autoriflemen and anti-tank gunners apparently forget they have 15 pound rocket launchers strapped to their backs and decide their small arms are the most effective weapons against MBTs. The aerial platforms' damage models could be improved as well (i.e.: losing parts of the aircraft when you clip a tree or wires rather than just exploding) however this would require a lot more work than may be worth it at this point - perhaps later in A3's lifetime. Fortunately to me despite these (at times) fatally annoying flaws (*cough* AI *cough*) nothing in the virtual world comes close to the level of accuracy (both from the vanilla BI platform and the ArmA communities' multiple mods) that  delivers.10
This is not your typical run and gun game. You must take your time to learn the ins and outs. I highly recommend it.
This game took my virginity! i rate this 9 out of 11 because yolo.
ets be honest you didnt buy this game for the story. You bought it for wasteland and Battle Royale.10
This Game is SO realistic it took me 54 hours to get my first sniper kill
ow  is a awesome game but were here to talk about more than the fact its awesome  Graphics are amazing well the way i can run it  can bring someone's FPS to -100 depending on your comp. so if it is lagging i highly suggest you lower the settings down ALOT.  What can you do on : You can do Atlis Life (Alot of Role play it has a bank and cops so there you go) Battle Royale (Hunger Games but in ) Dayz Brecking point ( Dayz Mod) Now about brecking point its a pain just to login to it so i suggest you play Atlis life and Battle Royale And it is a 1rst/3rd person shooter i rather allways be in 3rd person for certin reason's that im not gonna disscuss. There is alot more gamemodes but those are my things. Is it worth the money Depending on your comp. Yes As allways my rateing for this game is 10/10 REMEMBER THIS IS ALL MY OPION SO DO NOT THINK ITS ALL HERE. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME10
reat game Very Good War Simulator also very fun to play with friends. 5/510
Makes me feel insecure about my pc hardware /10
Hopped onto a role playing server and died by flying 30 ft into the air while getting out of a truck. 10/10
Amazing game Great core experiance with full modd support i recomend sixupdater  Some of the best editor and mission making out there ecpecialy with the new zeus tool. Choose Arma for you military sim needs
his game...  It can be seen as a good game. Or one that is terrible.   Most likely what will happen though is that some guy with 7 hours comes along and says it is garbage.  Then there will be that one guy with some 300 hours logged claiming that new players will have trouble adpating to 's engine and game mechanics.  In these reviews there are no middleground so it could make someone feel like they need to log 300 hours to feel like the guy who wrote the review.   My review is written with 60-70 hrs of gametime. Here is My review:   The game has no real competitors and the only things similar to it is Arma 2 and the original Arma. This is what causes that beginning time gap to learn how to play the game. If I were to go and play COD then switch to BF4(I know that they have a good amount of differences in them) I know I can in 2 hours play BF4 as well as I played COD If I had logged the same amount of hours in both of them. Here it's different. Since Arma has huge changes between the modern FPS games like COD and BF then those who are new to the Arma Franchise will have to adapt. For me I didn't adapt as soon as I got the game since I had gotten the game for Altis life(Something I will go into later). It took me around 6 hrs of missions to be effective in combat. By adapting from the Fps games I had usually played I developed better habits in Arma. These habits include slowing myself down going prone to stabalize my gun and to stay with my sqaud. This is what makes Arma so unique. It is a simulator and everything you do actually matters. So heres a breakdown of teh good and the bad:  Good  2 Large maps with great terrain and underwater features  a good selection of weapons and vehicles  Great graphcs  Great Workshop ability  Great Multiplayer Servers(Makes up the other 40% of Arma Users. Stuff like Altis life takistan life adn etc are something other than war)    THE BAD  The graphics could kill your computer  First person mode can get people sick due to the preset settings  First person mode presets can also lower framerate  Cars have bad controls(again can be fixed in the settings)  The 6 hr beginner time gap  The impressions the game gives to people  Overall  8.5/10  Oh.. Did I talk about mods   9/10 :D10
here is no reason to not get this game. If you like Military Shooters this is the masterpiece you were missing from your collection.10
reat game! if you can afford it BUY IT!!!!!!!!!10
This game is not for those who believe Call of Duty and/or Battlefield is 'realistic'. This is as close to realism as you can get without actually going to war. This is a breath of fresh air to anyone who wants an authentic military feel in their games.
his game for real man not for kid10
I don't know what im doing 90% time on the game.
Even though I could only play for a couple days it was a really good game.  9.5/10
 recommend this game to anyone who craves for a slower-paced tactical simulator. About 80% of the time you will spend travelling to the location you need to liberate or scouting the area for hostiles. Even then you are not guaranteed killing anyone. You may get one or two kills if you are lucky. That being said I love this game. I prefer it to Call of Duty or Battlefield because of the realism. The ballistics in this game is possibly the most realistic compared to most shooters nowadays.  Many of the people who play the game are either in the military or military enthusiasts. That being said prepare for the annoying 'support our troops' people. However if you can get past them you will appreciate the game for what it is. A lot of the combat is mid to long range (unlike most modern FPS's). You will often witness your teammates shooting at 'nothing' only to zoom in with binoculars and realize they're shooting at hostiles a kilometer away. The game requires you to be on your toes most of the time and to be prepared for nothing.  In the 5 hours I played this game (at the time of writing this) I experienced about 4 or 5 unique events that you could only experience in a multiplayer game. I was in a helicopter that had the engine shot from an enemy machine gunner. We crash landed in the middle of nowhere only to be ambushed by enemy troops. Myself the pilot and two other guys were able to take out all the enemies and request evacuation from another helicopter pilot. One of our guys was hit and was on the ground bleeding so a medic arrived at the scene and patched him up as well.  That may not sound exciting to a gamer that's used to the arcade-style shooters but the accurate physics and realism in this game is what makes it exciting. The very fact that this event occurred is rare (it only happens once in a lifetime maybe if you're lucky).  Anyways enough chatter. Buy this game if you enjoy tactical shooters that have an emphasis on teamwork (ie. working as a squad as a battallion and as an army).10
http://www.twitch.tv/actabunnifoofoo
 usually am the pilot in games so that is what I will rwview.  It is awesome! I must often tell my nervous passengers not to jump out of the helicopter because I fly so low. A while back helicopters exploded very easily however they have made improvments to helicopters. I have even learned to autorotate so the whole team dosn't die if the engine is damaged.  I have not used any type of special cotroller yet. I have a very old joystick which I tried using one time but it is very unresponsive which is surely due to it being probably 15 years old. Normally I just use the keyboard to fly around and do very well. Remapping the keys to fly is a must. There are some crazy default keybinding layout for helicopters.  Flares work well. A lot of times you will be fired at in the air by enemies and flares will help guide rockets astray. You must still try to dodge them however because not all rockets 'seek' you. Some are still just simple rockets and will still hit you. Mostly for my experience online you do not have too many rockets fired at you while on the ground usually just while flying. So flying low across the ground to a landing spot is recommended behind trees especially. Following roads up to a landing spot is good because you will avoid unloaded physical objects that can wreck you but just make sure you don't fly right through a town or the AO doing this.10
Better than Arma 2.
Where is my Deluxe Edition Extra content that I paid for???
robably the world's most realistic Military FPS. So many tactics can be used at any given moment along with an endless arsenal of weapons and vehicles. Create your own story with the scenario editor play with friends in Online retake Stratis in the Campaign or play a custom scenario game. If you like realistic modern shooters that have a squad/platoon system and would rather take orders from players instead of a pushy AI. Then this masterpiece is for you!10
this is one of the best war simulator in the world
pretty sick m8
awsome  what more is there to say
Hmm.. What can i say about ? I mean.. i can't describe it because of its awesome epicness³. Just buy it and u will never play another game ;)
its a noice game
mazingly beautiful graphics and Breaking Point is one of the best game mods I've played. I really enjoy the King Of The Hill game-play in  too.  The only downside is you need a very rad computer mainly CPU to play this without horrible lag.  I recently upgraded to a 4th gen i5 and a GTX 750ti which has greatly improved the playability of this game.10
I recomend this game if you have people to play with.    'Chicken Simulator 2015' 11/10 IGN
its a good game the only problem is  life dosent work unless you have tons of mods
The SP missions are exciting and very challenging. I haven't played online yet.
Currently my favourite game. Anyone looking for a realistic shooter needs to play this game. Also the modability makes it a game with unlimited options! Definitely check out all the mods that are out there. Worthy successor to the original Operation Flashpoint.
This 'military sim' has my shrek of approval. I give it 5 thumbs up!
ameplay if fantastic maps are fantastic missions are fantastic wasteland is fantastic mods are fantastic rp life sucks.    8.5/1010
Nuff said in the pictures
he closest you'll ever get to real combat in a video game. Be prepared for slow paced gameplay compared to other shooters (because that's how it is in real life). Once past the initial learning curve  provides some of the most rewarding gameplay out there. Community mods increase this game's value tenfold.10
his game is unvelievebly fun! I have spent nearly 1500 hours playing  thousands of servers are available for a range of user-made game modes.  BI has done a great job with the development tools available for  as well as the fully-accessable wiki which provides all of the commands for scripters and developers they've given the user thousands of ways of developing their own gamemodes mods maps anything.  I would highly reccomend this game to anyone into FPS and 3rd Person Shooters the userability in this game is outstanding.  (p.s - if you join a server and its laggy its not  its most commonly your graphics settings (this game is CPU heavy) or its caused by bad optimization of the mission which has most probably been user-made)  10
This game is epic Mainly doing this for the badge.
his game is a must have if you like MilSim. It is very realistic and has a great community. Wasteland is for those who enjoy killing everyone in sight even if they are wearing the same camo. Deathmatch is meh. CoOp Missions are some of the best game modes. If you are new to the series check this out The controls are a little strange at first but you will grow to love them.10
0/10 would get blown up a good few times again. But in all seriousness this game has a couple of flaws (the performance in online servers is a tad weird at times) this game is one of the best things I've played in a LONG time. You see this game has so much depth it's unbelievable. There are so many weapons and realistic vehicles that are so realistic you feel like you're really on the frontlines of a battlefield. To be honest it's more of a simulator than anything else. It's worth the £20 just for the entertainment value and the laughs you get on some of the online modes. That's not mentioning this is probably the best map in video game history. Don't expect this game to be easy either - elements of tactfullness and patience are very much needed much like a real world frontline scenario! Hands down the best FPS on the market right now; hands down beats any C.O.D. or Battlefield game! PLEASE buy it if you don't have it!10
anted this game for a while but didnt like the price then it was free for the weekend and in sale so i bought it. i wish i had of bought it months ago. its a cracking game absolutely loads to do and the visuals (apart from explosions) are fantastic.  campaign isnt great but it got me used to the buttons and a brief understanding how the game is played.  now online is fantastic wasteland is a brilliant mode pairing up with a couple pals time fly by working together spending 20 minutes just to kill one guy lol   in a real life situation i know id feel safer with a few dudes who play arma then a few trigger happy kids who play cod!  if your not sure whether to get this believe me your missing out.10
AwSome!!!
his is one of the best games I have every played theres so many things to do deffinitley worth the money endless possibilities i have been playing for a year and it just keeps getting better and better. It is a little CPU intensive but as long as you have an I5 I don't think you need to worry there is so many groups clans servers to choose from C:10
o you find yourself angry at the COD or Battlefield for being horrible unrealistic? If you this is the game for you guns tanks planes boats. What more is there to say?10
Addictive game no matter how much you play it there's always something new to do.
his is a great game for anyone with experience with first person shooters. You might not want to buy this as your first FPS game becasue of the steep learning curve and the amount if controls. but after some time it becomes a lot of fun. i have had a lot of good experiences in this game that i dont think i could get from another FPS. It has many cool features that you just cant get from other games like for example the ability to make use of any vehichle around you and use that as an advantage in the field. or maybe get a laser deignator off an enemy body and use that to mark targets for your friends. there is even gamemodes for roleplay. like altis life and  life which can be fun if you like to roleplay with other people. I think the possibilities in this game are endless. you can make your own missions and submit them to the workshop for other people to download and rate etc. I have had more than 500 hrs in this game and i think every one was a lot of fun. 10/1010
i dont own this game
Just buy it! No further information needed
ould reccomend greatly amazing graphics mechanics and everything inbetween10
 got the game while it was free for two days and it was awsome I loved everything about the game but it was a little to graphic for my windows 7. But trust me this is worth 59.99. But make sure your PC can take the graphics.10
he multiplayer is really the ownly selling point for this game but the multiplayer is really fun (depending on the type of server your on)10
 virtual battlefield and simulation experience like no other since 2001 (Op. Flashpoint). And series as Arma continues to evolve with this great yet not perfect title. Enough said.10
this game fun for goofing around and fun cause it has so many modes and servers and big maps and good graphics
ingleplayer: The campaign is dull but at the same time barely cool. (you probably wont touch it)  Multiplayer: Although this game takes quite a tuffy 'pooter to run well on most multiplayer servers than most people have available to them and the  processor usage due to the gaming engine it runs on I've never found a better game than . I've looked into this game for about a year or two before I even got into PC gaming and it became one of my first footsteps into the PC gaming world (aside from WoW when I was like 13 but lets be serious here.) The replayability you'll find in this game holds no bounds. You have a vibrant cultural community and more content then you'll know what to do with...DID I MENTION CONTENT? You've got gamemodes upon gamemodes upon workshop toys to play on and with from Wasteland Altis Life King of the Hill Exile and so so much more. Although the controls WILL take a bit to get used to you wont ever forget. Think this is a military combat simulator? Well it is but it's also practically a flying simulator a helicoptor simulator a life simulator a zombie survival simulator and even a verbal harassment simulator. But let's get down to it kiddos.  ----Pros -This game can be about 40+ other games that you've always wanted and be better. -Precise movements to benefit you in combat (Micro-Stances) -Ballistic physics that work -Beautiful large game -Tons of gamemodes that aren't always 'military' -Hilarious physics that break in the best of ways (there are two terms 'ArmA Logic' and 'ArmA Physics') -The most replayability you'll ever have out of any game TO DATE.  ----Cons -DLC bundle(25USD) is annoying if you don't have it as many servers use the DLC content and you'll be bothered with a popup quite a bit. -Medium to High Performance computer to run it -Physics in the game engine aren't always the greatest of things and WILL screw you over at times (but almost rarely) -MASSSIIIIIVEEEEEE LEARNNNINGGGG CURRRRVVVEEEEEE -Did I mention the learning curve for the controls? -Learning curve -Although the game can be used as a simulator for many things it's FAR from a driving simulator. -Rocks and branchy bushes (You'll know) -The game engine is quite  but no where near unplayable  VERDICT-------  in my opinion is the best game on the market to date with the experience you'll get out of it. Proof? I have 1600+ hours on it and my 2nd place game in my library only has about 400. Some of my best gaming moments in my life came from this game 10/10 would buy again     ..but seriously did I mention the learning curve?10
This game is awsome! its worth that 50-60 dollars or in england pounds but if you like first person shooters and complicated campaigns this game is for you
is an amazing game! This game is great for anyone who likes shooters or RP games. This game is one of the best first person/3rd person games I have ever played. I have played Arma 2 and I have to say  is so much better than Arma 2. The only problems about this games that really game to my attention is... First off glitches they're not too bad but they can get annoying every now and then. Also servers is a big problem there aren't many servers out there for a variety of gamemodes the ones that I commonly see is Deathmatch or Battle Royale Breakingpoint King Of The Hill and some others but other than that this game is really fun and an enjoyable experience for players that are new or old to the 1st/3rd person shooter genre. I really recommend you get this game especially if you're coming from Arma 2 or even Battlefield. Thanks! I hope I helped you out!10
antastic Game!!! It really does need some patches more weapons and animation fixes (Especially with reloading). But other than that if you love extremely hardcore games (AND ONLY HARDCORE GAMES THIS GAME WILL BE BAD IF YOUR GOING TO PLAY IT LIKE COD OR BF) then this is the game for you. Considering the state that its in i'd give it an 8.5/10 . But when the DEV's fix the glitches and animations this game will easily score at least a 9.5/10 for a Military Simulation. It has a very steep learning curve but in 5 hours or so you should get the hang of it :D10
he World´s one and only Military Simulation Game ! If you want an awesome Team-based and realistic Military Simulation this is the only right choice for you !  Nothing for Solo-Player like COD or Battlefield !!! THIS IS NOT KILL ON SIGHT AND ITS NOT AN EGO-SHOOTER OR ARCADE-SHOOTERITS A MILITARY SIMULATION...THERE IS NO SPACE FOR RAMBO´S !!! If you are a lone wolf and think you could kill an enemy squad alone or something...They will show you are wrong. You cant survive more than MAX 3-5 bullets based on your hitzones !   : THIS IS WAR10
he single player campaign despite being released in 'episodes' is one of the most immersive and exciting Single Player games I have played. A wide variety of missions a storyline that that keeps you interested and obvioulsy great locations from both Stratis and the huge Island of Altis too. If single player isnt your thing then there is sure to be an 'infinite' amount of co-op missions made by players and mods for the Multiplayer as well that will always be entertaining. Still doesn't cut it? Learn to use the map editor and create your perfect scenario that you would like to play out in  either by yourself with a mate of with all of your friends if you so desire.   9/10 definitely recommend! Altis was very poorly optimised on release but it has improved a lot since then. Even I can run it on medium/normal with a 560 ti and an i7 2600 at a respectable framerate in most cases.   Hope this helps! See you on the battlefield!10
Great military simulator. Even better with mods that improve immersion.
Great Game.So realistic!
this game is fun for 196.7 hrs.
If you have a Pc that can run this game at atleast medium settings 30fps. Best 60$ you have ever spent.
avorite game in some years definetly recommend it. Lots of content with: Campaign Scenarios  Sector Control Wasteland Battle Royale  Great game however I wish that multiplayer performance lag-wise would be better optimized. 10
he latest in the ArmA series this is the best military simulator out there and it sure does live up to the hype with a fantastic graphic upgrade.  Apart from just upgrading the graphics it has created 2 new maps for you to go crazy on in this sandbox military simulator where quite literally the sky is the limit.   Engaging Close Quarters Combat entertaining infantry combat with a load of other people and AI with vehicles to back you up the amount of scenarios you and your friends can experience is endless due to the thriving community that has come from ArmA 2 and Operation Arrowhead to make these games even better.   Whilst even without any mods this game still lives up to the standard that is expected from Bohemia Interactive in this long running series of military simulator/sandboxes. They added new movement new weapons new vehicles. Whilst no classic weapons like the M4/M16/AR15 series don't make a return along with the AK47/74/74su they are replaced with new weapons that are more towards the future.  The game itself is set in 2035 when the Republic of Altis and Stratis is facing a civil war NATO comes in and attempts to help the AAF in the war against CSAT they are turned on and the AAF teams up with CSAT to destroy NATO forces in this gripping fight between yourself and loads of tough AI.  In this futuristic settings along with new weapons new toys have been added to your arsenal to mess about with. New vehicles include submarine type transport vehicles amphibious armoured personnel carriers and scuba-diving equipment. It all totals up to a crazy sandbox experience with a load of missions and scenarios from the community from Altis Life to Wasteland.10
wesome game but its kinda boring after time withnout mods.10
This is a good game
ought some LSD in Altis Life ran from the cops when they noticed Purple smoke coming from my Truck. And hired a getaway helicopter only to find out I didnt have the Helicopter DLC. I got arrested and went to jail for 1:10:00 minutes. The guy in the Helicopter tried to break me out of jail. I only then realized that u cant get in copilot if u dont have DLC. I am not a wanted fugitive and have 3 bounties of 10million on me.    100/1010
9.5/10  A brilliant game for anyone who wants a realistic* and immersive warfare game. I've been with this game since the alpha and enjoyed every moment.  pros -Long and detailed campaign with a good story -varying multiplayer for all players -large mod base for improving or extending the game -large amount of customization for the player loadout and weapons -immersive and realistic* gameplay -stunning graphics (see cons for exceptions) -extremely large terrains for gameplay  cons -some of the audio is slightly unrealistic such as explosions (can be fixed with mods such as speed of sound pure) -particle effects are a let down for the graphics -there is not a massive amount of weapons available in the vanilla game* (there are many mods which add more weapons to the game)  *personal opinions (some people may disagree with these)
it's an alright game
See youtube videos. Buy game. Join server. Shot from 3000m 10/10
HE best value for money out there Arma is less of a game and more of a platform. There are so many mods and game modes that will see you entertained for hundreds if not thousands of hours.10
esync is real get swallowed by metal fence's and brick walls and rocks resulting in death .......10
ARMA III IS THE MOST AMAZING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED 10/10
est shooter I have ever played all you need is a descent pc.10
Amazing game. Endless game modes with mods and diff types of game play. A must have for FPS lovers. And with the EPOCH mod thousands of hours of fun are to be had.
Awesome cooperative game!
Definitely worth the money. Like I cant say anything else because its 100% worth the money. So many good features.
THE SOUND IS COMPLETLY BROCKEN AND I CANT HEAR ANY THING
mazing game! If you're looking for something actually tactical and team based not just the mindless 'run and gun' arcade shooters like CoD or BF4 then this is your game.   The game also has many mods and different game modes you can experience many similar to those from Arma 210
this game is worth buying. it has good graphics... i dont even have to mention anything everythings awesome with it
he worst score-whoring re-spawning FPS-game ever.   Which makes this the best tactical military sandbox on Steam ever!  10/1010
Would recommend if you have a strong computer. Sounds are vastly improved over Arma II and combat is very great.
It's fun.
mazing Game Love It Can Be Rage Inducing at times but in the end its all for good times and good memories. 10/1010
his game is by far one of the best tactical shooters i have ever played. I love the maps and the way the game feels in the way of how the weapons work the movement and the flow of the game just feel amazing.10
me in the  and call me samantha this is a good game.10
I don't like the vanilla version. The futuristic bs is for COD.The ability to mod the game makes up for the lack of realism most gamers liked about arma 2. Truthfully I feel like I have turned arma3 into arma 2 because of modded content. I give arma3 2 out of 4 stars. If this is real milsim game It should reflect the current time line. I play to kill terrorist not some fictional csat aff bs. If I want to play futuristic milsim I would buy the division or call of duty
One of the best games (if the the best) I've ever played. Was expecting the singleplayer campaign to be a bit longer with a few more missions but it still took me about a 100h to complete! I definitely recommend this game to any fps lover that can put in the time and effort to master the shooting mechanics.
So many great mods and game modes to play with this game.
Joins wasteland server Loots heaps of really good  Falls less than a centimeter Dies  10/10 would fall to my doom again   Disregard my last review of this game. Arma has been shrivled down to a framework for making roleplay gamemodes.  Never have I seen a server that has decent PvP or combat gameplay. The only thing you'll find on the server browser is Tanoa/Altis life or heavily modded DayZ clones that make you download 10gb worth of mods for each server.  This game has too much potential. Are we going to waste it on making RP servers that don't even allow for usage of the great gameplay Arma provides?  I'm still giving this a thumbs up because the game itself is great but the server owner's don't know an existance that isn't roleplay.10
ith a small loan of a million dollars i was able to buy this game.10
So I have played many hours and 'I like it a lot': So have you: Ever wanted to run around while looking at your feet making it look like your sucking your own ? Brake dance? Shoot a guy in the knee and laugh at him because he can't run anymore? Run in to battle in your undies? (Note: there’s a bug that doesn't allow you to go naked) Do a back flip in a chopper? Get into a tank LAV and go down the highway at 100km/h then hit a rock and go flying. And a lot more! Who said this was a war simulator you can play this game your whole life and not need to shoot one bullet? Remember Men Play ARMA! BTW: Lots of people won't like this game because they don't know what to play on it. find what modes you like or make your own!
i LOVE THIS GAME 10/10 I love the guns and items and the user interface that's a big plus way better than arma2 why are u reading this go buy it now im going to buy that's for shore 10/10. :)
One of the best games i've ever played. 10/10 Love it. Will play it for years to come.
People need to get this game
And outstanding multiplayer sandbox game that is so addictive !!! got me playing nothing else :D.... Amazing game &lt;3
est military simulation game ever made since Ghost Recon10
ou know a game is good when you spend more than 50 hours on it on Christmas week totally ignoring friends and family. Opening presents?  that! I'm playing ARMA.10
one of the best games u will play
You want endless fun?  GET THIS GAME
a beautifuly crafted military simulator with endless hours of fun.
This game is by far the best game I ever bought if you like realistic shooter games this is for you.
 give it a 4 star out of 5. It's an improvement over Arma 2 in every way and the way they have inteigrated steam workshop to the game to really customize the depth of the game is amazing.   My one gripe with the game is it's lack of stability. The game runs kind of choppy and slow at points and is buggy now that the APEX expansion is out. I actually cant even access the extension I bought and can't get a straight answer as to why.10
ery glad they had a free to play weekend as well as an awesome weekend sale. Got into boot camp and being a hardcore battlefield player i was hooked immediately. wow i'm looking forward to some really good tacatical game play with my friends.10
ame is great few minor glitches here and there but all are welcome to upload workshop material for co-op campaigns or missions a good game type to play on MM is King of The Hill by Sa-matra where 3 teams are pitted against each other in control of the objective. The DLC that has been brought out has been great the campaign itself was great however I was a little upset that you couldn't Co-Op on the campaign like you could with Arma 2 but hey - GREAT GAME10
 really love this game. There is some glitches though not that much and is very fun to play with friends or teamamates. There are things like role-playing servers where you have to act just like you act in life and another is wasteland which is just trying tu survive. You need to find your stuff and survive I really like this game and I could play it for days striaght without stopping because it's just so fun. Add me as a friend and we could play  sometime  I am always on :)10
aims to be a realistic military/combat simulator a goal that is well achieved with very few drawbacks. I would definitely reccommend this game to anyone looking for a truly realistic First/Third Person Shooter or Military Simulation. If you're expecting this to be like Battlefield you're wrong. If you expect this to be like Rainbow Six: Siege you're wrong. If you ecpect this to be like CoD why are you even here? I'd probably most closely compare this game to Squad but with 2 maps that are much larger than any of those in Squad and it's more complicated. There are several interesting game types in  however most are simply overshadowed by the sheer mass of servers running Invade and Annex and Arma Life. Some things I would reccommend to newcomers are that you have a mic and when joining a server online you find out their Teamspeak or other 3rd party chat program server because people will yell at (or kick) you for using global voice chat on most servers. I would also reccommend checking out some guides on youtube as there is a very minimal tutorial system that could really use some work.  I would definitely give this game an 8/10  It successfully achieves its goals of an accurate military simulation however the lack of a good tutorial and the fact that many excellent gamemodes are overshadowed by larger servers that only focus on 2 or 3 game types definitely takes away from the score.10
ne of the most realistic games i have ever played with one of the best comunity out there!  I recommend this game to anyone who is thinking of buying it10
 is my go to game... always new mod coming out and this make for free amazing content
his game has it's ups and downs. It has greatly improved since its official release as it was extremely dissapointing (lack of Altis servers Altis servers had no guns or vehicles or rarely any no mods campaign was not available at start (I did not care but to many they cared) and many optimization and bug issues)). All issues have been pretty much addressed and fixed but there are issues that can still be fixed as they include an issues tracker in which you can report issues and recieve feedback from developers and users. Forgetting the few issues it has it is still a great tactical military simulator that you can enjoy with yourself your clan or your friends.  This game definetly became an all-time favourite for me as the graphics look beautiful even if you play on low and gameplay is quite realistic to any other game.10
Super sereal kill bots simulator.
Could be 3 million times better but its still fun with a couple of mates.
n amazing FPS Action Multiplayer game. With Sick Graphics!   a game like no other buy the game and experience Ground Combat Air Combat Artillery and so much more! It also comes in with a group of Gamemodes like Wasteland Epoch Mod Overpoch Mod Altis Life  Life etc.  Buy this game! You won't regret it.  10
Great military shooter/simulator. Mods are awesome. Overall a great buy!
ood game really funny if u can figure out how to play it. Worthwell to try it !10
I had played 280 hours of  when i found out about king of the hill.Now i play the real .
is a very realistic game It has many different posabilities.  The pros are the graphics and style of gameplay. However the downfall is the dlcs which must be purchased to unlock all the game content. I would have preferredfor it to be in 2 different games like arma 2 and arma 2 OA.10
got in helicopter with team to raid enemy base.  attempt to open helicopter inventory. falls out. dies.  Runs 7 miles to nearest car and drives 20 KM  10/10 would fall from helicopter again
Nice game! King of the Hill &lt;3 If you want to play a game with friends together and you want to play with tactics...this game is awesome for that.
ow. Great game. In other campaigns I loved to get in action and fight but in the  campaign I'm very cautious. Now I'm hoping to get to my destinations safely. Great game. I love how real it is and how the game makes you feel like you are in these situations!10
Awesome Game! Breaking Point is a great MOD for the game as well! Well worth your time and money!
I enjoyed this game.
this game is awesome buy it. you won't regret
ery fun game! It takes some getting used to and you need to know strategy in order to prevail. It doesn't take long to learn the game either. This game is quite realistic with its weaponry vehicles and physics. A workshop in this game means more ways you can experience it allowing you to play player-made missions player-made game modes player-made whatever really. You can also install mods from a website called Armaholics which adds a higher score in my rating to the game.10
an your PC handle the awesomeness of ? If so put this awesome game in your library! (Get a steam key for 30 bucks on green man  gaming.com) 10
f you like Arma 2 then you'll have fun playing bumper cars on king of the hill ;)10
f you are into military simulation and have a bunch of friends you can have some fun for the rest of your life!10
his is undoubtably my favorite game ever. This game IS NOT like arma 2! This game is not so realistic that when you play it your head wants to explode. This game is basically a more realistic battlefield 4. But if for some reason you get bored of all of the combat and explosions in the normal game try some altis life or maybe some wasteland! The final thing I want to say is I would buy this game over any game in 41 game library (PERIOD!)10
Massive Improvement since the last game which I've been playing for about 4 years.
he Campaign: Firstly I must address the 'campaign' in this game. I have finally bit the bullet and played it. I did not enjoy it for a single second.  The AI seems to be 10x smarter within the campaign. You would think this is a good thing because it would pose more of a challenge but no this is not the case. The AI seems to have X-RAY Aimbot and Sixth sense all in one. At times I am completely hidden and they will spot me instantly not missing a single bullet and kill me within seconds. The First mission of Adapt is by far the worst thing Bohemia has ever created. You are one man vs. over 40 foot soldiers and 1 annoying chopper. You can pick up ammo from dead bodies that are generously placed about the map but that won't do you any good once you are getting shot from every single spot you could possibly imagine. I cannot fathom Bohemia Interactive's thought process behind this thing they have the audacity to call a 'Campaign'.  I advise anyone to steer clear of it if you ever decide to give it a go. Its not worth the 5 hours you will put into it. I regret every second. -- The Editor: By far the best thing about . Being able to put your own spin on the game creating the missions you want to play. Just a little note: ANY user made campaign is better than Bohemia Interactives 'Campaign.' The editor is what has led to me putting over 200 hours into this game; Its so fun to create a scenario to play your way.  If you have a desire to create your own missions and even campaigns  is the game for you. It does have a bit of a learning curve if you want to add tasks complex waypoints your own music etc.  -- The Multiplayer: I have also put a huge chunk of time playing the multiplayer. Whether its the ANNEX mission or Wasteland the muliplayer of  offers so much to do. The multiplayer is one of s best features. You can play online with I would say over 50 people at times on the vast 100km+ Altis and Stratis. Depending on the mission/game mode you play you can easily waste away 20 hours a week on the multiplayer. -- Graphics: This game has beautiful graphics. An enormous improvement over its predecessor  has luscious environments. Whether its at the depths of the ocean floor or running up to the nearest hill  has amazing graphics that you will notice straight away. The maps are so detailed and colorful with plentiful vegetation that makes the huge map of Stratis and Altis feel alive. Realism: This game is the best Military shooter to date. If you are an avid fan of Call of Duty/Battlefield this game is no where near comparable. Its aimed to be the most realistic military sim in the market.  --  -- Overall: I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys military simulators and doesn't mind a shooter being slow paced. This game requires a lot of patience. My final verdict is 8/10. This game is way better than its predecessors but still lacks a lot of things.  10
ncredible game love every bit of it it's worth the money!! The AI are better than what I experienced with Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead for sure the physics are incredible!!!10
Well what I like about it is that it is a Military Simulator and that it has so many different game modes. But what I really hate about it is that the price is to steep. I would recommend lowering the price down to $30-$40 or somewhere in between for about a week. That would really boost sales and I know I will buy it.
IT'S NOT A ORDINARY SHOOTER. IT'S A REAL WAR IN YOUR COMPUTER!!!
his game blew my mind. It is hard as hell but fun at the same. It's nothing like CoD or some easy  like that. The game where you actually have to concentrate on what you are doing. Rating 10/1010
I don't even own this game. lel
ood game. Played the life mod. Sold some narcotics became mayor then got arrested for j wlaking.10
 have over 500 hours on this game and I enjoyed every single minute. Even when you finish the campain the mods the community make are even better. So much to do in this game10
Ima be honset. Im only here for the Dayz mods
great game with excellent potential to keep adding worlds
and they said 16 fps wasnt playable
Love The Game It's The Ultimate Tactical Shooter.I Reccomend to buy deluxe
Now with bipods and sniper rifle grade caliber LMGs. Weapon Resting/10
eccomended for: people who like tactical realism  not recomended for: peopole who like fps games that dont simulate the army like COD10
he most realistic war game you'll ever find. Played it during the free trial now if I only had the money to buy something this awesome!10
This game is really good.
t's an incredible game I have over 200 hours invested into this and I don't regret a single one I am part of an  Realism unit and it makes it even better. The online multiplayer depending how many people there is and where the server is located may cause a lag every now and then but isn't bad at all. I run this game on a laptop Lenovo Ideapad Y510P with a GT 755m graphics card and run it at 1080p medium to high settings with all the fxaa and such turned as low as possible or off I get an average of 28-40 fps (dips to 18 with online explosions going on). So my point is this game is very well optimized for lower end nvidia cards.10
Wonderful game. heavily moddable by the community. Would reccomend this for the simluator aspect. its full on immersive gameplay and fire fights.
best military sim ever!
ow... So much fun. So tacky So buggy So laggy :311
reat shooter requires a bit mid-high end PC to run. Great game modes on top of an already great engine.10
uch an amazing game especially for serious gamers!10
Install the AI helper and C2 Command Mods... download DUWS Campaign ...  Sell all my crappy Counterstrike fingerpaint guns...  Never play another FPS...
yersh das is gud
rmA III is a military sandbox game aiming towards realism and authenticity. ArmA III thrives in these aspects. ArmA III does however lack in official content. It seems to me that your enjoyment is based on a few simple factors: your ability to distinguish quality community made content you joining a quality community or playing with a couple of friends and finally your ability to work as a team with those friends to accomplish those missions. The biggest standout missions are the official support modules and the cummunity made DUWS.10
THIS GAME IS GOOD I PLAY IT ALL DAY
An game that turns in to a timemachine when you play it. Lots of content and gameplay. A must buy!!!
It reminds me of games with guns. It is a good game with guns.
Must have for any ARMA fan
reat modern warfare simulator that is completely brutal and unforgiving make sure your PC can run the game before you buy as it does have reasonably high requirements10
Really good game imo. Needs more room for mods.
Outrageous war simulator !  10/10
trong aspect of competative and imursive gameplay. It's really good superbly realistic. I'd strongly recommend trying  out for the Mods such as Breaking Point among others whilst checking out the custom campaigns/missions.  Or even try and create your own to share!10
kinda boring but ya know whatever  5/10 wouldnt play again l0l ecks dee
 truly amazing game that lets you do anything you want. No where in any other game will you get the type of epic moments that you find in . The moment where your squad of four men are running to assault a town RPGs are screaming past the crack of gunshots is everywhere and just as you think your about to be killed an A10 type aircraft screams overhead and destroys the entire town. No need to assault anymore.  The base game itself is very good. It has bugs but I personally rarely find them. Playing on invade and annex servers is a lot of fun but the real joy is playing in a clan with mods. Mods add so much to the game that it feels totally different. Arma is weird because it feels so much more detailed then other games but the detail stops just shy of being amazing. You can do so much more then in other games but you feel like you should be able to do more. This is how mods help. They add guns vehicles gameplay radios literally everything. Often to they feel just how you would imagine it would feel in real life.   I would totally reccomend it to anyone who likes battlefield but feels like there is so much that battlefield is missing.   (Some mods I would reccomend are Community Base Addons (Needed for nearly all mods) ACE3 (Adds so much its hard to explain. Way detailed medical systems and tons of gameplay feature.) RHSUSAF and RHSAFRF. (Adds tons of US and Russian weapons vehicles armor stuff.) AllInArmaTerrainPack. (Adds tons of great maps.) And lastly my personal favorite DARS HMMWV. (This adds something that Arma really lacks. A medium class vehicle that is heavily armored and fast. This is the quintessential HMMWV. Armored turret armored doors bulletproof windows. Its Amazing.10
I don't even have the game but it's allowing me to write this.   I win.
 nice simulator. Unlike other games that try to give a 'Warfare' experience but instead give you a stupid CQC stage in this game it is 'Do or Die' you must team up but you can give it a try to being solo of course it will NOT be like Call of Duty or Medal of Honor it will be... an unique close-to-real warfare experience.  The game has few guns but they are unique and can make a difference. The variants are extended making it a huge library of choices you can have. The bullets have an unique rendering and you can have tracers (Red Green.) which can be seen and can help to tell a nearby teammate where the enemy is. The vehicles are decent most are sluggish and it does not really give you a civillian feeling but it gives out most of the Military feeling.  Many servers to play in with different modes: Altis Life Co-op Zeus and so on. You can find a game mode you want and with the huge quantity of modifications existing around Steam and the internet you will certainly never stop playing unless tactics or marksmanship isn't your thing.   9.5/1010
Is very good game. Lot of ruski. 
layed this game for a little under 500 hours now. Single player has an interesting enough story but I wouldn't consider it an adrenaline pumping experience more so than a challenaging one this game is realistic brutal even at times. You will die a lot from enemies you weren't even sure were there but lets be honest none of us bought this game for it's single player.   Multiplayer is where the fun is it's sometimes equally as brutal as the single player but 10x the fun this game has a strong and dedicated online community of modders scripters and map makers it's is incredibly versatile and has countless game modes and hours of fun. I have 200+ games in my steam libriary and this is the one I come back to every time for more.  Join a gaming community/clan and you'll be hooked. Some good servers to try out include: DOGB and Scarlett Insurgency both great servers.10
Great game in graphics and gameplay aspects. Mods are awesome too. It's a shame that the optimization drives so many players away
y favorite game. I've played This series Sense Operation Flash point cold war Crisis. Very modable realistic and plain ole addictive.10
Amazing game! Have so much fun playing!!
reat great fun. This is the ULTIMATE military simulator. And the mods and community developed missions add only more to it.   Highly recommended to any serious war gamer who's not looking for a FPS style shooter like COD or Battlefield.10
Mod's. Mod's. The things that make the game good. Oh and did I bring up the part where there selling us DLC Just to add some  go-karts and some half  helis? Well yeah.  off with DLC and just leave us alone. 'You MUST buy the DLC to use this go-kart' Are you ing kidding me?
Good game. Similar to South Park The Stick of Truth
lmost 2 years later still 60 dollars.   0/60 dollars left in my wallet 10
imply AMAZING! Recommended for shooter veterens with a GOOD GFX CARD:   take place in a fictional war a few years from now at the time of writing it takes place on a large island Stratis.  This game does NOT dissapoint and is even better than ARMA II and critically acclaimed Operation Arrowhead. The pinnacle of warfare simulation from fighting with chickens (Using the simple Editor) or all out combined-arms ARMED ASSAULT!10
 really recommend this game because of its nice graphics great Singleplayer/Multiplayer. I got the  Limited Deluxe Edition for $5547. It contains  a map of Altis and Stratis an awesome keycard ARMA: Cold War Assault a keyboard layout a digital soundtrack a digital tactical guide digital maps and all DLCs. For its price it is just a bargain. Buy it and you won't regret! :)10
One of the best games I have ever p[ayed I love this game
its a lot of fun especialy if you love military tactical and realistic games its FPS and TPS it contains divers paratroopers airforse infantry sniper aormourd vehicals I RECOMEND THIS GAME
The best military simulator ever made
his game is great for those players who wants more than just running around shooting people in cod of battlefield.  is an extremely well made militairy simulator which gives you multiple choises of gamemodes and hours of intense firefights. you can go on multiplayer with you and your crew or go in a free for all deathmatch in Battle Royale.   personally  is my favorite game and definetly recommend people to try this out. the campaign has a really good story solid multiplayer servers a well made Editor to make your own missions.   it could use a few fixes on terrain(if you are far away from someone the map tends to glitch and show flying objects) and maybe a little improvement on animations but this game truly is one for the books.   Bohemia Interactive Well Done :D10
Left my friends behind in a bank robbery in a ATV 10/10
So I got Global Banned for no reason... K
here is really no way of explaining this game to anyone who hasn't played it. It's awesome. It's fun. It's total freedom. It's a community. It's dedication. It's tons of bugs and glitches. It's the thing you want to do with your friends on a friday night. It's blowing  up cruising with technicals and flying in helos. It's at the same time realism and make-believe. It's frustratingly hard at times. It's long intervals of doing nothing. It's modding modding and more modding. It's FPS drops. It's only limited by your imagination. It's even more awesomeness. Hell enough talk! Buy the the godd*mn game!11
Yes in very good fun
reat game especially the altis life! Arma is the type of game that puts FPS RPG and etc. all together and smashed into one great game!!!! Best game ive ever seen!11
most bad  game ive ever played
 recomend this game to all you military sim fans or military fans regardless it is a slpendid game will keep you up for hours!11
is a ridiculously complicated military simulator which includes 7 buttons just to look around (that is if you're too special to use the mouse like everyone else). You can play through a bunch of single player scenarios which subject you to taking down the odd bad guy while knowing that a single stray bullet could end your life. These scenarios are all pretty much the same move on to the next town take out the five random guys that are wandering around armed with assault rifles then repeat. It's multiplayer that makes this game shine a bunch of modded servers like the immensely popular 'Altis Life' mode in which you can play as a civilian or cop. As a civilian you'll buy your drivers license set off to a life of adventure get robbed stripped naked and kneecapped before being abandonded in the desert. In your next life you'll probably head over to the cocaine field to try and make some easy drug money right? Wrong. As you fill your pockets with unprocessed cocaine (which look suspiciously like rotten cabbages) you'll likely run into a group of like-minded rebels who will make it their business to brutally kill you and take all of your items which you worked so hard for. Then you respawn with nothing and do it all again. As a cop you'll try to stop this from happening but you'll probably just taze the wrong guy run him over then try to pretend like you never did it. You'll brutally murder a bunch of people completely on accident that is to say you pull a guy over for speeding he annoys you so much that you shoot him with your tazer. Then he has a bad reaction to the tazer and the next thing you know you're cleaning up a dead body.  Honestly do I need to say anymore?11
Bought this game on sale for $33 and was not dissappointed. Ive played the second one and this one is just 10x better. Once my exams are over im going to get so many hours on this amazing game! :D This is the story for my first day in Altis life...  I join a nice server which seemed to have nice people and they seemed to beonly rude to the cops. I am invited into a little group by this one guy to have some fun with.. 20 minutes later im in the back of a truck with a guy holding a gun to my face and im  my pants here.... So they take me into a hideout where they make me sing for them and then they kill me. As i wait for a medic im being t-bagged by like 10 people which is not cool. Once the medic came they killed him too and started t-bagging him. I then respawned a new man with a horrible past :(  Great game overall :D 10/10
best Military simulation game ever!!  10/10!
can drag butt across a firefight    11/10 best miltary sim
y team died. I was all alone. I had managed to kill many of the enemy. When the path to the objective seemed safe and clear I made a run for it.  *BOOM* A grenade launcher shot blew up right next to me.  I fell out of my chair in fear and had to take off my headset to make sure I was still alive.  10/10 would cry again 11
PDATE - Mar 26 2016 Years have past. Friendships forged and broken shattered. Days worth of hilarious moments overwhelming fight scenarios and rediculous outcomes. Insane mods and an ultra realistic feel when used on an overpowered PC. After years of playing this game I can finally give the ultimate review. This game has the most potential of any game ever created. With a dev company that encourages unlimited freedom with modding the community makes this game what it is. ArmA is not played for what ArmA is out of the box. ArmA is played for what it's crafted into once it's released into the wild. Gigantic maps that are indistinguishable from dev crated maps. Insane aircraft clothing weapon and gameplay mods give you the most realistic experiences from military sims to zombies over-the-top interactive role play to go-kart racing. This game literally has the potential to deliver anything that people are willing to spend time on. Servers that allow you to buy pick sell and smoke weed and even dive and excevate ship wreckages. You can operate submerines fly jets and helicopters play as a police officer be a bandit a priest preaching the teachings of Jesus (or Satan whichever) or even play laser tag. Some servers let you grind your little heart out earning in-game money to buy expensive items in a living thriving world with thousands of other players robbing and grinding for themselves making gangs or bounty hunting murderers played by real-life players making real decisions. You can kidnap those peaople blindfold them fly them to an island force them to watch a sunset while they sing Cher to you just before you put a bullet in the back of their head.   At the heart of this game it is a stunningly boring Military Simulator filled with choppy mechanics stale dialogue and very AI driven missions. But when the multiplayer tab is clicked this game turns into an endless list of dramatically different gaming experiences. Wasteland King of the Hill Battle Royale DayZ/Epoch Altis/Stratis Life Gun Game MilSim Survial Hardcore Air Racing Go-Kart Racing Skydiving...it just never ends. You will never in your life be more challanged to learn the control layout for a game. There is a seriously complicated keyboard layout for this game. Oh you want to crouch? Choose one of the 5 different crouching positions. You think you know how to fly a helicopter in a video game? You naive child....buy this game fly for 30 minutes and report back. Very very few people can master flying in this game. You might as well take real flying classes...it's the only other thing you'll experience that's as close.  This game will retain a thumbs up. Years later there is nothing else like it. The choppy unpolished mechanics that act up sometimes have nothing on the ridiculously over the top amount of control you have in the game. BE WARNED!!! This game is SUPER SUPER heavy on your CPU and GPU. Example: I now have a i7 5960X ($1100) and dual 980 Ti's ($650 ea) and still bounce down to as low as 28fps in very active situations. Given these are on servers with 110+ people with insane amounts of activity in a smaller area it is still astounding that this PC would be affected by it at all. It just shows you how insane this game really is. I can't be too dramatic that was Ultra settings I am referring to.  When it's all said and done. You need to be hardcore gamer enough to tough through the first 100 hours being confused overwhelmed terrible and awkward. You will need to learn how to game in many different ways. It is expensive and will always be expensive (until A4). This game drops to $30 on big sales so wait for a season sale. If you say 'I want to save the money but I really want to play this' than you will be another victim...sucked into the world of ArmA. This game is to 'simulators' what Counter Strike is to First Person Shooters. It's a different league. It's a buy.     ORINIGAL POST - Dec 31 2014 Although the reliability of certain game mechanics and functionality is far from optimal you're forced to cater to the games faults making it that much more gratifying to master. Modded servers are unreliable at best when servers are filled to the brim. Accidentally falling from a 2 1/2 step will kill you. Sometimes you get stuck in objects like walls and floors. Sometimes items disappear from your inventory and occasionally your inventory just isn't there it's gone. Sometimes sometimes a bunch of assclowns ddos the modded servers to frustrate the people playing. Sometimes.....sometimes ArmA sucks hard really hard. It's bad enough to where at times it turns you off to gaming in general and makes you rethink your hobbies. Sometimes it makes you regret building a computer just to handle its heavy processing load and having your heart torn out when it takes 48mins to join your favorite server for it to never happen. But then I remember ArmA is intensely intricate. Things can be done and scenarios can be played out only on ArmA. This is a big boys game taking patience and intelligence.   You buy this I guarantee that you will hate life 40% of the time you play it.   You don't buy this you'll regret it for the rest of your life.  10/10  *ps: dat altis life doe11
emember folks suppressing fire does not suppress.  10/10 would suppress again.11
oin us on our server We have 1 server up going to get more  Website:  www.adkgamers.com  Teamspeak:  TS.adkgamers.com 11
 will quote a good friend of mine;  'Steam winter sale FTW. ARMA is 50% off again - which makes it priced about right given the ery required to make it work all snazzy.'  Best Arma review ever. If you can run the gauntlet this game is brilliant. If you expect to download something and have it work best wait awhile. 11
 tried to go up some stairs but I fell through and died very realistic army simulator I have to say. In fact this game is more realistic than real life. As a result I have learnt several new skills from the game to use in my non virtual life. The first of which would be to undoubtedly be wary of stairs every since I played this game I have never died in RL while going up stairs.  Another skill I have gained while playing life mods is learning how to make and sell drugs. I would be rich by now if I lived in Altis but im saving for a plane ticket so it won't be long. There isn't enough time to explain every single skill I have learnt from this game but I think even just that one example of surviving stairs is enough to justify buying the game.   I cannot recommend this game enough who knows how many times it has saved my life. 10/10 GOTY all years.11
 reasons to buy ArmA III.  1. I looked at the horizon and saw a Hemmt going to space I had to double-check if I wasn't playing any space related games.  2. A guy hitted the brakes and got thrown out of his car.  3. A medic was driving on the mainroad I heard his sirenes when suddenly BOOM an offroad flew through the sky a moment later.  4. Freaking people using Go-Karts as rocket proppelant.  100/10 Altis Space Program11
his is an AMAZING Game with many game modes a bit of d-sync but its amazing i love the multiplayer and so many mods import mods to mods the compleastly change the game and need  as a button Altis Life  Is a fun multiplayer mission you can join the Altis Police Department (APD) oor join the Rebelion ! and if you are a fan of mods  Life will be the mod for you (still work in progress for 2014) And well the missions and the: Helping You Out Mission thats just the cherry on the cake for this game i recomend you buy it whiel its in a sale or just buy it anyway thanks for reading Enjoy The Game11
ove it Altis life rolling around with the clans always a good time when coppas stop a car filled to the top full of heroin XD11
I robed someone in my underwear then another guy in an underware came and arrested me.  -10/10
This review is for a badge but this is still a GREAT GAME!
Its a good game WAY better then arma 2 and the bunys OHHH THE BUNNYS they dont move 20000000000000KM/s any more so perpare to shoot the little buggers.  My first day on altis life Got a car did some salt Second day Drove the car into a fence at 10 km/s blew up Thrid day Ran over a admin and got banned.
ltis life in a nutshell:  -Takes 150000$ out of his atm to go buy a helicopter -Gets stopped and robbed all my money on the road to the airport -Goes back to the copper mine to earn money -Gets stopped and robbed by a kid admin except i already got robbed before so i had 0$ -Asks me if i could drive him somewhere -i insult him and i drive off  -'Kicked by admin reason: being rude'  10/10 would get robbed again11
I thought a snake was going to bite me so i jumped up got shot in the face somehow lived only to be killed by APB. 11/10 the chem lights are pretty.
reat game but the people are very hostile watch a few gameplays before playing you will more than likely get rekt otherwise11
n excellent MilSim the only downside is that it has a very steep learning curve making it hard to get started.11
ello Community   is in my opinion one of the best games I ever played. You have so many options how you can play this game. You want.. Survival.. RP.. PvP.. PvE..  give it all to you. So if you ask me you should buy this f*cking game and play the shiit out of it.   Greetings Zadary!11
Just buy a tank and you will love it
Really Like this Game its Really like a Sandbox Simulation and you can mod it how you want. I still play it after 400h and I'm still motivated. Really good game.
o you love 10 FPS? Do you love bushes that can blow up trucks? Do you love buying DLC that is overpriced? THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!  Welcome to  a game that can give you hours of fun while making you ask yourself why you paid $60 for the game and $15 for the DLC. This game will give you so many funny memory about how you drive on a rockwall with a tank and exploded and hit a bush with a truck and your wheel broke.  I have a top of the line graphics card processor and internet but I still can't paly this game on high/ultra and get about 25 FPS.  Best war simulator 2014.11
ou think you gonna shoot  in this game? You dont. You walk you run. This is running simulator.11
Truly one of the most visually realistic games I've ever beheld. Plus the modding community has raised it's replay value to the maximum value.
well.... if you like being shot on a server my your own team for getting into the the wrong heli then this game is for you but it is very good to play with friends
Too much water! -IGN
f it fits I sit11
I very much enjoy this game. I do however feel base  is lacking in content and could do with alot more polishing up too.  Luckily there are very many community made mods/ the DLC's that fill up this lack of content and can give you many hours of fun SP and MP gameplay :)
Best game ever. My fav part is altis life &lt;3
 was half way through a very long operation which a friend created and my TV Remote slipped and fell on my keyboard I threw a grenade reloaded went to prone and opened my backpack in all one hit. Then I ran up a slight incline and was fatigued we were then contacted from the south and a turned to see a squad. My CoD experince thought 'Huh four guys easy!'. I soon came to realise that even anybody can kill you in this game with ease a few shots down range at me and I was to shakey to even locate my target in my sights. I got shot in the head and ragdolled down a hill. The last save point was 20 minutes before this. I decided to try a campaign mission where you are alone with a guy in a forest. I was following him close behind and he stepped on a mine and killed us both. Turns out you're not meant to be close to this guy. I played again and kept very far away from him. I stepped on a mine this time and died. A brutal shake-em-up with a massive sandbox to blow things up in. You're not even safe in the scripted events.11
rom the perspective of a player that hasn't experienced the previous 2 ArmA's this game is great! It's provided something that I've wanted for a long time; a sandbox army based mod-able campaign! The graphics are lovely and customization is very vast. The DLC is actually worth it for once and I cannot wait for more to come out!  Very Good game Get it if you like combat!  - 10/1011
you have to play whith friosed if funer that way
Great gameplay. Shitiest UI out of any ing game!
Really nice game make sure that you do have the. Recommended specs since if you dont your disk percentage goes 0-100 real quick. no pun intended nice game 100% love it
he hot-doggiest game your butt will evr experience in its whole lifetime! Gun play is great and if something ain't for you then visit the workshop!11
I could not find the god damned cake!
is an awesome intense and realistic shooter ( besides the fact that you run for 10 seconds and then your character starts to waddle around)  8/1011
Two simple words.... ING AMAZING
Ruined my life.  10/10
King of the Hill ruins my life.  11/10
YOU THINK THIS IS A FUTURE ENDEAVOR? ITS NOT ITS JUST NO  YOU IT ISN'T
Can we just take 3 minutes to appreciate this game...?   Thank you.
its a game on steam 11/4
retty good I mean I jumped off a crate and broke both my legs but great experience.11
ossibly the most realistic military game with extreme replayablility. I don't regret a single cent I spent on this game worth everything I Yianni is a F_A_G for it and more!11
Its fun alone and whit friends.
kip to the bottom for a quick overview of this review.  Gameplay: When this game works it truly shines. Overall the game feels just a lot more tight than the previous ArmA games. The camera does not have that weird movement feeling anymore and is replaced by a normal first person camera. The gunplay feels pretty similar though sometimes the hitboxes of enemies feels way off. It is a little more user friendly and less clunky than the other games. Scuba diving looks gorgeous and is a welcome addition. This is still a really complicated game and will take many hours to master. All the customization options are still here and the raw number of weapons vehicles and attachments is stunning. The inventory is ever so slightly streamlined which makes it a lot easier to navigate it without losing any functionality. Beware though the “G” key is now grenade not gear! The modding community is very active and tons of content is being produced all the time. The base campaign is semi nonlinear and is so far tons of fun and a hell of a lot less buggy than ArmA 2’s. This game as an absolutely mind boggling amount of content. 8/10  Sound: Much better than ArmA 2’s. The radio chatter almost sounds normal finally. The gunfire sounds pretty average actually most of the sound effects are pretty average. However sound effects in the distance sound neat. Hearing the gunfire from a battle far away is always cool as well as far away explosions. 6/10   Graphics: This is a beautiful game. As always the draw distances are jawdropping. The characters look a lot better and most of the objects look equally good. Trees and other vegetation look freaking awesome. For me though the lighting has been the biggest improvement. Seeing the sun poke through branches in trees has never looked so good. I wish this game ran just a little faster and that it utilized a little more of my system resources. I am above the recommended specs for this game and still only get about 40 FPS with most settings turned to high. (Not ultra) 9/10  Story: For this kind of game a story is really not necessary and yet we are treated to a halfway decent one! It is there and worth playing though and is much improved over ArmA 2’s. The missions are a lot shorter and thus generally have less scripting errors. 7/10  Editor: From what I can tell not a ton is improved over the previous editors. It is still super powerful and surprising not impossible to learn how to use. Lots of different kinds of missions could be made. Zeus which is basically a 3D editor is absolutely amazing except for one big drawback; it doesn’t give you the option to save anything after you used it. I know it was intended for multiplayer but it would have been nice to finally have a 3D editor. 7/10  Multiplayer: I do not generally play the multiplayer aspects of games very much. However most of my experience with it was confusing and chaotic. To truly get the most out of it you would need to join a clan.   Summary: This is a very fun game with a ton of content that will only appeal to a small percentage of people. I personally loved it and enjoyed the many tweaks it made to how ArmA 2 felt. Although not perfect almost everything is improved and once again proved that ArmA is the leading military simulator. If you are interested in playing a game like that this is the best the market has to offer.   Recommended to hardcore fans of FPS’s people interested in military simulators and to people who have played ArmA games in the past.  Recommended Purchase Price: 30 bucks if slightly interested  Full Price if you know you like this kind of game   Final Personal Score: 8.5/1011
ood game  i want it but i havo no credit card :(11
e advised:  +Extreme realism +Complex squad play +Awesome engine +Mods (Altis Life Epoch etc.)  -Extreme realism -AI Squad Leaders are  -Little content inside. Requires third-party content to remain interesting. -Does anyone actually play the game itself?  you will never get closer to an actual war/1011
is probably one of the most 'moment' making games I've ever played. When I first began and still to this day when I play it every now and then I get some awesome 'Holy  that was awesome!' moments in there that no other title that I personally have experienced was able to deliver quite as well as  does. For example times where I was able to blow up a convoy of armored vehicles and helicopters flying low with just a red pickup truck that was missing a wheel or another where a few friends and I were able to bring a team together and establish a base stocking it with vehicles to then fly squads out while blasting 'Fortunate son' on the vehicle channel. The graphics are also absolutely stunning especially with all the incredible amount of detail that Bohemia Interactive have put into this game for example: That the rear and side view mirrors on cars actually work or the fact that your character's mouth actually moves when you speak in game. I can't say much about the Singleplayer for  other than that it has one it's not my thing but it may be yours on the other hand the Multiplayer is where the real meat of the game is at. The Community is still thriving even after the game has been out for just over a year. You'll be able to find a clan to play with if you wish to do so or always be able to find well populated servers. There are quite a few things you can do in  just to name off a few: King of the Hill Wasteland Battle Royale and Co-op missions. It also has a mode called Zeus where a person plays as a 'Game Master' persay where they get an up top view on the battlefield and have the ability to be able to spawn vehicles enemies or various other objects along with create objectives and missions on the fly for players on the ground in real time. It's very cool and fun to play around with once you learn the ropes. The game played solo can be quite fun but to get the most out of this game you have to either make a few friends or bring some of your own along for the ride. Communication and teamwork are quite important to the game and will increase your chances of success. For the downsides of the game is that it has a decent learning curve on new players to the series like flying a helicopter or plane and simply just learning the controls. The game is also decently demanding on PCs especially when servers get populated over 60 players you may experience some drops in the FPS. At the end of the day I'd recommend this game to anybody who loves military shooters and absolutely love having unique and amazing moments or stories to tell. I give this game a 9/10 Boasting hours upon hours of content to be played either just the vanilla game or the large amount of community created content and scenarios. I just keep wanting to come back to this game just to experience one more of those amazing experiences that  continues to give.11
reat game but BI's failure to optimise their Arma engine disappoints the majority of the community. EA was able to run BF4 on a tablet perhaps they should learn for them.11
 very good and realistic game not for players who just like to shoot alot and kill the most people this is for people who think strategic and have te patience to wait if necesairy. Keep up th good work Bohemia!!!11
L;DR: Very good game. Get it if its not already in your library. If it is in your library get it for a friend.  This game is a very solid entry in the Arma franchise. It improves upon Arma 2 in every way besides content. But that is even made up for in mods. If youve played Arma 2 and enjoyed it then youll love this. If you havent played any Army before youll still love this. It is a must buy. But ill explain why that is my review.  Pros: -This game has very good graphics and well optimised -I would go as far to say this is the most 'realistic' combat game out there -There is loads of content in the Steam Workshop for many hours of fun and tons of mods and game modes -The PvP is simply the best PvP in any game Ive ever played and Ive played a lot of games -Compared to the last Arma it improves in all areas (besides content- Ill cover that in the Cons) -There is very few squeakers and trollers and it has a mature player base.  -New inventory system is very well done -The sound in this game is amazing.   Cons: -It will absolutely  your PC. You need a good graphics card to run this game. (It runs like a champ if you have a good card) -Lack of weapons and vehicles. (But it makes up for it by having a great attatchment system) -This is not for impatient people. Nearly every mission will have you walk at least 1km. (I dont find this a Con but I imagine most FPS players would)  Final rating would be 9/10. Simply because it requires a very good rig to run it well.11
I saw a rabbit followed by a civilian followed by a private followed by a colonel hunted by a sniper getting shot by an armored truck locked by a jet ...... Only the rabbit survived :P
Its a very good milsim and its big jump forwards for ArmA series.
Is Bohemie Interactive under EA control now? seems like it with the rip off dlc.
this game is epic gooby... breaking point
Straight out awsome game to play with the friends
ve only just started playing Arma but it is a lot different than your typical modern day shooter it is considerably more challenging (One hit and you most likely will die). The single player campaign is in need of an update but the multiplayer makes up for the rest fighting against the AI is an interesting idea especially when the enemy can hit you from a mile away before you know what hit them. If the game is too complicated for you go ahead and look up videos on guides there are countless guides out there and better yet mods. The modding community is fairly active and BI knows and wants this the mods help improve certain aspects of the game such as health or radio. All in all play the game if you think you want to have something more realistic than other shooters no dual wielding no multiple slots (Can't have more than three weapons unless you have a backpack or clothes.  Pros . Step-up from previous Armas can't say about Arma 2 but I can for CWA . Tactical shooter involving serious roleplay . A good AI (Mostly other times they just sit there) . Great modding community  Cons . Not very well optimized . Very easy for players to abandon you if you are injured11
 is a really great game if you have the patience for it. There are many game modes and it is a lot of fun with friends. I highly reccomend this game to anyone that hasn't played it yet.
i got shot by a tank and died instantaneously 11/10
layed a little was fun.11
 played this game a few times it was decent  i guess11
it a cool
reat game tons of possibilities and modability although lacking serious realism factors at its current state such as weapon sway (said to be fixed t) which in real-life being a gun owner say i ran a quarter mile as fast as possible I stop and aim my gun you hold your breath as much as possible since its necessary but in this holding your breath is nothing and it is the exact opposite of what real life is like... your gun will be bouncing literally side to side on your screen after a long walk when you actually need it youll be hitting 5-10 feet left and right of a target 30 yards in front of you... ing rediculous.. And the fact that the DLCs even exist is  imagine getting into a wasteland server seeing a heli and you want to fly off in it then you scroll wheel up to it get in yeah all gud in tha hood rite? wrong without paying $15.99 for TWO HELICOPTERS you will be kicked out and not able to fly it. Is it just me or is $16 rediculous to fly 2 new helicopters? Yes i own it because i bought the DLC bundle. Im not saying dont buy arma but think about the stupidity running through their heads about these ideas... Might I also mention that the helicopter physics in the AFM (Advanced flight model) is somewhat exagerated in some areas. Speaking of the AFM its optional.. which is stupid because like 1/200 people are actually using it now which makes the dlc a god awful waste of time..11
layed a little bit and its just mehh just ok11
f you expect a Call of Duty like game play you ain't gonna kill for at least 25 play hours....  If you want to be challenged really hard then buy this game.  and if you're that person who throw controllers all around the room in anger when playing.....  Do not buy this game you'll probably end up hanging you and your whole family.11
Nothing like running around a 120 player war zone in your whitie-tighties
he focal point of  is the infantryman. You get the feeling that you are a cog in a massive military machine. Armor rolls in behind you to support the assault helicopters scream by with cannon blazing to keep the enemy’s head down. It is a game about visibility finding your target and fixing them in place while teammates move in for the kill. You will spend as much time looking at a map as you will firing at enemies you can barely see.  But  goes a step farther and allows for you to take every role on the battlefield. You can be the tanker on the front line the helicopter pilot ferrying ammunition and men or the mortar team dropping rounds on a target from a kilometer away.  You can even be the commander and lead the assault via radio turning the entire game into an RTS. It scales incredibly well and has an AI capable of filling every role.  It wants to tell a futuristic story set in the 2030s where Arab countries leap-frog the West technologically. It's a daring choice. NATO infantry resemble today's special operators like the SEALS or Army Rangers. Against the lizard-like helmets integrated binocular heads-up displays and futuristic ammunition of the Arab CSAT faction western forces look decidedly old-school. It's an interesting role reversal.  But without a plot 's daring bits of speculative futurism are reduced to mere graphical pastiche. As it has been released without a single-player campaign it’s just a collection of vehicles and weapons. When playing NATO you don't feel overmatched and when playing CSAT you don't feel superior. You’re just there.  Next to the gaping hole where the campaign should have been Bohemia Interactive has placed a set of showcase missions. These are largely the same missions that were available during the beta phase. And the alpha phase. Some of these missions feel like vertical slices that could have been presented to the press at conventions years ago.  The showcase missions serve a function in showing off the game’s tech at least. I was impressed by the lighting and particle effects pleased to find that ground vehicles handled better than in past versions and that the AI for allies and enemies has been beefed up. My roughly 2 year-old gaming PC ran  successfully at very high settings though not always at desirable framerates.  My puny mind however with its limited processing capacity was not able to divine how to fly attack helicopters without multiple trips to Bohemia Interactive's forums and out to YouTube for several fan-made tutorials.  That’s because the game that Bohemia Interactive is selling right now does nothing to effectively teach you how to play it. Help screens flash up during showcase missions so quickly that they’re nearly useless. There’s an in-game instruction manual of sorts but it feels unfinished. Some of the commands — switching optics on the tank’s periscope for example — are listed as 'undefined.' It was on me to go deep into the menu systems and assign a key to make them work.  These showcase missions move unrelenting fast at times. The allied AI makes few attempts to let you catch up when you fall behind and that leads to a vicious cycle of learning by dying. This made the glitches all the more frustrating. Small hiccups saw allied soldiers sucked inside rocks or enemy AI who would lay on the ground as if to sun themselves while I carefully zeroed my rifle and walked rounds in on their head.  What I would call large errors ranged from the improbable (landing a jet upside down on a mountainside) to the incomprehensible (a low-speed collision of two tanks which catapulted them both 30 feet into the air) to the downright creepy (a seated infantryman lengthening his neck by a foot T-1000 style).  Joining public multiplayer servers was a crapshoot and there are no Bohemia Interactive servers to play on. The majority of my pick-up games were hosted peer-to-peer. Players looking for regular stable experiences on hardware capable of hosting more than a few dozen players without serious performance issues are left on their own to roam the wilds of the internet searching for clans.  But the searching was worth it because when I found a good server the experience was incredible. Most of those experiences came from fan-made modifications like Wasteland and Domination — not from anything that Bohemia Interactive shipped with the game. It’s as if the game’s community has ignored the content that Bohemia Interactive made out of spite.  Where  shines is when you have 6 or more players working with you in a multiplayer session. A set-piece cooperative mission called Escape from Stratis stands out. Here a NATO platoon of 10 is stranded somewhere on the massive hand-made map. The goal is to find a boat or a helicopter and escape alive.  The few times I've been able to play it with a complement of 8-10 friends have been nothing short of incredible. Simply making it safely from one hilltop to the next has been exhilarating. How I know the game is succeeding is that it is teaching us how to operate as a cohesive fighting unit by forcing us to survive in a hostile environment.  Once while moving over open ground our platoon was pinned down by multiple enemy infantry formations. We formed a perimeter called out coordinates and together returned fire and destroyed the enemies allowing us to move to better cover. While we were looting the corpses for ammunition an armored personnel carrier (APC) crested a hill. We hunkered down and gave covering fire while two players carefully brought anti-tank rounds to bear. Then we repaired the APC ourselves and drove off into the sunset.11
This Game is Really Fun! Totally worth 40€
his game is so much fun when it was free for a couple of days my friend reccomended it to me and I said 'Sure Why not im not doing anything else right now.' So i Downloaded  and joined my friend. He said he was going to be a cop Then I said screw that im going to be a 'Rebel' so i did. I got a team of 6 or 7 robbed a bank for 25.7 Mill and got off . Overall  was not a bad game It was actually the best game ive every played on my PC for YEARS! So i totally reccomend  to all of you who are thinking about buying this game. And if you don't belive what im saying here is a link to some  gameplay  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2Z1ftAqCZ8 11
The only fps that allows you to run straight and look left and right! Thumbs up!  I downloaded  to play the Breaking Point and Epoch mods. Both are great! Highlly Recommend!
his game is great the simulation on the vehicles is realistic.  requires a good computer to be able to experience the game. This game has lots of mods such as Epoch Breakingpoint etc. This games' map is extremely large the Altis map and the Stratis map. This is a good thing!   However this game costs £35.99 in my opinion it is highly overpriced it would be a 'Must buy' game if the price was between £23.99-£30  At the end this game is great nice simulation I highly recommend this game to everyone. If you got the money laying around you should really get this game.11
ou enter combat with your team/squad hop in a chopper fly to destination parachute in forget to pull chord fall to death. Would jump again 10/10.  In all honesty I would say get this game. It's hard to learn but it gets so good once you learn how and you get into a combat zone and bullets are wizzing by jets flying overhead and then you hear an explosion and the house on the next block is destroyed.11
its is fun.
he first couple days can be really painful for most of the people '' is kinda hard to understand it's not for everyone especially not for 'BF/COD lovers' the maps are really great graphics are awesome same as the audio this game is made really good not as ArmA 2. ArmA 2 is lagging a lot has a lot of fps drops playing ArmA 2 on 1920x1080 Mid/Low and i have only 30-60 FPS  on 1920x1080 Ultra High/High 80 FPS +++ half of  players can't kill a standing player so the combat is pretty easy i'd say the game is pretty expensive but it's definitely worth the money 10/10.  11
Great game! Can not begin to tell you how many fun times I have had. You should get it for sure. You will get many fun memories for the price you pay.
Stole a police car then drowned in the water while a child cop told me im stupid  12/10 would recommend
Used to not have a lot of guns but it's constantly improving. It's the most fun with friends but still a lot of fun alone. I would give it a 10/10 but because of the framerates and flying goats ill give it a solid 0/10
Loving . The A.I still... is either mentally challenged or trained by Seal Team 6. But still a great game.
ould use better car graphics but other than that pretty sick.11
 would say that the best way to describe ArmA III would be to say that it sends you to war. Be it through having your helicopter shot down in the first five minutes of you being in the game and ejecting just in time to avoid death then crawling to an outpost on your broken legs to defend it to your death or be it in having your Humvee hit by an RPG and having your commanding officer's head shot off by a sniper. The game is what you make it but I will say this. This is not a casual game by any means. If you are a fan of games like COD or BF you will not be happy with this game. The hyper realism makes it often incredibly challenging to survive but I can say from experience that when you do succeed you will be as excited as ever. I would reccomend most players to start out playing online because that is where most of the fun is. The multiplayer modes and the variety of them make a nearly infinite replay value. The game's sandbox nature make it a blast to play with friends though it does lose something when playing alone. I would reccomend playing with friends. I give it a 8/10.11
The only bad part is the 60 dollar price tag
o once you've figured out what the  you're doing you'll like this game if not then go play some Call of Duty.11
With the new update i get PTSD from getting shot at. i was at a party and some kid dropped a plate and i nearly  my self
Totally worth it both for SP and for MP. Especially for MP.
 is infinitely fun. The gameplay experience is never the same every time.  They have hashed out a lot of issues a while ago and continue to update the game.
ealistic. And sometimes not realistic but its a simulator so what'd you expect. Go kill a bunch of people and make a ton of money racking up your war crimes only to realize hours later none of it was real. Kinda like playing a game all day huh?11
I've only been playing for about 86 hours this last week.   What I've learned....  Modded with Epoch on a PvP server -  Got shot right out of spawn Went back Got shot again Went to different spawn Didn't get shot right away Heard constant 'Mooing' sound after running about 500m from this spawn Looked for Cow Not a cow Armless Zombie (How dangerous can that be?) Shot it with starter pistol Pi**ed it off It ran at me Emptied Mag into it Didn't stop Blew up in my face Dead again  11/10 going back for more punishment  I've died and had my heart stop and almost crapped my pants so many times. It's nerve wracking and buggy at times but NO WHERE NEAR the bugginess of Arma 2.
his game made me an operatorits so tactial 30 minds ride to fire one bullet and diealso made me pop boners on tacticool gearall in all I give if 9 out of 10 dynamic storiesif only the FPS was operational level i would operate with other operators11
This game is wonderful and its fun with the missions being awesome and an open sandbox is just really awesome
I stepped through a 8 foot wall and took out the enemy patrol 420/69 would wall magic again
This is my Favorite game the fun is endless and it never gets old due to the mods and the game only gets better as time goes on I would recommend this game to anyone who has a some what good pc to run it :)
ve been part of the ARMA franchise since Operation Flashpoint. This is by far the best MilSim to ever be released. If you're into slow simulated and realistic gameplay... This game is the one for you.11
Its good but not something that I could play for 6 hours in a row.... yet
How many hours have i got ^
his is a wonderful game I've put my fair share of hours into it and needless to say this game is great to play with a nice large organized group of people to play with there are plenty of gamemodes to play and plenty of groups to join for this game11
The most realistic military experience short of being dropped into a live warzone just got more intense with the Go Kart addon.
Got some friends.  Made a badass group named The Orphanage. Once teamed up with the Sock Rebellion. Meet people and make them Orphans. Robbed the Federal Reserve. Took over a town.  This all happened in the afternoon. #NoRagrets
eally good game to play with your friends. Although I was playing on a server and it seemed to have max players on it (There was 2 servers) and my browser seemed to stop working after a while.... so i had to restart the whole game then refresh a couple of times then it would stop again. Thats really the only probelem the co-op is amazing - It almost reminds me of Planetside 2 when you have a squad and there are mortar strikes and everything works out... Anyway I would recomend this game to alot of my friends :-)11
est game i have ever owned!  With all the realistic firearms vehicles infantry awesome and a  of multiplayer servers mods and a lot more. I now have 1000 hours of this game played and almost every hour is on multiplayer. The gamemodes i love the most is: sandbox (wasteland) cooperative mission roleplaying (this is the best one) and alot of other fun things and training servers.  I would recommend this game to everyone this is a game you need to try. 11/1011
it should be on mac aswell
0/10 MilSim doesn't get any better than this. Props to BiS and the whole community for a awesome game. There is so much more to this than Altis Life and KotH so head yourself towards workshop and go get some really decent missions and mods to play with!11
Very fun game with all the mods and fetures avalible; fun with friends or ALONE!  10/10 would buy again
This game makes me wet.
ello Very Good game if into Simulation and also it relates very well to real life This game Is very mod flexible and there have been alot of mod releases latley e.g. life Milsin units and all of that sort of stuff that takes the modding cabablilties very far with this game11
Great serious Milsim game. Lots of improvement in graphics from ArmA 2. The infantry movement is smooth and adds a realistic feel. Without a doubt reccomend this game.
I personally like the Game Modes and the ways you can play greatly Optmized game all you need a beefed up computer and you might be able to play on High or even Ultra Graphics I used to play on a Laptop which i could get over 20+ FPS now I have my New computer which can run at High with 30+ FPS and its still just as good as it was still love the Gamemodes and its even better to play. I really like his game and I hope you do too.
ighly recommened for people who love RPG games or Action games. Feels like real life war but into a game. Worth the money.11
Singleplayer: 74 fps. Multiplayer: -12312424 fps. bohemia in a nutshell.
You can kill someone by dropping an airlifted ammo crate on their head.    'Nuff said. 11/10
reat game overall but very CPU intensive...11
Great game :D
i forgot i needed a parachute
arma3 rocks and is fun game to play with friends and family. i never play arma3 with family before. get arma3
Drives over guy with a Heavy Armed vehicle-dies. Tries it again-Wheel gets destroyed-vehicle explodes-dies. 10/10
44845
Really good game go check it out
This game is very fun to troll on. And the gameplay can be intense. Definately recommend to anyone who wants a fun time.
Great game : Nice graphic  Open world Fun playing with friends :D  P.S  i wish there are armory mode like arma 2  Also hope there will be more map coming soon :D
icture yourself standing in the middle of ing nowhere then having to run 60 miles to get home you picturing that? Well the game should really be called  the real jogging simulator or dream smasher because let me tell ya you run for that long and get some cool gear you're probably gonna get killed'- Righteous goaler 2013-1511
Bought this for Battle Royale 100/10 people killed  (its the modern hunger games)= Forbes (Prepare for the same  engine except this time it doesnt look blurry af)= IGN (This is better than Dayz Yet Dayz has had more development time and money put in)= Bob Barker overall this should be rated 3 out of 4 armas Maybe arma 4 will be more unoptimized. But i still love it 'our games are  but you'll still buy them' -with love Dean Hall Buy this game its the most fun you'll have in awhile
This game is amazing find the right server and join some friends to play!
The only game where the bots have aimbot.
I don't even own this game but I can write a review so I've got that going for me.
Great game so many different game mods and is a great role-play game definatly worth the price. I highly advise buying this game!!
• Rear view mirrors actually show whats behind you. 11/10
0/10 would sell csgo skins for this game  Side note : Npcs have aimbot on lowest difficulty (on singleplayer)  but the end result is worth it11
I play this stupid game like it's a full time job. And I wouldn't take back a minute of it.
10/10 would forget controls again
rma is not a game in the same way that a word processor is not a document.   Want to play Call-of-Duty-level stuff? It's got that. Want to play RPG stuff? It's got that. Want to play survival horror? It's got that. Want to play a flight simulator? It's got that.  This software's so good it will convince you to strap things to your head for headtracking and that this is perfectly normal.   However you will probably find you get the most out of this if you play with a clan. From we-want-to-pretend-we're-in-the-army level of committment to the it's-saturday-and-we're-drunk-and-on-the-internet level of committment to the we-have-small-children-and-this-is-what-we-do-to-chill-out levels of normality there are clans out there for anyone's taste and needs.   And hell if you're a misanthrope the singleplayer fun is still pretty damn awesome.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1PXJduNQdg 11
ought this game for the Breaking point (Dayz) modbut i decided to give Epoch and Altis life a try.It was a blast i had a great time playing with friendsso i tought i should play the campaigni'm sorry to say that it was horriblethe AI was dumb as F*ck even at the hightest level of difficultyand sometimes game would crash at the end of a cutscene(although this might be an issue on my end).So overall i think that  is a great choice for those who want to play onlineif you are looking for a good singleplayer campaign you might wanna avoid .11
AHHH. such a nice game many hours of fun 10/10 IGN
is perfect !!! my only complain is about the game is not 100% optimized i still drop frames altho i have i7 4790 oc and 970 gtx oc 4 gb  i hope they will optimize it soon as we know there wont be Arma 4 soon11
This is the best war simulator !!!!!!!
Fun Fun and more Fun get a play with me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This game gave me PTSD  100/10
retty good game only downside about it is that its a hardware  will hog your computer like sasha grey sucks  :/  10/10 would get sniped out of their jet while going at 500 km/h at 700 metres11
layed Altis life and started off with small truck did drugs kidnaped people and role played as a cop. In the end I came out with many helicopters but my expert pilot decided to mow the grass with the blades.  ~~10/10 would MLG agian11
Server waiting simulator 2020
It is amazeballs.
layed altis life with my friends we went for a cocaine run. We got big trucks and put offroad trucks in the back of our big trucks (yo dawg i heard you like trucks) We made it through the border to the cocaine field fine All of a sudden a another truck pulls up besides us what must be a 10 year old child armed to the teeth jumps out 'Bonjour!' Canada Not knowing a word of french my canadian friends exchange words as we gather raw cocaine for processing. We fill our trucks and the kid follows us in a 5 truck convoy We make it through the border fine we stop because squeaky broke the wheels on his truck somehow. All of a sudden we hear a helicopter its getting closer and closer everyones looking. At this point hes right above us hovering We all panic and take off flooring it at like 90km/h down the highway Eventually we get pretty close to the cocaine lab the helo broke away from us we thought we were in the clear police APC joins the chase ITS NOT POLICE IN THE APC We all panic and split my one friend is pursued by the APC while the other two make it to the cocaine lab fine (for now) I am trying to break away from my friend because hes banking towards me in his truck with the rogue APC in pursuit I eventually make it far away the helo returned and was chasing me now  getting heavy im away from my friends all by myself getting chased by a helicopter the guy is yelling at me in french and trying to stop me and steal my truck out of my big truck thats full of raw cocaine. I keep heading towards Altis capital Kavala the chopper breaks away from me and goes towards it probably expecting me to sell my cocaine there. The pilots a dumbass and I manage to escape far away as my friends are shot dead at the lab. I make it to another city in 10 minutes safe from the chase now. I was the only survivor of that chase.  Screenshot of the chase below  http://gyazo.com/b39c718d58262619a302babd0eba2071     (Eventually my friends got a moderator in the servers TS because we thought they freekilled us but it turns out they could shoot us if there was an obvious pursuit and we werent stopping and that they could take 50% of our inventory from our trucks but they couldnt take our trucks and chop them praise peaceful canadian servers. After a long discussion in french which i couldnt understand they said it was all RP and we all enjoyed it for the most part.)  10/10 best RP experience I have had in a video game.  The campaign to this game is really hard but enjoyable.11
y first week of Arma I was walking through a pleasant meadow birds were chirping a rabbit was hopping through the grass and sun rays were penatrating through the tree branches. I paused to take in all the beauty around me as did my friends. We lingered there for a while watching the rabbits and snakes. Then as we thought the tranquility would last a .50 rips through my squad leads head a machine guns starts chattering away poor Mr. Rabbit took a 40mm grenade and I was castrated by a tracer.  11/10 Would be sterilized again  11
Rappelled from a chinook with my mates. Last guy caused the chopper to explode.  10/10
Best Game ever  - Join Altis Life to have more fun
e and one of my friends are playing on a Insurgency Startis server when is heli goes down. I get sent out on a rescue mission when my chopper which is flying over him gets hit by Anti-Air and goes down hard. He comes over and revies me only to relise that we are right next to an enemy base with a MORA circiling it. We manged to take the zone only left with the MORA still rolling. My friend picks up a launcher with only one rocket. 'Make it count' I say. He misses. The MORA turns and sees us then we scatter. Behind the MORA was a Offroader with a machien gun mounted on the back which we imediatly run for relising its our only chance. We make it. I drive while my friend shoots all the while the MORA is chasing us. Bullets are flying in all directions. We finnaly lose the MORA and end up in the AO Agios Efstratios. Im driving with my friend on the outskirts of town when we get blow up. By four IED's. I die but my friend lives. We then come under motor fire my friend still somehow alive. He revives me and make it across town. We've captured the AO and everyone on the servers celebrating except or OPFOR. One of them snipes my friend in the back. while the sniper reloads I fireman carry him over a hill under cover. I patch him up and we rain motor fire all over the city.  9/10 would swim with fishes again.11
Could not complete the first level of single player  10/10
hot a tank with a javelin 5 guys popped out and exploded.11
VERY GOOD GAME I LOVE IT
whats the diffrence between buying normal  and buying  digital deluxe edition because it seems you pay for 5 euro's more for absolutly nothing.........
reat game 95% of people on pub servers are cancer.  Seriously if you enjoy milsim in any form this game is worth it. The plethora of mods and addons make the game what you want it to be. There are so many great weapon vehicle and mechanic mods. This game is beautiful in the sense that there is so much to do.  Run around on a life server with screaming people and crazy police. Take objectives with other in co-op using infantry armour and air support. Join a unit to get the most furfilling fun experience with those that play more seriously.  I'd recommend anyone that likes milsim of any kind to buy this game then join a unit as it greatly increases enjoyment to play with a group of friends.11
Killed a guy over 1100 meters with the gm6 lynx. I had the best .  10/10
antastic Mil-Sim with a HUGE modding community and a wide variety of gamemodes. If you want to bomb a plane into a prison on a life mod go ahead! If you want to lead you team of tanks the the forest moving everything down you can do that too! This game is brilliant and I would HIGHLY recommend that you pick it up if you don't have it. Try out some gamemodes and experiment with some mods and find out what suits you best.  12/8 M811
10/10  Pros: Guns Greece GUNNS Good maps Awesome RP Mod(s)  Cons: No Shotguns Kavala is Lag city No other cons
like Arma 2 is one of the most realistic war games you're going to get. When i jump into this world i feel so immersed. I love running to the chopper with my squad talking with them. This game is really awesome if you can find a realistic server. Im not into deathmatch and all of that in Arma it feels weird to play something like that in Arma. In Arma i want the most realistic experience i can get and  delivers. There is no better feeling rushing through the fields with your squad getting shot at shooting back. It feels so immersive. I rate  8.5/10   I wish i could give it a 10 or 9.5 but i can't. This game does have alot and i mean alot of bugs. It's impossible to play through this game without encountering a bug and that really sucks. I wish they could at least fix some of these bugs because some of them are actually game breaking. I do recommend this game for people who want a realistic and immersive experience but if you want a really good shooter this might not be it. The only reason i play this so much is not for the shooting. It's for the communication with other people and the realism.11
f you ever want to know what war is this game and the people in it will do it for you. Foxtrot Alpha/1011
 is for amazing 'R' is for i'm not really sure 'M' is for magnificent and 'A' is for amazing again and 3 lastly 3 times the amazingness (true fact...trust me I'm a doctor)11
here is the type of gamer who loves realistic games then theres those players who want to be a bulldog style being and  a tank with a baby 'lil 'nade11
uper detailed super realtistic super co-op/multiplayer. Not-so-super performance scaling due to bad engine.11
ew pew boom argl.  11/10.11
Best first person shooter I played. I played Battle Feild alot. But Arma is amazing compared to Battle Feild. I told recommend this game 100%.
lying around in one of the jets showing off my 'Wonderful' skills I'm flying about 10 meters above the ground trying to be cool only to soon realize that I hit some electrical wires and died. Give Bohemia your F'in money!11
I have been playing this game for a while now and I am loving every moment of it. I am in a large unit called the 16AA and we do missions ever wednesday and saturday
 only really play Over/E Poch and from my experience its a great game. You have moments when helis blow up for no reason or you die to stairs but when you look past that the skys the limit to building bases collecting weapons starting firefights with your neighbours or making peace treatys. this game is great.11
uch realistic very boom 9/11 - IGN11
I played RolePlaying and got harassed by a bunch of french guys. It was fun.
Yeah we need some help. Joey got his car stuck in the window again.'
Love this game! I like it because it is tactical and not COD. The ways you can tackle a mission is amazing!
Nice ! Best game ever !
ne of the best games i ever played! I love the game in general but the mods like Atlatis life Breaking point are so fun..  I really think everyone shoud try this game out!11
this game is increidle amounts of fun and with the amount of stuff enjoy this openworld mmo thats literallly kept me occcpuyed for 2 months
you can shoot snakes
Not as good as arma 2 but its alright i guess
i want to play it so bad
The best military simulator
ood game good graphics flying cars broken physics  11/10 would fly again11
One of the most versatile game.
ell for start off i love  its an amazing military simulator and its really fun to play with friends on servers like; life  wasteland  breaking point and more mission files to enjoy! But im really dissapointed at the same time. Arma cut MAJOR corners in development and is very glitchy.You fall through stairs  get stuck in rocks and sometimes d-sync which isnt fun at all cause you loose all your stuff if you die or if your hurt loose the advantage in a gun fight.I wish Arma brought out a patch which fixes all of these bugs but in all  this is a really good game and you should buy it if you like first person shooters.11
his is the sequel to Black Ops 2. Everyone throws away a bunch of the high-tec stuff and now people fight more like it's 2012 even though it's 2030something. Fight against the army of Greece and all of their Spartans so that zombie Menendez can't steal Reznov's Gold!11
ixed emotions about this one... Bought it when it was 40 bucks kinda wish I didn't. Only real good parts about this are customizing levels of your own. Custom KOTH servers are good too. Other than that I didn't really enjoy this. I was hoping a lot more from . Arma 2 still has unlimited gameplay in it. RP servers and normal servers. If you want a good war sim this is pretty good. If you want a semigood war sim with basically unlimited gameplay Arma 2. I don't exactly RECOMMEND this game but it's pretty okay.  6.4/1011
Just buy the f**king game already. if you need to read reviews your ready to perchase.
reat game with great mods. the game requires patience and alot of time to get into since 1 game might last +12h. the game doesnt have constaint action but when it does its very tense and nice since all it takes is 1-3 shots and your dead. the game has a massive map somewhere around 270 squarekilometers giving you lots of space to run around aimlessly if you dont know what to do. the game has multiple different vehicle types such as: civilian cars ATV's APC's tanks jets helicopters armored cars boats and submarines. you have lots of choices in this game and the game needs thinking. you cant just run in middle of city with an machinegun holding the trigger and hoping to do something useful. the instant you get spotted running in middle of open field you will most likely die. arma is a great game series and they have tons of player made mods.  finally got dayz aswell for those who dont care about arma itself sure theres dayz standalone but  dayz breaking point has somewhere like 500 zombies in a city who walk slowly isntead of empty cities with tom the floorzombies. in  dayz breaking point zombies are a treath and will swarm you if you stay in one place for too long. but anyways performance of the game is not the best you will need a high end pc to run it properly. you can check if you can run it from  canyourunit.com  if you think you can run it and you have the patience to play i would recommend this game.11
ompletely recommend it its one of the best games i've ever played the great realism and tactical ability allows you to do practically anthing you want within the boundries great gammodes and mostly good comunity always going to be one of my favourite games hope you enjoy it as much as i have try it even if your not sure i can almost garaunte you'll love it!!11
his game is breath-taking whether you like fast-paced gunfights long-range sniper duels monster-trucking it with M1A2 Slammer tanks playing Ace Combat with incredibly fluid movement raiding a small outpost of hostile forces with a attack helicopter playing a role in week long server-wide wars doing night raids on an enemy research facility setting up a UAV to perform reconnissance on enemy camps packing your scuba gear and checking out the lost treasures of Altis and Stratis or just hopping in a plane and enjoying the wide vast beauty of this game!  really dominates the 'realistic military video game/simulator' genre. Combine some wicked creativity with 's mission editor mode and you can create your own missions and scenarios. In the past people have used this to make their own additions to the game such as new weapons vehicles clothing and even entire maps! 's customization is endless and will keep you constantly changing guns attachments for them and other equipment to match the situation your in. If you feel like playing solo  has totally revamped its Campaign mode to keep the player's attention and actually immerse you in the ArmA universe or forget the single-player all together and go play good cop-bad cop on Altis Life a user created gamemode or blowing up tanks and getting in random firefights with other players in Wasteland also a user-created gamemode. If none of this satisfies you then you can always just build your own mission so that you and your own private team can go and enjoy a experience that I guarntee you is as close as you'll get to war before enlisting!11
Had firefight of epic proportions. Died falling down stairs. 10/10
m going to make this review extremely short. This game is a very extreme sandbox/warfare simulator I HIGHLY recommend this game for anybody able to run it. This game is extremely fun with Zeus-- the multiplayer sandbox/warfare simulator. You will not be dissapointed.11
The level of this game is pure awesome!
i love  buy it buy it buy it
TANGO DOWN
reat game great mods great community. Definitely one of my favorite games of all time.11
he controls are doo doo but with friends this game can be pretty fun.11
aradropped in my underwear landed on top of an enemy tank and died in my underwear. 11/10 would do it again!11
That pseudo-realistic infantry experience we have all been looking for. elevendy/10
ery fun to use. The graphics and realism aspect of the game is extreme. The firefights are intense and it's easy to be immersed into the combat. The vehicle (Including Aircraft submarines helicopters) interiors are nice to look at as well.  Zues: Before this addon I couldn't get up close to watch a firefight without getting shot. This makes a great RTS and a pleasurable theater of war.  Go Karts: I was kind of confused about this addon. 'A war simulator with Go Karts?' I got it tried it out and to be honest it wasn't that bad. Bohemia Interactive was trying something new. it was apreciated.11
Best fricking game ever. Limitless possibilities. Cheap DLC. 9.8/10
n amazing game I recommend to only players who have patience and are skilled. This is not an easy game to play.11
Best Tactical FPS Ever! Really Keeps You On You Heels.
ot many games will amaze me but this one did. I did not belive that  would stand a chance to Arma 2/OA but it gives it a good run for its money. Only downside to  is the lack of weapons and vehicles but mods seem to patch that right up good job Bohimia Interactive11
This is a amazing game. Going from playing Arma 2 and Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead is a brand new experiance. This game has amazing graphics and amazing gameplay. The only thing i miss is When Diplomacy Fails from Arma 2 where you and some ai fight against another army and you have to control different locations to win. But overall this game was worth the upgrade.
his game is excellent!  If you are looking for a realistic military shooter you got it. But becareful and check your specs cause its hell on the machine.11
military dads on vacation
eally cool game if you are used to shooter games. It is very intense and realistic you can get killed pretty quickly and vehicles can blow up easy. Also the maps are very beautiful and great to explore with lots of hiding spots.  has a large range of weapons that can suit all playing styles so I highly recomend it for people who are reasonalbly experienced at shooter games.11
he* best military simulator on the market. It's the only game where one or two bad guys at the right time and in the right situation will get your heart pumping. My go-to game. Highly recomended to anybody who has played a military shooter and thought 'I wish I could do X and Y.' Doesn't matter what X and Y are the majority of the time you can do it in ARMA.  Edit: 3 years on from the Alpha release and hardware has not yet caught up to ARMA. A testimate to what can be done at 30fps10
rma is a great game to simulate combat. This game contains a bunch or military tactics weapons and movements you can think of.  the military tactics include basic training staying low profile and taking care of eachother. In multiplayer the medic class can be very useful if used correctly. BUT that goes for every class not just the medic.  The weapons are very nicely designed. The look fantastic they even have those hybrid scopes (The ones with a scope and ontop a micro red dot sight or RDS). The only problem that everyone runs into - which is intentionally implemented in the game - the shortage of ammo. You can just spray and pray. No if you do that your ed.  The movements are really realistic too. It's overlooked but if used the right way they can be the difference between life and death. In one situtation (this gets a bit off topic for a sec) we had a teammate who at the beginning killed our entire team. We all spawned in he waited and deployed his bipod and killed like 20 of us. When this was happening the enemy was getting the upper hand. We were all killing him and people turned on eathother and somehow we picked up our  and faught the enemy who had spawn trapped us. The advanced movements allowed me and 1 other person to roll in the grass to the left flank got behind them and killed a pretty good amount which allowed our team to push in and capture the base.  In conclusion it's a great game. BUT way to difficult for me. The controls are a bit complicated to me; I'm used to Battlefield and CoD. This game is FANTASTIC but I hate to say it but the realism is too much for me :/ I refunded it but Do NOT hesitate to buy this product. Always remember there's always the refund button.  I did buy it again then forget to close it now I cant refund anymore lol its a cool game though.10
One of the rather better shooters. 10/10 for quality.
reat mil sim. Can be play for eternity thanks to mods and mission editor10
Started with Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis back in the day and now  rocks my world. Best game ever.... step into zues and things really start to get fun!
his is a great gam if you're interested in military simulators. I've found quite a few Veterens playing this. It does take a pretty beefy computer but hey if you can manage 60 FPS in a 200 km² map it's quite beautiful. For true realism I recommend the ACE3 mod but if you're okay with that explore mods   9/10 in my view10
ets start off with this is way better than arma 2 ever was. wasteland is fun to play. breaking point is so much better than dayz less bugs etc. i s with  and its mods10
his is by a wide margin my favorite game on steam. HOWEVER IT IS NOT FOR THOSE WHO WHINE ABOUT CLUNKINESS AND POOR OPTIMIZATION. The clunkiness is what keeps this game down to earth and realistic and part of what makes this game great but it is not for some tastes. The optimization yeah your not gonna get 60fps very often no matter your pc it is still very very playable sitting fround 40-50 fps constant. Thsi is a military simulation sandbox which means the user created sontent is what makes it great. Check out the workshop for the best mods. I sugest battly royale king of the hill a3l and exile.   Fantastic game 10/10 10
Best Military Simulator!
 really great Military Simulator.  The amount of content and detail in this game is great and will give you hours of fun to have! From a great SP campaign to a diverse and intense MP along with CO OP missions with friends there is endless content in !!10
Well I love this game. From really good Roleplay servers to War simulator servers it's a fun game. The Apex DLC ruins this game for people who don't have it *cough* *cough* me *cough* *cough* it seriously makes it aggravating to play.
You love war? you will love this ...
 After testing the free trial out....I can now give a decent review.....   This game.....is amazing.....the guns the graphics the game play.....HOWEVER  you are not going to get much FPS....on metro last light redux (about as demanding as this game) I got 60fps on high settings.....on this I play on high at 30fps.....I put it to standard which is like medium quality and only get 30-48 fps and sometimes I get 50  It is still VERY playable and time flies and its a very fun game  you will not regret this......I thought 2 and 2OA were fun but this beats both games easily10
Really amazing :P
I started gaming back in 2003 on the ogirginal cod 1 and i have had issues with new shooter games not having decent map sizes but i give this game 10/10 for the map size and the freedom it gives. (even if it has its issues like touching a rock and flying across the map lol)
/10 Best Sandbox Simulation. Truly enchances the feel of FPS to send you to war. With huge amounts of mods to choose from it makes it create a different feel no other game creates. Highly recommend this game.10
his is not your basic FPS. It's a military simulation with great graphics good logic (not like have a health bar or heal after getting shot and like nothing happened) nice gameplay cool campaign and multiplayer amazing mods etc...10
AI killed me with a rocket from 1000 meters while driving at high speed on Exile 10/10 would get blown up again
 have a lot of hours on . Of all the games in my library this game by far has givin me the most money's worth of play.  The good. -Insanely detailed graphics with beautiful and plentiful maps.  -Imersive sound effects with mods to improve sounds. -REALISTIC feeling weapon systems and vehicles. -So many different mods to suit your game style. Epoch day-z wasteland exile king of the hill are some of my favorites. (and hundreds if not thousands more) -A multitude of different ways to play this game will leave you playing more and more.  -Mostly mature communities.  -New content added almost DAILY  The bad. -The mods can be tricky to get working. There are guides online. -Some complain it's graphics intensive but that's adjustable.  -Some of the mechanics needs attention. Vanilla stairs and balconies can be deadly and de-syncing through walls can kill you as well. It's pretty common to randomly fall through stuff and die which can be frustrating. (2nd story altis balconies) -Long download times with most hosts (please encourage mods to be steam-downloadable)  Summary.  If you love repetative and smooth FPS with small maps...stick to COD. If you love repatative fast gameplay with 'your mom' jokes stick to BF4. If you're a mature gamer who loves guns bombs planes tanks sniping combat or anything related to military simulators buy it already.10
is a Massive Multiplayer action based game with TONS of activites for you to do like Roleplaying Scavenge and kill others or team up and take over an area or making you're OWN server with whatever you wish to do.  also is best known ofr the ammount of mods they have and they have a lot of it! Arma is a 3rd to 1st person moduale and is a very nice game to play especially with friends. I do in-courage all of you to get this game as it is a nice game to play. Although it does have some bugs in the game and an amount of exploiters (not that many don't worry) but set aside from that  was worth the money.10
teamwork and the AMAZING spotlight  Had a blast last night working together with my squad and never knew how deadly the spotlights on heli's could be...  During the first round of king of the hill there was only about 30 players total so I took to my beloved Hellcat chopper to help spot the enemy for my squad. Another teamate flew a Pawnee with rockets and guns and as I found targets hiding in Kavela I would call out thier location and within 15 secs or less our Pawnee would come in and lay waste to the enemy.  We dominated everyone that round. It was daylight so spotting was pretty easy and if the Pawnee couldnt get to them our ground forces would move into the area to flush them out. The entire team was working together calling out targets waiting for the incoming rocket barrage!!  The next match was even better. Same map but night time with almost no visibility on the ground...this is where it got really fun. I switched on my giant spotlight finding and hovering over targets waiting for the Pawnee to swoop in and take em out. We must have gotten 30+ kills this way.  I felt like the police going after criminals spotlighting enemies as they ran from building to building cover to cover trying to hide form my spotlight. After a while they figured out they needed to hide from that annoying heli pilot shining a giant light in thier faces.  So many times I would find an enemy on rooftops trying to hide where I would come in and light the whole building up. They were getting soooo mad would either have to run and hide or would try to shoot my light out so they werent so exposed which of course never worked out in thier favor. Many times I would follow with my light the enemy from building to building across the city tracking them until our forces could kill or flush them out.  In 20 years of gaming this has to be one of the best gaming experiences in my life. The pawnee pilot even mentioned he felt bad for killing them after I would spot them. The enemy knew if that light found them they were done for.  Its funny something as simple as a light could be so fun and deadly...10/10 for Amra 3!!!!!!!

KIng of hill / Altis life / battle royale / breakking point and alot of mods in ONE GAME &lt;3
ve spent so much time(yes 200 hours are actually a lot for me) with this game and it is still fun. Why is it still fun? The community especially the right community is the reason for it. Playing KotH CTI and Coop. If you need an air strike then call one nothing is more epic then an A-10 fly-by while shootings its guns and rockets at some pesky tanks. And with all these mods out there you can actually always find something new. There is also a mod called ALive which creates missions for you. You decide which scale you decide which side and you decide everything. I can only recommend this game to every military simulator lover even though it isn't as serious as DCS as example. But there is already A.C.E.3 in development. See you on the battlefield.10
aving owned this since the alpha I can say I highly recommend it. This beautiful game brings not only fantastic single and multiplayer modes but stunning graphics as well. It has a much better optimization than Arma 2 but is also more graphically intensive due to being a newer game. Modding community is very developed and mods are plentiful. Breaking point mod highly recomended for those who enjoy DayZ. All together an amazing game and a huge step-up from Arma 2.10
orked multiplayer for 80 hours now everytime i join a server i get a message 'Battleeye client not responding'. I have tried updating batleeye manually updated router firmware and tried everything else in the help forums. Good game but it is broken by a 3rd party anti-cheat software.-10
Best military simulator to date.
is one of those games you hate but you still play it because it is so good.   is unique in how it plays out but without doubt has some flaws. A common problem is optimization; this problem is a big one considering if you would like to play on a server with a decent amount of players you will be ploughed down to 30 frames per second or below. It can be a horrible experience. However with the right tweaks to the game you can easily run it at 100 fps+ (in singleplayer) with decent specs (if you would consider a 560 ti and i5 3570 as somewhere between good and bad). I suspect that the framerate problem on servers may because how the Arma server is designed but that is for bohemia to improve.  For out this  is a brilliant designed game in the manner that pretty much everything you'll find on the server browser is user made. To the extent where a mod or mission may completely overcome the 'Military simulator' aspect of the game. At one point I even found a mod where you played as a robot car war machine just like that old tv show with the bots fighting in an arena.   If you are into tactics and survival wasteland might be the place for you with the constant feeling of being watched by someone with a very big weapon while attempting to gear up so you can fight back. Alternatively the great feeling of wiping a 5-man squad purely based on your skill and intelligence by outplaying them. If you are into big battles king of the hill is something you may like. With giant battles going on including infantry armoured cars and air support. Even if these things are not for you Altis life might be. With the biggest (or one of the biggest) player-base in Arma the incredible Altis life is really something in its own. You start out by being a civilian with nothing where you get to choose a path of Justice as a police officer medic or something alike. Alternatively if you strive after being the biggest drug lord on the server by harvesting crops and processing them into drugs to sell. On the other hand if you simply just want to pluck apples for a little cash you can do that as well. For you Garry’s mod veterans this is pretty much the DarkRP of Arma.  And if none of these are something that you'd spend time playing why not grab a text editor and start scripting a mission exactly how you'd want it!  Though I recommend this game I would like to point out that it is not that fun to play alone; you definitely need some friends to play with.10
 is so good I don't have time to fully review it I just want to get back to playing.
Love it.
mazing multiplayer could not ask for more! It is a game worth owning it's so easy to go install workshop mods because the buttom is right in-game! Infinite missions! Luckily a DayZ like mod is in there. Make the wise choice but after you get a beefy computer tho! ;)10
y mother would probably scorn me by saying this about any media related to war but...  This game is magnificent beautiful epic and brilliant. the sound-track is not too bad either! I absolutely love the way the game controls especially compared to the stiff nature of its predecessor Arma 2. This is particularly noticable when focusing on vehicles. In other words the vehicles handle like a dream due to the improved physics model (PhysX). apart from the third party physics engine implementation the engine seems to have seen new additions and reconfigurations such as the improved AI (still not perfect especially when driving). The textures are decent considering the scale of the game but definatly an improvement over Arma 2. Animations are miles better. The details of objects such as weapons vehicles and various common geometry scattered around the large expanse of the two vanilla maps (Stratis and Altis) are great!   I find great delight in oogling at such a realistic landscape which in the case of the vanilla maps apparently are modelled from real locations Agios Efstratios (Stratis) and Lemnos (Altis)! There is a lot of content on offer with  notably the ZEUS gamemode which is really exciting to play. Its when a player takes control of sort of an RTS perspective defending attacking and messing around with spawning objects and AI while other players run around as normal soldiers adapting to the unpredictability of ZEUS's actions. It's quite a fun game mode and no two sessions are the same. There are a load of other standard game modes along with the ability to play scenarios either made with the editor workshop or built in ones such as 'Escape from Altis' which is one of my favourite scenarios provided by BIS its great to play with some friends. In fact with a clan or a load of friends this game is a lot more fun. Don't get me wrong the Single player content which is similar is also really really good.   Speaking of the single player experience one of the most notable additions to this iteration of the series is the decent campaign. missions are good and diverse making use of the space it has to play with. As well as the good voice acting which seems to immerse me into the war torn greek islands of Stratis and Altis.  Despite all the good things in the game of course it has problems. One that sticks out like a sore thumb to me is the performace relative to the hardware. Also the fact that the game does not seem to spread the workload across all four of the cores my CPU has to offer; The AI only take one thread causing servere framerate loss when trying to play with lots of troops running around. Which is what I enjoy doing in sandbox games like this most of the time. Servers seem to have problems too. As connecting to a friends has failed on multiple occasions seeming to be randomly stubborn towards other players joining your server despite inviting them.  This is no casual shooter. This is a military simulation. This is ARMA.....3.................puts glasses on gets up walks off into the distance.  &lt;obligatory 10/10 ign mlg 420 reference10
Who dosent want to get this game.... Flicking amazing out of the series so was arma 2. This is just BIG BOOTY ES MATE RECOMMANDED 10/10
Open world modable realistic fps/tps? who could say no?
Great game recommend it to anyone. One of the best games i have played and graphics are amazing. many gamemodes for you to try out and DLC.
 waited to play this after release because of some issues and not having any friends to play it with I started playing it now a couple days ago and it is fantastic. The mods available for the game give unlimited content. Best shooter out atm imo.10
his game is just awesome.  Ppl may complain its too expensive but they are rly wrong. For what an Arma game have and for what the community build for the game its a pretty cheap price you are paying.  Expect to have hundreds of hours of gameplay because you wont master all the skills necessary to enjoy the full content of the game in just 10 hours.  This game is not for casual Players.10
reat game full of underwear.10
his game is amazing and the mods make it so much better. If you are a fan of simulators (not like COD) please get this game now!10
eally fun fps. Enjoy it much more than Arma 2. The DayZ mod here isnt that great but you gotta make do with what you got.10
DIT: I finally got into the modded server area of Arma3. I'm almost ashamed to say I put 7 hours into a Epoch mod+Ryan's Zombies and Demons server. It was a blast. Looting buildings building a sanctuary. Getting spotted by a zombie horde was terrifying all of a sudden you'd start hearing screams and moans and turn around and you see the zombies teeming out of a city. Crazy fun. Highly suggest Epoch or Exile to anyone looking for good servers to play.  My computer is definitely not up-to-par with running this on full graphics. Sometimes it makes engagements are 200+yards very hard especially with no magnification. But I still have had some of my best gaming experiences in this game. Find a group of guys. Find a clan a casual thing or just a server with the same people playing consistently. Your experiences in this game will skyrocket. I mainly play co-op servers just doing made up missions on the map against spawned AI. Its a blast. I've participated in missions that lasted 4 hours in real time and ingame spanned early morning to over night to the next morning. All because we encountered an APC and our AT guy was the first one shot by it in an open field. At night.  There are no limits to travel. If you want to run across the island feel free! It'll take you a couple hours I'd imagine real time I've never done it though. Everything is detailed towns have houses where you actually clear buildings opening doors and such. And tactics work. PvE is hard without a squad using comms let alone PvP.  For an epic military simulator you've got your dream game. Not for a COD fan just looking for a change of scenery. Its an entirely different FPS. You can do most things you would in real life. Pretty crazy.  Gameplay: 10/10 Optimization: 10/10 I can adjust my settings down and still get 50fps. Community: 8/10 a little hard to get involved but once you are amazing. Overall: 9.3/10 Get your friends to play with you.10
I personally dont like it becuase out of 13 hours of game play 10 of it was trying to fix errors popping up in the game. I have tryed EVERYTHING and some of them are not fixable. It has made me lose my mind.
 have to say This game is dam realistic :) AND PERFECT! even without that mod called DayZ10
 dont have it But I want it10
his game is intensely fun and has some very intricate mods that allow you to get more immersed in whichever style of fps gameplay you like. From Strategic Warfare to COD-style run and gun.10
 enjoy playing this game with friends on multiple different gamemodes.  The game is still buggy but not messing with your gameplay unless you cause it to happen.  Helicopter flight is unrealistic but easy to learn.   Many gamemodes including roleplay wasteland king of the hill and Battle Royale.10
Just Buy It
ell after about 1200 some-odd hours playing I haev to say  is a amazing game. Highly realistic really good ai that can be adjusted to your skill level allowing you to have a challenge but still making it enjoyable. It is easy to personalize edit to your own preferances. Now Modding is friggin awesome wait no it is FRIGGIN AWESOME if you want to see some of the content available go to  www.armaholic.com  it has all the mods addons and replacement packs to make your game better suited for yourself. If you buy this game you will not be disappointed.10
is in every way better than its previous version Arma 2 its still has its bugs but nothing compared to Arma 2 the Graphics are absolutely great and as always the Gunfights are amazing nothing like battlefield or call of duty good planning and tactics are just as important as been able to be a good shot exactly what you want in a tactical Military Simulator.   From my own Experience mods are the best way to play And I can easily see myself Putting in triple the amount of Hours that i currently have the only reason I would stop playing  would be if Arma 4 got released.   Only Downside is that you will need a good PC to run it its demanding but its worth every Penny.10
hat is love? Baby dont hurt me dont hurt me... No more!10
By far. the best game i have ever played.
layer on enemy team in King of the Hill crashed his helicopter onto the roof of the building I was in. The fire from the explosion clipped through the ceiling of the building and burned me to death and gave the pilot the kill. 11/1010
&amp; Dayz r not just a normall games to play  it's a life to live .10
Awesome game needs some work on the scripting side of thing's
Scares the crap out of me when im being shot at
 am yet to find a more realistic shooter on the market this game offers tremendous entertainment. Conduct multiplayer operations online or with friends or play special operations missions in the singleplayer mode with massive upgrades from the previous installment of the series. I don't recomend the game buy it. Now.10
og endlessly accross vast landscapes and get killed by people you never saw. Reminds me of all the things that sucked in the real Army. The Community also emulates all the retardation that surrounds the operation of Armed Forces. If you want tedious hours of boredom unforgiving gameplay a friend circle of maniacs and so forth then yes please do purchase this game.   Great game I love it. A must have.10
ame is cool 20 minutes at a time when its not losing connection or having my steam ticket fail what ever that means when they fix this POS should be an awesome game.11
brilliant graphics and amazing military experience ! MEIN FURHER STEINER..........
t's just so great to play haven't been playing on my computer cause i can't play it on this one... but ive been playing it on my friends pc and it ran fine just play and you'll see that is fun. Realistic is one of the things that is well made in this game to man i liked it since i saw the first trailer10
nother great game in the arma seris keep it up Bohemia because I'm not tired of this yet! 9/1010
his game will not measure your KDR this game will not have you grind to unlock weapons or attachments this game will not release 4 expensive DLC patches every year but this game will be more immersive epic and thrilling than any other. It will make you feel like a part of something bigger.  Arma is not for everyone one should not be fooled into thinking so; the willingness to train practice and execute are not traits everyone posses. However should you choose to don the desert camo of Blufor the quicksand colours of Opfor or the grass greens of Greenfor know that you have become part of a community which will grow advance and perfect their craft.  If you're willing and if you want more than a game Arma is the pinnacle of milsims to date.  UPDATE: the new Zeus game modes are amazing (currently availible on the dev build) it is difficult to sum up the essence of the gane mode but it is very interesting and my new favourite game mode which is quite an achievement considering I've been around since Arma: Cold War Crisis (as it is bow known) and the OPF games.10
rma is love Arma is life. No better simulation on the market. Taking down 5-10 in a single engagement can feel more rewarding than an entire playthrough of any other military game. CoDF*gs need not apply. As the saying goes: Wussies play CoD boys play Battlefield ARMA is for men ;)10
his game is awesome the amount of customization and moddability is amazing. It is a bit too futuristic for some people but there are tons of mods that can fix that. tons of fun missions tons of amazing multiplayer content this game is absolutely amazing. Many people have issues with performance especially when on multiplayer what I say to that is 'oh well turn down the settings and make do.'10
A solid update to a solid franchise.
est game i have saw. All kind of detail is complete better then the last gen worth every penny. Buy it if you really like FPS!10
Amazing! Even though you will not play with our Modern Weapons(You get Future-ish) the campaign is still worthy to play and the vehicles finally has a neat suspension. 9.5/10
wesome game The mods make it worth it.10
0,423611111
wesome. I loved Arma 2 and this is like Arma 2 but less clunky and lots of new mechanics and graphics. The only thing I think is holding this game back is the almost unimproved AI.10
The best military sim out there!
The battle royale mod is one of the reason it makes it great
ot the best city builder I've ever played but it did quite a good job at simulating modern military combat10
Do you like tactics? Do you like explosions? Do you like tanks and explosions with tactics? Do you like UAVs with explosions with a convoy with tanks and explosions and amphibious APC's with tactics? Then you need this game!
 beautifully done full-on military simulation that is a lot of fun to play.10
seems really cool
Great game. played it while it was free. enjoyed it. now i want it
an always keep coming back to Arma for more and more fun. Endless content A must buy.10
ne of the greatest games I have ever played. Visuals are stunning realism is incredible comuunity is mature and respectful lots of different firearms and vehicles to drive and shoot. Wasteland is probably the most addictive and likeable game mode I have ever played. This game is sole reason why I bought my PC in the first place. Get this game if you dont have it yet you wont be disapointed10
Crash your car into a tree and realize it's going to take you 20 minutes to run to the objective from where you crashed.
he little time i've had in ARMA III really goes to show that this is a very heavy Milsim game and is amazingly fun highly realistic with great and smoth controls that never get in the way. ARMA III fixed ARMA II's more clunky controls and added different stances besides standing crouching and prone. This adds a new dynamic to the game and allows for things like cover that would be useless at the standing and still realvealing at crouching you can 'Crouch-prone' or crouch very lowly much lower then normal crouching which makes combat more dynamic and much more fun. The only thing in ARMA that is a killer is stamina because it its a milsim game stamina will always be your number one enemy and more of the threat in a fire fight then the guy shooting you because you cannot steady your aim.10
his game is amazing I was worried that I would have bought a bad game for how much it cost but it was really worth every penny. Out of 10 stars I would give it a 9.5 and the only reason its not 10/10 i sbecuase at first when I started playing it I had extremly low FPS and I know i have a very good rig becuase i built it myself so i spent a couple of days trying to figure out what was wrong and frustration everywhere. After a while I set the games priority to high in the luanch options and some other tweaks to the game. Thankfully I'm experienced with computer hardware but other people with no experience might have alot of trouble with it. Hopefully you guy scan fix that in some way? Other than that this game is 10 out of 10 would definitely recommend to anyone! I just finished playing it and i started today. Yeah 7 hours! :D I had a blast and i will tomorrow too!10
his is the most adicting most realistic war game out there. Don't come and expect COD because this is real war. It takes time to get some things done just like in real life. This is a war SIMULATOR not a fast paced shootem up FPS. Best most addicting game i have ever played. I used to be a Battlefield junkie but this takes the cake sorry to say.10
This game is very intertaining. You can have lots of fun by playing the campaign or online. I find the best thing to playis the mod breaking point. This is a dayz like game that has a lot less problems. You can pick a faction each time you die and respawn.
Great Game got me addicted love it its a must get.
xtremely good game! Well made and all round so much fun! from plain TDM to Altis life you will never get bored of this game especially if you download all the mods for it! Endless hours of fun! Nuf' Said!10
AI bugged out and wouldn't let me carry on with the campaign. 0/10 would play.
ow do you not own this yet are you a friggin caveman?!11
I bought a brand new gaming desktop just so I could play it on 'Ultra'  No number can describe this game's greatness  Infinity/0
You should all play it.
mazing game such an improvement on everything that was bad about the second wrapped up in the most beautiful package I've ever opened.11
Game is all well and good. But I really hate the fact that they put the game this far in the future! The weapons are absolute crap! I'm shocked that they didn't just say to hell with it and give you ing lazer guns. I love the addition of scuba options and implementing body armor and customizing your own outfit and the campaign is interesting plus voice acting is much better than ARMA 2. Id give this a 6 out of 10 because I am not happy that I am gonna have to download a  load of mods to play the game with equipment and vehicles that should of been implemented in the first place.
3/10 looks nice but basicaly nothing works everything's buggy as hell cant even walk down stairs without being killed by the map
he long awaited follow up to Arma II. A lot of stuff has been improved upon; graphics inventory stances physics AI and more. Still we need to fight the somewhat cumbersome interface and sometimes strange performance dips. But for fans of military simulators this is an obvious buy and you will have a lot of fun in this amazing sandbox.10
As good as computer gaming gets for military sims.
o far i have put hundreds of hours into  I spent most of it on a game mode called Altis life which i am sure most of you have heard of It is incredibly entertaining but that is not all that comes with .  I recommend the campaign for its interesting and fun story alongside some awesome gameplay you wont see outside of the campaign there is also wasteland you can try as it offers constant pvp while aiming for interesting objectives and i also recommend battle royale that you can download from Play with six.   Over all this game is absolutely worth the money I personally spent £20 on this game when it was on sale and I do recommend purchasing it for around that price as £35 is a bit much and if you got to sites like  you will get it for a nice price So yes please do yourself the favor of purchasing the game as it will bring so much more to your gaming experiences.10
one of my fav games
Its very good and i think it adds alot of new content people havnt seen before.
 is a outstanding game with such immersive gameplay and nice controls that feel right at home. The game also has a nice VR Training mode to start learning about its mechanics and controls about the game.   is also the best way to get a PTSD within 5 minutes of gameplay
This game is great nuff said. Sure the game can run like a dog  sometimes but it the overall experience is awesome. I mean look at my time played. Also I need Apex some one should gift it to me lol.
I love this game But i do not like the singleplayer
antastic game! Realistic fun and allows you to create all sorts of situations.10
This is one of the best games on pc for pvp a must need game if you need some
pent too much time on this but top game if you want a realistic shooter10
lthough I dislike  as a game due to it's attitudes towards DLC as well as the futuristic setting I can appreciate its capacity for milsim. The modding community makes up for it's shortcomings and results in a fantastic experience.10
I started with Sniping in COD 1 on ICSL (International Cyber Snipe League). Here I am modding and playing . (The game has a lot of potential)
i likes that it was combat based and had all war vecles the only thing i dilikes was the lack of maps to play one but i know this takes a long time to build maps so i would still recemend this to my freinds as a good game otherwise this is the best well built war game ive ever played not laggy  plz note i dont atuallly own the game i played the free weekend  anyway i would love to receive a steam key from somone
all of Duty? Battlefield? What are those? ArmA is a simulator game compared to those pesky arcade games. Nobody can 360 you here nobody can quickscope you either. This is the real MLG.   Try to go on a rush and see yourself getting shot. It's all about tactics how good your teamwork is and how efficient you play.  Pros *Unimaginably good UI. Game gets every command as I want to transfer. No problem. *Good netcode. Even with 200ms you hardly feel the lag. Most match lookups have no problem at all. *Stunning graphics. Yes it can use a better thing or two but it is a simulator game and gives you the simulating graphics too. Not to mention a large variety of adjustables for graphics. *Total realism. Okay well maybe except the magical first aid kits rest is pretty much correct. *Brilliant single player campaign. Unique for me. *Multiplayer with mod support. Let it be EPoch or Altis Life Zeus or whatever you can think of there's a mod related to military. *I can count these up to infinite but just get the game and see for yourself.  Cons *Bad low graphic performance. or I have a really ancient GPU. Ge-Force 610M gets ~30fps with everything at lowest 100% scaling with 768p. Drops down to 17-18 on really hammering areas. *Game's way too CPU intensive. I can go for a CPU stress test with this game. Maybe I should type this as a Pro. 2 in 1 program :P *Way too costly. 124TRY for vanilla version and 159TRY for Extended. Even with 50% discount it felt like it was a full priced game to me. If you're not fan of ArmA series or really want to get this game I can't recommend it without a discount. *A bit complex commands. Takes a few hours to get used to it hell it can even be days. Also not everyone can play this game. Takes a bit of extra buttons or few macros for quick responding to situations.  Go and do your thing private!10
Really great game and worth your money and time. Nothing else to add.
Great game best in the arma series. Worth the money
wesome game pick up a copy if you've haven't already prices seem to drop quite well. Tonnes of mod support and new gamemodes coming out its definitely worth a buy if you've played things like DarkRP and Battlefield in my opinion. :)10
Ive only played a little so far its pretty great
Best MilSim out there yet. Truly recommend it! Great game for those interested in teamwork play and so on :D
hile some may disagree this game I find it a whole lot better the physics of the bodys and the whole interface is quite realistic as to were in Arma 2 they all had the 'all hail' death animation and while being a little glitchy'. The game is super optimized so if you run Arma 2 on medium or high expect to run this on ultra with very similar preformance (disable some of the Anti-filtering). This I would give a 9/10 its a GREAT game and will be sure to waste some hours of my life in this game all in all BUY...IT...Just look at the graphics and tell me this game dosent look SEXXAYYY!10
layed Altis Life.  Cop chased me I turn corner stop. He turns corner pops tires on a bush. I hoon it. Got away 10/1010
rma3 is a game that really hit me in the heart both in terms of how large maps are movable and opportunity one has both on land water and air. realsisme in the game is fantastic and I love both weapons and vehicles. I just can not get meek how much I love multiplayer game this is something that has really bother me what I hoped for and looked after and believe me I've played cod cs bf ect but none of they gave me what I looked for and there I found in arma23 games + That there are an incredible number of fun scenario and mods ect possibilities are endless10
isten i dont really give a  about planning out huge tactical sieges online with my friends or mods or realism or anything like that i just really appreciate that this is a game where i can run myself over with an unmanned jeep10
his game is so diverse in what you can do the possibilities are near limitless. This is a amazing game even though there are many bugs that can prove to be annoying. I cant really explain what the game is about because its different on every server most people may think it just a mil sim game but its so much more.10
Very much enjoyed this game!!! So many servers to play that are all unique and enjoyable as the rest!!! I would happily give this game a 10/10 with no hesitation or doubt
 is realy fun but Ther are many problems that realy need to be fix like the animation charater ect switching weapons going thru walls and stairs still i play this game but they need more update's or other wise its feel like a open beta game . :D ... sry for mine broken Eng i tried mine best Cya all and have fun if you play 
This is one the best combat simulators ive ever played. The sand box on here is a blast and the steam work shop is awesome for user created content. The only down fall for me is that i dont have anyone to play this with.
Very fun with friends and without friends. be sure to play the Epoch mod and Breaking Point its hella fun!!!!
 Brilliant yet realistic Military Game. As expected from the Arma Series!10
This game suffers of many glitches such as the stairs and ladders but it also suffers of epic lag proportions but it still a great game. TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!
ust like Human Centipede this game is medically and scientifically accurate.  Just like Apollo 13 you will have a lot of problems.  Just like Shakespeare it will end in tragedy. Just like NASA you will not have enough funds to continue missions. Just like your grandma you will end up as ashes. Just like Boy Meets World... except face first. Just like Die Hard: With a Vengeance... except no vengeance.  Just like a Japanese Kamikaze pilot... except unintentional. Just like your girlfriend's virginity... all will be lost. Just like gay marriage... you will eventually get close. Just like an adopted baby you will long for reuniting with mother moon.  Just like a failed marriage you wonder where it all went wrong. Just like an Islam extremist you will scream prior to your death. Just like a cookie you will crumble. Just like Selena Gomez you will have one good hit but can't replicate it no matter how hard you try. Just like a crazed sociopath Jebediah will ALWAYS smile whether he's being thrown into the sun or on a fire-reentry back into Kerbin Orbit. - (Cobalt Lightning) Just like you have Alzheimers you will forget your parachute - (Austin) Just like war It never changes. - (Dr. Strangelove)  Just like Peppi you'll use the boost to get through. - (Kodiak) Just like Falco there will be something wrong with the G-diffuser Just like Slippy 'Help me.....help me!' Just like a large burrito. It looks delicious but always ends up a terrible mess. Just like a Stormtrooper you'll never hit your target Unlike Luke Trusting your instincts will get you killed Unlike Star Wars the only force you need to be concerned about is Mass X Acceleration Just like a necromancer you'll have absolutely no life - (Kodiak) Just Like North Korea The Rocket will never launch - (Sir Panda) Just like a Space Marine we call it Steel Rain - (Kill-Cam Celebrity) Just like Skyrim your steed will only be able to fly for minutes at a time Just like SimCity you'll quickly learn your building skills are  Just like a Scout Jebediah runs fast and dies a virgin - (Kill-Cam Celebrity) Just like your mom's house one mistake and you're out - (Kill-Cam Celebrity) Just like Russia. You can only love it or hate it. - (Selina Kyle) Just like EA you promote it as a good thing but it turns out to be a bad thing - (NOSCOPE) just like a Steam sale you will use the funds that you don't have. - (Broccoli) Just Like Adventure Time Grab your friends &amp; go to very distant lands. - (Kanjzo) Just like IPhone 6 It will bend. - (Kanjzo) Just like this review f*cking  dude - (Chris Atkins) Just like a bomb ...

f your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if your looking for an outstanding lemon bars recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1) 2 cups Flour 2) 1/2 cup Sugar 3) 1/4 teaspoon Salt 4) 2 sticks (1 Cup) Salted Butter Cut Into Small Cubes 5) Filling 6) 1-1/2 cup Sugar 7) 1/4 cup Flour 8) 4 whole Large Eggs 9) Zest And Juice Of 4 Medium-sized Lemons 10) Powdered Sugar For Sifting  Directions:  1. For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch pan with butter.  2. Stir together the flour sugar and salt. Add the butter to the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut it all together until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press into the prepared pan and bake until golden around the edges about 20 minutes.  3. For the filling: Stir together the sugar and flour. Crack in the eggs and whisk to combine. Add the lemon zest and juice and mix until combined. Pour over the crust and bake about 20 minutes.  4. Allow to cool in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours then sift powdered sugar over the top before cutting into squares.  (Use an 8 x 10 pan if you'd like the layers to be a little thicker.)  This recipe has not been approved by the FDA10
ove It Amazing!!!10
is an A-MA-ZING game! It offers a lot of gamemodes and that makes this game incredibly fun to play. Over the past two weeks i have become addicted to ARMA (in a good way) :-). So where are you waiting for? Buy it already!10
 don't even have the game yet....No clue why it gave me a reason to review it. Anyway the game looks ing awesome! Can't wait to buy it...eventually.10
 loved every detail&amp;feature in this game except the DLC where you'll have to pay $15 for two helicopters and to remove a  kind of advertisement in-game.  As I said except those  money farming DLC's you'll have to play this game with mods to have fun in my opinion. If you want realism you should get ACE but I high recommend Exile&amp;Epoch mods as I had the most fun with these mods.  And this game is overpriced in my opinion.10
his game is just as incredible as ARMA 2. The only thing I do not like about it is its extremely infantry based with little combined operations.10
 wonderfully flexible detailed and immersive milsim.  great modding support and a community that doesnt dissapoint.  a worthy addition to your gaming collection10
pic game. Amazing graphics super immersive and generally great at what it does. However some people may not like what it does. It is very much a simulator so it takes time to get in to. And playing with the right people is almost essential to get the full experience. That is however not a bad thing cause the depth that this game delivers makes it one of the best games i have ever played10
arma3 is a good war game simulator i have been playing this alot and i recommend to buy it if you like war game simulators.
This uniqe game offers a much much more realistic combat experince then any other shooter. Call Of Duty and BattleFeild have been left in the dust years ago.
 is an excellent game but you have to know when to stop.
ook me a while to get into this game. I would highly recommend doing all the tutorials and manuals first. Once you get used to the controls and the style of the game it really starts to shine.10
rma never fails to impress and  is no exception. The game looks beautiful and I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy and team work with their shooters.10
 don't have many hours but I enjoyed every second I played this game and I can say it's worth it it's really beautiful game with tons of different mods and I will recommend it if you like shooting and having fun with your friends.10
t's good but not for it's 50 bucjk price tag10
f you always wanted some real kind of army game this is it man there's no aspect in this game which lacks behind from loving you this game. Highly tactical and the radio communications are just so damn real. This game has a long way to go and it is growing better each day. This game is highly moddable and will never lack content to play.10
It's cool if you like playing with people who take this way too seriously.  EDIT 2/14/16   actually taught me how to tread water.I'm being serious here.It actually taught me how to tread water.I'm a great swimmer now and I can probably be a Marine Raider since they're more bad  than Navy SEALs.
I am going to be short and sweet on this one:  I have been playing and following up with Bohemia Interactive products since the very first release of 'Operation Flashpoint'.  One warning: Don't get addicted ! :)
ne of the best shooters out there on PC playing it like CoD or Battlefield will just result in death. This game requires skill to progress getting injured effects your characters movement and hiding does not regenerate health. Play this game if you want a challenge.10
reat game provides countless hours of fun.10
I must say this is the best shooting game I have ever played.Maybe it's quite unfriendly to the newcomers but in others aspects it is epic.Highly recommended to military lovers.
n terms of scale this game has spoiled me for other shooters.  In terms of stability I miss other shooters.   When everything is working and you've got a good group of people to play with or a good server to play on this game trumps most others in the FPS genre. But its a time-investment to learn how to play the game well and it honestly is not for everyone.10
The best war simulator there is. Plus its on sale now... GO BUY IT!!!
10/10 made me wanna be a lesbian
rma is a great series of games and the scope of each title is always more impressive than it's predecessor. Yes like those it follows  has it's bugs but these are in no way irritating. At most they are hilarious.... because you become immersed with experience of being a lethal weapon methodically removing enemy AI from their short lived lives when all of a sudden the yells and laughs of comrades 'hoovering' in a tank or being insta-killed by randomly exploding vehicles that touched a small pebble breaks the cycle!   It's a game you have to try out. You can get into the game quite easily and add to your knowledge as you go. But don't be a lone wolf and complain it was boring. Arma is about team work... and not your Call of Duty or Battlefield TDM capture the flag balls...but actual teamwork where communication and learning your place in a squad keeps you all alive! The A.I. on this game is 'effective' - they will suppress they will surpise and they definetly do more than just flank you from obvious places. It's very dynamic and lonewolfs die quickly... a good squad will have a much higher survival rate!   So get yourself in a game be a local on the server and join in with 'regulars' to have the best experience.  There is a lot to learn but 's new tutorial system is far superior to older versions of the game and many of the players online are very helpful.   Heaps of content &amp; the workshop has lots more additions. Goto Armaholic for the best and widest range of addons. My only gripe is that they can still be somewhat difficult to install. So it maybe best to use a loader.   I'm a big fan of the Arma series and this one has raised the bar again!  Get your 's off COD &amp; BF and play a real game!!!   11/1011
is clearly a step forward compared to ArmA 2. Interesting new mechanics and more smoother gameplay compared to the previous game.  But still this game could be complete  because all the bugs and d-sync. But all of the creative people who have made many interesting mods and missions make this game such a masterpiece. I have spent so much time playing this game. The community of this game is the best I have seen so far. 's playerbase is like one big family. But then there are the s but they are kinda rare nowadays. This game has made me laugh and cry so many times because the bugs and some epic and stupid moments.  The only bad thing I say about this game is that it is getting less realistic compared to ArmA 2. ArmA 2 has mods that make it a REAL mil-sim. This game is more like slow-paced open world BF with some realistic stuff.  I rate this game 8/10.11
oined altis life got ran over by some dude who was singing. 10/1011
less aircraft than arma 2=cost more$$  11/10 would recomment my family and friend to buy this game for Christmas
Pilot Jumpsuit Army vs. Iranians From Outer Space.  And some greek guys that suck.
10/10 Super fun game and the mods are great.
This was very awesome FPS games! Nice Graphic and there's so many mode on it ....so it's not easy to make you become bored. So fun if u guy's playing together with best friend's or family's. U guy's must have this game!  ^_^V
NG LOVE IT  10/10 IGN - GRAPHICS ARE BETTER THAN NORMAL GRAPHICS 10/10 SUNDAY PAPER- IT'S MORE THAN A GUN 420/420 SNOOPDOG - BLAZE IT 720P/1240P UNKNOWN- QUALITY!11
o I joined a terrorist group. After training I went on our biggest job where I killed a bunch of enemies with a single jet and they were all in a massive building. Those steel beams didn't hold out. Then I went home and got this game. Pretty good.  9/11 would allahu akbar again11
hen you play on Stratis your main enemy is rocks and when you play on Altis your main enemy are fences. Also if you hit anything hard enough with a hatchback sport it blows up.11
it's realy a cool game while playing with friends
Too similar to Serious Sam.
This is one of the best games i've ever played! I recommend buying this game.
ealistic (more so than any other shooter) teambased and an overall good battlefield game.  Now if only they could improve the netcode and fix the desync...11
took a mortar launcher to space  10/10
It is the best military game I have ever played in my live.
he game is a veery good Militairy simulation game. even tough its more arcady in some aspects its still a good game . the build 'field manual' can give you somme good info about somme of the mechanics and you can try them out in the editor it takes somme time to get the hang of using the editor. but the free Zeus mode DLC is another way to setup missions for testsetc which is simpeler then the standart editing screen. the games goes realy in depth in somme aspects so i suggest trying things out in the editor or looking them up on the internet becuas sometimes the FIeld manual doesnt give enough info. the game is pretty hard tough to begin with especialy if you never played tactical realism on arma 2. but if you get the hang of the mechanics and how evrything works try joining a server. most of the community is pretty friendly so they will help you out if you need help with somthing. just a small side note : most poeple prefer you having a microphone or at least responding in chat. be aware most poeple want you to use the correct channals if you dont know what channal is used for what just ask them.11
It is such a good game all though it run's like a b*tch
The game is so realistic that I have contracted PTSD.
ound a guy wearing a Turban. Shot the guy stole the turban got decimated by an IED.  11/10 would jihad again11
A very good game for those who likes action &amp; shooting.  12/10 Would Play.  I really recommend this game.
fter playing Altis life for the first time I accomplished holding a guy up at a peach tree field outside Kola or however it's spelled I didn't know how to pick the peaches so i made the guy pick em for me at gunpoint I then made him take off his cloths why I did this? I don't know but it was very amusing. He picked a couple hundred peaches handed them to me after doing so he booked it to my truck which i stupidly left unlocked he got in my truck pulled a u-turn and hit me I some how survived this with very low health like very god damn low. He had to get rid of the evidence including me. He pulled me off the road and behind one of the houses he waited for me to bleed out. I told him he didn't have to do it that he was a good person he just sat there and waited. After a few moments the light faded It was game over I goofed. Best first time playing Arma III ever. 10/1011
 bought this game purely for Altis Life and it's worth it.   Does the game run like ? Yeah kinda.  Does it matter? No. Because it's fun. Really fun.    offers an online experience you cannot get in other games. There's something great about getting into a firefight and knowing that you can lose everything in an instant. Definitely not a game to hop into solo it's best to be playing with friends. Well worth it.10
egative reviews fueled by angsty console junkies  off that they can't hipshoot and bunny hop everywhere. If you really like unreal tournament style shooters go play something else. If you think battlefield or call of duty is too hard core this game will hand you your  and send you back to the forums crying.   There's a reason some military groups use it as a training simulator. It's not for punk kids.10
o doubt. The price to game time comparison is silly you will love this game Altis Life MilsimmodsKOTH and all those other great things will keep you busy for a long time I consider this to be the most realistic game I have ever played!!!10
ost action pack game yet amazing two way to finish off the campaign. I really recommend this game if your into a lot of strategy and firefights.11
I've played a little bit. Boats and hoes
Its fun so far.
f you have played Operation Flashpoint (2001) you'll be right at home with this one - which is my biggest complaint about this game.  Not much has changed in game mechanics since Flashpoint. The game is still pretty much waypoint oriented and even the editor is pretty much the same; meaning for instance setting up custom loadouts needs lots of scripting. The AI is downright horrible at times and actions that worked fine in previous releases (like driving in a convoy) are now nearly impossible with lots of collisions and vehicles getting stuck.   At least the first part of the single player campaign was a disappointment with most of the action being 4vs4 infantry combat. Multiplayer and community made mods are what make this game so if you enjoy huge realistic operations with real people or having fun with mods in a beautiful sandbox - then this game might be for you.  All in all  is still in development and hopefully it will break free from the old Flashpoint mold. New features like graphical interfaces in the editor and flexibility to AI behaviour beyond the waypoint-system would be most welcome. Modifications add a lot of potential and replay value.  Get  if you enjoy your games as projects.  35/510
fter almost 1500+ hours of playing thise game I feel inclined to write a review.  I don't think I can even describe how much fun I've had playing this game the amount of immersion realism and tactical experience is literally of the charts. There's so much to do with this game it's as if it will never end. From Sandbox to milsim to just Co-op missions literally every part of it is a blast with friends. I've met some of my greatest friends through this and If anyone is looking for a truly social gaming experience I cannot recommend this more. It's a definite buy for anyone interested in the military and tactical genre or anything of the such.10
efinately a great buy! Need a pretty good pc to run it please don't buy if you play on a laptop because it isn't going to function great and you will run into major problems!10
 A 'tacticool' shooter. Sorry that was terrible.   is an apparent military simulator. I'd personally call it a casual simulator considering the bugs (the engine is riddled with them but the devs are active on fixing bugs and creating new ones in the process). There are issues such as: - The movement system (transitions can be jarring- a sprint can becoming a walk just because the terrain is *slightly* steeper which has got me killed more than a few times in the past though it can be solved by running in weird ways up hills) - Over zealous stamina system (60lb of equipment will drain your stamina whilst jogging in a few minutes 10lb will do so in a few seconds later) and issues like that. The guys I play with tend to disable it and for good reason. - 'Futuristic' theme through the use of various real world vehicles and weapons - no AKs M4/16s and countless other classic weapons we all know and love. Sucks in my opinion. - Really dumb ai. Some improvements over the ArmA 2 ai - ai reacts faster and better but can react a little... Overzealous. A single soldier in a good position can lock up squads by taking random shots preventing them from being ordered around (units love to crawl when under fire) requiring a lot of micromanaging as a squad leader - if you're playing as Zeus or using High Command for squads good luck.  There are many others but I can't think of them at the moment. But now for some good news.  You can install mods fixing a large number of gameplay related issues. Sadly the first issue with the movement system can't be fixed (or hasn't at least) but the stamina system has been fixed by a number of mods to be somewhat more realistic and more managable.  Mods such as RHS: Escalation (the US forces and Russian Armed Forces parts) plus the HLC packs solve the lack of modern weapons - the two mods / packs are my faviourites for this sort of thing.  Various realism mods around such as AGM and CSE also help improve the realism of the game.  DLC is also free with the game sort of. Similar to what they did in ArmA 2 you get the content but with some restrictions - so you can play with people who have it though you may not be able do access all the features and there may be some annoying notifications. ;p10
t isn't like other fps games on the market somewhat because it isn't always played in first person lol. I am a simple player with simple opinions. It is a game you can play alone online fully alone or online with friends.10
BEST SIMULLATOR OF WAR IN THE WORLD!!!
 can really recommend this game it's just awesome for so many reasons !! :D10
Best game ive ever played tbh
A solid sequel to Arma 2 but would fall short if it hadn't been for the workshop support.  Arma 2 with operation arrowhead is full of different vehicles and weapons for each faction not to mention some really great maps. Meanwhile  does some stupid  and makes the CSAT and NATO tanks very similair and reuses their chassis for other vehicles. I understand that reusing the same chassis is supposed to make it futursitic but I think it's ing boring.  - Post-Modern military theme is cool - Customization of loadouts - Easy to get workshop mods - Workshop quality control is non-existent - Vehicles are alright - They push their mods and expansions in the most annoying way possible - UI and FPS controls are improved - Maps are alright but nothing that really stands out or is very memorable - Runs similarly to Arma 2 despite looking much better -
best military simulater out there lol
The gmod of First Person Realism.
o you want to blast peoples skulls off from 2000 meters out?  Arma's got you covered.   Do you want to fall from the sky after the helicopter you were being towed by was hit by an air to air missile?  Arma's got you covered.  Have you ever dreampt about creating your own terrorist cell?  Arma's got you covered.  You will not get bored playing this game. You name it there is workshop content that will cover your needs. Not to mention the thousands of mods that can be installed to customize your experience.   10/10 would jihad again  11
it's a lot of fun if you have friends
this game would be fun if I had any friends  #feelsbad
Theres a problem with battleeye anticheat failing to install and yes the game is amazing just that the anti cheat fails install
fter nearly 1000 hours in ArmA3 I feel like I have gathered enough experience to review this game.   It's good.  11
est friggin game ever. Been playing Arma 2 for years now. Will play  for years to come. If there is an aspect about this game you don't like then theres probably a mod for that! Seriously check out mods like  life epoch or breaking point.  is not just a fun game by itself but the mods make this any gaming experience you want it to be.   If you like FPS this is really the only game you need!  10
The PC Experience 10/10
un if you like hearing the F word over and over and over and over again. lol I miss the days when games where about great graphics great stories and amazing sounds. now it seems like all game developers do is build there games around the bad language. not worth my time or money. deleted it after the first 10 min.-10
has $100000000000* computer* - finally a solid 25 frames per minute.11
retty sure this game is one of the best I have ever played. The devs work hard and every penny spent is worth it.  EDIT: Sale for Apex at $17.49 for sure worth grabbing that dang I almost wish I saved enough $ to by myself one gift it would be Apex no doubt.10
it omg the bessssssssssssssssst game ever i love it i have met so meany nice peps on here 10/10
rma is probably one of the best allround millsims there are to date and everyone loves it. this games puts you through highs and low tough and easy times sad happy angry and probably one of the best loving and most best game every10
ot pulled over going 300 in a 100 km/h zone got a warning. got pulled over going 115 in 100 km/h zone and got $1500 fine. 10/1011
   First of all it's only good game modes are Altis life and Battle royale the rest of them you need to download which takes 5 years maybe 60 years if you're lucky
is (one of) the best game(s) I have ever played - even after 2500+ h !   gameplay: 9/10 (Very complicated controls - at least at the start you will need to put some time in optimizing them! But the movement system you get from that is amazing!)  graphics: 10/10 (It is a very good looking game)  sound: 10/10 (sounds amazing if you hear the bullet crack over your head you will hope to see CAS engaging the enemys...)  performance: 7/10 (You need a very good processor to run  and it is not the best optimized game out there but it is a sandbox with massive modding support so if you look from that side its great)  conclusion: Very very good game!   I recommend this game! It offers something for everyone: Military sim (coop) RPG (life servers) FPS-styled gamemodes (king of the hill wasteland) ...   Buy it its worth the money!10
ot only has  provided countless hours of fun and a totally unique experience but Bohemia Interactive should also be commended for their consumer-friendly conduct.10
f all my library this is the game i choose to recommend above all others..10
ated one of the best Simulator of this year it needs some work but mods help make it feel better made with the stock  isn't good. Sure it is the newest it still in development i hope in the future they will add more vehicles and weapons10
The best MIl-Sim game on the market
icked up a hitchhiking crack head drove out to the middle of nowhere had him strip down to his underwear then proceeded to cut out his kidneys while we sang 'Always look on the bright side of life'. It was magical.11
Great game !
 have this game since alpha i play it off and on again but i do have to say i am enjoying it.  Pro's: + You can mod this game to hell and back again + Realistic Warsim + Realistic bullet mechanics + Looks good + Sounds better + Customize every keybinding and then some   Negatives: - Default Keymapping  - Unoptimized engine  - Its not an easy game to learn or to master10
Literally using my friend's dead body as cover in desperation.       One of my best Memories.
Superb game with years of playability ahead of it.
Not as good as ArmA 2.
i love it eventho im struggling to play it with a decent rigsssssssssssss gggggggggggggggggggggaaaaaaah!
 has been on my list of games to get for a long time my only disappointment is that I waited so long to get it. This is one of the best games I have played in 2015. I can’t wait for some campaign based DLC.10
Still absolutely worth it
reat game but I wish it was easier to play a private game with friends.10
reat game love flying around in the Jets/helis. Also love that there's going be a good variety of mods offered and being developed like Arma II had. i.e Epoch Battleroyal etc. =)  Only thing I don't recommend is getting the expensive DLC's they're offering.10
ersonal Rating: 9/10 Replayability: High Budget: Affordable - The price has dropped enough.  Length: It's mostly multiplayer - the singleplayer campaign is... Very difficult.   I was a fan of Operation Flashpoint - Dragon Rising and Red River as well as Arma II.  I have to admit the same problems that plagued Arma II still ravage Arma III to a degree.  It's unnecessarily difficult to set your keyboard up for this game.  They've certainly improved on it now the keyboard mapping recognizes double tapping a button and even holding it versus just pressing it.   That said a lot of things in this game could be handled through smart menus rather than having buttons for it.   It becomes impossible to remember where everything is toggled for.   That said the game is without a doubt the greatest military simulator I've ever seen and the AI is actually fairly smart (except for the friendly AI which appears to be stupid in comparison - but I mostly think it's because the friendly AI is subject to much more scripting than the enemy AI).   The inventory system is a welcome change from Arma II that had an incredibly complicated inventory system and the fact that you can change everything from your uniform to your weapon mods is super great!   The game is like I said very difficult in single player because the enemy can spot you before you can reasonably spot the enemy - but that isn't because the game is unrealistic it's because it's pretty difficult to spot an enemy on a 28 inch monitor in 1080p if there is a simulated distance of 500 meters between you and the enemy is wearing camuflage.  This game will probably be a good thing to try with occulous rift once it comes out. It doesn't help that the enemy soldiers use camuflage that is actually much better suited for the terrain you play in during the campaign - not that it matters the other way around because I don't think the AI is set to differentiate between camu patterns.   There is no melee combat in the game which was a bit of a bummer for me but I don't think you would ever get a chance to use it anyway because as I mentioned you will often end up spotted by an enemy long before you're even able to notice that combat has started around you.   The game lacks an easy mode where you stop to be wounded after bandaging your wounds and being out of combat for a while - Of course that wouldn't be realistic but it would still make the game a little less hardcore for those that find the difficulty a bit too steep.   In operation flashpoint when you reached a checkpoint your squad was revived wounds were healed and new squad members even spawned with full ammo.   In Arma III I find myself running out of ammo very quickly I'm only capable of carrying one rifle (an option to carry a rifle instead of a secondary weapon such as a rocket launcher would be welcome) and if I get hit at any point - It's going to affect the rest of the mission and missions are very very long.   This is a bit too brutal for my liking - it wouldn't matter in a multiplayer game but in a single player campaign where the missions are so long that I often feel like I could make a full time job out of playing the game it's too much.   That said you can't ask for a more realistic military infantry simulator. It very accurately represents what it feels like to be in the infantry.   The producers should have put in some optional missions that were skippable showing some of the less exciting parts of being in the armed forces such as building a camp weapon and gear maintenance dealing with a complicated and sometimes not 100% efficient chain of command and the many menial duties of being a soldier.   It'd be cool if there was a 'I'm military' mode that could be activated which results in you being assigned to a fire team in your unit instead of basically being a joker.   The AI in your unit does operate like a military unit with proper 'fire and movement' maneuvers but you're left out of this because the producer knew the player wasn't necessarily going to be able to keep up with that but some players have it the other way around they sit there confused wondering why you're not getting advancement orders why your team is acting like they have orders but they didn't reach you.   That said I think that it's GOOD that they did it like they did because this game is supposed to be for everyone and not just for people with military experience but it wouldn't have taken them that much longer to incorporate a mode like that.   With the verdict that sometimes the realism level in this game makes it TOO difficult to play through a limited interface such as keyboard+mouse and monitor then I can really recommend this game to anyone who likes military simulators.   It's not your average run of the mill FPS game though so if you like high-paced and less punishing gameplay I recommend something like battlefield instead.  10
is a superior game. First of all this is a  military simulator . Don't  expect  it to be like Call of Duty or Battlefield for that matter. Not to say it is the most realistic especially when it comes down to a crazy amount of bugs/glitches. It's just unique and very different compared to many other games.    The Gameplay10

n in depth difficult to learn but very fun warfare simulator. Plenty of gamemodes to keep you occupied and has an amazing supportive community with plenty of user made content waiting at your finger tips. Single player missions are very difficult but the satisfaction of finally finishing a mission keep you entertained and wanting more. 9/10 highly recommended for anyone who enjoys shooters but wants a more realistic and challenging version of your average tactical shooter.10
Great game that offers many different game modes for all the hardcore and softcore gamers. It is much more fun to play with a group of friends since you will be up against majority of the time groups.
 was playing a normal king of the hill type game with my friend. He and I wanted to be Gods. The only way to become Gods? We bought ourselves matching LSD-skin go carts. What fun! We could roll around and kill whoever whenever.   We started them up. Ah! The roar of our engines. Such love it seemed. Off we went down a dirt road to Marina. Hitting speeds of only around 50 mph we thought nothing could go wrong. We were deceived...   He was in the map blocking his field of vision. I decided to nudge his rear bumper with mine. It was harmless a simple friendly nudge. Nothing would surely happen from this I thought. Mine exploded leaving me wounded on the side of the road. I was sure he was dead since his flew into the air about 200 feet and landed in the woods next to me. This was it. But no over the mic I heard him say 'Wtf I'm alive!?' I was overjoyed. I would no longer have to lose all my gear! He came to revive me only to get within a 5 meter radius from my fiery go cart and there he die. He had apparently gotten to close to my LSD cart. There we lay on that tiny dirt road leading to Marina not mad but hysterically laughing. We could not harness the powers of the LSD go carts. We would never become Gods...  Together we died. I never saw him again and it was then that I realized: 'We only realize how much someone means to us when they are no longer with us.'  Live long my friend. Eventually I will find you and we will once again be united.  10/10 would crash my LSD cart again 11
Nothing is more fun than blowing up Persians with homodachis.
If Arma 2 came with ACE and VTAC weapon resting in vanilla;3
his game is a different breed. For both the positives and negatives that brings with it this game is truly a different breed.  I can easily say the best times I've had playing a video game have been in this game. Those times don't come easy though and most videos don't do those times justice.  is full of quailty people but as it's seen significant growth also growing amounts of trolls and not-so-friendly players. If you can find a group of players with a similar mindset and enough talent you will have a fantastically unique time in this game.  Unlike most mainstream shooters this game is almost entirely community based. Sure  itself is controlled and developed by Bohemia but once you get in-game you are most likely playing a creation of another player. This completely opened ended sandbox of opportunities also has it's downsides though.  For one performance isn't top notch. The game doesn't perform horribly in most cases but a poorly scripted mission may lead to a drastic FPS decrease. Networked play will opperate fine under vanilla or well-created missions on a beefy server but adding in a lot of players and custom scripts will quickly lead to major annoying dsync.   The creative freedom in this game also means that expecting to launch the game join any open server and bunker down for some fun isn't a realistic expectation. A vast majority of the servers are community operated meaning there are some very good and very poor servers. Apart from the diversity in game modes (a positive element) many of the same game modes (or missions) are modified by their respective server owners. This could mean some extra goodies or some unexpectedly low FPS.  For all the negatives this game has the positive elements will easily and repeated lead me to highly recommend this game. Just know what you're signing up for before purchasing ;)10
You know i was originally on the fence about how i felt about games like arma i never really cared for them outside of using them to play dayz holy ing  what a waste of time it was to use them for that and that only only recently have i begun playing more arma and less dayz  then i wanted  almost bought it for full price got it for 40 bucks the next day AND got the rest of the expansions for arma 2 these are actually really fun games 10
I wish I did not bought this game so I could buy it again - 10/10
My character has PTSD now     Shellshock/11
Very cool game. Lots of MODs.
Best shooter out there!  KOTH FOR WIN
this is awsome and i recommend it to others
lotta fun with the right ppl
Great Simulator IF you have Oculus Rift Recomend game Great
his game has changed my life only last year was i a sad person playin call of duty listning to 5 year olds calling me a  then i moved to battlefield which isnt bad compared to call of duty how i kick myself every morning for ever being involved with that game but then i found  and well I ING LOVE IT its way more realistic than anyother military  game and theirs no kids calling you a fagg    10/10 IGN11
But only with mods:P
World's most accurate war simulator.  This game is the closest you can get to real army warfare.  Important Factors:  -Must have a very good PC. Very CPU Heavy. I suffer from this. -Game's download size can get very big with servers and mods. Mine reached 80gb. -Please make sure you have a mic and don't be shy to comunicate. We need you! -Expect to be running a lot.  -Recoil's a b**ch    Up's and Down's:  +Amazing graphics +Many vehicles and weapons to use/each have completly different physics. +Many many servers that only keep growing. +Just about unlimited mods to keep you busy. +Realistic sounds +Tutorial for everything in the game. +100+hr campagn. +So many features your head will blow up. +Ultra-Realistic flight models +VOIP and Communication is easy +100 Player servers  -Very laggy for bad PCs -Long loading screens -Very expensive DLCs (there are a lot of sales though) -Many controls to get used too. -A lot of running to get to an area   Overall 9/10.
Ook this game is speachless ...get some friends team up and let the fun begin. ;)  If you decide to buy the game then try out some Sandbox (this happens to be my favorite type of game) and the best servers if you ask me are the ws.arma.su. One more thing to say is that this is not Call of Duty this is a game where you fight for everything you need and it will take you further then COD will ever do. PS : This game is not for kids !!!
deserves the 'Test of Time' award
This game will stand the test of time.
The Best Simulator-Game' about armies.
ery good game with horrible optimalization (may be caused by my laptop). I love this game even when I have low fps. Best part of this game begins when you mod it!10
Just do it!!! Buy it!!! :D
 good Military Simulation game that allows the player to experience different senarios. The game includes Multiplayer and Singleplayer differenciating the types of experiences that you can face in the game. DIfferent gamemodes and custom servers also makes  a fun game to play.10
One of the best Simulation games out there. This is as real as things get. Jump into warfare without having to take the risk of taking bullets and dying. A must have in any Steam library
I have played over 100+ hours and this is my favourite game off all time.  Like when i play Altis:  1) Go up to an ATM take out all your money 2) Go buy a car 3) Drive to the Gun Store (takes million year to drive) 4) Buy license and gun 5) Drive down to kaval again  6) get robbed 7) cops drive pass  8) loss you gun  10/10  Get this game
Really Fun
plz give me this game i love this game
f you don't already own this game I'm disapointed.. It's a pretty awsome game with various stuff to do check it out!!!10
Start playing arma Join invade and annex server play for 15 minues to capture zone Squad dies on defense pushed to edge of cliff under fire Try to jump off into water No jump button Die 10/10 Would fail to recreate lone survivor again
400 HRS of my life I kinda want back but eh RP mods what ya going to do. Making 10-year-old kids cry is pretty fun and annoying serious RP nerds who Have their d**k half way in the computer and hearing them cry gives me a semi. 9/11 Original meme. May cause chronic depression suicidal thoughts and you may become attracted to dubstep (By then you definitely have chronic depression and should probably make better life choices). Your mum thinks you’re some sort of down syndrome solider and considering if swallowing was a good option. Anyway I digress the game is fun and brings you to the final stages of forever being a virgin but let’s face it you’re sat here reading a 200-word steam comment I doubt you get much p**sy. -Forever Love Jak11
One of the best games out there ! With the amount of missions / mods out there.. the game will never end.

 have seen some negative reviews on this game and they mostly say this:  - Bad FPS in multiplayer - I don't understand the controls - A lot of bugs - I have a high end rig and it's still bad FPS - There are DLC add popups in the game  Everyone needs to understand that comparing Arma to CoD or BF is like comparing Windows/Android to Mac/iOS. Windows is made to work with a lot of different software made by a lot of different parties and therefore sometimes buggy. In the same way Arma is made with modders in mind. Whenever you join a server it is a 98% likelyhood that the server is running on mods. In some of these the FPS can be sub par I'll admit. However that is because you are playing with software (mods) that is made by players as yourself and they are doing this for free. Time spent on optimizations are therefore not always enough to give you high FPS. And remember ALL mods are free. If you join a server without mods the FPS is at 70-90 compared to 25-45 at heavily modded servers. Don't get me wrong though a lot ot modders have done a great job with optimizations to get modded servers up to 90+ FPS.  As for the controls yes there are a lot of them. Why? Because this game is at heart a foundation for a military simulator. If you only had BF/CoD controls at hand 70% of the functions in the game would have been gone. Learning the controls is tricky but also very rewarding.  The last thing I wonna say is that Bohemia Interactive is the most community friendly game developer I know of. They listen to the community they give credit to modders and their way of implementing DLCs should be the standard of the industry. A lot of negative reviews complain about adds in the game. That is because when Bohemia releases a DLC it usually conains a lot of functions for free (Shooting from vehicles better projectile trajectories etc). What you actually pay for is the new weapons and vehicles in each DLC. They are somewhat abundant as there is thousands of weapons and vehicles made by modders so paying for the DLC is more about contributing to Bohemia rather than buying new weapons. And let me say the adds only pops up when you use DLC weapons and vehicles in-game if you haven't purchased the DLC yet. Which means that there is no upbreaking of the community because of DLCs.  If you like the BF and CoD franchises wonderful I do too. If you wan't something a bit less arcade try Arma. It's a beautiful game and you really get hundreds of games in one.   You like zombie survival? Buy Arma it's got it. You like survival without zombies? Buy Arma it's got it. You like teambased infantry? Buy Arma it's got it. You like all out mechanized warfare? Buy Arma it's got it. You like WW2 shooters? Buy Arma it's got it. You like Vietnam era shooters? Buy Arma it's got it. You like Star Wars? Buy Arma it's got it. You like life simulators? Buy Arma it's got it. You like playing BF and CoD? Buy Arma it's got it.  10
ithout a doubt  is worth all the money if not more. I've had my some of best memories in gaming playing this game. There's so much variety in the amount of things you can do. Get bored of Altis Life? Then hop on KoTH. End up being bored with that later too? Well don't worry because Arma is jam packed with tons of content and different game modes to suit your needs. Just to name off a few of the other awesome game modes there's Exile Domination Wasteland Breaking Point Battle Royale RPG/Life etc. And then there's also the in-game editor and scenerarios. Whenever someone asks me if they should buy  I always tell them 'A pc without  is like a human without a soul.' Though I would suggest having a mid/high tier build if you're planning to get into . It's pretty unoptimized on weaker machines.  Yes you should definetly buy  even if you aren't into shooters I'm sure you can find some enjoyment with this game.10
Pray to not be shot by a helicopter while running on a mountain without any wearing any camouflage simulator.  10/10 Would cry for my life again.
The gameplay says it all. Awesome!
f you know what you're doing or even if you don't for that matter there is unlimited replayability with explosions derps mods friends and much much more.10
10/10 would waste 1000 hours again :D
Pretty good
o matter if you are a modder mapmaker with no advance tool knowledge shooter taker air head rts player mission maker or explorer; this game is for you.10
Arma still is totally in lead of militarybased shooter/sim category. The best
ery realistic and addictive now give me my  community badge!  Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2016 badge!11
fully hectic lad
Best Military Simulator with plenty of mods and a huge RP community.
Very nice game if u play coop
o I got the Exile Mod installed and ran about 1 hour around Esseker looking for supplies. I see a guy around a hospital and he looks unarmed just like me. I ran to him and we started talking. Soon after I was handcuffed and naked in the open. He sayed he'd comeback with something to free me. 'Well this is all I've got' - he says. Gets executed.  11/10 would socialize in a harsh apocaliptic wasteland again11
Pass the  weed  PTSD
this my first game in steam
ltough it does have some frame issues at times it's a solid title with a unique multiplayer experience. Worth a buy imo!10
Amazing game even at low fps
My favorite game it is so fun and 128h in game
ood game  company.10
I think I need to spend much more hours in it.
Insanely Awesome!
ust have game best mil sim with great mods.10
eh Its alright10
Best Mil sim on the market.
old but still good
efault (vanilla)  - 8/10 very solid game.   with mods - 100500/10. Absolute must have.11
est war simulator ever. Ran with my tank over a very tiny rock did double backflip and exploded. Physics work on 110%. I can only recommend.10
 is one of the few games you can get for a few bucks (18€ summersale 2016 -without DLCs) and in wich you can spend months of playing and still have fun
f you have some interest in simulated military gameplay and some friends go for it. Alternatively you can check out some of the great mods like Altis life Battle royale or Exile.10
aggy buggy de-sync. It has everyting that an Arma game needs. 10/10.10
love this game so much
I started playing this game today and when I first joined I knew I was gonna love the game 1st off if you like to Roleplay or maybe get into some hardcore PVP then this is the game for you. Why not hop down to the PD and sign up for a job to earn some money for you and your gang! Trust me this is definitely worth the money! Good luck to everyone! Hope this helped. Peace -Nathan

50 hours of crawling though a forest only to get mowed down by a well placed machine gun
t's ARMA. Pretty much a sandbox simulator. Great game and honestly the game I have most hours in. Find a community server or realism unit to play with and enjoy.10
If you like the smell of VDM and couple of baldies this is the game for you. :standingchicken:
av game to this date never gets old some how even though its terribly terribly optimized10
10/10 would spend hundreds of hours on game again
fter putting in over 800 hours into this game's predecessor Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate this game plays with the gameplay mechanics a bit while still retaining the good feel of victory after each hunt.   Like the other games in the series the main gameplay focuses around your character hunting monsters with the key focus of avoiding their attacks and attacking at opportune moments between their attacks often times hitting their weak points for massive damage. And like every game in the series you can't heal and attack super quickly; you need to get out of the way of an incoming attack and heal then continue avoiding attacks until the opportune moment to strike.  There's a smaller weapon variety in this game but each weapon is still unique in how it plays as how you attack with each weapon slightly differs so I'm glad they retained that feature. Another feature that's also in this game is the limited inventory space so you have to manage your inventory as you progress; you can't hold everything after all.  One thing I'm sort of iffy about is the limited hunter rank; in the previous game it was 999 but in this game it's only 20. This makes it much easier to cap your rank and it doesn't feel as rewarding but the grind it takes to get there is a lot quicker so I guess that's a plus.  Perhaps the best part of the entire franchise is that the main 'large monsters' get their own battle theme and this game is no exception providing intense battle music for the two flagship boss monsters as well as the usual recurring map theme for regular hunts.   One mechanic that I abused greatly seemed to have been removed until the final boss and that is the popular tactic known as sleep bombing; towards endgame you're given the only weapon with the sleeping status effect. Nothing quite satisfies like putting the monster to sleep then destroying it with one devastating unseen strike to finish it off.  All in all this game plays quite differently than the other Monster Hunter games but still retains many of its core features and that's why I recommend it. It has significantly less content than the other Monster Hunter games but it's also significantly cheaper so it balances out nicely.  Uh Not too sure what to write here so here's a recipe for Pancakes instead  Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter plus more as needed  Now to make it 1. In a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit or chocolate chips nuts etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more being careful not to burn toppings. :)10
rma III is the best chopper crash test LSD dragon catch simulator out there!!!! Watch out for druken pilots and soldier everyone on arma is drunk or has take some drugs!!! And the level beginning   'Euhm I hope we´re not gonna to die again... Me too Me too ... And we crashed again... Affirmative Shi t F a c k'  Well seriously this game is awesome there are bugs there are many bugs BUT this are funny as hell.  So if you got so often dissappointed by EA or Activision about their next 'big' title. You should buy this game!! At first I was like I don´t know Arma I won´t buy it and then there was a Steam sales and  was free to play and what should I say.... I got 19Hours play time since beginning and just bought that game. And a big + is also the multiplayer community is that what it should have been in Battlefield almost everyone is nice and you can work as a team together to get your objectiv.10
atience young one...I think thats a good summary of this game. If you are after a fast paced shooter then this isn't for you - you need time and accuracy and patience...oh and also a good computer otherwise the game runs like garbage !  8/10 would recommend10
est military simulation game out there. Great sandbox with incredible modability and community support. You will find no other game with the same amout of teamplay and immerssion. It suffers from bad performance occassional bugs silly physics and semi-acceptable DLC policy.  Strives when played with an organized group. With support of many advanced modifications it shows its full potential.10
easants I bring news! Only the most elite PC Master Race players can run this and witness the immortal graphics and majesty which is this game!  Not for filthy consle plebs!  On a serious note this is a very good game if you desire realism and a more tatical approach towards a first/third person shooter. Be it on foot as infantry or ground vehicles aircraft or even a navy approach (No one really wants to be aquaman tbh.) this is a nice change if you prefer this sort of gameplay.10
ne of the best realistic miltary sims available with infrantry and vehicles. Great graphics and a (mostly) good multiplayer community and community-designed mods and missions. The key bindings and initial setup may be a bit daunting but 3 comes with better tutorials than previous versions Dedicated servers (no EA bullsh*t) are an option for playing with your friends.10
Still the bomb.
One of the most realistic FPS ever
You know why! Just get it...
Best Walking and Driving simulator ever......
layed a bit quite a learning curve.10
very good open world shooter
I love this game!
Best game and best update APEX
ove this series since  Operation Flashpoint  (original not the other monster). Bohemia created something that I followed for years and it's longest franchise I'm attached to. Free and open great action harcore tactics hard and yet I scream for more many emotions come to my mind. A3 is evolution of greatest A2 (which born Dayz mod) which I treasue most for so many great memories.  pros * open world * can be modded greatest strenght of this game * provides tons of good fun which increase with mods * one of or not if greatest platform for network based playing (up to 64 players) * mods (hmmm did I say this already?) * decent storylines (pretty short though) * war climax not too many games relate to civilian aspects of conflicts * audio (specially after tweak) * graphics on cool PC's and servers  cons * scripted body animation * no jumping (after all these years they did not figure ot out!?) * AI in long run fails or is OP * not a fun of vehicle driving here10
After playing hours and hours of Arma i still think its a great game. The modding community really keeps it alive.
othing out today touches this game. NOTHING. Been going hard since 144kbps DOOM 4-way Quake1-Netquake Quakeworld. Etc.. You get the point. This is the one and only that stands far out from the rest. Nothing comes even close. I am still awaiting for years the game that can come close. Nothing yet. Huge learning curve thats the only downside so dont be a lazy fk. Those who cant mustard it up have to hack the PBO's are es so watchout for them hackers they are few and far between due to guys who run and operate Breaking Point they are strict.10
1000hrs is a lot of time. Time well spent playing this brilliant bloody game.
ven after a 1000 hours of gameplay I am still finding enjoying and playing new things about this game. The sheer depth of what is available within the Arma community make a good game absolutely amazing. The number of different mods game modes and excellent additions make this a very easy game to find something you will like. Be it pure combat with tanks and helicopters roleplaying and life servers a military simulation community using all the varieties of radios weapons and uniforms DayZ spin offs which have much fewer bugs than the standalone...  The list goes on and on.   I cut my teeth on the Alpha and Beta of  and whilst it struggled at the beginning to make things work properly and to provide a fun experience it has developed into a wonderful addition to my library. So much so that after a couple of years its my most played game. There is literally something for everyone here and it is regularly on at half price. Buy it love it make the most of it.10
 is the best game that ive ever played its a amazing experince that suits every game mode
This is a great game and I would recomend it for anyone who likes tactical shooters or role play. Arma a best when played with friends. The price may look too big but trust me Arma is woth every cent.
ought this game to play Altis Life. Got into a Altis Life server farmed some weed smoked some weed got tazed by a cop named Bubba got  by a cop named Bubba acted as target practice for a cop named Bubba.  10/1010
Is nice even at 10fps
his game is amazing i was a little bit worried about buying this considering its not like amything else i have played before. The closest thing is battlefield but this has way more options for combat and the map scale is huge. My favorite part about this is the excile and dayZ Mods. Team up with a friend and play Dayz Survival you wont regret it!10
80/100
Very happily dropping 500$ into my computer just for this game. :D
Endless amount of fun. There are so so many different game modes. It's fun with friends or solo. The only thing you will have to worry about is the mentally  COD kids on wasteland servers.
ove the game it's mmy new favorite. Iv'e had for three months now and I play alomst everyday with my friend. I actually bought it for him because I wanted to play so much.10
lthough performance gameplay and graphics are still not the best  is one of the best strategic and realistic shooter on the market.  Its mod support and community offer a decent amount of game modes scenarios and other cool stuff giving you the oportunity to play not just a shooter but also an amazing role play game a depressing post apocalypse survival game the most realistic military simulation so far and many other cool things brought to you by the community or Bohemia itself!  If you like strategic or realistic shooter  is a must have! Just go sure and check the system requirements before buying... ;)10
is a sandbox military game which excels in a number of ways. The way the game encourages community-play and user modification is unprecedented. I'll briefly summarize a couple pros and cons.  PROS:   Infinitely customizable. With the in-built editor and SQF scripting language you can make any scenario you can think of.   Thriving modding community. With small mods that change minor gameplay aspects to complete overhauls like CUP and RHS there is an incredible amount of community built content for you to enjoy.   Variety of scenarios. If you want to be a lone wolf in a zombie apocolypse or just a standard rifleman in a huge coordinated operation there are scenarios and groups for you.   CONS:   Almost requires DLC. You can play the game purely vanilla but most servers and communites you find will require at least Apex if not everything else.   Steep learning curve. Being a game with incredible movement controls these controls all require keybinds that need to be learned on top of potentially learning to fly planes and helicopters this could take a while.   In summary  can cost a bit and take a large amount of hard drive space but is extremely rewarding to learn and find a group of people to play with.11
 primarily play Altis Life and where some servers have more rules then others you can definitely feel like a true cop as you tase people for doing absolutely nothing wrong whatsoever. 10/1010
realistic military shooter filled with special children 10/10 i love driving an suv into a chinese military base and dying
his is one of the best simulator games I've ever played. There is so much to do including a single player story mode an editor loads of mods and a ton of multiplayer gamemodes. I highly reccomend playing this game.10
This game contains so much because of the mods     it's awesome
ALthough it falls short in many ways its still a blast to play
Best open world war simulator and installing mods brings a whole new game for you to play

Backwards compatible with all legacy content literally 1000's of weapons vehicles and other assets. A ton of beautiful and vast maps new and legacy. Amazing editor unlimited options in terms of gameplay. Amazing dedicated modding community some incredible mods out there backwards compatible with older mods. Great and varied communities from fun 'Life' and Zombie clans to serious Milsim units. Continuously being tweaked and improved regular and substantial official updates. Fair DLC policy not buying DLC does not stop you from playing with those who do. Combined arms air land and sea. Jet pilot to scuba diver. Realistic ballistics modelling.  This is the one if you have a PC that can run it and you're prepared to get used to the controls there is no limit to what is possible gameplay wise.   Mods include vehicles weapons maps SP/MP missions campaigns Star Wars WW2 'Nam realistic comms systems realistic health management enhanced avatar movement uniforms RTS UI etc etc...  If you like military gaming then you should consider buying  to really appreciate how great this game can be join an active well run community it's the best way to learn about the game and to get the most from it.  9/10 - here's a sweet showcase video that scratches the surface of what's possible in .   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzMBOmOweiE 10
Awesome game! The best you can get in Mil-Sim! Recommend high powered CP though. Takes a good graphics card.
Hands down best game on steam.
Good Game I Love. GGIL
airly realistic military game controls are hard to learn many gamemodes to suit different people. There are servers ranging from mil-sim to DayZ type servers (Exile) to GTA style servers and King of the Hill games. The Apex expansion is very good adding a new interesting detailed map.  A3 Launcher can be used to easily install mods but it does not work for some people.  It's reccommended to have a good group of friends to play with.11
How to play ARMA:  .Skip Tutorial .Go Multiplayer .Dies alot .Go Campaign  .Die .Go scenario .Die .Go tutorial  .Go multiplayer .Repeat
his game can be cancerous at times but its really fun when you run from cops on a go cart.11
Playing Zombie Mission with the squad*  Vito: 'Look guys a chopper! Cover me while I start the engine and fly us out of here!'  *Whole squad creates a perimeter around the chopper shooting at hordes of undead while Vito frantically prepares the chopper for lift-off.*  Vito: 'We are ready to take off everybody get in!'  *Everyone boards the chopper except one indivdual*  Alphamike: 'Drager get the  in the chopper!'  *Zombies begin circling around the chopper closing in quickly.*  Vito: 'I will leave you behind I swear to god!'

Though with my few hours I can honestly say that this game is just amazing. It took me a bit to learn how to play but once you get over the learning curve the game is ing epic. There is a monumental scale of gamemodes all made by the community. I personally enjoy Wasteland a survival situation in which players are thrown onto a random location on the map and are forced to find gear to survive. Others include King of the Hill which is a major action packed gamemode where all gun fire is focused on one city. It's hectic. Though the price is a bit high you might think. The game is well worth the money for how much fun you will have.
Really Love This Game.  But Is A Lot Better When Using Mods Like Exile.
uy this  homie amazing game bruh10
ith the 64bit update my machine finally runs smooth as butter Worth every single penny.10
his game is frustrating it's dowright infuriating at times.  And I absolutely love it.  Oh it has a steep learning curve. It's a big hill to climb before you learn all the controls then get used to the somewhat bizarre controls (especially if you're coming at it from other FPS's). And the pace is very different from your CoDs and Battlefields and whatnot.  But this isn't trying to be those games. It is not a shooter it's a simulation. And it's the best one there is.  - It's a true sandbox game. From the campaign to the multiplayer. And there's nothing like it out there.   - The standard map Altis is a replica of the real-world island of Lemnos. And me and my mates love it so much we're saving up to go there on holiday.  - You can do whatever you please. The scouting missions in singleplayer let you explore the map and do missions the multiplayer opens up the entire map and lets you do whatever.  - Bohemia are absolute darlings and are doing a fantastic job. Have been for years. The community is beautiful from the players to the modders.   Oh and one of the devs got arrested for 'espionage' while visiting the island for research. That's how committed these people are.   TL;DR:  Joined a squad as a medic. Saved about 12 people then got shot... a squadmate carried me on his back a full kilometre to get revived by another medic.  11/10 would get shot again.10
Best game ever! Amazing for roleplay
or £44. I've expected more But the workshop items make up for it.10
ith proper mods and good community this is the only war game you need.10
layed most of my hours in  Battle Royale and it has been an absolute blast. Took some time getting the fps stable enough but that I can live with:) Tactical adrealin pumping and realistic combat simulator!  10
 great open world military simulator that allows players to go and create their own content game modes and missions. It is good possibly even better that is has been the day it came out. With the APEX DLC released it was made  almost a whole new game with a new map vehicles weapons and characters.10
Trust Bohemia they are engineer.
It Good Game
One of the best games i've ever played
well its  one of the best games ive ever played
what can i say ? this game has endless things to do i highly would suggest this game.
I have played a couple hours and it seems ok i guess.
ery good game a lot to do on here. Worth a buy:D10
is by far the best sandbox game I have played. The mods are just out the  so many different game modes/game genres. It feels like 10 games in one deff worth the money. It is also a beautiful game. Very Demanding game.I have a GTX 1060 and on 1080p it has hicups on ultra but its still beautiful.10
 hate this game so much and I love it in the same time. :)11
ove this game Im currently running my own Altis Life server.!10
Great game with many hours of fun to come!
Gr8 2 play m8.  Buy dis ples
reat game with many memes in it 10/1010
With this game and it's great (modding) community only the sky is the limit. This is truly a 'Be all you want to be' game.
8000 hours and still playing.....but I am weird like that
Nice game
Good Game Open world And nice with a lot of weapons from the futre
I play this game a lot and after all this time I still do. I will also probably never stop
This game deserves the 'BEST USE OF A FARM ANIMAL' Steam Award.   Never before have I encountered more terrifying rabbits.
Olympus Sucks
Best headache simulator for server admins
The. Best. Game. Ever.     *Drops mic*
Good game. Decent Engine. Realistic af. Altis Life - is v/good. Exile - is v/good.  Decent community. Hardly any hackers. Lots of mods.  good
very realistic
Best game for realism shooters! Not even compared to Battlefield. I loved playing the campaign and I love playing multiplayer! Just joined to a milsim unit and every week I do at least 3 drills.
rove a car at 65 mph straight into a tree car blew up and the tree survived.  10/1010
This game made me  5 times in 5 MINUTES!   No Sign Up No t No Download   Download NOW for FREE HD PORN Game!  *terribly animated porno GIF here*
reat game but heavy for many PC!10
ONE OF THE FUNNIEST GAMES YOUR EVER PLAY no lie you wont regret this purchase hmu if you wanna play sometimes
reat game what more. Just need a decebt pc10
reat game it doesn't matter if you want to shoot a gun fly a jet or drop troops off in a helo. You can dowhatever you want in this game. There are even mods to go fishing...imagine that!  I will update this when I have the time I have to play some more. Gotta get up to 2000 hours to meet target set by other players.10
RMA III's graphics are amazing the community made missions are awesome and the maps currently in the game are very pretty. There isn't much to the vanilla singleplayer they are currently developing the campaign and have only released one 'episode' of it so far but there are plenty of brilliant singleplayer and multiplayer missions available on the Steam Workshop. They developers have done a great job at making this as realistic and immersive as possible. Rating: 10 slithering snakes out of 10.  Update: 11/25/2016 Above and beyond what could have been expected from any developer working on a military sim like this with continued plans for future content release.10
One of the best realism simulators out there. Workshop content makes hours of fun with friends as well as helps the more advanced servers you can find out there.
Great game which is made well worth it by the many mods available for it!.
its a fun game but you need a good pc to play it. the fun you can have depends on what you like but in the end its all about the gunplay. unless you lioke the rp mods as there are a lot of them out there
wesome game overall. Great graphics ballistics everything is great. Yes it is complicated it might be hard to get into it at first but belive me it is worth it if you like realism. Also one of the best gaming communities especially if you join the vast world of Milsim/Tactical Realism units. Oh did i mention how awesome the mods are?. Worth every penny10
By far one of the best game's of all time. It is not only just a milsim but a platform for hundreds of other different game types. such as the life mod or king of the hill. I would deffinently reccomend this game to anyone who has a resonable PC. I could play this game forever as the community and bohemia are actively working on new game types mods etc to provide a deeper expansion of the game.
LC DLC everywhere! xd11
ood game with friends very moddable if you like a game with variying pace this is for you.10
The most fun you can have with your pants on!
This game is best enjoyed with some mods that add extra realism on top of the game already being quite realistic. It is by far one of the best Army simulators out there and will remain so for a while.
o glitches just features. 10/1010
n amazing game! Millitary sandbox with many game modes. Milsim Roleplaying TDM and Capture the Hill. This game is for everyone!10
est war simulator marry me.10
ne of the best games i ever playedso many modsmissions..every pearson can find somethink in arma that can enjoy10
antastic game. I played so many shooters but this game.. .. definitely takes the cake. It feels so realistic. The visuals and the audio all look and feel so authentic. You may encounter few hiccups and some FPS drop on certain servers but all-in-all this game is by far the best tactical shooter I've ever played. I highly recommend this game! The devoloper cares about the game and the DLCs are nice. The community mods are incredible and the soundtrack is just amazing. Gameplay is very fun engaging and the environment is so immersive. The map is huge and there's weather and day/night system. There are various combat land air and sea vehicles. I have more than 1000 hours on record and I am totally addicted to this game. 9/1010
This game is amazing especially if you like to do some rp then just buy the game.
10/100
You can almost do everything! But the most inportat is... YOU CAN KILL RABBITS!!!  Just get this game. its awesome!    10/10
low= 18 fps ultra = 30 FPS  GJ bohemia
This game is fun to play but it has steep learning curve. And some may say dlc are must and that's somewhat the case but personally I don't regret buying any of them.
ve played more Arma series games than all the other games put together. That says something about replayability. If you like being part of a team limitless opportunities and of course shooting stuff - this game is for you.  It's vastly extended by numerous mods missions and scripts. You can create your own no matter how skilled in programming you are. It's almost like playing modern D&amp;D.10
reat game when you have alot of time to put into it would defenilty recommend it if you like tactical games.10
Weapon 3 is the most buggy game ever! Rsrs For those who like war simulation and have patience with the game breaks and slowness (if you do not have a ing machine) you will love it!
10/10 with with nice mods
ost versatile game ever. You can be everything from a guy earning cash by picking apples to Katniss Everdeen.10
i think this game should win because it never gets old.
beyond repair.
 is a love hate relationship. Once you figure out the basic controls for each type of system its a blast. The most recent DLC APEX is amazing and just feels really refined. If you dont like twitch shooters and you like to think about your move before you make it. This is the game for you!
ing Love This Game This Is the only game i play omg who ever made this thank you soo much
This is a must-have game for everyone that is interested in modern war and such.
is by far my favorite game to date considering it's Realism Graphics Features and of course all the Mods that add on to the nearly endless amount of things you can do with the Base Game's Eden Editor and Zeus mode.  The only thing i can say that 'may' frustrate some is the learning curve but with the Virtual Reality Training Simulator it will teach you all you really need to know from Compensating bullet drop to Crash Landing a helicopter if you're Rotor is damaged. (However the Learning Curve is what makes Arma well Arma)  Aside from that i must say that the game always stays fun and HELLA CHAOTIC (especially in online multiplayer) because this is not just someone shooting at you from a distance or calling in an artillery strike with some binocluars. There is a  across the ridge who spotted you and is calling out the compass bearings to reveal your position so his buddies can light your  up or he is calling out your exact coodinates (or your Grid) so that some  in an artillery truck miles away can nail your position exactly. So when  goes down in this game  GOES DOWN.   The maps on this game by the way are absolutely massive Atlis clocking in at about 250 sq km Stratis at 20 sq km and Tanoa (the new DLC map) 100 sq km. All consisting of different terrain from A large hill country feel in Stratis more flat land in Atlis but strongly representing a wartorn country and Tanoa having a very dense Jungle terrain with many islands to be explored and its very own guerilla faction and Nato (Pacific) and CSAT (Pacific).  Vehicles in this game feel VERY real opposed from most other games. Tanks will have a Commander Seat Driver Seat Gunner Seat and Passenger seats (all having their own role) and goes the same for most other vehicles such as a jet fighter or a helicopter where you will most likely have a Co-Pilot or multiple gunners. Controls are a bit more tedious but allow for much more control and flexibility on most vehicles.  All in all  is by far my favorite game to date and im sure it will stay that way for a long time the devs keep up to date with patch updates and bug fixes and the community is always active and consistently putting out new mods. 3 years after Release the graphics still amaze me and the game itself always stays fresh.  10/10 would crash land a helicopter in the jungle to be chased and killed by guerilla fighters again.10
This game is quite good should buy if u have the money and love war/military stuff
You're getting  on but it's funny somehow.
nother case of 'download mods for several days then play for several hours repeat'10
his is The best Realistic military game u ever can get! it got so damn much!!! And it is so fun to play with friends dont matter what game style u have u can play in a clan Or u can play with friends and just bombing towns! :D10
the best and most friendly community i've seen in a long time. Also i havent played it much but i am really impressed by it
t's a pretty good game if you enjoy playing with pizza faced nerds and danny devito. i on the otherhand prefer to play the more tactical 'Simcity 2000'. it's a real game for real gamers like me and not a casual like you.10
like real life but only better
imply the best game ever - Only with mods. Without mods it is still a great game.10
very nice game
nce you taste  there's no going back to games like Battlefield and Call of duty.   You have ascended the stairs to adulthood.11
It's awesome ;P
seems like a good game unfortunately it is proving to be nearly impossible to play any missions with just two people. I have the APEX edition and I see the features like the class creator then when I get into the game I realize that there is no way for me to actually be able to use the custom classes I create in game! Which is incredibly frustrating. 'Oh you want to play a mission that would be perfect for sniping? Well we will make sure that you can only use an assualt rifle and an ACOG in EVERY MISSION!' That is the unfortunate message that I am getting from the game. If ANYONE CAN HELP please do so. I think it could be a very enjoyable game IF it had some simple features such as the ability to actually play the way you want to play.   Thanks10
Best tatical shooter / military sim out there!
I dont know what to think about this game didnt play it much but meh i kinda like it.
Pretty nice military simulator
its vry relistic and kewl
Adictive.
why not
s much as I wish that BI would add more modern weapons I know they added the AR-15 platform to the game with the Apex DLC and there are mods but this game is pretty damn good even without them.10
f you like running simulators where you'll occasionally get sniped from 2000 meters away this is the game for you.10
mazing game but its not for everyone.  :)10
ou wont get bored of this game. There's just too much to do. You need a fairly decent PC to play some of the large multiplayer servers but it's no big deal. I've had a blast on this game and I plan to for a long time. Recommend this to anyone looking for lots of fun and some very weird and unique people. Roleplay Battle Royale [Hunger Games] Wasteland &amp; King Of The Hill are just some of the amazing game modes.   That's all.10
Pretty realistic graphics bro...
his is a great game with tons of mods to keep u going forever. Some people complain about the DLC and it being to pricy but this game is like BFCODGTAH1Z1DayZRTS combined and if u put those titles alone together wich will give u less play hours ull be spending allot more money on those even if u bought the entire  collection at full price.  Totally worth the money. And if its on sale. 100% must buy.10
est combat simulator ever. If you're looking for something that nears realism this is the best choice you have.10
A game that teaches you what working as a team and communication means.5/5
layed a little has some replayability.11
wesome game only requires a good pc.10
ot shot at by an AA gun 20 times as a rifleman and not once as a pilot. Also you can now play as an Operator Waifu. 11/10 game would mod a completely broken experience into semi playability again.10
Never actually really got to play the game :/ 2.6 hours of trying to load it xDDDDDDD
Amazing game. From starting your own mission to bombing the next enemy next to you. This game has a few ups and downs with its modding system but I stronly recommend this game to those who love open world and action games. You can make your own world. It's just in a click of a button. I will just sum up why this game is extraordinary. Pros: -Hours of non-stop exploring and editing -Barely any bugs or glitches -Graphics are insane for a big game like this -Animations are insane  Cons: -Driving controls need to be fixed -Complicated Loadout  This game is truely worth your money!
onestly the only problems with this game is that the game is horribly optimized and has very little content in the base game don't get me wrong there's lots of stuff to do and this game is the definition of replayability but there's simply not that many vehicles and you'll find yourself using the same guns over and over again. However you can always mod the game but for someone who don't wan't to do that well then you're out of luck there's just not much to play with in the base. I personaly mod the game so I don't have this problem but I didn't before and to honest the base version is very 'meh'. But all in all this game is as solid as any and for a cheaper price than COD or BF you are going to have a lot more fun even without mods.10
 love the Arma series.  definitely my favorite in the series by far it has so much detail in it and it's extremely community friendly. The game isn't just a MilSim it's also a Zombie survival game a kart racing game an RTS game a role-playing game and much much more. The massive multiplayer online community for this game has thrived off of it's community created and endorsed custom multiplayer modes like classic  DayZ Altis Life Wasteland or even Battle Royale. There's plenty of servers to join and plenty of gamemodes to try. All of them have their own unique kinks and features to make it a completely unique experience from the base game. There's even a massively in-depth editor mode in which you can create your own singleplayer or multiplayer scenarios using all the assets in the game ranging from soldiers to scuba-submarines. With tonnes of script functionality implemented into the game the editor truly is an endless pool of opportunities. The game as a whole is amazingly worth the base price itself but if you can grab it on sale (especially the Winter or Summer sale) then it's an absolute steal. The only thing to look out for when purchasing this game are the minimum requirements. It takes a pretty good PC to run this game so make sure you have a proper set up before you invest into this game other than that it's fantastic and I highly reccomend it to anyone that enjoys any kind of First Person Shooter experience.10
some how i have this game?
Pro: Mods Explosions Overwhelming Mods Guns More Mods Nice campaign story Still more mods Trolling 5 year olds who plays the game(rare) Beating the  out of people in editor  Cons: Mods that take up half of your harddrives ing Miller.....   52351/10 Would shoot Kerry if he doesn't stop complaining again
 Fun game I love how I can run around and pretend I'm actually there! To bad the AI are quite bad all-in-all great game!11
-shot down a heli -same guy i shot down came back -as i shot down another heli the wreckage landed on him -10/10 would rek again
1000 hours in glorious 20 fps
Do you like dying a lot?   !   Do you like military stuff?   !   Do you like to slaughter rabbits?   !  Do you like to pilot planes?   !   Do you like to watch the sunset?   !   You don't like doing any of this? Buy  anyway cause it's one of the best sandbox game out there!   Originally posted by  Københaffn'Härvy buksvåger? :
This game is definately not your standard cod run and gun type of game. You are forced to use tactics and the enviroment around you to gain the advantage and with all the multiplayer content as well as custom missions/mods you will never get bored.
it pretty god
est Military Third/Fps game ever Ground breaking graphics makes war even real  tactics and planning every step you take is awesome  Great war atmosphere  Unlike Cod/Battlefield You have to be aware in Every step you take Cuz You can be shot 400 miter away . Best Simulation Game Ever. XD10
Best game in my life@_@
layed a bunch of Arma 2 when it came out finally got the money for this and i love it10
wish i could play. every time i try to load the game it gets stuck on loading profile options it's annoying
ore options for play style than any other game I know of. Air combat (to be expanded upon) infantry and armored assault and even water ops. The best modding community out there a great base game and it runs great (you just have to not run everything on 200% sampling like most of the negative reviewers do).10
Good game needs some performace working thou
he Next Game in the series brings you to a new rual area map Altis and Stratis bring you many rocky/moutain areas with a set of new vehicles. Damage has been modified to bring a more realistic feeling when getting shot or smashing a vehicle into the wall. with the new adjustments to the campaign theres more tactics and desions to include. With  there are many new modding abilities that can be brought to the table; wether your wanting to kill zombies or have miltary secenarios such as cap the points or destroy a radio tower while getting shot by helicopters and tanks or even play Life mods the choice is yours10
hen you're not getting killed by a door or suffering from 10 FPS on your £3000 Ultra-Advanced Gaming PC this game offers a lot of fun through semi-realistic combat and a wide range of game modes.   Multiplayer is what makes the game. Offline game modes are mainly used for practice as the campaign is pretty basic in story and character detail. However it's hard to get bored of everything that multiplayer has to offer; Altis Life RPG Wasteland Exile Invade &amp; Annex you name it.   The gameplay mechanics are the worst part of the game. You really can die by opening a bloody door albeit rare. Not to mention the driving physics. It can be very tough to drive using just W A S and D. Even crashing into a rock that appears as though it just 'Came outta nowhere!' at 5MPH can do severe damage to your car and health. The game's packed with glitches.   Aside from the occasional buggy annoyance if you're looking for a war simulator that allows a range of unique experiences  is probably your best bet.10
y friend stole this guys car. In an attempt to get his car back this guy drove into his own car with a quad bike and died11
wesome game Takes a few hours of playing to get comfortable with the controls but game play is great haven't had a dull moment it's all been a BLAST. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a more team emphasized game.10
 do recommend this game but there is something that you need to know about this game.... This game is not the most optimized game out there your PC might struggle like hell. You can enjoy this game if your PC specs meet the requirement even so you might face FPS drop during gameplay (explosion etc.). This game is CPU intensive if you experience FPS drop there's a chance it is caused by your CPU (unless you set the graphics all the way to high then your GPU might be the case too).  This is a military simulation game if you like games like Call of Duty (and used to it) you might not like this game however if you want to try something new then this game is worth a shot. This game has limited HUD there is no minimap and if somebody is shooting you will not be given a hint and you will need to find the source yourself. You will be given a compass to help you to locate yourself and to give other people hints about the location of the enemy. Every single bullet counts I mean 1-3 shots can kill somebody do not spray and pray. You will not be given a hint about your location so you need to be observant and check your surrounding.  One big problem about this game is.... There is no melee so you can't kill other players with a knife it can be a huge turn off for some people (I am one of those people) nevertheless it is less likely that you will use melee in the game it is most likely a gunfight.  If you want a shooter game and want to spice things up then  could be the game for you if you are still unsure then you can check some YouTube videos and see it for yourself. This game is hard the control buttons are many (I highly recommend newcomers to go to the tutorial first) before going into the campaign or multiplayer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My PC specs can be seen in my profile just to let you know how well this game run at least in this setup. I can play this game in Ultra settings.10
ts like Arma 2 Except its  so its better11
ith +900 hours of game time..   It is a game worth having. If you are new to the Arma series or just  in paticular it is a worth while experience.  With all the mods different game types and friends made while playing it's a game I dont regret buying.10
 really like Arma But Since they keep updating and the other game franchies are giving their DLC's for free. pretty much I think that they should eventually give the Apex out for people or at least make the Other DLc's such as Marksman Karts Helicopters free because the market on their prices on Apex is more then 20 bucks in my eyes. I think that it would be kinda awesome to see that the DLC's should come out free for owners that have had  before there biggest update. If not then I would say that reduce the prices on the Steam Store. Sure the sales are nice But it only goes down lower to 20 bucks Which its way expensive for its DLC. Plus Since their Marksman Helicopter and Karts. They should be free by now because Apex is pretty much the biggest DLC and most expensive. 30$ Bucks.10
Least kids ive seen in an online game ever.
est ing Military Simulator out there. Only problem terribly optimized game. SP Can run extremely well but MP will destroy your frames. Get a decent PC before playing this. 10
is a game with many fun mods like Exile Wasteland Arma Life ECT. if you into complicated styled games I reccomend picking it up when its on sale for like 30 bucks.10
ou're either going to tear your hair out or be hooked in the first half hour.10
ave had the game since 1st round of Alpha &amp; had Arma 2 OA before that. Intially I liked ARMA due tot he Milsim but only played Arma 2 Free which wasn't that good.    was a revolutionary step forward especially with many of the server lag fixes &amp; better movement.   The DLC has been a bit of a disappointment as between RHS &amp; CUP I don't see anything that I need missing.   I did buy APex forgetting that RHS has the AK 104 which is essentially the same as the AK-12.   I'm putting in a refund as no mil sim I play with uses Tanoa &amp; no servers really do either.   I would rate the base game a 5/5 &amp; the DLC a 3/5 so overall 4/5.   I would buy the base game &amp; download   CBA  CUP  RHS  &amp;  Enhanced Movement.10
t's a great game but it takes a beefy pc to run it somewhat smoothly if I was to buy it again I would wait until the framerate issues get better than their current state.10
Awsome game... buy it
good game but the combat isn't as good as i thought it would be
A great millitary sim. It really demands the use of team work and strategy
LOVE IT! Just the servers and mods are a bit confusing
ou like being a soldier?  You enjoy playing in a clan? You want almost full Realism?  50 - 200m are close quarters for you? Get this Masterpiece!  (Except if youre an Altis Life Wasteland Exile etc.  go suck a keyboard)11
he most realistic military simulator I know. Better than CoD and other cheap shooter games which focus only on shooting and weapons instead of other elements such as exhaustion tactical movement strategy etc...10
Pretty good I guess.
A game where you can do anything except having more than 30 FPS... AND jumping.
I've only spent a few hours on it but from what i've seen it's pretty good.
 wanted to play a game were i could snipe but realisticly most people told me to play battlefield 4 or battlefield 1 but tbh it wasnt good enough so i went and asked a couple friends and they said  and ive only been playing it for 23.6 hours but i feel like ive played so much already like in KOTH( King of the Hill) i already have enough money to buy a sniper plus a scope im looking forward to shooting some people in the face.

The cluster shells are amazing. Made a flaming car hit a guy.
he best words to describe this game are incredible. I've played  for quite a while now a total of about 1410 hours now and it is definetly one of the best games that I've ever played if not the best.  Like shooters?   Like Roleplay?   Like Strategy?   Like MilSims?   This game offers it all!!11
ad a great experience in this gameplenty of details in arma3so impressive!10
s always this still is the best military simulator in the world! ArmA keeps affascinating me for its realism. I really suggest you to buy the game if you're a 'fan of war' real war. The maps are really detailed and the AI is really ! Actually too much but there are mods that can help you resolve that problem. Anyway if you buy this game PLAY IT WITH A CLAN.  really makes you cooperate with other people in order to survive and complete your mission. if you're a CoD fan you rather change side or forget about ArmA. They are completely different and ArmA itself is usually not liked by 'shoot and run' fan boys. However ArmA's editor allows you to create your own missions in every detail. Actually it's not too simple making them but with some commands and other stuff you can start making some nice missions and enjoy the game with your friends. Furthermore there are tons of forums and people that can help you improve your editing skills providing you with commands suggestions and scripts. ENJOY.10
Do not get this game if you wish to have a normal life.  10/10 would waste life again.
layed a couple of hours... It was alright I guess.11
this game is dope
Operating operators operating operationally meets special needs children walking with their asscheeks.
mulation isn't the defining aspect of . It's scale.  The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios topographical maps binoculars and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies muzzle flashes tracers and gunsmoke.   represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series. Unbelievable dynamic lighting a volumetric cloud system genuine vehicle physics 3D weapon optics ragdoll noticeably improved weapon audio and other grainy eye-level details await scrutiny inside 's macro elegance. The best improvement is the merciful cutting of Arma 2's rigid Tin-Man-without-oil combat animations which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands.  A half-year in paid pre-release has given  time to gestate but the final build is far from being a comprehensive reinvention of the series and some long-standing blemishes that arise from its nature as a gargantuan simulation linger. Even on high-end hardware the framerate dips under the spectacle of some multiplayer missions. Friendly AI units though marginally better-behaved still depend on the player to be their brains an issue that's circumvented by playing Arma the way God intended it cooperatively.10
it crashes more often than Paul Walker but except from that its okay  see you again/10
This game is very open and has so many different things to do
reat game still trying to figure out some things about the game tho XD but great game10
got arrested on a role player server for-  6 counts of murder with vehicle 3 counts of grand theft 1 count of nudity 1 count of asking the admin for a handjob  3 counts of escaping arrest  11/10 better than gta
est game ever I recomend geting while its on sale :D
ne of the best games available. The amount of things that can be done with this game is just amazing. There's a really active Modding Community for this game wich constantly creates new content be it Star Wars Mods Halo Dinosaurs Zombies new Cars Equipment Island or just simple retextures - there's always something new to discover!  Another good thing is that you'll never get bored! There's a lot of public servers running gamemodes like KotH Wasteland or Altis Life and even more Communities you can join wich are hosting Events and big Operations. On top of that there is also the Editor where you can create own Scenarios or Gamemodes or you can just try and do supid stuff (simply for the fun of it).  In the workshop you can find a lot of good missions to try as well as a lot of new content to explore and if that's not enouh for you then there's also armaholic!  All in all this is a wonderful game wich can keep you entertained for countless hours...10
imply the best close to realistic shooter you are going to play. So many different mods that are great and frustrating but brilliant. So many hours wasted I mean used playing zombie type mods and KOH. Love it! :D10
This game is harder than Jared Fogle's  in a preschool. 5/5 stars.
Would this work on a mac
It was ok I guess..
est game i ever played plan to play it MUCH more when i get a powerful pc10;0
ou know i was originally on the fence about how i felt about games like arma i never really cared for them outside of using them to play dayz holy ing  what a waste of time it was to use them for that and that only only recently have i begun playing more arma and less dayz  then i wanted  almost bought it for full price got it for 40 bucks the next day AND got the rest of the expansions for arma 2 these are actually really fun games 10;0
antastic game. This has come on leaps and bounds form Arma 2.   Beautiful graphics challenging combat and a good variety of missions in the campaign.10;0
espite the whole 'play as a soldier' part to it there are many servers that offer a new way to play with the use of roleplaying as a cop a rebel or even a paramedic and taking the game to a different level10;0

t's a very extensive game with amazing gameplay and teamplay however i would like to see a more AAA type game within it like a cinematic campaign with the first mision being a stealth escape froma camp MGS style and then as you go you unlock more equipment guns vests and uniforms anything really. this would be an awesome feature within this amazing original game.10

layed a couple of hours... It was alright I guess.11
if u have an amazingly good processor and graphics card this game is for u
 game where you can get sexually violated ingame but still feel like it happened in real life.10
his game is a dream come true for me! This is probably the most realistic combat simulator I have ever played! Being able to play on real photo accurate locations is really fun and awesome especially when you take the vast size of the maps into consideration! My favorite part of this game are the 2D and 3D editor tools that are provided with the game it allows you to create just about any scenario you can think of! Have you ever wanted to experience a stealth night operation as a scuba diver and wipe out patrols? Or have you ever wanted to experience a full on war with combined operations such as hundreds of ground units armored vehicles and aircraft? OR have you ever wanted to design a fortress that you and your AI team has to defend from hundreds of invading enemies? Well all of this and much MUCH more is possible with the easy to use editor tools!  Also I have come to the conclusion that 's AI is the most advanced versitile and smartest AI than any other game has to offer I was extremely surprised when I hand-placed a bunch of jets in an airbase to see the AI know how to actually taxi the jets to the runway strip and take off in an orderly fashion without running into each other or other obstacles during the whole process!! Also I didn't even place any waypoints or create any scripts for them it was all the AI!!! The AI can adapt to pretty much any situation and will follow orders from you if you are the leader of the group. Plus it is really fun to watch independent AI squads battle it out without your interactions the AI squad leaders will actually command their units (even you if you are part of their squad!) in any situation!  The multiplayer is very fun you can play in a variety of servers that could involve capturing territories fighting AI role playing combined operations with over a hundreds of players or all of the above combined!!  Lastly this is more of a thank you towards Bohemia Interactive: As someone who strongly supports the United States Military and has 3 brothers in the Army I thank you for your bold brave and admirable move to not include female soldiers in this game I understand that society is trying to move in that 'accepting' 'politically correct' and 'equality' direction but this whole movement is proving to be VERY troublesome and problematic for the United States Military. Ask any American male soldier who has actually fought in combat overseas what they think of allowing female soldiers fight by their sides they will ALL say that it is not good and that they rather keep females off the battlefields. Unfortunately American society doesn't understand the fact that females naturally do not have the capability of controlling their emotions under stressful and dangerous situations as well as males can. There have been MANY recorded events that involve female soldiers putting their battle partners in grave danger during combat situations due to letting their emotions control them. I understand that this is just a video game but it still does matter A LOT what developers do with their games because you would be really surprised how many young men and women go to enlist for the military just because of movies or video games honestly it is really quite sad.  So thank you Bohemia Interactive for making such a good game you guys are making excellent bold moves which I believe sets a great example of how other developers should operate and not fall into the common traps set by society. Thank you!  James Glenn10
his is the ultimate military simulator. While the new physics can be buggy and sometimes the desync acts up It's still a great game for all you can do with it.10
robably the best shooter out there. Loads of things are possible within the game. A lot of gamemodes for example roleplay games.10
I play this more than I play real life.... I guess that's saying something
f it's military realism you're looking for look no further. With a modding scene that adds everything from Star Wars and Mechs to the entire US Army vehicle and weapons sets  is an absolute playground for those wanting to experience everything and anything to do with weapons military vehicles and more.  If you can imagine it there's a strong chance you can do it in . Constant updates increase the value and rich experience of the game and new DLC bring further incredible assets to play around with. Highly recommended!10
very good game.  good graphics

bsolutely fantastic game almost everything is implemented and executed perfectly.  10/1010
Its 10/10 to be honest. I rate it.   10/10 should download
aven't fully explored the game yet hold on for the review.10
owns my life no matter how mad I get at it sometimes I'll always love it regardless. There is a endless amount of content due to mods that make this game even more amazing. It doesn't matter if your hardcore singleplayer like me or if hardcore multiplayer there are gamemodes and scenarios for everyone. If you survival there's a server for that if you love zombies there's a server for that if you love realistic combat scenarios there's a server for that if you love roleplay there's a server for that. If you're looking for a shooter that gives you a challenge but sometimes you like a break  is your game I've played it for a little over 500 hours in about 2 years and I've enjoyed every second. All the death the heart attacks when someone nearly shoots my head and to all the people I've shot I love all of it. The one thing however that bothers me the most is the ing DLC but it's such a minor thing but when you do actually go to pick up a certain weapon and it tells you that you can't because you require a certain DLC it will make you want to blow your brains out. But even the DLC  will stay my favorite shooter for a very long time10
is great. the community is awesome alwasy coming out with new content. game optimation isnt the best but hey the game is still a blast when you are playing with your friends.10
 do like this game although it is hard for some computers to handle it is fun. I like it becuase of the Exile mod which is a survival mod i love survival games so it fits right. I suggest this game to others try it out I bet you'll like it.10
Better than ARMA 2 but has a pretty gross DLC plan.
Try to be best ‘Cause you're only a man And a man's gotta learn to take it Try to believe Though the going gets rough That you gotta hang tough to make it History repeats itself Try and you'll succeed Never doubt that you're the one And you can have your dreams! You're the best! Around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down You're the Best! Around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down You're the Best! Around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down Fight ‘til the end Cause your life will depend On the strength that you have inside you Ah you gotta be proud Starin' out in the cloud When the odds in the game defy you Try your best to win them all And one day time will tell When you're the one that's standing there You'll reach the final bell! You're the best! Around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down You're the Best! Around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down You're the Best! Around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down You're the best! Around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down You're the Best! Around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down You're the Best! Around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down Fight ‘til you drop Never stop Can't give up Til you reach the top (FIGHT!) You're the best in town (FIGHT!) Listen to that sound A little bit of all you got Can never bring you down You're the best! Around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down You're the Best! Around!
Lots of fun but actually getting into a game takes forever
A very good game. Way better than Call of Duty and Battlefield.
Best game 2016 Many great game modes 1600 hours + and still counting buy it
his is maybe the best war simulator out there you should try it though the multiplayer requires a lot of DLC but it is worth its money when you 'can' get into a server its fun as hell and the campagin THE BEST THING EVER anyway this is what I think  is like and I think you should get it I would recommend this too my friends and everyone.10

Get this if you are looking for the biggest bang for your buck!
Probably one of the best games ever made. Love the variety of mods etc
had a cheat on dayz 3 years ago didnt realise i was on this account while buying  3/3 would buy agian
 Great game the addons are a little confusing when trying to join multiplayer servers though. Its hard but meant to be realistic.10
a huge game in itself with like 200 other games inside of it and the scariest and most realistic sounds / gameplay
f you've ever wanted to play a game where you'll never be able to see who's shooting you because they're half a kilometer away then this is for you. I can't mention how frusterated this game has made me yet I seem to always come back. I come back because while this game is very difficult and very confusing for new players it's also very rewarding. Once you get the hang of the controls (which there a ridiculous amount of that can glady be rebinded) you'll feel amazing that you finally blew that  that kept sniping you across the maps head off. Thats not the only thing that I love about this game. It has a huge amount of customizability. There are so many cool well done mods out there that you can pretty much do whatever you want. You can even put models and textures from the Halo game series in here.  also has a community that is relativily active that welcomes anyone to play. I haven't encountered one  on here since I've been playing. Its all just good fun. Now the only negatives that I can think of is the developers aren't very keen on good content. Some of the DLC is questionable and probably should just be free updates or already in the game. Otherwise this is a really great game.10
Its like skyrim but in the future 10/10 -IGN
ant to shoot soldiers?  has LOTS of those. Want to shoot zombies?  has you covered. Want to shoot dinosaurs? Yep it has them too. Want to shoot Santa? You can do it in  but watch out next Christmas. Tired of all the shooting? Well  also has go-carts!  Someone took a kids toybox and made a fantastic military game out of it.10
espite the whole 'play as a soldier' part to it there are many servers that offer a new way to play with the use of roleplaying as a cop a rebel or even a paramedic and taking the game to a different level10
Traded in my social life (or whatever there is of it) for  Life.
the most realistic war game ever
he best words to describe this game are incredible. I've played  for quite a while now a total of about 1410 hours now and it is definetly one of the best games that I've ever played if not the best.  Like shooters?   Like Roleplay?   Like Strategy?   Like MilSims?   This game offers it all!!11
ad a great experience in this gameplenty of details in arma3so impressive!10
The most fun you can have with your clothes on.
I have missed many life events because of this game.......not even mad
Neat.
A cheaper and longer lasting GF replacement.
ARMA IS LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
30 out of 30 fps
 watch this video at least twice daily and I think it’s finally time for me to chime in. Over the years this clip has come to mean pure suffering to me and yet I cannot and WILL NOT stop watching. I have accepted the fact that I will never be Anne Hathaway’s forward young man that is not the problem. How could I be? I’m nothing like this interviewer. I simply do not have this dumb ’s exquisite genes and playful personality quite the contrary. If you need to know I’m a fat balding piece of human garbage living in a turd of a city and working at a dead-end customer service job for a greedy insurance company. My entire role there consists of telling people about the technicalities used to deny them coverage so I know a thing or two about misery. I’m a broken man inside and out with few if any reasons to live and yet my personal suffering is increased tenfold by knowing that I will never get even a whiff of Anne Hathaway’s soiled panties. I can tell you exactly what they look like for I have pondered it. Anne is a simple woman yet she is elegant also. Therefore her panties reflect these qualities. She would never debase herself with the likes of a “g-sting” or a “thong-style” garnment. No my friends hers are of simple white cotton: clean classic tasteful and with a small but noticeable urine spot in the crotchal area. Would that this video were in smellovision so I could finally realize my one and only dream of knowing her personal scent suicide myself and truly die a happy man. Is that too much to ask? One freakin’ whiff of Annie’s juices? I mean come on Redbull should get on that ASAP. It’s great to see a triple backflip or whatever but I have an actual physical NEED for the smell of those panties. It boggles the mind that one of those visionary companies such as Google or SpaceX hasn't rolled out SOME version of the smellovision by now. In the 21st century it is absolutely unacceptable that we don’t have access to this technology. It is criminal. How dare humanity presume to explore space map the earth or cure deadly diseases when we can’t even conquer “the gap”? These ingenious fools need to get their  together and hurry because the window of opportunity is closing. Don’t get me wrong the Hathmonster is still fertile and fresh. As a matter of fact I would argue that the organs are in their prime but there is a lot of work to be done here. The technology for smellovision is not even near ready to provide the goods. It still needs to be developped tested and rolled out on a massive scale. Even then I doubt that the queen of smells would submit to a thorough and invasive panty-scan willingly (she’s too sophisticated for that) so we need to make advances in the field that would allow for telesopic smell capture or even x-ray smell replication. We’re two steps behind and it is simply frightening. The reality is that we might never get to dowload a perfectly compiled fragrance-code of her odorous  and enjoy it in our homes. It’s a long shot but maybe if everyone thumbed up this comment we could finally raise awareness on this issue. Maybe Richard Branson would see it and realise how urgent the situation is. Millions of people are dumping buckets on their head for some made up disease and meanwhile I can’t even get a retweet for my #SpreadTheSmell campaign? How is that fair? I can’t even get ONE lousy sniff? Why would God even put me on this ing earth??10
 really enjoy this game i will admit tho it is alot better with mods installed10
f you like tactical  military or stategy games purchase it you damn !!! The only thing that i didnt like it  was that the servers sometimes are scrap ;p10
Looks like a great game and I have really enjoyed the previous incarnations (still playing ARMA2 Operation Arrowhead) although htere seems to be hardly any scenarios in this version. Certainly I think I prefer the desert scenarios in OA. I would be hard pressed to point out anything major that this game does over OA really. The underwater environment was nothing to write home about really. The people look a little bit better and the sun is better etc but its nothing major. At the moment until more expansions are produced that add more scenarios etc I would recommend getting ARMA2 Combined Operations but this game will be great when filled out a little more.
If your looking for call of duty type game you won't find it here. This is a tactical shooter with emphasis on realism. Great game a must buy for military shooter fans. Also huge mod community that will change the hole game into a new one. It's like buying 50 games in 1.
OT FOR CALL OF DUTY PLAYERS!!!  If you are looking for an realistic shooter with a good player base than look no further. However this game does demand a lot from a rig. You may need to play with the settings a good bit before you can find a nice happy balance.  ARMA is the best Mil Sim out there right now vastly different from any of the big name shooter titles. You will actually engage in fire fights at realistic (in-game) distances move and assault in a real world fashion and overall just have to use common sense. If you enjoy run n' guns like call of duty battlefield battlefront etc then you will either find this game annoying or have some growing pains as you adjust to the play style. The base game is enough to keep you engaged but with a huge selection of MODs you'll find hours of game play.10
est game I've ever had imagine Garry's Mod and Battlefield had a baby but the Battlefield part was actually good framerate feels high yet its about 15-30 has more custom content than overwatch banned steam accounts has scripts to make literal infinite amounts of custom scenarios to play with and HUGE amounts of mods that can either add small things or completely change how the game functions.  Total Hours says it all buy the f****** thing!  1/10 did not pay for a good rating -IGN10
 would recommend any day of the week. I enjoy this game too much great servers and variation between life mods and milsim. 10/1011
est war simulator ever made specially in infantry  there are lots of war simulator games like squads  operation flashpoint series and many others but  is something else ... !   If you want to learn and get some real war experience buy this game   But if you are looking for a simple shooting game that you carry a gun and keep shooting enemies just like battlefield  call of duty  cs go and ...  I suggest you to do not buy this game otherwise this game going to be a boring game for you .   Great graphic quality  nice game control  AI's have great artificial intelligence witch you can set Difficulty for them and co-op is awesome  also PVP is great and campaign is good for learning .10
ame is very CPU intensive. You will have to optomize it before you play but once you do that 20/10.11
What arma is for newbies: A awkward horribly optimized stupidly clumsy military shooter.  What arma is for veterans: A awkward horribly optimized stupidly clumsy military shooter.  Never change arma.
same as every other arma with 'new' graphics
It's the .
Made me lose all my real life friendships. 10/10
bsolutely worth the 20 or less FPS I got for an entire year until I upgraded my PC. Game is well worth the price even if you run on a toaster; gameplay is beyond fun if you play with a high amount of mods or just modded servers in general. Pretty much unlimited amounts of things you can do.10
et it. Buy it. Play it.  You can literally do anything you want. Use your imagination folks! Best game for an FPS by far.10
ive heard great things about this game too bad i cant afford the  :(
Graphically stunning  Community content either PVE or PVP extremely diverse and many mods offer extremely rewarding experiences.  90% of any good multiplayer experience in ARMA is found through good communication either relaying enemy positions or chatting and making friends with other players.   Have a Mic and know how to use it responsibly. Be mature in the way you communicate and you will make friends and have a good time.  game is regulalry on sale for 50% however is worth every $ of its regular price.
HIS IS A COMBAT SIMULATOR NOT AN FPS! I cannot stress that enough. Having said that some of my most memorable gaming moments came from this game. I can remember moving through a town we were so close to the objective then an explosion. A guy in my squad had stepped on a mine then came another and one more after. The enemy opened fire and we had to dive for cover. My squad quickly attempted to return fire but it seemed we were pinned and there were three of my buddies still laying wouded in the open. Unsure of their condition I charged forward grabbing the first guy and pulling him behind cover then the second and soon after the third. Miraculously I wasn't hit by gunfire but we had problem our medic was one of the three wounded. Without a field medic to stabilize the wounded they would surely die. I called out over the comms for anyone who could help there was a long pause...then a response a pilot just happened to be dropping off a squad nearby and was happy to evac them to HQ. We eventually managed to drive the enemy off allowing for medevac to pick up the wounded and fly them to safety.    It still sounds to me like something that would be scripted in a singleplayer campaign something where you are surrounded by npcs and you are merely along for the ride just for entertainment. The truth is these were all real players fighting as a team trying to save three members of their squad. It's player interactions like that that make this game incredible.  TLDR: This game is awesome I cannot reccomend it enough!10
 will say so far as a military simulator i enjoy this game alot speacially when you have a team of friends to play it with. i will post the pro and cons that i believe to be in my opinion it is up to you to either purchase the game and make you own opinion.  Pros: - Very good variation of weapons vehicles and attires. - The Damage system for rifleshandguns are well-balanced eventhough unrealistic. - Graphics and animation are very well improved from the previous Game (Arma 2) - weapon physics are somewhat realistic it includes bullet drop as range increase and it make it simple for those people who use weaponS IRL to understand how the physics work  Cons: - The ridicoulus price currently on not only the game but as well the DLC content. Not worth purchasing DLCs  unless its on sale. - This game is a high intense on the CPU of your system and unfortunatly  not a lot can be done even if you reduce your display settings. - some vehicles are to OP or their ranges are unrealistic to the real world models that they mimic. - Server provider pretty much need to either get their stuff together or just give up because the latency  gets really bad eventhough i access a server located in my state.  So far this is my review with time i might change it with time but for the mean time i will say this game is worth getting if you have multiple friends that play it often.10
ought it too lazy to learn all the keybinds close it. 11/1010
love this game there is never a time where i dont know what to do
his game through ups and downs I keep coming back to it. So its got to have something to it. I played this with fantastic people. Met some great friends and some not so great people but through it all this game has stood up to the tests of time and has been here for longer then i think some people i know. ha. Its a good game has many options and mods.10
Indeed one of the best military simulators yet. So much to do you would never get bored.  63/64 cancer pasients would survive cancer after playing .
he life servers/mods can make you spend way too many hours infront of your PC.   If you like i bought Arma II first Arma III is just an perfect follow up.  10/10  -Xar10
Arma is life
ure there are better plane simulators car simulators and other kinds of simulators but  is the only game that can bring all of these simulators together and make it a full complete military simulator. with tons of vehicles from civilian cars and helicopters to military tanks and jets where even the mirrors work while you're inside of them. There are also lots of gamemodes to choose from and mods to download and play.10
I loved Arma 2 when it came out.But  is just too good!! Pros: -Great Maps -Really cool campaign -Dope  missions Cons: -DLCs over DLCs (Cmon one DLC for just a few guns?) -Glitches! -Can't make it run over 60 FPS
ery fun game but very steep learning curve.10
arm r tree
ust get it seriously.10
m-...Im actually really stuck for words. My computer isn't even a gaming laptop and I can still play  with my mates. This game makes me feel mixed emotions of-... OF JOY! This game is so awesome and the detail put in OMG the game is a BIG part of my life now. I actually feel as if I am part of the army thank you for allowing this game to be made. Its. So . GOOD!10
great game but not as good as arma 2
 Well  is well a great game! Its probs the most realistic Militery game out there! There is so much to  like Co-op Campain multiplayer Custom maps Player made maps and MORE! its a really fun game and worth the prise big time! But your gonna need a good PC for this game alright! My laptop isint that good! The grapchics not to good on my laptop and a little laggy. So beware of that! Also the MAPS are massive! there really well made and they put alot of effort into the game and maps. So as u can tell There is so much to explore in . GREAT for playing with your friends and the BEST for RP on it! would recommend to anyone who likes Militery games and shooting ;)  i would rate this game a 9/10 &lt;3 this game10
Only played for awhile but its pretty fun.
his game is good for a time being. I played it long enough to know the uptades &amp; changes and this devolopers is the one you should be avoid. All they think is how can we make more money from this game ! What they do is NOT fixing THE BUGS AND GLITCHES NO... They want to release new dlc which is almost same price as the game and has no realism in it's contents (Tags Simulation Millitary and Tactical) There is no realistic thing in apex that is just pay to win you can get friking THERMAL+NVG HELMET ON YOUR DUDE AND SEE EVERYTHING ! I did buy this game because of those titles and simulation feeling it gave me when I first played it let me tell you it is good ! But after some point when I see things like ; Devolopers giving support to mod called 'Altis Life' FFS THIS AINT ARMA THIS IS NOT WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BUY THE GAME FOR ! People should buy this game because of it's titles and devolopers should focus on those titles. If you will buy this game because you want to play simulation OK but don't expect devolopers to fix bugs and glitches WHICH IS %100 of the game they will think how we can make more money out of this game believe me I played this game for 2 years and never seen devolopers fix any bug that is really makes impact on gameplay just the ones they can fix within an hour. I don't recommend this game for anyone wants to play simulation and expects devolopers to make it more realistic no this AIN'T THE GAME FOR YOU DEFINITELY NOT !-10
is a fun and complex military simulator that is not only as an awesome game on it's own but serves as a platform for many awesome game modifications - my favorite being Exhile mod. While it has a strange and less-than-functional physics and animations systems a moderate range of bugs (in multiplayer); and performance issues on AMD processors... - it still is great game well worth the price of entry.  Also 64-bit executable coming soon!10
 hate reviews so this is going to be extremely short but this game deserves a good one more than anything else.  I can not reccomend this game more highly or reccomend any other game more than it.   It provides you with the most realistic and highest quality military elements in the video game industry and allows you to do anything you want with them.  Infinity/1010
 got this game on sale but i would of happly paid full price for it amazing game so many different servers to play on. if your looking for a call of duty type of game this isnt it10
Good game TBH bit gltchy but thats  for ya
orth every penny best game for graphic designs but fps can be pretty frightening and is hard to gain fps. AFTER all that's the engine it's using. Would recommend to all gamers!10
un and intense as . This realistic shooter will have you on the edge of your seat in the compaign and in multiplayer (which is hype AS ). The RP server are pretty cool too its always a plus to have functional RP servers in games.10
f you have friends this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play get money for it. If you don't have the money for it get a job. If you don't have a job rob a bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank at least you tried.10
 is the best war simulation game . i am recommend you to play this game
I've played the game during the free weekend and it is extremely laggy even in standart settings my pc has all the recomended features.unless it is a temporary bug that everyone deals with i dont suggest it to anyone.
Input lag on all controls makes you feel as though you're running around with a block of concrete strapped to your head. The new Go Karts have what feels like a 100ms delay in single player from me pressing the D or A key to the wheels actually starting to turn.
altis life sucks and its so hard to run its stupid
ig improvement on Arma 2 The water side of  is outstanding swimming in Arma 2 is painfull. waepon Mod variation is another step forward Highly recommended.10
Amazing but not a good variety of vehicles. It will deserve the wait though. Love the soundtrack.
ell after more than 450 hours on record i have to say it is THE best game in the last years! There is so much to do with it. Seemingly unlimited ways to modify the game or to make own missions with nearly unlimited access to everything you need! It deserves just one word: AWESOME!10
Good war simulator. Has some glitches.
It opens the door to a new world of video games through which the player is more than just immersed!
is a must have for any shooter fan that enjoys open-ended possibilities. With several mods now available (hence the reason I'm changing my review) there are just so many things that you can do it's not even funny. Co-op missions are fun getting with a larger group and doing an MCC or Zeus mission is just ridiculously fun and the campaign is still solid.  If you prefer PvP there are a lot more modes out now than when I originally wrote the review. King of The Hill is the only one I've really played and it's not really my jam but hey if it is yours then go for it.   The game is fairly well optimized at this point but really poorly optimized MP servers are extremely noticable and when bad scripting is done it's even more noticable. This game on an SSD is a pretty intelligent decision.  With or without mods there is just a ton that you can do with this game. If you're at all into large scale operations or even long-lasting missions on a smaller scale you NEED this game. Point blank.10
 came from FPS games like Call of Duty and Battlefield those games are fun but in the end they are arcade style they don't offer you a real taste of what it is really like to shoot a gun or being hit by a bullet. Red Orchestra 2 came a little closer to real combat but  is the most realistic military simulator ever. Despite the fact that it requires great effort to even kill someone with a gun (recoil sight stability etc) it is fun to play this game. At least you understand you can't run across a map for 10 minutes straight get hit by 10 bullets and still regenerate. This is the real deal. It's not too friendly to new players but the challenging aspect is intriguing enough to keep you going.10
RMA. The most respected Mil-Sim series to date. Serious play that's the objective.  'Fun' isn't a word I would use. It's not casual you simply can't hop in play 15 minutes and then hop out. The enjoyment comes from finding a server and getting to know people. Playing with them when you take on hour long missions that's the enjoyment.  First thing I have to say really which I almost forgot about IT'S REAL SCALE. The 'maps' really should be called environments. You can't drive from one side of the island to another in minutes. The battlefield is really a battlefield. While most modern games focus on a small segment of a city town or something ARMA is about the openess making you sniper bait. You have to look hard for hostiles they could be shooting at you from a hill across the valley.  Performance. Was it terrible the first few days after release. Even still AI seem to cause a drop in FPS even though they are far away. This isn't latency this is pure frame for frame output. Never really understood how something unoptimized got pushed out. That being said they follow Valve's ideas and push out updates for free.  I play with a GTX 560Ti and Core i7 870. CPU matters GPU matters. i3 wasn't up for the task even with a 4GHz clock. You need an i7 or 8-core AMD heat monster to play with details. If you can push your rig you get to see things that many don't get to see.  N00bs will have a large hill to climb in regards to learning the game.  7/1010
he game needs some polishing but when it is done I think the result will be damn good :) worth a buy10
It was the only game i played till i had 140hrs on it. O.o
Fun game all around worth the money!
If you like playing games you'll like playing this game.
erfect short-distance graphics effect &amp; nice weapon modsbut distant view seems a little simple... prety much tactical options for players and much funny veichles  particularly the helicoptersand the karts! ahahaha somehow the multiplayers mode its hard 2 connect for that evry server needs sm  addons . and  CNS internetwhich makes hi ping.10
amn good game. So many mods so little time.10
This games brings really fun and is addictive : Great workshop and mods makes this game even better. Really worth to buy if you are looking for something to play longer than 1 hour.
 12 yr old raged at me for taking his pilot seat in an attack helicopter i then proceeded to takeoff and lag into the ground teamkilling 6 guys got banned from server.  420/69 would lag/steal again   p.s. i have an i7 4820k gtx 780 16gb ram 240gb ssd.....pull 17 fps most of time GOTY10
wesome game addicting.10
HIS GAME IS FUN  BUT MOSTLEY FOR THE MODS AND OTHER MULTIPLAYER10
ons and tons of playability! Two same missions will never be the same! Really good game where instead of running and spraying everything in your line of sight you actually gotta think and plan your moves as well cooperate with your teammates. Highly recommended for people with a sense of tactics communication skills!  Stricly NOT recommended for CoD fanboys (yes flame me)10
my girlfriend hates this game.
tole a tank and drove over my friend got launched into the air and exploded on landing. 10/10 would kill my friends again10
 is a good game [It may have bugs but often they are the funny bugs with twisted necks and stretching soldiers] Many mods are made for the game often mods create a lot of extra playtime in my case I bought this because of Arma 2 and how I enjoyed it. I would recommend others who are thinking about buying this to go ahead there is so much you can do. With that said the Dev team are always releasing patch fixes to add more shine to the game.
reat visual effects a stunningly immense map with detailed environments and immersive gameplay  is one of the best (if not the best) Military Simulators currently available. Casual gamers beware the name of the game in ARMA is REALISM and Bohemia Interactive has spared no attention to detail. ARMA is merciless running and gunning into an enemy squad will get you killed in two seconds flat. Alertness caution cover strategy and teamwork will win the day.  Strongly recommended for the more serious FPS players and those wanting a truly rewarding gameplay experience.10
 much better improvement in the way that Arma plays and looks I recommend this game to all Arma 2 fans and incourage people whom have never played Arma to try it.10
its fun game with the rite guys lol
Let me its true extent is difficult to believe that this game is very good!
I highly recommend this game to anyone who is tired of all the twitch shooters out there.
f someone asks me what is the best game I have ever played then without contemplation I will definitely choose ArmA3. It has the best graphic I've ever seen it satisfies the ultra-realism I've been looking for (I thought BF series were realistic) and last but not least it makes gamers to jump into game-making. I doubt games better than this would come out any time because I strongly insist this is the most breath taking and innovative game I've ever seen.10
here are so many servers out there that being a new player to  does not constitute childish behavior of admins that say that I am being ignorant. For that matter go have a nice 13year old life. The server IP I would suggest for you to avoid is Karmic’s PVE/LIFT/MISSIONS/TRADERSTOCKED at IP 24.123.11.106:2302. Complete lack of social skills that admin had. Just because I did not constantly check my side bar does not make me ignorant. I am still learning this game and I really don’t give two  about who runs the flipping server. I only want to have fun while learning the game and not be harassed when I log in about reading the mother flippin side chat/bar. For your information I do read whatever come up in the beginning just to see if anything important shows up. If not I just walk or run around and play. I give two fingers up for that server and admin. (to.ot)10
 years later after release still feels like it's in beta.10
all of Duty is so over rated.....120 people 3 factions huge life like terrain maybe 2020 Call of duty can offer this 8) ...PC Gaming always outways console...10
as a whole mess of amazing and fun mods to play with kind of like Mount and Blade: Warband. Basically it is Mount and Blade but with assault rifles... And tanks.10
i love this game too bits but i would not spend the original prize fund i would defo get this when its on sale but this game is awesome tons of mods nice community overall 9/10
10/10 Would Play Again!
raphics 8/10  Opitimized 4/10  Gameplay 6/10  Multiplayer Campaign 7/10  Mods 10/10   Overall 6.5/10   Now down to the deatils. The game's graphics amazing looking. The opitmization. Yeah that's not existing. It's like Dayz Standalone in it's early beta. So yeah... Mods for it great. Altis life Takistan Life CIty Life Surfing  Life Mod. really great game. Plus Overpoch. Freaking amazing. Now to the campaign... Again... ALmost not existing. The campaign is about as boring as a math class would be on a friday afternoon. So would I recoomend tehe game? Well if you only want to play the mulitiplayer and the mods then I definitly would recoomend it. Plus if you rae into roleplaying games the mods for this game will be perfect for you. There very well designed and have great GUI's unlike somethign like Gmod Darkrp. Now if you want a war simulator... No not the game for you... Go back to Arma10
ost realistic war / military game ever. The game is very easy to mod and the community has ended up making some very fun gamemodes and a variety of mods. Some of my favorite custom gamemodes are 'Altis Life' and 'King of the Hill'. This game also has a ton of realism units / milsim units that do custom missions. Even though this game has been out for three years it is still being worked on with new updates maps etc. The map 'Tanoa' is expected to come out sometime this year and they just released the 'Eden 3D Editor' a couple days ago.   Overall this game is amazing. With the surplus of mods and gamemodes this game never gets old. If you are interested in buying this game you will need a good computer to run it. Some servers have custom veichles and other things that drops your FPS low. Also this isn't like most games where you can just go play for 15 or 30 minutes. For gamemodes like 'Altis Life' I usually set aside 3-5 hours to play. But I'd give this game a 10/10 for the realism and the easy access to mods.10
I don't have the game yet.
they should include sexual self-defense in their next update
Nice game
ne day in Wasteland Sandbox I found a car. Picked up the gun inside and got in. Crashed into a small rock entire car blew up. 11/1011
 was actually one of the first people to pre-order this game's Supporter Edition on March 5th 2013 and so far the game evolved from a 7-8/10 military shooter with emphasis on realism to a 12/10 Military Simulator the probably best mod support of any game currently on the market and an extensive community that happily accepts new players.   If you're searching for realistic military operations in a videogame ArmA is for you. If you're searching for some open world roleplaying or general TVT action ArmA is for you. If you would like to be part of a group that conducts CO-OP and/or TVT missions together ArmA is for you.  Additionally one very huge part of this game is the mod support literally anything you can imagine ranging from fictional spaceships to realistically modeled Main Battle Tanks as well as all accompanying features can be downloaded and used in game just a few mods I would recommend checking out:  JSRS 3 Dragonfyre the successor to the very popular JSRS2 for ArmA3 and the previous JSRS for ArmA2 this soundmod delivers a high fidelity realism oriented sound environment I would strongly recommend checking out a few videos on the official JSRS studio's youtube channel if you didn't know that it's a mod for a videogame you would probably think that the sounds are part of actual combat footage that's the fidelity you can expect from JSRS.  Blastcore Phoenix JSRS is for sounds Blastcore Phoenix is for visuals Blastcore Phoenix which is also currently in developement is the successor of the very popular Blastcore mods for ArmA2 and ArmA3 this mod delivers realistic high quality explosion and smoke effects while still maintaining good ingame performance if you want to check this mod out make sure that you're specificially searching for Blastcore Phoenix as the new mod is quite a lot different from the old ones.   RHS Escalation this mod is actually split up into two mods and has been released only a couple of days ago it brings very high quality contemporary Russian and American assets into the game including vehicles weapons and uniforms despite the mod being in a very early stage at version 0.30 it already has considerably more content than the main game this mod is definitely worth being checked out.  Authentic Gameplay Modification this mod could be regarded as the successor for the Advanced Combat Environment 1 and 2 modifications for ArmA2 they take this game from being somewhat beginner friendly and while already very realistic to a Simulation that may be mistaken with VBS the military training simulator developed by a sub company of Bohemia Interactive this mod may not be for everyone but if you're looking for the most realistic military experience that can be delivered by a game this mod is definitely worth checking out  Advanced Combat Radio Environment or Task Force Arrowhead Radio these two mods which actually could be considered rivals provide the game with very realistic communication in form of an overhauled VON and simulated real world radio models they also come with a very high fidelity UI they achieve all this by using a teamspeak plugin.  The TL:DR of this would be: Should you get ArmA? Yes.11
laying with friends:  Gayfish 3: 'Homo one are you in position? Over.'  Me: 'Gayfish three I am in position. I can see three technicals and two footmobiles over.'  Gayfish 3: 'Copy that homo one wait for the sig---'   *Gayfish 3 is interrupted by loud  explosion  Me: 'NECROPHILIAC 1 WHAT THE  DID YOU DO?!'  Necrophiliac 1: 'Homo one it appears I accidently fired our only javelin missile into that big  motherin' bush over.'   Me *Turns to look at Necrophiliac 1  Necrophiliac 1 *Headshotted by 12.7mm MG on Technical head explodes  Me: 'Jesus  my !'  *Grenade lands at my feet explodes I fly about 20 feet back into a wall.  Gayfish 3: 'Ha y'all got ed. Over.'  Me &amp; Necrophiliac 1: 'Yep ayylmao.'  The game is really fun playing it with friends makes it better. The only downside is that it is poorly optimized.  11
One Of The Best Games Out There. Pure Enjoyment
eally awesome game to play one of my best games10
This Game Is For 40 year olds
+ Fantastic Graphics + Great Story + Huge Community + Lots Of Mods + Tea Bagging Simulator  + Amazing Audio + Role Playing  - 12 Year Old 'Police Officers' On Altis Life - Side Chat Spammers -  Blatt?  - Rekt  I'd give this game a solid 9/10.
An incredible game for anyone that likes realism more than run and gun style gameplay  The only downside is it's very picky about the server side of things and some gamemodes or servers will bring down the client FPS to unplayable levels (&lt;25 fps)
Eat 
Died because of a bush.  10/10
Huge game. Many scenarios and Mods to get lost in. Low frame rates on many servers for me. Decent fps when i play Solo. Amazingly large maps. Great Visuals and Sound. Realistic. Definately not a run and gun game.
No life = Logging into the game for the first time and being sucked into the void
efinitely one of my favorite military themed games of all time. I've had countless of fun experiences intense firefights and have met some interesting people. I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for a different experience far away from COD or Battlefield. Vanilla I would say is a 7.5 (out of ten) and with mods a 9 out of ten. Fantastic.11
Best game ever i got addicted to the game already XD (Recommending buying it)
Best military simulator out there
Was stoned while playing the tutorial.    Funniest tutorial i had ever played.
-Driving along with highly valuable stuff in vehicle.  -See's other vehicle coming my way thinking nothing of it.  -Desync.  -Crashes into each other.  -Both vehicles explode.  10/10 WILL loose everything too desync again.
 received a low-threat prisoner so I didn't pay much attention to him.  How wrong I was..  It was a normal average day. The prisoners were eating their lunch.. then it happened.  He attacked from the shadows. Prisoner 'Leeroy jenkins' viciously started stabbing my guards with his plastic fork. It was 5 against one. He'll never win I thought. He'll never escape I thought. He'll never survive I thought.  I thought wrong.  He managed to start a full-scale riot him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.  I did it I stopped the riot.  But then I saw that one particular cell was empty. Then I realized..   LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEENKINS!  54/11 would plastic fork again.11
The Best Game Ever!!!
10/10 Got killed 200000 times in 5 mins by ex militaries finest and when i got 1 kill he said 'What the  did you just ing say about me you little ? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the  out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth mark my ing words. You think you can get away with saying that  to me over the Internet? Think again er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re ing dead kid. I can be anywhere anytime and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways and that’s just with my bare hands.

love this game 10/10
 great game for the boys who have nothing to do great game to AFK in. RP is nowhere near as hectic as Metal Gear. ??/??????????'
plays   thinks he masters game finds out about ACE3 becomes novice   amazing
ne of the best games I have ever played hands down. Patience is the key in this game if your all about run and gun I suggest you play CoD. A lot of opportunities in this game. I LOVE IT. Arma3 for life!11
is an amazing realistic military simulation game. The campaign/singleplayer itself is amazing and the multiplayer just gets better. There are many servers and modifications you can make to the game to make it an even better experience.  I sold a knife in CS:GO for this game; It was worth it.11
Very good game realistic just fantastic it makes my nipple hard11
This game is THE GAME.
Do you enjoy 20 Fps? Are you willing to let a 10 year old commmand you like marines? Do you have a top of the line computer? This Game is slower on it  Can you deal with constant Freezeing and or Game Breaking crashes? Are you willing to be trolled constantly by your own teamates that end up shooting you? Has your computer ever bottlenecked on low graphics? Are you looking for devs that take weeks to respond to troubleshoot? Are you Ready for PTSD?  If you are looking for a game that does all the above daily Try !!!
This Game is the best thing I have ever played in my life. It is so awesome.All the mods and workshop iteams. This game Has so many things to do.  Here is a small list  -  life - Battle royal - Wastland - Breaking point - Epoch  I really recomend this game.
 please give me back my life 700 hours its like crack. CRACK CRACK POP oh  underfire. realistic PTSD   IGN 1/10 game of the century
its... something
Amazing game. I absolutely love it. DLC is a bit stupid for the prices not a game breaker but it does suck sometimes. Great to play with friends. 8/1010
is by far the most realistic most entertaining and most intence war simulator of all time! If the technology is availible this game should come out for next gen. consoles. Not only is this an amazing sandbox but it also blows every other war game out of the water! Keep up the good work Bohemia Interactive and step aside Battlefield and COD because a new age has started. The age of a real war.10
Quick review:  Pros (+) : Realistic military hardware (PlanesHeavy transportSUBMARINES HYPETanksHelicopters and more.. like Quad-bikes) Realistic gun play! Good huge maps! Really good multi-player and communtity! Variety in everythingNothing really hard scripted.  Many activities/missions.  Cons (-) : Arma engine (Clunky menus) Pretty demanding in terms of hardware (My system runs it still better than Arma II tho) Some out of place NPC animations Really good internet connection needed! Pricey even at a discount.  Would I recommend it?  If you are OK with the Arma engine and you own a decent gaming system then YES!10
No word to say.
his game was especially great for me recreating a perfect moment in my life...  I had two towers and a c130 and I flew it into the tower....  It's really great to see the perspective my grandfather saw as he flew his last flight..  rip :(11
You thought Arma 2 was good?  In  even the sound lags.  5/5FPS
Anti cheat system works great! I got banned within a week using hacks ????
Helped me get alot of friends and has so many options on how to play thanks to mods and the editor. Virtually infinite possibilities with superb physics (sometimes) and graphics. Also has a fantastic community and great developers. The only thing that bothers me is the poor optimization on large servers. Above 50-60 people and fps takes a dive. Overall a great game and would definitely buy it again if I didn't have it.
I wish I had it
- Zip tied someone - Take them to the top of a church - Cut the poor soul's kidney out of their body - make them jump while being shot at and hearing gaben being chanted  best game - 10/10
*Enters a server* Doesnt know how to play Accidentally killed 8 'cops' and was kicked from the server. 10/10 would shot a cop in the testicles again.
o after about a year of off and on playing I thought id give it a review. One word. AMAZING. I dont understand how this game is so fun. Almost all of the (close to) 600 hours I have played on this has been in A3Armorys Stratis Server. I can play it for hours upon hours and not get too bored. Yes after 600 hours of stock arma the weapons vehicles gear does get really stale. And that brings me too mods. Mods make this game 10000x better. It brings new content into this game. So much new content that I dont think anyone will ever get bored. You have Life mods. You have Gun Game. You have Dayz. Theres so much replayability in this game. Theres so much to do. So much you can create. Its almost endless. With the addition of Apex this month we will have plenty of new guns vehicles gear to choose from when playing. This game is just simply awesome. It does have its downfalls. The lack of official content gets stale after alot of playtime. The optimization really sucks.(I get about 20-30 fps in wasteland stratis with full server) But I have so much fun its hard not to recomend it. You also have those really funny arma physics. So 11/1011
gt;Be me playing Battle Royale on  Gets good loot and hides in a house alone Keep hearing footsteps and unsure if anyone is inside or near I keep checking noone there I then find out that it was mostly my footsteps Heard footsteps again Unsure if it was mine or not Could not take it anymore and ran away Not a single guy there  10/10 would be in the House of Paranoia again.11
Im in love with this game
Is an open platform military simulator. Similar to real life war with great sound effects and much more.  is not only about playing as a military since it's an open platform there is tons of mods avalible for ! Popular mods like Exile Breakingpoint Roleplay servers u name it..  This game takes away my social life Is it worth it?? HELLYEAH i'd say!11
Hello am 48 year man from somalia. Sorry for my bed englando. I selled my wife for internet connection for play '3 Arma' and very good chouse . 10 buy game
 Well.... is military simulator on 2035? or something right? Game works well whit good fps.   I like  on pvp (King of the hill and playing on EUTW servers there is some good HC gaming up there and some roleplaying is cool in  on good servers^)    I give 9/10 of  because some fysics^^ are broken...other ways this game is good.  Children play Call of Duty Boys play Cs:Go Men's play 11
he Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Western Bloc (the United States its NATO allies and others) and powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states). Historians do not fully agree on the dates but a common timeframe is the period between 1947 the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced and 1991 the year the Soviet Union collapsed.  11
Pretty good game. You can fly helicopters and  and its better than cod. 12/8 ign
i bought this game for $60 and the next day there was a 50% off sale. Not even mad about it.  11/10
is a game you'll either love or hate and personally I love it. Sure the game is a bit confronting at first as it looks like it has a million controls (pro-tip: If you're mostly sticking to infantry combat you'll only have a handful more buttons and button combinations to learn than the most shooters E.G. Battlefield) and the game definitely feels clunky when compared to other FPS games out there (though it's come a long way over the years) but in a way that adds to part of it's charm once you get past that. Small things such as having multiple shooting stances meaning if you're near a hole in the wall you can raise or lower your body until you're at a level that allows you to use that hole to engage through makes a huge difference into how combat plays out in this game compared to others on the market. You'll want a beefy PC moreso in the CPU department than the GPU to get the most out of the game and a lower end computer can be a bit of a hinderance in PvP (E.G. you may be unable to see your shots landing at long range) but for PvE this won't be as much of an issue.   The game has a wide range of multiplayer game types and anyone should be able to find something to accomodate them. There's King of the Hill battles akin to Battlefield Life servers that are sort of a mix between The Sims and GTA Online Invade and Annex servers (Players fighting AI to take back towns) so on so forth. There's also a huge community of players who make custom missions be it a coop adventure or an organised PvP battle there's more arcade orientated units and groups who focus on making combat as realistic as possible. There's also a huge amount of mods and community addons for the game from missions uniforms vehicles weapons realistic functioning radio plugin so on so forth. One need only look and you should be able to find something you want both in terms of content and community.   is definitely a game worth picking up if you like realistic combat a sense of community and/or a huge range of community added content.10
mazing graphics though not compared to Crysis 2 or 3 but still very good considering what you get. this is not your average FPS game this has a ton of features meaning no matter what happens this will likely remain a pc exclusive as a controller simply don't have enough buttons for all the functions. it has a good single player campaign and a very active online scene. it is a rather demanding game for any system but i suspect this is due to the engine and the fact it has to do so much at once.10
I don't have the game but Steam's letting me review it.  gg XDDDDDDDDDDDDd
I don't even own this game. Why is it asking me for my review?
f you are looking for the most realistic simulator out there this game is for you. If you want to get the loot this game is for you. If you want to constantly get oneshot this game is for you. If you want to play Broken Point this game is for you. If you get 50 points this game is for you. Do I recommend this game? The real question is...do I recommend this game? But of course. 10/10. This game sux.11
reat game. IMO more realistic than Arma 2 better graphics engine. I was able to run it in 1600x960p. Recoil is not that of a damn Barrett .50 cal when you are shooting a pistol. Cooler story and just overall an advancement from Arma 2. OP AF10
optimization can be very off. Sometimes I can run this game at a decent temperature for hours at a time. sometimes the temperature skyrockets and my PC BSODs. The issue lies with the CPU optimization and how the  engine utilizes only 1 core to a large extent.
un game If you get bored playing one game mode there are hundreds others to choose from never ending fun!10
irst of all ARMA is not a shooter like COD or BF. The pace style of gameplay maps are really different but I have to say that it is more enjoyable funny and COMMUNICATING with the other players is great. For example being the gunner of a tank: there are numbers that tell you direction and distance so other player inside the tank tells you the indications to shoot. You wont be able to find this anywhere else. Or being in a squad splitting in pairs to clear some buildings while the other 2 players cover you.   It is important to make clear that you buy ARMA for its multiplayer and coop mode. If you are looking for campaign game dont buy this. Also if you are planning to buy this game I have to tell you that you will have to join a clan to enjoy this game to its maximum; otherwise by yourself you wont like it as much :S Joining a clan means you will have to download MODs (content created by the community) and probably TeamSpeak (program similar to Skype) to play with them (all clans ask for a mic take that into account).   To sum it up ARMA is a total unique in the experience out in the market regarding FPS. Nonetheless to have a good time you need to join a clan and play with other people and be willing to download new content. 10
Welcome to the jungle...
ne of the best millitary combat simulation games out there.  PROS: -high quality content made by the devs -dlcs worth the price (especially Apex) -modded content extremely easily accesible via the Steam Workshop but also via modding sites which offer a larger quantity of mods. -tons of content available through modding -offers different styles of gameplay (can also be casual to a certain extent) -a lot of 'serious' fun once you get over the steep learning curve CONS: -bad performance ~depending on how casually you want to play this game the steep learning curve and dependence on entering an active community can be problems    ----- it's pretty good ;)10
This game is my favorite game and I think it always will be changed by the steam workshop.If your looking to buy a game where you can sink more than 1000 hours and still only touch a tiny part of the modding community this game is for you. :)
ITS THE BEST ING GAME EVER 10/10
I haven't played  for that long but it's ok I guess....
Best. Game. Ever. And nominate this game for 'Just 5 more minutes!'
THE BEST GAME EVER!
ella realistic quite boring if you're into fast action but fun if you like slow strategy.10
Kayzar thinks I play this game too much.
 is an AWESOME rpg just buy it
Great game!! :D
y Quick review.   is probably the most user friendly entry into the series. Not to the mention the best looking and in my opinion the most fun to play.  Now thats not to say doesn't have issues. CURRENTLY not as much content as the previous entries but that said BIS is working on more and its soon to come. Obviously the modder community is working feverishly away.  Steam workshop support for missions is great and as soon as they add support for full Mods everything will be even better.  The game plays as one would expect. Its a tactical simulator so that means the average expericance wont be a firefight every few seconds. Tehre is waiting there is walking but if you're of the right mindset it all adds to the experience and build up. Knowing only a few shots can kill you make it quite tense.  Key points- -The new stance system is great a variable height and lean means you can make the most out of any cover you find yourself in! - The maps are huge and varied with the scenario editor you can quickly whip up any type of engagement you want. - The game is better multiplayer if your more of a Solo player I wouldn't say you'll have no fun but I think it'd be more limited. - So many mods on the horizon all will add up to be the experience you want tailored to you.  So all that said I love this game. Devs are continuining support with regular updates and additions. Join a multiplayer community and prepare to have a blast!10
he greatest accomplishment a game can have is to leave lasting memory with the player. I find that this is especially true for memories that you can share.  can provide these in abundance. It is easily one of the best sandbox games I have ever played. I’ll never forget escaping from a temporary prison with a handful of friends spending hours slowly and stealthily making our way to a heavily guarded communication tower taking out an entire platoon in a surprise attack and finally making contact with friendly forces for extraction only to be told to rendezvous on the opposite side of the island. Of course the enjoyment of these games is also dependent on the people that you play it with so be sure to pester all your good friends so that they can play this with you. For as graphics and physics heavy as this game is it handles surprisingly well. Gameplay wise you will have to relearn everything you’ve been taught for FPSs. If you’re not extremely careful and working as a team you’re going to die swiftly and painfully. The number of player made missions is amazing. This game has a bit of a learning curve but not nearly as much as the previous titles in the series. Please if you want to have some fun with friends get this game.10
Great game bro
ood game totaly aint tryin to get the community badge thingy by doing all there is there10
Slice aproves this.
eah I highly recommend this Game to All people who like Realistic type Shooters And if you Have played Arma 2 Im Sure you would also Like the massive improvemnts and features added. And this Game has many Fan made mods like Altis Life Wasteland And king of the Hill to get stuck into. The delevlopers have Made it very easy to mod In new Models weapons etc. This is a great game and im looking forward to future DLC and features. :)10
recommend this game HAVANA6 screw betafail4 or 5
ank hits rock tank flies tank shoots tank flies even faster. Water try and stop tank tank bounce tank flies happily ever after.  tank/10 would fly again.10
wesome Tactical gameplay If you enjoy simulations This is NOT COD or BF4!!!!10
mazing game so far and it's only an Alpha! Updated and improved on so many things from previous Arma games. If you like miltarty simulators this game has you covered; infantry boats vehicles and aircraft. Huge maps (20KM) and you can pretty much go in to any building now! In short pre-order this game :D10
irst play session join a random multiplayer server called altis life or something. get kidnapped by some form of terrorist group they take me to an island and tell me to hide in a house the police come and save me they give me a car to go back to a town have the car confiscated by the cops that helped me due to speeding run for about an hour to the nearest town get killed by a guy in his underwear and a fedora screaming about being mlg leave game. 11/10 would play again!10
et's see... I have put 530 hours on ArmA II and 230 on ArmA III... Is this a good game?  Yes.  It is a military shooter that focuses on scale. There is some realism and some not its a video game so of course there will be reality breaking moments.  Do the sounds of rifles crack? Yes. Grenades that explode near you will shake you up and be loud. The sounds in this game are amazing. From the hum of the chopper as it starts up to the rumble of your tank you will feel like you are in this breathing world of military hardware the moment the game starts up.  The graphics are amazing. There are times when I simply stare off into the horizon in awe at how large the map is. You can customize your character for a more immersive feel in game.  There are mods and various game modes. From Deathmatch to King of the Hill and DayZ Epoch there is something for every FPS fan.  The gameplay mechanics and controls are deep. Be ready for about 8 different key strokes for how you can take cover but it works in its favor as you want to have the most concealed firing position yet be able to hit your target so peeking around corners from low to the ground rocks and more make combat from mountains or Close Quarters dynamic and fresh. Piloting a heli or driving a tank is easy to pick up and rewarding when you master it. For airplanes you may find the controls difficult as having a stick is the best and easiest way to effectively pilot (some players only pilot and use only the joystick in multiplayer).  There are really cool workshop game modes you can download and play solo or with friends.  10/10 I highly recommend this game due to its gameplay controls and graphics. If you enjoyed the ArmA series you will love this game and if you like military shooters with some realism you will also enjoy picking this game up.10
YOU CAN IN SALUTE PEOPLE LIKE WHAT HEY GET THIS GAME NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW
ow where do we start here then :D  Arma2: OA was great for mods such as Overpoch and the best thing in Arma2: OA is that there is no physics :D but... : Brings allot to the table when fighting in wars I mean when I first played  and that was when it was free on steam I instantly played the campaign and it was amazing Not as great as Battlefield and Call Of Duty campaigns. Now lets cut this boring crap and talk about running the game.  Intel HD 4000+ Graphics Card: Will run the game But on Low settings and will get over 30 FPS witch is all you need really to get a good feel of the game exept obviously crap graphics. It can run  on a mixed scaled of Low and Medium settings but will get around 20 FPS depending on what settings you have changed to Medium ( I allways have Vsync off Not sure if that improved FPS but I do it anyway :p ). However once you are flying in the air in combat like Apache's or Armed Little Birds for example your FPS goes up obviously because it does not render as much stuff around you as when you are on the ground you loose FPS.  AMD Graphics Card: Not sure about this graphics card as my old I3 Intel HD Graphics 4000 Laptop can run  in the ways I spoke about above but lets bring Arma 2: OA back here for a second On Arma2: OA I get about 40-60 FPS witch is great and in the air about 70-80 FPS and thats perfect but I came across someone who uses a PC with a AMD graphics card and even on low settings he gets like 15 FPS and maybe 25 FPS if he is lucky. So  wise I am not too sure on what FPS you will get.  I do not recommend anything like FPS boosters or Contig ect As they may contain a virus and can slow down your computer badly.  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????10
I loved this game when my computer was good after about 6 months or so the game started crashing and getting low frames but before my computer turned into poo I loved this game but soon my time with the game was over ans wasnt able to play anymore if you want to take the risk take it. If you think this game is cool the review aren't stopping you buy it!
ith over 600 hours of play time. Plus probably about 200 more on another account I had. This is hands down one of the best games I have ever played. Not because its such a rock solid game with a good story. As a matter of fact im sure about %80 of people playing this never played the story. Probably about %40 of ARMA players didnt even know it had one.   But this game does something that ALL games should. Its a swiss army knife of video games. It's developers decided to open the game up to modders and developers. Creating countless communities of LIFE servers MILSIM servers KOH WASTELAND BATTLE ROYALE and countless others whom I maybe have not yet discovered. No other game out there has such a vast veriaty of different game modes that allow the player to do Whatever he or she wants to do at the time.   This game takes it self seriously yet at the same time it knows how to tell a joke or two. (like its driving mechanics and vehicle damage its quite funny.... sometimes). When you first hop into  you will want to go right to the multiplayer and load up one of the LIFE servers it has. Which i think is the 2nd reason why this game is so popular. First being the DayZ mod and subsequently the DayZ: SA.   All in all If you are looking for a game that will alow you to play a rebel one day a cop the next and a military member the day after look no further. This versitile platform is exactly right for you. I actually have started to compare this to GTA and quite frankly... i have more hours in this than GTA.   I FULLY recommend this game to everyone. Sale or full price its well worth it!10
Great looking game. And the MOD's are just awesome. Don't get thoughts behind the DLC's tho..
 Roleplay *Hey COP where can i get mary* 10 out 10 and in all serious VERY good No VERY GREAT!
Good game but there is no shotguns :(
Very nice game engine with lots of missions and MODs (hopefully full-on) coming for it. If it goes on sale again Im buying 2 more copies that is for sure.
its like Jesus had a baby and it took over the world. Yes its that good.
reat simulator! No wonder it won the award. It's just at the right pace not too fast not too slow. There's no health regeneration so if you get shot you're either going to have to patch yourself up or just tread with a wounded arm or leg. Best of all no one fusses about it! There's no Call of Duty vs. Battlefield wars no Ubisoft bandwagon hate. It's just Arma III.10
It's okay.  Also gave me PTSD.
ITS a great game and everyone should get it
he game is great! It is a very realistic war simulator that I highly recommend. It makes Call of Duty look like dog poop. There are a lot of mods that are fun to play. You can do just about anything in this game fly helos drive quads trucks tanks shoot people and much more. It just makes me mad that I bought it for $59.99 three days ago and today it is on sale for $29.99.  11/10 Would pay full price again.10
Nothing can compare to the variety of gameplay Arma III has to offer.
THIS game is very fun and entertaining. with new mods coming out it makes it more interesting and creative.
Ok first off HOLY CRAP this game is sweet. If you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les( I got mine for 30 i think) I would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist. A great game thats lots of fun. You can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just  around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up. If you liked Dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating. But over all 10/10 would buy again. Seriously if your PC can handle it get it.
ood game.Super models weapons.Verry good workshop.Good comunity.Verry good editor.Super maps.Verry good models carsplanesboatssoldiershouses.Very good citys.10
Great game you wil have countless hours of fun just with the regular . Getting bored? Thats fine just jump on a multiplayer server like altis life and you will be able to get many more hours of fun! just make sure your pc can handle it.
tay low move fast kill first die last one shot one kill no luck pure skill.10
Great Game!!!
Great game if you have a Mac.
an someone please buy  as a gift to me please :(???? You see I am very poor and I just cant afford a game like . I just love this intense game and it has a wonderful sensation. I wish I could just get my hands on it but I dont have the required amount of mey just yet. Im just begging anyone out there that is kind to buy me this game as a gift. It would touch my heart deep inside me ;). Im crying now as I type. If anyone out there has a heart that is strong enough to be generous I would Highly appreciate it :). Most people won't listen but it will be awesome. THANKYOU!!! ;)10
 My brother and I are on opposite teams (Wasteland) -We meet up and I tow my vehicle on his vehicle -We drive into his teams base and I get out and kill 4 people  10/10 would betray their team again10
A very good fps/thirdperson shooter game. Perfect for RP and much more. 10/10 best you could get:D
Great game without mods. EVEN BETTER WITH MODS! MY FAVORITE MODS ARE TFAR AND ACRE!
Absolute fantastic game. Very good simulation and good physics. Big open maps for dramatic scenery.
n contrast to the popular genre first person shooters  lives up to being a war simulator. What makes this game so successful is the contribitions made by the community. Like well source games  Garry's Mod  being one of them 's Steam Workshop is full of user-created content that continue to enhance gameplay to this day.  While being as realistic the game was made enjoyable. This can be a drawback as the first-aid kit continues to be the cliche for quickly restoring health and the artificial intelligence are strong at some points and weak in others. To be fair this is not a medical simulator and the AI are not to be operated by super computers.  With the upcoming  Apex DLC  in sight it is extremely recommended NOT to just get the  base game. Even if the multiplayer is currently dominated by Altis-Life Wasteland and King of the Hill that is likely to change when Apex is released. It was announced that many new enjoyable features would be implemented in the DLC in favor of those who would much rather prefer a simulator for war than a simulator for life on Altis or for an apocalypse.  Previously this game was losing their veterans and gaining rp'ers and fp shooters. If your playstyle fits in the three don't worry. Bohemia Interactive see's what their players are into and is doing their part to equally make content for those who prefer different playstyles.10
his is one of the most complicated FPS games to play as in there are a lot of control you need to learn to make your character move around in a organized way. Once you learn them however the games becomes very fun and difficult. So if you dont like a challenge this game is not for you. Some parts of the campaign I had to try (on regular) at least 20-30 times. Im a decent FPS player but is like no other I've played.   The game itself is very nice to look at albeit not as optimized as I would like to see. It is also very heavility CPU based. My OC 4790k hovers around 20-50% usage sometimes going into the high 60s. I play on very high at 5760x1080 and get around 55-70 fps on average with 970 SLI.   The gameplay is very different then any other game. The audio and realism is very good. Sometimes you really think you are a soldier and get scared when you are walking and suddenly hear bullet impacts near you. The gunplay is also very hard and challenging. You have to really be slow and careful on where you are how you plan to engage the enemy. Because they are very good shots and you die very easily. So you have to be strategic in everything you do. Which can be really fun.   This also is not a non-stop action game. There is a lot of walking and exploring. This is like a COD polar opposite.   Mods and custom content really add to the replayability and fun of this game. The fun never stops when you have all of the steam workshop and a few friends to play with.   Some things did bother me and broke the realism for me. One being that a nice combat simulator like this with accurate gun behaviors and recoil doesnt even have 2 different reload animations for guns or when reloading when not empty you don't get 30+1. Also there is not very good animation in this game reload talking and some player animation is not very smooth or realistic in many cases.   Overall I give it a 8/10 for what it was planning/supposed to be and how I received it.10
his review is in comparison to ArmA 2 ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead which I own both of.  The graphics are the best in terms of arma since sliced bread. The only downside is that the fps suffers on what appears to be an average-ish optimised game engine (still Real Virtuality).  Maps (imho) are not to my liking as they get boring after a while at least there is CUP to fix that for me.  Personally expected more stuff (vehicles guns etc) overall for paying NZ$50. This is one reason why i am hesitant to buy Apex...  Overall great game. Lack of content can be fixed with third-party content but the engine needs some tweaking for performance still.10
his game is absolutley wonderful. I have played about 11 hours of this game and i have not gotten bored yet. There is so much you can do in this game without even touching the multiplayer portion such as ; Build your own missions (scenarios). Yes you can build your own missions once and if you get bored of the main campaign or you finish it. (2) The campaign- Now if you have the Apex DLC you will have 2 campaigns available. I have not played the Apex campaign but the main campaign is absolutley exciting. If you are looking for a campaign similar to COD or Battlefield then this is not for you the missions require strategic thinking and smart tactics you have to actually look for the enemies instead of them popping out in front of you. There is also no respawning (which some people may not like). However you have the ability to patch yourself up after taking a non-critical hit and the game auto saves after passing certain points throughout the level. (3) Mods- Mods are a great addition to the game. You can either get Scenario mods Campaign mods Vehicle and Unit mods or Game changing mods which mean they will put you through another Era in time and you can either download scenarios or campaigns with these mods. Examples of these are : Iron Front 3 for Arma and Unsung vietnam. You can grab IFA3 here on the steam workshop however you will have to do some searching for Unsung it can be found on MODDB. Last but not least is Multiplayer. Now i have not played very much of the multiplayer becasue in my opinion to really get the most out of multiplayer you should play it with friends. Now that is not to say don't play multiplayer because you dont have anyone to play it with but communication is key in some game modes. Hope this review helped you in deciding whether or not to get this masterpiece of a game. Enjoy.10
Great game. 10/10 would play again.
11/10 BEST GAME EVER MADE (as of 05/11/2015)
est military combat simulator i have played. Very nice graphics and gameplay There are a lot of servers to play that you will find entertaining. However. The down side is that you need to get the DLC to play most of these servers. In which it kind of sucks as you have to pay a little more. I got the game when it was on sale as well as the dlc and payed about £22. But I reckon that this game is worth the price and a lot of FPS fans will enjoy it. 8/10 - Good game worth the price.10
hildren play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield Teens play CS:GO Men play ARMA People waste there ing lives in real war and were trying to copy that.    OK LETS DO IT ;D10
uite frankly the ultimate first-person military simulator. This is a true PC game with a modding community to match. Mad props to Bohemia for such an excellent successor to ARMA 2.10
 parachute into a hot zone. I hear the distant crackle of small arms fire. Kind of like fireworks. 4th of July... I snap out of it as the ground suddenly rushes up and meets me. I roll onto my stomach and crawl into a nearby bush. I jumped with 3 squad mates. Where are they? I glance around. One comes drifting down dead in his harness. The other is nowhere to be found. Tension builds in my belly as the chatter of nearby automatic weapons fire starts back up again. I gaze cautiously out into the outcropping of squat buildings ahead.   Is that where the fire is coming from? I can't tell. Can't be sure.  I am frozen.   There is a house across the street. The street is narrow. I could dash for it. But it might blow my cover. 50 meters never looked so far in my life. I get into a crouch. Glance around again. Suddenly I see smoke rising from a dusting of rocks to my left. I immidiately drop down and toss a grenade. It works the enemy tango dashes from the rocks. A few swift pops and he's down. Was he alone?   There was no way to know for sure.   This is warfare. This is Arma.10
ery good poorly optimized but very good10
play dis gam cause realistic  http://i.imgur.com/UJGbDoc.gifv    10/10
amazing nothing more to realy say
Great game to play with friends
Awesome Sauce
ery fun game. Playable for hours on hours. Great community and lots of addons. Totally recommended.10
its arma !!! with all their bugs\glitches and fun gameplay )
 highly recommend  on sale.  has a learning curve bit of a learning but is unlike any shooter on the market.    is a bit buggy so expect rage inducing lag and glitches from time to time. Turst me Booboo it's most likely not your PC set up. With all the mods and servers that this game features you are guaranteed to get countless hours of game play out of this game. The campaign story is laughable but the AI is challenging if you're completionist.  Buy this game if you like:  Great Gun play Teamwork Realistic firefights Flying Helicopters or Jets Survival mods Fighting AI with your buddies PvP with a /steep/ learning curve  Pass on  if you don't like:  Large keybind layouts Low framerates Working as a team Dying a lot Not being Rambo Having PTSD   Carry on Soldier.10
its like Nekopara with guns and vehicles. Except there is no chest bounce slider option :'-( .
We made a convoy. I like convoys 11/8 Would convoy again
For an Alpha there are so many aspects of this game that are already better than Arma 2. A purchase now equals less to pay for when the full title releases.
i just love playing this game!! :3
:D worth $59.99
69/10
This game is really good. I would give it a 9/10 and the reason i give it such a high rating is because there are endless things to do. Such as altis life or maybe tactical missions but my favorite part of the game is flying. There is the standard flying which is sorta like a arcade flying but still has some realistic features then there is advanced flying. But besides that this game is just great before i had this game i was a lone wolf on arma 2 but on here i met a awesome group of people that i play  with every night we even have are own altis life server.
his game is extremely realistic with everything bullet ballistics to in-depth squad command. And if you aren't satisfied there's a massive community that's always creating addons modifications and even full-conversion modifcations. The community also has another side where you can find friends and formulate tactical squads or even battalions. I highly recommend you check this game out though do acknowledge that this game isn't perfect and does lack a lot of desired features. However you can probably find those features within the modding community.10
Altis life with friends is hours of fun
Playing this game on a public server with random people will make you hate this game. Playing this game on a private server with a chosen few will make you love this game.
 creators.Please stop making it so you have to buy stuff on every new update I was so excited about the new vehicles and weapons and i don't even get to use them and i don't want to have to pay $15 to get them so please make it free
ery cool game love the campaign and the mods avaialble are limitless.10
is a solid military simulator that really gets its legs from the modding community. Many ppl are familar with the ARMA series for one reason alone and that is the DayZ mod it's even a well known fact that the game ARMA 2 sold more copies shortly after DayZ was released than it had since it's initial release. Not having played much single player besides a few short training sessions this review is going to be mostly focused on the multiplayer mods gameplay and engine in general.  First of all I want to say that this game may not be for those with underpowered PCs ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PLAYING MULTIPLAYER. While the engine performance is dramaticly improved over ARMA 2 unfortunently it seems that in multiplayer performance will suffer especially with high player counts due to a combination of server performance (running an ARMA server is very resource heavy especially cpu) and netcode shortcommings. The graphics have been improved over its predecessor as well as performance allowing for even greater view distances than I was able to pull off in ARMA 2 while still having playable framerates. Lighting in my opinion seems to have been improved the most leading to many atmospheric moments when I would find myself taking a screenshot. Models have all been improved quite a bit with the character models receiving the greatest leap in graphic fidelity I can almost feel the stubble on the manly mans face sitting next to me in the attack chopper its the future I tell you.  As you would expect in a military simulator there is a huge variety of boom sticks and vehicles to play with and not having a knowledge of military equipment or really a lot of experience with ARMA 2 I won't go into what guns/vehicles are new or what is more or less realistic. The gun and vehicle models however have seen a fantastic improvement in overall texture detail and resolution and the animations in general are a giant improvement over previous ARMA games with many of them appearing to be motion capped for that sexy smoothness.  Gameplay has shown improvement in equal lengths with my favorite additions being the character stance positions revamped inventory system and much more natural feeling to movement in general. This is partly due to the fact that animations in general have been improved but also because mouse acceleration and smoothing seem to have been fixed. Combat feels solid and realistic the effects and sounds of warfare do well to set the mood and convince you that you are really blowing the  out of someone or really in the .   The positional audio is fantastic and you can tell the approximate distance of gunshots based on their volume and trust me the sound of a gunshot travels a long long ways. I also want to mention your characters sound effects visual effects and ambient animations I love these and they really pull me into the experience. I have been walking for nearly 30min and I have finally made it to the cocaine fields but someone saw me comming. Oblivious I stand collecting the leaves when I hear something and my heart sinks the rustling of feet and whispers in the bushes. I panic and turn the way I came bursting into a full sprint as I hear sirens begin to blare out and helicopter blades begin to spin. I'm sprinting at full speed now and the edges of my vision blur as I run blindly into the darkness. I'm breathing more heavily now and my vision is more tunneled than before the color seems to have melted away slightly and I can't focus my eyes. Still running I'm breathing so heavy now that I gasp for air at times nearly choking on the air i'm attempting to breathe. The sirens are now far off in the distance and the whirling blades of the helicopter have nearly left ear shot I gasp for more air as I slowly regain a normal rate of breathing. I wipe my brow to remove the sweat and my vision finally clears I can see the boat I rode in on still there waiting for me I feel much better now. It's these little details that make an experience like that feel personal and real this was an experience I had playing the mod 'Altis Life'. Everything in the right situation really comes together to bring you into the game experience and this is somthing  has pulled off well.   Now the mods are where I think ARMA really shines as they provide infinite replayability assuming the community continues to develop for the platform. So far I have to say I am very impressed with the creativity of the mods and the scope of the mods in general. Want to recreate a historical engagement maybe survive the zombie apocalypse or perhaps selling fish and smoking weed is more your gig? You can do it all with the vast array of mods already available but I want to talk quickly about my new favorite mod Altis Life. Altis life is a roleplaying mod were you must choose whether you are a civillian or a cop and you must live out you life however you choose. Civs must make a living whether legal or illegal it's you choice and your options are vast for how you do so. The cops must keep the civs in line and enforce the laws if you are running around smoking weed and yelling F*ck the police you are probably gonna get pulled over beaten and arrested. Play it cool and do the speed limit maybe you will get away with that trunk full of heroin and get rich quick. Or maybe you just want to pick peaches smoke your weed and claim its for medical purposes when the cops pull you over its your choice and it is really great fun.  There is so much more to say about this game and the potential it has with the fantastic modding community but I've written too much here already and i'm tired so i'm going to bed. On second thought maybe ill just do one more run to the poppy fields.10
ot spawn killed by a man with a handgun then he hunt me down just to take my clothes and dignity.  10/10 would play again10
reat and awsome military lovers game  . you can enjoy how realistic is it  how many weapons it includes . those pretty detailed driving transports and how many different vehicules . the thing that i like is the workshop it s fans are too creative there always something new to try  some mods you will enjoy for free . its developpers aren't lazy at all  there is many updates and many news they are working pretty hard to make this game more special  . funny DLCS :D thats my opinion share me with yours i would be glad to hear it :)10
Excelent game if u like making plays
10/10 would die from a six foot fall again
ame = Mods  Great game! Constant hours played on 'Altis Life' and 'A3L'. The fact is this game is pretty boring without the mods added into it most will agree with me! I think the highlight of what made  a popular game was the Altis Life Mod which made a fun environment where communities could form and do RP within the game that mod is recommened. However despite having nearly 150hours just on Altis Life a new mod 'A3L' i has sparked up and taken over in opinion. The mod is a other RP mod like Altis Life however more shops a new map [Lakeside] and is taken more serious but is more fun to be fair. From robbing banks to being in a high speed chase as a cop you can do it all for yourself here.  is the game for you to get into the modded games community for sure you may even make your own community out of it [own a server]. Note this game also has improved graphics from arma 2 and really is smooth when playing [NO MORE DESYNC].  Ratings below:   [No Mods]: 5/10  [Mods]: 10/10  Thanks10
ow such realism. Much bullet drop. So tactical. 10/10 would simulate again.10
his game takes practice and boy once you become fairly skilled this game really begins to kick off the game does well to teach you things using a fun story mode and extra tutorials. This game has an alright community and i love the DLC!10
Best gamemode to play is Altis Life  Highly reccomend this game. :()
love this game i keep spending all my hours on it
Shootin brown people and delivering FREEDOM to poor countries around the world. What ing more do you want?
it's alright
is a simulator First/Third Person shooter one of the most realistic game's ive seen come by in a long while. You better have a good computer if you plan to play Multiplayer some servers really take a beating on FrameRate If you like military or just good ol pvp in general this is quite the game to sink some time into... The new map don't hold how special Wasteland was in Alpha/Beta but its still the core mentallity of the gameplay.10
Awesome game love this game :D
 have put a few hundred hours into  and it's the wackiest military game I've ever played.  Here are a list of entertaining things you can do in  that I have also personally partaken in:   You can set up enemy faction sentry guns to kill you and your team mates-  You can tactically scoot on your butt to the combat zone-  You can gather your friends inside a bullet proof room and bounce bullets off the walls and watch to see who dies first-  You can have your friends get in a truck then proceed to airlift said truck with a helicopter and swing them around below you while seeing how long it takes before you accidentally swing them into your main rotor and crash in an explosive inferno-  You can hide in a building while your squade mate crashes heavily armed UAVs into said building trying to kill you-  You can hop into a vehicle just to have it explode immediately after and kill you-  You can get stranded in the water after your helicopter pilot accidentally sank the chopper in the ocean then find a civilian driving a boat and kill said civilian to where the boat is just driving itself in circles just to have it smack you in the head so you're unconsious and drown-  Hands down  is one of the most entertaining wacky military simulator sandbox video games I've ever played. 10/1010
is an excellent military sandbox You don't buy it for the Singleplayer. You buy it for the Community mods and addons. You could really never run out of things to try or play.10
ing Great. OMG xD
The Bad Default campaign   The Good Pretty much everything else  If you aren't going to play multiplayer then don't bother with this game.
Not Call of Duty Level Quality -9/11
by far one of the most expensive games i bought (lel). besides from that it is also one of the funnest. Atlis Life is best. Love love love. iz like sperm
Preety wesome game
d like to say I like the game and i'm a fan would i recommend this game to people 'nope' not until they fix the 'sway' down sight you run 3 feet you sway you crawl you sway....you fart you sway...people are going to say it's 'realistic' that is bull....I hope no one in our armed forces are that wimpy and get tired that fast. if you want to know what it is like for michael j fox in his daily life buy this game...because that is what you'll be getting a michael j fox shooting game.-10
It takes a while to get used to the controls and everything but after that u have one of the best most fun open world game in the world. I will suggest tho if your new start with the campiagn without watching walkthroughs and then play a bit of Altis life life but overall i would definetly recommened it.
layed a little had fun. 10/1010
one of the best games
eutiful game brings back tons of memories from Arma 2. Amazing gameplay amazing graphics.  10/10 would root10
Got shot for and apple. 10/10
Arma Karts is exactly how it sounds. Hell yeah.
ne of the best games out there with countless mods to play and try and so many servers with different modes such as Altis life Wasteland  Life Exile Epoch etc. this game has it all if you are into Military Sims or just FPS's in general you don't have to have the worlds best PC to run it but you do need at least an alright one Ive played this game ever sense i got my PC and i can't say that there was a ever a dole moment with this game it just has so much things to do its a must buy.10
Simply  just good.
he game is great its very glitchy and needs to fix bugs but overall is one of my favorite games.10
ave had this game for a while near enough have 100 hours i don't play the campaign but i do play the multiplayer and it is quite fun. Played on Invade and Annex with others and gave sniper cover over a valley. Played on Altis life and became a rebel killing cops. Played king of the hill and had to fight my way through the streets of Kavala. Long story short. This game is good the SP and MP are both good People are good but some can be annoying.10
pdated review: I have been exploring more features of  and I love it!   I have been playing a bit of the standard  features which are fun but the sheer number of mods and workshop missions is unreal! This game is so flexible.  My most favourite mods and missions I have been playing are:  Altis life: think along the lines of GTA but everyone ever where is a real player the police military bandits civilians criminals everyone. It is a very immersive mission where you do what you want whenever you want. Earn money through doing legal jobs or become a criminal and traffic drugs rob banks rob other players do whatever you want to survive but beware your actions could get you on the police wanted list. Buy food weapons vehicles licenses and so much more it is a great experience when your on an active server.  Escape Altis: an online coop game which can also be played single player your goal to escape the huge island of altis. You will encounter AI enemy`s in all kinds of locations choose how you get through stealthy? Or guns blazing? Do it your way! This mission is very challenging and lots of fun best with mates!  Breaking Point: Think Dayz but on a bigger map less glitches and now a choice of 5 factions to choose from. Each with their own perks rules (or none depending which you choose) and appearance. Breaking point provides 5 maps Altis Stratis Thirsk summer and Thirsk winter.  The thirsk maps are PvP orientated with survival thrown in for good measure.  Stratis is bigger than than Thirsk maps with a bigger focus on survival against zombies and other players. Altis is just huge!  While breaking point is still in its infancy the dev team is working really hard at it and adding new features and maps frequently. Vehicles in this mod are fairly rare so expect work to be done finding them you will also have to fix them up to get them working to.  I love the  engine it is so flexible and allows for so many different ways to play it just never gets dull.  I highly recommend it!10
m not a massive FPS gamer but then I don't really count this game as a FPS. It's not like Battlefied CoD or any of those types of titles. This is a combat simulator and I have been immidiately impressed with the single player campaign (which I normally don't play!).  The game doesn't feel as responsive as some newer titles (BF4) but it's realism to me seems excellent. I don't know of course I've never been in a war and hope I never have too - but playing this game makes me feel about as close as I'd want to get.  I only started playing this game really after playing DayZ Standalone and will definately be continuing the explore it further.10
THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD :)))))
ell if you like COD then gtfo cuz this is  by far the best game i have ever play (with dota 2 in close second). it is a must have and is #DOpE10
his is one of the most interesting and expansive games out there. The current storyline and background is a bit unrealistic-The Republic of Altis and Stratis has a super-advanced military but the nation has under 50000 people in its population. The population also is Greek but for whatever reason all speaks english-even the armed forces. Nonetheless the mission editing is superb compared to Arma 2 the mechanics are mostly improved (animation and AI needing a bit of a change for realism) the voice acting for British and American English as well as Farsi is superb. Iran has a huge presence in the game however it is never mentioned and instead goes under the quite unrealistic banner of Canton-Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty or CSAT. I really wish that BIS would at least include the Iran flag above the CSAT insignia on the uniforms for it looked absolutely amazing when this was the case at E3 2011. Physics in the game are great however the fabled ragdoll physics are a bit dissapointing. All they seem to do is make units die in a more unrealistic-looking way. NATO is portrayed as completely bankrupt which really bothers me-unemployment is at freaking 50% in the US. It is interesting to see future interpretations of the US Army which use the new multicam pattern in their uniforms. I am bothered by the lack of ANY yes ANY authentic equipment in the game. This is perhaps my biggest problem for it gives the developers an excuse to make fantasy content for every upcoming Arma game. Yes it saves on lisencing but the developers just launched a 650-thousand dollar modding contest. A fraction of the money could have been spent on making the weapons and vehicles authentic.   With a host of friends to play with some mods and an open mind this title is one of the most awesome games I have ever played. The simulation of the vehicles is amazing with support for almost every joystick controller or other external device you can think of. The game fails to provide an immersive atmosphere but is a fun and engaging way to play COOP with friends strategy being completely necessary. The graphics are in my top 10 games ever and the performance is better than with Arma 2 especially if you plan on making Youtube videos like I do. (check out my Youtube channel: FistoGames :D ) Go and buy it. With some DLC's that bring it back to where Arma 2 was in scenario it will definitely be an amazing game.        10
un times to be had. Ignore all the issues and play the game. When you get down to it killing hapless peasants at range with a 50 cal and thermal optics is just as fun as gunning them down from across the street with a LMG. This game is at its best when you are on your own behind enemy lines with nothing but Abdul the condenscending Persian and your T-100. You can fire from behind a house or in a hull down position at the backs of unsuspecting armor infantry or the occasional aircraft. Fall back and repeat while the smoke fills the sky and peasants burn to their horrid deaths. In the end the game has some flaws but thats to be expected in a game this size regardles of that; I love this game. 9/10 Would use as trophy wife.10
Glitchy as hell but addictive
est game really good.10
rmA is one of the best games I have ever played but be warned it is nothing like your mainstream shooter like Battlefield or Call of Duty. ArmA presents you with quite a challenge because the AI is hard and unforgiving (sometimes even unfair) and weapons vehicles and damage all feel quite realistic.  I recommend getting the DLC Pack with it and (as soon as it releases) getting the expansion. The DLCs bring cool new content to the game and it is a great way to additionally support the Developers  ArmA can also be greaty improved with mods to anyone new to the game: Check out mods like TFAR ACE3 ASR AI and RHS:Escalation10
9.9/10
Amazing 3rd or 1st person shooter that has a very realistic feel (aka simulator) hard to get bored with all the user created content and the editor. The controls can be a tad tough to learn at first but with in a few hours you should have them down. Being able to mod your game file gives you tons of customizable things to do. I would recomend playing with a group of people because playing this game by yourself can tend to get boring. That is the only flaw iv been able to find really aside from a few random bugs here and there.
o man once u mod this game up it is so great. my recommendations are RHS mod and sound mod of ur choice. i love it so much. pretty much all of my playtime has been spent in the editor creating and playing my own little scenarios :-))
 bought this game day 1 of steam release it was pretty barebones stuff a few guns even less vehicles 1/3 a campaign.  They said more weapons would come (if you know arma 2 they had dozens of weapons  however had less than 10)  well more weapons did come in the form of paid DLC.  More vehicles more paid DLC.  Scumbag moves-10
This game is worth every cent. It is extremely realistic and has provided hours of fun for me and my friends.
Best time of my life right here. Amazing amazing game so much fun... The only problem is that it is optimized like garbage as soon as you play multiplayer or campaign your fps goes down regardless of your specs i upgraded three times and still i only get 30 fps multiplayer. Its a great game but the engine needs to be optimized badly.
Love it! Though I wish I had a better graphics card (gt 750m).
Like Skyrim with infidels
brings so much different game types to the table. From Altis Life which is a crazy GTA Online style clone that is better to full on war simulator with ari land troops. There is so much to do in this game. If you can't find something to do in this game then you need to get to a Doctor quick... cause you might be dead. :) Enjoy.10
ove the instense battles Graphics in this game. Arma is always a must have10
ood game played it for the free weekend. Nek minute I put my cd key in and I had to reinstall the whole game... 10/1010
I tried the game on the free trial and I have to say it was the funnest expirence Ive had in a WHILE. I cant get it right now because its too pricy for me.
fter the steep learning curve it's really good fun. Beware it seems very graphics intensive.10
Its a good game!!!
f you are looking for something to do.  If you are bored. If you like some resistance. If you really like teamwork. If you don't like teamwork but can be around people. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE GAME!!!   You will always have something new to learn fix repair or just curse with this game! In game you can create what the duck you what.  Trying to install mods it takes time and is super complicated and rarely every functions properly but in the end it's worth it.  I have yet to see a more complicated but fun game to play with people. Even if you are a lone wolf and just wants to sit on a hill and shoot people while your friends are running Rambo in a town.  Just saying... 2000+ hours in A2 1000+ hours in A3 and I never feel like giving up on arma. I would marry this game. Because I would have the same complicated arguments with a wife as with this game.  12/11.9 points!10
hanks to the community this game is allways a pleasure to play. Not for noobs but for mature players who'll enjoy a hard challenge.10
his game is a sandbox and what you get out of it is what your imagination or the community behind you puts into it.10
This game.... is good. 999999/10
*****
 One of the best Military Simulator on the market right now! Alot of good featuresShooting out of vechicles and a very good!  Warning:AMD performs worse than Intel in this game due to it being more Cpu based Buy it on sale or right now!10
It's almost as if it's real.
Very Enjoyable Game
set everything to low and still got 20 fps  10/10 Optimization
Hellicopters are good
reat game load it up optimize the sttings using GeForce. joins a game with a friends who recomended it. ... get 7 frames. thinks meh if i just put all my settings on low. it will increase fps right? NO ultra settings: 7 fps low settings : 7 fps ... it's playable right? no * walks around * *gets shot from somewhere* * gets dragged to a medic by a friend * * gets revived * * sees enemy * * tries to aim with 7 fps * *dies * ... i would reccomend if you have a beastly pc. but do not try to play on an outdated laptop.10
o here's my story on arma3 but before I tell you that I would like to say that don't buy this game if you're not okay with it running horrible because the dev's are lazy as  but that's besides the point as I need to tell you my story. I started the game and then found a tank within minutes I find myself destroying the entire base and then get banned after being called a little low-life  10/10 would get called a  and banned again.10
It has ISIS now
uch fun very wow10
ont buy this game. its not finished. there is no story there are bugs ai is stupid........ bohemia doesn´t give a  about releases they promised. we are still waiting for the 2nd part of the campaign that should have been released - as promised - in december. now the tell us it will be february. its a sanbox and without community developers this game would worth 0.- I highly recomment to wait a few months.-10
k so the bottom line is this is not just a shooter its not just a multiplayer shooter similar to the likes of Black ops 2 AW or anything like that it is as close to a military simulator. I love KOTH(King of the Hill) great game &amp; can be played as alone wolf or with friends. I have to give this 11/1010
ust like arma 2 there's a huge amount of variety in gameplay with this game. The graphics are fantastic although most people probably won't be able to run this game on full settings at a reasonable framerate.  Worth picking up even if you're not planning to play it in the immediate future.10
It's ight 9.99/10
fun game all around
best army simulator game
love this game and all of the gamemodes/mods if you dont own it buy it now your missing out
one of the best
i  in my pants every time i play...my marrige is on the rocks because of this game lol
great game:)
wesome game. Open world with tons of different things to try. The only big problem is the optimization for this game. Other than that it is a great game.10
This game is racist
his game was a lot of fun when I first got it but after a while my friends got bored and I decided to use mods.  Long story short mods will eat up your space and this game will take up a lot of space as it self.  Fun but you need people to play it with.10
Looted the corpse of my fallen comrade and took his sunglasses.  10/10 respec for your fallen bredas.
t is THE military simulator! Or something like it anyway.  It ain't a COD FPS no not even a Battlefield so much action game even better or worse. Many features such as weapon attachments underwater ops oh did i mention aviation?  Pros:  - Very very tactical maybe too tactical.  - Open world limited to whatever people can figure out.  - So many possible missions you just need to find them.  - So much mods so many many mods in fact maybe too many.  - Often medium to long range realistic combat which is usually really hard to hit enemies.  - Many features since first game release such as shooting from vehicles and Virtual Reality.  - Realistic graphics limited to your hardware or your nerves for lag.  - Many more?  Cons:  - Too tactical? Yep. Sometimes enemy AIs are a step ahead of you.  - With big content and graphics comes great hardware requirements.  - Modifications that may be too big to download.10
great game grhapichs amazing gameplay mods 10/10/ wouild buy again
 am 30 years old and started this series with Operation Flashpoint in 2001. As a result I am playing ARMA (and predecessors) half of my life.  It has a tough learning curve but if you embrace the gameplay and are willing to learn all the different aspects of the game it will reward you with the most realistic and unique gameplay across all games.  The game itself is basically a sandbox which is already great fun but adding the different mods it is so much more. If you are into fast pace action I recomment 'King of the Hill by SA-Matra'. Do you want to be a resistant leader with the aim of cleaning the bloody opressors from your island: Play 'Antistasi'. Do you want to have some survival action: 'Wasteland' or 'Epoch'. You enjoyed the movie 'The Hunger Games' and want to play sth alike: 'Battle Royal' is your mod. Last year they added the ZEUS which lets a player to be like a role play master who has a 3d editor to script a mission spawn enemies or friendlies directly on the fly while your players fight against what ever you throw at them.  The awesome community of Arma created countless missions (more then 20k) which range from small modifications to complete overhauls.  If I would need to pick one game for the rest of my life: This is it!10
Most realistc and funnist game I have ever played!!!
Great game recomend it to anyone!
h the good ol' Arma III. Lets get started.  Arma a mil-sim game by Bohemia how is it played? Custom game modes. Yes there's a campaign yes you can do the mil-sim related tasks and wage war against other mil-sim players but this game isn't typically played like that. Custom maps like: Altis Life King of the Hill Battle Royale Mod etc are how most people end up playing and enjoying this game.  As of this writing I play this game for the most part once or twice a week but as you can see I've logged hundreds of hours on this game. That should speak quite a bit in regards to the fun factor. Whether you want to Role-Play with other players (who 50/50 just shoot anyways) play a giant game of king of the hill with big guns and vehicles or just play an hour long survival last man standing kind of game... Arma III offers it.  Downsides to this game bugs lots of them expensive DLC and one of the most poorly optimized games I've ever played. The game would greatly benefit from a way more optimized engine that doesn't tank a modern PC under 60FPS by just being in a town.   Once again that said you can spend hundreds of hours entertaining yourself in the world that is Arma and I do highly reccomend this game for all shooter fans.10
IM SURPRISED I actually got addicted to it! Best game playing Alone OR Online. Soooo Gooood!
I LIKE DIS GAME CUZ U CAN GO BOOM BOOM INTO BAD GUY
his is the best military simulator available with its superb graphics and it's wide range of features highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys realistic gameplay.10
This game is amazing and i havent played multiplayer yet :P. Dandellion have to get this and play with me.
ou either die a good soldier or you live long enough to see yourself become a hater.  There are 2 ways in this game the first hours you hate right away or love it all the way.10
Great game I would suggest to the people that love army simulator games
fter almost 1100 hours I can say this game is dank af. Hosted 3 servers said alpha whisky bravo charlie a couple times and had serious fun.10
this game brout me 2 tear first time i play.... wow...!....wat a xpereance.  truly beutifull game play  12\10/7
Very good game.
 A3 compared to A2 had strong and weak sides: good things are: new engine. more offloading to GPU among GFX things atleast(and DX10 support btw. DX12 promised in Tanoa). new editor. somewhat rehauled/reworked core modules generally 'for good'. bad/disapointing things are: less content. gear vehicles features ingame. ugly setting in stock package both art islands vehicles collection 'alternative future' era touch with bat[cenzored]crazy opinions about that 'future' in terms of miltech state of. but thats more about personal taste. but choice about 'sunset' as editor default perhaps Good thing. AI and physics code not really scalable/multicore(thanks' to intel libraries and lack of message-passing code(developers with ada/smalltalk/haskell/erlang experience is rare asset to sieze) and one-sided profiling of binaries. even more obvious/eye-wrapping/scratching post-processing. but not uniform 'bloom' as in A2 but DoF and color-based things 'console'-style and generally DayZ-alike 'casualisation' isn't thing i welcome in Arma frankly-speaking. no 64-binaries(and A3 dataset is HUGE. even w/o serious(and A2/A3 may look truly Beatiful with it and aircrafts playable)viewdistance and mide or small-sized islands with huge gridsstep. despite persistent modders efforts to fix most obvious gaps(like decent islands gear etc)generally major flaws was engine(it buit atop)itself and incomplete(or incoherent with)documentation(i Do really miss OFP:R-era Very documented engine/syntax examples references) tools/sdk(especially landscape editor perhaps). so after DX12 most important things for A3 would be: putting 64-bit engine(for both client AND server)into actions making A3 really-multithreading or better relying about Message-passing code(preferably over some ERlang code perhaps. considering scalability advantages even against other MP-langs or MP-libs/wrappers to overcome)especially in AI code(most stress even in ~ short battles/matches). generally i would recommend A3. but not for casual gamers. if you one of newbie in milsim or even in action games at all - you may be disapointed/frustrated at first time or even angry(if you read some reviews - you may had expressions of). its game for gamers really Knowing what they need and why. cuz most fun in A3 rolled over three things: teamplay challenge replayabliliy. and editability/moddabiliy.(but it worth another separated review i guess).10
Thanks for the free weekend. Now i know i can run it! I'll be buying it in the near future.
errible multiplayer optimization with those who have AMD chips. Running an 8 core bulldozer AMD CPU with 8GB of DDR3 and a R9 270x and I cant get over 15-20Fps tops while online (no matter the server). Terrible. Its a known issue with this game engine but it looks like there isnt any hope in site in the near future. Otherwise I think id like this game. I really have no use for the single player so im not sure about it. I do know its playable on most rigs even AMD ones. But I bought this one for the MP and I cant play it so....not sure how good it is gameplay wise really. (PS-its not just my setup that causes these issues either. I couldnt run it any better with my AMD FX-6100 6 core with samsung DDR3 and a HD 7770 GPU).-10
is not your typical first person shooter. It is a military simulation. It truely is one of if not the most immersive games I have ever played. The amount of tactical realism this game offers is like no other shooter out there.  rewards the player for having good tactics teamwork and communication over twitch reflexes like in other vanilla shooters. If you're a fan of anything military or just like strategic tactical gameplay especially with friends i would definately recommend this title.10
{LINK REMOVED}  http://www.xvideos.com/video2592023/og_mudbone_compilation  -  in a nutshell 10/10
not enough content wtf?
Yeah it's alright
f you like realism and military stuff.... Just BUY this game! This game also have a tons of mod like epoch exile ace etc.10
great game would r8 8/8 m8
you have a friend? play this game  you dont have friend? play this game  you dont have this game? buy the game you dont have money? get a job you dont have job? die  dieee !
mazing game especially Altis life some people say sixty dollars isn't worth it it is. Altis life and the workshop content are aspiring over expectations of most mod players the base game is pretty good (Pretty complicated though) I would say the mods are the best of this game like of course Garry's Mod Altis life is my favorite I play Battle Royale occasionally but my secondary gamemode that I play in the downtime of my favorite Altis Life server is King of The Hill amazing gamemode also to mention this game (just like Arma 2) is extremely moddable unlike all EA games and lets say triple A games. All and All its worth sixty dollars and is a must buy. There are some downsides to this game like Arma 2 not that well of optimization (extremely better than Arma 2) but thats my opinion also DSYNC is a problem to some servers and you WILL have problems if you have a terrible internet company like me would buy again.  9/1010
ood army game you can actually kill vehicule with rocket unlike Battleshit 4 where you can heal tank with electrical screwdriver that are more powerfull than rockets. 9/1010
Good game. 1/1. That's a perfect score.
A yo dude dis is te  if yo want to shoot sum of dose cops niqqua. DAMN DIS  IS LIKE DEtroit LIKE BAGHDAD NIQQUA GOOAAD DAAYM
 game with an experience and community like no other with a multitude of game styles on a scale that destroys all rivalry10
 bought this game when it was pre-order or early acces. I can't remember. Played it for a few minutes but couldn't find a good community to get into with the multiplayer. It's been about almost a year now and I've come back to this game to realize I absolutely love it. Arma 2 was good. I had a love hate relationship with it. I tried and tried to find a decent multiplayer server but I could not. However I did a bit of digging around and found a great KOTH infantry only server and I'm in love. I'm a HUGE diehard Socom fan and I love the 3rd person feel to the game.  fills that spot and I can already tell hours of my soul will belong to Arma now. I don't have a high end pc but I can still hang and contribute a lot towards helping my team win. The movement is better as well as the overall feeling towards the mobility of your soldier. I give this a thumbs up. I have nothing to complain about. If you love Socom get this game. Play Koth infantry only. You may need to download an  launcher that has a lot of other servers on it that deal with mods. Anywhoo I highly recommend this game.10
amaizing thats alll you need to know &lt;3
ell I only have 100 hours on this one. But that's enaugh after I've played nearly 2000 hours of ArmA 2 OA with and without the DayZ mod.(440 or so hours wasteland 220 hours on a single dayz server and about 150 - 200 on multiple other DayZ epoch servers via DayZ commander) The game is simply improved it runs better than the old one does (at least on my system) looks great is less clunky. The game is set in future (I dislike this bit) Is a time cow as alaways. To newcomers this game takes time. There are no quick 10 minute rounds. The meat of the game for me is on 120 people wasteland servers where it takes time to get gear takes time to travel takes time to siege and objective and so on. An average paly session will last from 2 hours and up (If you want to acctualy acomplish something).   10/10 would recomend if you can run it.   Howerver I'd simply suggest picking up ArmA 2 when it's avalible for 5 or less euros since the price is quite steep when not on sale and you're either going to love this (like I do) or hate it.   It's not comparable to Battlefield or Call of Duty. And even more so it's false to think that liking any of those games will make you like ArmA as well.  Also when deciding on making your purchase take a good hard look will you be able to run this game and if can play a game on 30 fps. I'm all PC master race guy with atleast full HD and 60fps as a requirment however without the latest and greatest rig it's hard to swim around 60fps in this title. SP runs well very well even but when it comes to MP your expierence is close to unpredictable. On some servers you'll be running great and on some you'll have 10fps no matter what you do.   This game is uniqe. It's more like tools and materials that can be used to create a beautifull house than the house itself. If you want to expierence the construction of your house rather than getting one already built there is no better title than this one. 10

Very fun game. But downfall of it is that you need some of your friends to play in order to have lots of fun. + the AI cheat
GREAT....but the for online if you wanted to do anything besides....Grunt work then you need teamspeak or the server admins will rage bann you...all of them....
This is one of the most fun games ive ever played
its really good love everything in it so far
I have played this game for a long time and have also played arma 2. I would call this game one of the best games out there. There is so many things that you can do that it just does not end.    If you are looking for a new game to buy I would say  is a great chose.
stounding game. Great graphics gameplay and more. Whenever I played it I would feel either really relaxed or tense no in-between.  However my computer is  so I can't play it :(10
his game is one of my favoutites and you just dont run out of things to do there is all these custom missions and lots Of different gamemodes only con is this game needs pretty good computer to run with max graphics10
Fantastic game. No regrets at all about buying it. 10/10
his game is definitely a direct improvement over Arma 2. If you are familiar with that game it is very easy to transition over to this game. I especially enjoy the mission editor. The mission editor has a pretty steep learning curve but enough tutorials and trial and error will get you competent with the editor's logic. The game is much better optimized than Arma 2 was but it still runs pretty awful on multiplayer even with a high spec PC. I ended up having to turn down my view distance to a pretty low amount to consistently get 40 fps on multiplayer because the fps largely relies on the server's power. On single player or a small server of 5-10 people I could just about max out the game with a steady 60 fps. I am disappointed with the DLC though as it really doesn't add much at all to the game at this point and it retails at $25. I would recommend picking this game up even if you have never played the other Arma games because it seems like it has a much smaller learning curve than previous titles but is still just as in-depth. This game is a good purchase especially on sale the DLC on the other hand is not currently worth it.10
Great game.Gives you that original war feeling.For those who are interested in tactical gaming this is the game for you.
his game is only good if you remember the controls and to remember the controls you will need a PhD in quantum physics and engineering.10
 have spent quite a long time playing this game and developing for it.  Pros: Graphics  Systems (Weapon attchements Ect.)  Combat   Vehicles Feal More Realistic  Physics are 100 times better than Arma 2   Cons: Feals Incomplete  Mods Almost Feal neccesarry for vetran amra fans  Paid DLC On a Small Scale Arma 2 DLC inluded weapons features maps and a new campaign not 2 helicopters and a sling system.  Community Has went downhill since the introduction of DAYZ in arma 2 but has improved snce standalone.  Mod Support Still hasnt improved   Performance  Multiplayer DeSync  OverView: I love arma and i allways will but the new DLC system and lack of content left a bad taste in my mouth but overall the game holds up to its features and premise of a arma game just expect to downoad alot of mods for those AK's and ARs you like.   8 Out of 10 For this game   Time logged when this review was posted is 615 Hours of ingame time. 10
A good military tactical shooter
1. Run cocaine wit ur boi's 2. Love your mother 3. Make money 4. F**K Bi**hES 5. ?????? 6. Profit
Most realistic first person shooter with very detailed weaponry system and huge maps. The only bad thing is its poor optimization making it run slow on certain maps and servers.  Its a really good game which i recommend playing with friends  10/10
 found this game 'fun entertaining and breath taking' action packed10
The best game !.. Ever ..! the best money I've spent on steam and it's all worth it. =)  out of 5 stars i can give  ?????
tbh  vanilla game. Awesome modded game  8.7/10
I have put endless hours into the entertaining game. This game plays as an military simulation/sandbox  So if you are looking for something like call of duty go away. This game offers campaigns with a editor tool so you can make your own scenarios. (or just have some fun)  In the multiplayer it has many gamemodes wth plenty of servers to keep you busy. co-op and RPG are to name a few.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for and open-world realistic shooter.  Review by Motabilla
amazing game full of epic mods worth every penny just buy it lol.
Ear  people by setting default microphone to Stereo Mix.  Play Caravan palance - Dirty Side of The Streat  999/10
reat game but fps is  most of the time and the paywall stopping you from using dlc content is really annoying.10
reat game and compatable with Mods. Having played more than 1000 Hours on this game I'd rate this 10/10.10
is really fun but sometimes can get really boaring when not playing wiht anyone or without interacting with other players.10
played 1 game for 3 hours and got 4 kills 10/10
Any sane person would say this game is bad... I am not sane. This has got to be the most fun I've had with a game in a long time.
.
his game is one of the most realistic war simulators ever I have got over 2300 hours right now and it is one of the most addicting games I have played in a long time. There are so many game modes from TDM to survival and roll playing it is well worth the money. If you have friends that play it then it makes it so much better. 100% recomend it to every one who wants to get! 10
This game is good
I love it.
mproves a lot from the previous games but lacks certain key improvements to really set it apart from ARMA 2 like a redesigned 'AddAction System' and multiplayer performance. Still a great game in its modding infancy. In a few months there will be some great addons.10
lmost 40 hours into the game and I can honestly say it's the best game I've purchased on Steam amazingly fun action packed and a lot of things to do never gotten tired of it and I'll continue to play it until I find another game as funny as this one.10
10/10 would be a rabbit again
Let's just say it's awesome
Friendly-fire is enabled. 10/10
this game is awesome that is all!
Faceplanted and died whilst being shot at by a guy screaming Hitler quotes at me. 10/10
it ok till u hit fence then gota walk 20k
is a wonderful game. Within the main game you find dozen of game types and mods. You can go ultra hyper realistic to just having a crazy experience. The mods alone make the game worth it. The maps are huge.   This is my favorite game. So I will always gush over it and praise it. Go on youtube and check out the thousands of videos that show what this engine can do.   PLAY THIS GAME.11
This game is the BEST army simulator anyone will ever play. I like how you can pick about anything for your character to use or wear. Every thing is realistic in this game and i highly recomend this game!
ou want a game where everything is close quarters combat? You want a game where you can see your enemy shooting you? You want a game where your health regenerates and you're able to survive several shots to the face? You want a game where the vehicles are extremely easy to operate and pretty much nearly invincible? You want a game where the guns are easy to aim and you need absolutely no experience to use them? You want a game where the map is nice and small and compact and is perfectly practical to walk across?  Sorry. But this game is not for you.  10/1011
10/10 would play again
y story on ... This was not made up I wrote this review for what it was likef or the first time... Before the war started... I remember watching on T.V. Where landing craft was landing on the Beaches and men were getting killed... I landed in the airport and I remember how people were signing up for the army. I ran through the grass in California rushing to the airport to head to Afghanstan. After I landed we landed in Europe somwhere. It get us half an hour to get though training. I fell asleep after a day. I woke up hearing the transports going by of Officers. I got up and looked around I decided to go aboard my Heilcopter. I looked outside the driver closed the Heilcopter down after my new sqaud got in. I looked as we passed the terrain beatiful. Then we were going accross the sea. I still had my pistol out and tried to quickly figure out where my gun was. Then I saw land the same land and beach I saw on T.V. We landed a mile or two away from the beach. I didnt have time to figure out my equitment so I rushed with my sqaud. My sqaud was getting ahead of me. Heilcopters and airplanes were everywhere above me. I kept running my sqaud split up I kept falling my objective to follow my leader. I looked ahead and saw fences and tons of troops. I finally got my gun out and rushed accross grass and fences.  All of a suddden gunshots started to fire I didnt know where so I kept running. A sharp pain in my hand and I dropped to the floor taking cover. I kept crawling until my worst enemy was in front of me: The fence. I decided to get up and run I kept running until I reached the troops running in the dirt. Then my sqaudron started to move out to the town. On my way I saw men surrounding a man. The man was dead I heard gunshots all over again. The man checked the boddy and the dead man got up. The sniper was shot by his own teamate. I rushed to where the sqaudron was and they healed the man appolgizeing. I kept rushing through all of a sudden 'Mission accpomplished men onto the next objective'! I lost my team everybody spreaded out. A Heilcopter was picking a man up I rushed to it and it took off without me. I decided to head back to where I ran through the fences. I kept running I noticed that I was thirsty I was tired. I kept running trying to figure out my radio. Pressing buttons all over. All of a sudden I pressed one button and talked into it: 'Hello Hello this is Robert this is my first time fighting and I need a medic!' I repeated the same sentence this time louder. No reply came to me and I was worried I would die  Sweat came accross my face as I looked into a empety Heilcopter. I got in and he took me further into the fighting not back to H.Q. I never knew when the battle was gonna be over. I frogot my Journal on the other Heilcopter and noticed this Heilocopter from H.Q. The ride was longer we passed many farms in ruins and a city. The heilcopter stopped and dropped me off alone. Another Heilcopter came in and quickly a man jumped out of it. I remember a attack Heilcopter above me. I ran to the village and was shot multiple times. I turned quickly and got on the ground I was shot in the back.  I fell asleep. I woke up back at H.Q. wondering what was happening. 'go go go!' A man shouted as cars passed by. I was eager to get back into the Chopper. I got in and there was a bigger new sqaud in the Heilcopter. They wispered plans to eachother. I started to write my first battle but time went by and everybody got out. 'Robert go go go!' The man shouted I got out and the heilcopter waited a second then lifted off the ground. This time we landed in the same spot I stayed with my team this time but the same comamnder came on the radio. 'Great job you have taken the objective'. Our team ran to the forest silently. Our sqaud commander took his binoculars and looked ahead. 'Retreat!' Kept repeating on our radios. A half an hour later armour was spotted and I  myself. We were under fire and multiple jets were spotted. A artillery shot fired and the civillian that came with us fell to the ground. The Marine got his SAW and fired it.  We moved into the town and we thought the two heilcoptesrs were enemy heilcopters. We got into one of the Heilcopters and we waited for a long time for many people to get in. Ranger sqaud got in with snipers and a civillian got in. WE lifted off the ground and this time it felt alot more scarier. All of a sudden while I was about to say somthing a huge hole went into the glass and hit the machine gun and almost killed the sniper. Bullets were everywhere and there were jets outside picking us off. I wanted to get out but everything was down. Nobody moved and we were going on. The heilcopter exploded and we all flew out. A pack of us layed there. I was gonna call for a medic but I couldnt reach it. Nobody could find us. We were all lost. All I could do was finish my story and await for sombody to find me.      Thanks for reading this was my first time and im eager to do my 2nd adventure and then get some mods like the zombie mod and Colonial mod!!!11
lmost a perfect infantry combat experience. The peripheries aren't quite polished especially air combat and there is a lack of content in the base game but the ability to make mods for this game is what really makes it shine. Overall I give this game a 9/1011
I'm writing this review because Steam wants me to. Also  is awesome.
I think this game is great buy it omg im crying to my mom because she slaps the  out of me please help she wanted me to review this game help
Great game can't stop playing it
Well i had it then Steam took it away from me. :(
 the only game i have played where i was like hum this map is big be i wont see any one and then get shot buy a jet
Such a good game. Don't get it if you have a bad pc!
It's a very nice game with multiple dedicated servers with different mods! Brilliant gameplay!
ow this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air  In west Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'  I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said 'I might as well kick it'.  First class yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmmmmm this might be alright.  But wait I hear they're prissy bourgeois all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air  Well the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning disappeared  I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'  I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air 11
layed Dayz Standalone version.... Enjoyed it but so many cheaters hacking So the only way I could play was to hack also.. It ended with a global account battleye ban. Brought  on this account and loved it however could not play online as the ban carried over onto this game also which I was devastated about. I loved this game and agree with the mojority of postive comments... so I decided to create a new account and buy  again.  Overall I am happy with paying double the price as I have a great game and I spent many hours on Dayz griefing the hackers and giving them a taste of their own medicine.  10/1010
Very strategic and requires skill more than anything.
It's like skyrim with guns
ery fun will play for years.10
Optimization needed.
this is the ing iest game i have ever played if you are thinking about getting it dont because otherwise you are an fajit so you can suck my an  bruh and its not freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee betch
Im in love with this game !
 have heard many things about this game such as its poorly optimized or it's too laggy. Yes it is poorly optimized in some situations but when it comes to graphics knowyour computer specs and dont argue when it lags because you bought the game without looking at your computer specs and noticing their bad. In my opinion this game is very fun. It is a very realistic game because crashing a car that your in will hurt you. Getting shot in the head will kill you. When sniping there is bullet drop. I love this game not only for its graphics but mostly for the gameplay.    I will note that I reccomend having friends to play with on the game because it's not so fun alone. Well at least there are some nice people in the game others willbe totlal douches as a teamate. I love to play gamemodes such as King of the Hill Wasteland and Battle Royal but not so much.    I will rate this game a 8.25/10 due to the lag even on low setting. Also if you have the settings too low for your computer the game will lag I can play this game at 50FPS on ultra settings.10
 Huge Map + Good Community + Realistic Guns   +/- Too many controls.  - Campaign Story Sucks - Horrible Voice Acting - Clunky Animations - Not a lot of people playing. Sometimes there are some maps with a good amount of people otherwise it's locked.  7/10 It's a decent modern Shooter but my experiences with it aren't satisfactory. The game feels like like Arma 2 but with good graphics skin. You will always find people who are microphone active but they can sometimes be toxic if you're a noob. I have heard lots of things about  from the past but it looks like its popularity has cooled down since I mostly find maps with only 12 people in it.  Overall: it's a good game and you'll probably like it if you're a hardcore mordern shooters but don't expect it'll be the golden game you've been wanting.  Also don't bother buying the DLC. The majority of multiplayer rooms disable them.10
Awesome game recommend it to everyone !!
 nice game but not optimised for AMD-multicore users. I'm a big ARMA fan but its unplayable on my PC. (5-20 FPS)  AMD FX-8120 Black Edition GTX780 8 Gb RAM  Probably the game uses one core most of the time. There are a lot of such called 'tweaks' but they all have the placebo effect.  Please Bohemia fix it.  When you have an decent Intel processor this game runs better. Still thumbs up for the game.10
est and most modular game I've ever played. I've never been so addicted to any game this much10
 only played the free version of it But... I ran into war with a bunch of people in underwear. We all died. 10/10 would run into battle naked again.10
robably the best game out there if you have friends to play it! Endless scenarios and campaigns being added in the workshop. Not recommended for too casual players quite a learning curve to really understand the game.10
Best game ever shoot many enemy wow. Get apc sshoot many raket for enemy i like 5/5 only noobs and  dont recommind this game #yolo #sweg
It's like a 1000 games in one
This game is now my child.
was fun
wow i never knew 14fps was this playable
he graphics are great and there is a lot of stuff in the game from mortars to drones helicopters and jets tanks civillian and millitary transport vehicles etc. It requires a great deal of skill to pilot/use some of these. The multiplayer is really good and you can play Altis Life RPG Wasteland Co-Op king of the hill and more. 85% of community is great and much more mature compared to other FPS games. The only thing I don't like very much is infantry movement not sure why though feels different. Overall it's a great experience I recommend it.10
Flying offroads wielding 50. calls xdddd
here are lots of bugs and poor design choices that's for sure. The graphics aren't that great and the game runs like crap (sometimes 25 fps on my top end system). The game can also be really boring and frustrating (like when you get stuck on rocks and have to restart a 2 hour mission).  That said I definitely recommend this game for someone who's tired of the same ol arcade shooters. Before I played Arma I thought Battlefield 3 was a military simulator (lel). This game is nothing like call of duty. In arcade shooters like CoD there's tons of action all the time and it gets mind numbing. In Arma action is pretty infrequent but when it does happen it's really intense and unforgiving. The missions are also very sandbox; you can plan out your own strategies instead of just running through ACTIONPACKED!!!!! repetitive levels.  It's a hard game to learn. It uses almost every button on the keyboard. To this day I still don't know how to do some things such as use laser guided bombs. If you're looking for a challenging intense 'true pc game' you can't go wrong with Arma III.10
Verry fun many bugs
ent on the breaking point mod (Dayz) and I was instantly hunted down by 6 men in a chopper. I ran to the first house I saw picked up an axe and axed the first man to come in. I then proceeded to grab his gun off him but was shot in the head. They then proceeded to say the only reason this is happening is because I had a brown player model.   10/10 Would brown player model again.10
est military simulator ever... Want to experience some hardcore  not COD t? try it buy it enjoy it.10
 love the fact that the maps are so large it barely crashes and its soooooo tactical10
wesome game quality top preformance. More than 500 mods great and realistic physics best combat simulator. Awesome game ! I recommend it 100%10
ROS: -Great game with tons of mods and gamemodes -The community is huge and there is always going to be players -Graphics are simply beautiful  CONS: -Game is unoptimized  -Game may initially be overwhelming to newcomers of the series. -Lack of more in-depth audio options may be a turnoff for us 7.1 surround users or those who just want a greater level of control.  MY REVIEW  Your experience and mileage may vary depending on what you do with . You can go all vanilla and play campaign or simple multiplayer or you can go with the huge modding community. The mods are really what make this game great. Not in the mood for simple deathmatch? Play king of the hill with 120 players! Not in the mood for that? Try Epoch or Survival!   The gameplay is solid and the experience is worth it. There is only one con and it may affect you depending on how you like to experience games.   You are more than likely not going to get 60 FPS in this game and probably will be hard to get a solid 30 without the occasional dips. This game is highly unoptimized on multiplayer. The game runs fine with single player campaign but with multiplayer the netcode is completely weird. Some mods i can get 60 FPS in some i can barely hit 30. Regardless if i run on ultra or minimum settings you will only usually have the same FPS the server has. This was a BIG problem initially then i just got past it. The gameplay more than makes up for it and the experience is more about the community. Hopefully this will be rectified soon however i highly doubt it especially if you look at DayZ.  Audio customization is a problem i have in particular also. With all the customization  allows with the interface they barely have any settings for audio. Mostly just the general 'Master' 'Chat' etc. I wish i could choose which sounds' levels i could adjust.   I bought this game with the intention of playing EPOCH since DayZ' latest update ruined everything i liked about the game and in the end i barely play EPOCH. Mostly Survival and King of the Hill. Great gametypes and i also highly recommend ATLIS Life.  In 's current state i would rate it a 7/10.10
he best military simulator! If you enjoy realism run out and buy now!10
Both Call of Duty and Battlefield don't come half as close to realistic modern warfare as Arma III Does.
o this is in no way better than Call of Duty I feel cheated with this game it's too hard and endlessly complex.10
great game fun playing with friends and just having fun
When I started my first mission in coop I ended up dieing in the first few seconds. Little did I know how to fly a helicopter but I wasn't going to have anyone hold me back! took down 10 guys..not sure if they were on my team. 10/10
Very entertaining alot of modding for this game. If you like the more realistic military simmulators this is for you. 8.4/10
I've played it every once in a while. Would recommend
un As Hell! Great game only complaint is.... NO JUMP. REALLY!! Epic fail in that department as your legs into the floor of the cement pad you try to climb on to. I will say amazing game other then that though10
is a game with simulation elements. It's not a simulator.   It is also a game for a specific type of gamer that prefers large scale warfare instead of playing casual fast-paced shooters like COD or BF. If you enjoy the experience from briefing and planning  and executing a plan  no matter how it plays out the game adapts to any playing style that fits your style. Run &amp; gun still works but you need to have some uber micro skills..   If your mission fails Arma allows you to retreat and get out alive or gives you the oppertunity to get it done in another way. That's a nice touch compared to games that usually let the game end right after a fail. (SP)  A bullet in the head will kill you a bullet in your ballistic helmet might save your life get shot in your legs and you're have to crawl your way out of there..   Things you have to consider in real life come close to the decisions you have to make in this game.   Playing multiplayer with a group of people make the experience even better but this game isn't really 'finished'. While the tags say it's a full release Bohemia keeps working for years on these games to improve and add more content. They've done the same thing to their previous titles.   If you really care about Multiplayer I suggest Arma 2 :CO.    Pro/cons :  + Mission Editor Large scale warfare Mods (Armaholic &amp; Bis forums) Steam workshop - User Generated 'Mission' Content (Mods in future?) All kinds of vehicles (Air Cars Armor Support and so on) +270 km2 map to explore  - Multiplayer performance still crap. AIR vehicle (MH-/AH-) lost turnspeed please add a slider to have us configurate our own speed on pedals. Setting sensitivity to high still have slow pedal movement _&lt; Those small choppers are able to quickly rotate  but now it's a slow  long and horrible turn. No co-op in Campaign?. (Co-op game plox!) AI moves unnatural (They behave like androids)10
asy to love hard to master. Best enjoyed with the highest fps your rig can manage. I suggest lowering visibility for largest improvement.10
There are no servers in Asia but the game is pretty enjoyable nonetheless.
ThIS GAME IS SWAG
is THE most detailed combat simulator you can find for a PC . There's much improvement from ArmA 2  including smarter UI more natural feeling movement and so on. Community support is excellent with mods and scenarios created by the day keeping the game fresh for a long time. A must buy if you are looking for a more 'serious' shooter than your average Counter-Strike.10
Best war simulator ever!! Highly recomended !!
hile there are still a few bugs it really is a great game MUCH better than ArmA 2. Highly Recommended!10
 think  one of the most dangerous game to review in whole ocean of the Steam Games. Because of its style many people don't like this game at all and compare it with the other games like BF3 CoD series. However it is another story. First of all it is a military simulation which offers you to  realism . I have been playing ArmA series for about 100 hours now and I haven't thought leave it yet.  If you  like  slow developed action the tactical thinking rather than just fire everywhere and have couple of friends to cooperate this game will be in your dreams when you shut it down and sleep. The mission making system modding support and huge map is definetely make this game better than many of the First Person Games  in my opinion . 10
ghWhat else is there to say about ? Theres so many things. A huge open world so detailed and so great thats amazing. An awesome community that loves playing tactically. I could go on for daysYou just have to try it. Here take the money just buy it. Your still focusing on my review go ahead and buy it buy it now nownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownownow10
reat game Worth every $$$  10
Best thing since sex.
Realism at it's finest. Doesn't get much more real than this ladies and gents.
This game is SOOOOO COOL Love running around in Atltis life gaining money and robbing people :D SO fun 100000/100
?????????????????????  ????????????????????? ???????????????????? ? ???? ???? ?? ???? ???? ???? ?? ?? ???? ?? ???? ????
rove quadbike off clif no damage. Drove tank into tree exploded. The new karts dlc is amazing within the first day. 10/10 would recommend.11
ell 50 meters out of a chopper in multiplayer didn't open my chute and lived. 10/1011
 Gives me a hard on whenever i open it.Just the smell of the cover makes me want to murder a puppy and  on a newborn baby with cancer like cause iam just so indie like that. Its like the love of my life i dont need a girlfriend because i have my  by my side. My non indie Friend Rory Evans hates this game cause he is not Indie like me. It gives me more to do around the house other than thinking bout ways to kill myself or How to make the news with the next big mass school killing.
Tis a great game...
ts fun but not great PVE vs AI you lose close combat(they shoot thru bushes ect) PVP working good if you have a good PCyou dominate the game Making your own map playing with friends for fun or adding some cool addons. 10
 remember seeing screenshots of Arma 1 and thinking 'Wow this game must keep me entertained for months' but after obtaining it I quickly changed my mind and thought what a buggy piece of crap this is me being a somewhat casual gamer back then. The game was a total disaster to me and made me think 'How could they even call this a game?' The best part were the voice commands. Move. To. That. Building. At.. SIX O'CLOCK! Not to mention the game ran like crap. (Only arma players know what crap means.) (This was obviously ~6 years ago so I was a bit younger then aswell)  Well I had a friend in xFire who I shared a similar fate with but for some reason we decided to try it out together anyway. What we did was the sample Seize the area -mission that you can automatically create from the editor. Suddenly the game wasn't so bad after all. Everything that it lacked in the usual things you have in FPS games it gained back in gameplay and the complexity of the game. Suddenly the trademark buggyness and clumsyness of the engine (which is still present) was a feature instead of a problem. We played it for about 60 hours straight after that downloading mods missions and whatnot.  Then came Arma 2. Being a moneyless kid I was I couldn't buy it. So we tried different cracks playing through hamachi LAN with the same CD-Key and whatnot but got beaten by the anti-crack software it had built in. Now you might think that's cause of our amateurism but really it was cause nobody played the game back then and nobody could create working cracks. Literally there was maybe 1000 players around the world who had bought the game. Eventually I managed to buy the game and spent countless hours on it until it was time to put it on the shelf.  And then maybe two years later came DayZ and probably a million more players cause of it.  Suddenly there were keygens cracks.. - whatever you needed to bypass the protection. Also the mainstream gamer had found out what kind of possibilites the Arma engine can provide (dayz being the example). This was something the game developers deserved for putting so much effort to the series.  And now cause of this success  is here. It's basically Arma 1 and 2 with a bigger budget. I wouldn't have ever thought during my Arma 1 days that it would ever get this popular.   What  features: - Excellent graphics - The most realistic military simulation there is - Huge map - Good modability: This has always been a strong point in the series just check Armaholic and steam workshop and you'll find all sorts of things for your liking. - Possibility to design scenarios with endless different ways: Want a mission where you have to sneak through enemy lines and assasinate an officer? You got it. - Excellent co-op gameplay. - Trademark clumsyness to a lot of things which will become a feature once you get used to it.  But.. if you're a codfag; you need to give the game some time. It's not your usual casual FPS where everything is scripted and whatnot. And get someone to play with.10
lthough there are many faults to the game which are in the current process of being fixed the game as it stands gives my friends and I endless capabilties through the use of the online community.10
i would like to test  out can you make it free for like 3 days please?
694 Hours Played ¯\_(?)_/¯  11
by far the best game i have ever played yet keep up the good work
This is THE game to own. There's nothing else like it and the Community is great ! 10/10 from me easy
ive played it a few times. its okay
is a very nice gamewell developed and supported by creators from all around the world who keep making modsmissions and all that kind of stuffs that improve the quality of the game and increase its lifetime...sadly it's a bit bugged sometimes and it lacks some key features like jumping and climbing(which can be introduced by mods)but overall it's a good game and it's worth the money and i can't wait to see how arma 4 will look like!!10
he Arma series has become an amazing masterpiece throughout its past 15 years of development. With backing from previous games and mods such as Arma 2 and the DayZ mod the developers have made it into a work of art.  really finalizes the series for me with more DLCs on the way and improved bullet ballistics and combat realism this truly is the mil-sim to rule them all. Along with the addition of the Apex expansion came more weapons and vehicles which drastically improved gun variety and the number of combat situations. Overall amazing game and I would definitely reccomend it if you like 'Serious Fun' (in Shack Tac terms) then you need to get this game.10
imulation Military Tactical Realistic. Then add mods. OOGABOOGA +100010
ohemia Interactive's  is the lastest iteration of a long-running series of realistic military sandbox titles where the common themes have consistently centred upon player freedom flexibility of action and movement an expansive open world setting an impressive degree of virtual realism and a passionate player community.   Set in the near future  presents the player with the sprawling high-fidelity terrain of Altis a war-torn Mediterranean island in the Agean Sea caught up in the building tensions between NATO and the growing influence of an eastern military alliance known as CSAT. This simmering geopolitical state of play serves as the core backdrop to the title's 3-part singleplayer campaign and persists as the central theme and justification of the game's simulated conflict.    The island of Altis itself is an immense detailed and truly immersive canvas upon which the player is free to realise practically any military scenario of their imagining; where the journey from point A to point B can easily encompass many kilometres and where topography and geographic features can collude to radically alter player tactics. Based loosely upon the real island of Lemnos Altis is able to achieve a uniquely natural feel to its coasts rolling hills and forests and stands as a great testament to the skill and dedication of Bohemia interactive's map designers. Even while pinned under withering enemy fire one cannot help but be struck by its beauty and authenticity.     also offers up a plethora of near-future military hardware; from various firearms transports logistical supports infantry fighting vehicles main battle tanks helicopters as well as fighter jets and boats. The assets are generally very well modelled with distinct individual characteristics which make driving a quadbike a very different experience from that of a lumbering metal behemoth. While the helicopter flight dynamics are driven by Bohemia's optional challenging but immensely rewarding advanced flight model fixed-wing aircraft in  remain the begrudging recipients of a comparatively rudimentary flight model that is perhaps a reflection of the series' traditional focus on ground-centric gameplay.   Given the near future setting it is pertinent to note that much of the title's military assets are modelled upon real-life prototype weaponry as well as a few present day variations met with a degree of developer artistic licence and fabricated designations. This notable departure from the well-established and popular modern day armaments that featured so prominently within previous titles in the series is undoubtedly a bold move by Bohemia and one that still remains a divisive point of discussion within the player community.   The sounds of  traditionally a less impressive facet of previous titles in the series has undergone a marked improvement in this latest offering. Sustained post-launch updates to sound attenuation super-sonic bullet cracks along a general reboot of the veracity of weapon fire in general have improved 's soundscape immeasurably ensuring that the aural experience of its virtual warfare remains an authentic often terrifying but ultimately satisfying assault upon the senses.     also comes bundled with an incredibly powerful mission editing suite which places the player in complete control of the entirety of the game's imposing asset list. It is in this mode perhaps more so than any other where the title truly shines as a sandbox experience. With a little practice and experimentation the player is able to construct fully realised military scenarios of varying complexity for themselves their friends or the community at large with objectives limited only by the bounds of the author's imagination. This uninhibited freedom a cornerstone of the series remains wonderfully present within 's core offering.     It would be almost criminally irresponsible to discuss Bohemia's flagship franchise without a brief mention of Arma's imperious modding community and the staggering host of improvements fixes overhauls and tweaks that this vibrant collection of talented indivduals provides. Whether one seeks to reintroduce real-life armies and modern-day weapon sets to their virtual arsenal to aquaint oneself with a fresh new terrain upon which to wage war or to apply a simple yet powerful overhaul to realism the impressive array of user-made mods make this possible. Player created content has persisted as an important keystone of the series' appeal and longevity since its debut and continues to form an integral part of 's broader experience.    Players new to the series may find themselves understandably intimidated by the sheer bredth and depth of the content on offer not to mention some of the more unforgiving aspects of the simulation. Thankfully Boehemia Interactive have introduced a host of means to facilitate the familiarisation process in the form of an in-game field manual and hint system an introductory campaign a Tron-esque virtual reality terrain and even providing the means for more experienced players to act as 'drill instructors' to teach newer players the ropes online. While a handful of frustrating AI user interface animation and optimisation/stability querks persist Bohemia Interactive have created what is easily the most accessible title in the franchise to date.     As a reflection of 's flexibility this is a title that has come to mean many different things to its expansive playerbase and one that can be played in a huge variety of different modes and playstyles. As a result  perhaps more so than any previous iteration in the series has seemed to grapple increasingly with the fallout of its own versatility. Attempting to establish a consensus on exactly how the game 'should be played' has become an increasingly tenuous prospect and one that is arguably unnecessary.    In the creation of  Bohemia Interactive has taken upon the unenviable task of treading the fine middle-ground that exists between sustaining the high degree of realism that the series is famous for while attempting to preserve fun and engaging gameplay for newcomers or those unacclimatised to a realistic simulation experience. 'Realism' itself has proven to be an immensely subjective term within a virtual setting and one that invariably means vastly different things to different players. The finer points of the title's realism with respect to certain game features remains a continual point of contention within the player community and one that appears unlikely to abate any time soon.    's greatest triumphs then are to be found in its versatility and impressive open-world gameplay. Players are offered near total freedom a staggering choice of armament and a mandate to pursue their objectives however they see fit employing tactics entirely of their own design. This is a hugely layered and expansive sandbox title offering the player a unique gameplay experience and a gaming platform that has earned the rightful praise of many loyal fans.10
efinitely the best tactical shooter and shooter in general in the last decade. It is very immersive in that you have so many different controls at your disposal which is a little tedious at first but once you learn them you will be wishing every shooter had them. It's very realistic in that you can only survice about 2-3 shots from a rifle. You can zero your scopes to get perfect shots from a distance. 1st and 3rd person views allow for very tactical gameplay. You can pilot jets and helicopters drive tanks and transport vehilces or dominate on foot. The maps are massive allowing for very intense wide scale (or small) fire fights. The mods alone make this game worth getting. So many different game modes available to play thanks to the modding community for this game. Absolutely worth every penny. If you like slower paced tactical shooters this is your game! Lone wolf or team up both excel in this game.10
op notch gameespecially with Altis and Wastelands. 10/10 would recommend again.10
his game is amazing my first PC love it has everything a great community great mods great servers with limited hackers. only issue being the gliches you run into great fun for many hours on multiplayer10
You'll spend more time ing around in the editor than playing the actual game at all! 11/10
is a great military simulator you won't get the fast paced shooter feel that you get with BF4 or CoD but instead get a slower paced but more rewarding (IMO) experience. The non-combat roles such as logistics and support add an entirely different angle to what you get in other shooters.   However it is a game you need to either play with a large group of like minded people or find something on the workshop that you like. I found the campaign had a decent storyline but wasn't particularily fun to play. However some of the games i've had online have been simply amazing and to me that's what you should buy the game for.  Pros- Highly Realistic Amazing Visuals Friendly Community Excellent Mods Available  Cons- Not a great singleplayer game Some missions take a while to get to any reasonable gameplay  7/1010
f you like military shooters and realism this is your game.  Only complaint is the MP as its not overly optimized at the moment.10
This game is awesome! I love &lt;3 Militarty games!
ery First Minutes: Oh god oh god who shot me who shot me ?! 30 mins. later: I see you but I won't shoot you because I can't. 60 mins. later: ing campers ing CAMPERS ! 1 months later: SITREP Grind 061357 Enemy 200 metres R.U.A  11
his is a game you buy for the features but keep on playing for the mods! Not everyone is a fan of 's mods and prefer to play it for it's base game I'm not 1 of those people! It isn't a game for the 'COD kid' to just pick and up and play it requires patience and team work to complete missions. People who prefer the 'Run N Gun' approach won't last long in the world of Arma!  For me the best thing about  is the mods. As a survival fan I love that I can play Epoch Breaking Point and Battle Royale on a map like Altis or Stratis (or even chernarus and beyond!). Even if you hate 'mil-sim' games I promise you will love  if you like survival and zombie games!  Give it a go!10
here's not much to say about Arma so many crazy stories come out of it.  Once me and Two other friends were scouting around in some woods near some buildings we were loaded up with weapons and some good backpacks. We spot a building we wanted to check for loot except theres already about 3 or 4 guys in there from where we could see in the hills.  So my friends decide its not a good idea to go down there I had a grenade on me I took off my backpack and left my sniper in one place (So my friends could take it for me if I died) Took a grenade and a Pistol. I launched the grenade high into the air where it exploded confusing the enemy I went Rambo into the building with a pistol and took all the guys out.  So Yeah.....10/10. GET THIS GAME!10

n reality this is a pretty bad game rife with glitches and problems. The only saving graces that managed to make this popular were the mods and the fact that there was really no game like this. Until Squad anyways.-10
Very Good Very Impress 10/10
idiculously realistic movement aiming &amp; shooting. Ridiculously realistic representation of Lemnos &amp; S. Stratis.  It's worth buying it just for the choosing of these two Greek islands for a battle terrain...10
I love the Altis life game mod + This game looks so beautiful. And this game is much better then gta.
55555555
I play this game everyday. Its amazing!
Ehh its a game and it does stuff. Probs something you should buy but you need all the dlc.
very good dont know what else i would play
Excellent game.   Takes some getting used to if you're coming form a nomal fps. The options for this game are endless. After 1600 hours I feel like I've still just scratched the surface.
 love this game have a lot of mods and roleplay servers is the best singleplayer campaing is good but not perfect i give the game 9/1010
i have to say this is one great game 10/10
Worth The Money. 10/10 Game.
ne of the very few games that I believe is actually worth the full price amazing. Give it a try but make sure your system is good enough ;)11
10/10 game woth the money
There is nothing quite like gearing up for 3+ hours and than having your friend shoot you in the face. 10/10 would lose friends again.
I like this game because it feels realstic and feels like your actually in the game.
 great game. Great graphics. But you need a great computer to run max settings at a decent FPS
Greatest GAME EVA!!!
It's alright.
ve spent way too long playing this game but i can say its the best game ive played. Playing this game has made 95% of my steam friends and that may be from mil-sim servers to life servers and survival servers. This game always has something for you to do. I 100% recomend it and also the DLC's as they just make the game even more fun! so see you in game!10
It's ok i guess.
ove this game firstly mechanics are wonderful! Graphics are amazing and it is challening! First game I have played in a while where you can play and if you are new people help you out. I have put a lot of time into this game and some of the mods are amazing! But don't get me wrong. There are a few downsides. Sometimes can be hard to run if you have a not so good computer but overall I love it!   Love the bullet ballistics simple and easy to learn. Love the teamwork involved in coop. People actually help eachother in stead of them running around with guns in their hands yelling'Allahu ackbar'. Brilliant community! Amazing mods!10
Yet another great game by Bohemia Interactive Studios. Keep up the good work!
the game of the century. One of my all time favorites. Hell it is my all time favorite. I have been gaming for most of my life and have yet to find another game that I play or played as much as this one. I have been PC gaming since 2013 and started off with Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead. I didn't get  until about May of 2014. Then did I realize the immense amount the game has to offer. From racing go karts to fighting in Vietnam  has brought everything to the table. Bohemia has done a great job but not recently when they haven't been able to find out a few problems such as the texture bug. I still do enjoy the game and all it has to offer and I really want to give it up to the creators of the mods and everything because it really pulls everything together in the world of Arma. That is just my two cents though.10
ow to play arma EPOCH. Step 1) Spawn in run around get spawn killed by campers. Step 2) Spawn in run around again But make it out and get a gun then get killed by falling down some stairs. Step 3) Get a team worthy team mate Get back stabbed by this 'Team worthy Team mate' die. step 4) Rinse and repeat for 400+ hours. Step 5) Get a gun + base Get kiled by hackers shooting through walls step 5) Get trapped in a house and get told to sing or die  step 6) Die      Step 1002030) Get trapped everywhere Kill everyone Destroy bases.    Step 1234567087) shoot a rabit from 10000m and eat it for survival Kill all admins become king of EPOCH   Step 999999999999) Lose your mind start talking tou your self and always be paranoid about someone watching or following you in a car.11
I land my parachute next to a building...  i open the door and find a gun...  I then open another door with three people all dressed in santa suits...  DEATH TO CHRISTMAS  10/10
retty cool game definately an upgrade from Arma 2 a lot more content and it is more optimized.10
The game itself is OK- but the mods are amazing and are what I bought it for- and I'm not dissappointed.
This game is the best game i have ever played
Decent game wait for sales to buy... :3
Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
time to put on your big boy pants
I still can't land a plane....
got global banned within 10 minutes of playing. gg
Absolutely amazing game (as long as your PC can handle it.) I can easily see myself sinking hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this.
*Buys game* *Plays game and thinks 'Oh this game is quite good'* *Plays for about another week* *Goes to play game* *Is greeted by 'You have been globally banned from all battleye gameservers'* *Rages* *Questions battleye reason for ban* *Gets no response* *Sends abusive emails because they won't do anything* *Realizes account is also banned on DayZ* *Rages more* *Sends extremely abusive emails* *Still no response* *Gets told Battleye have unbanned lots of people* *Checks* *Is still ing banned* *Rages* *Writes steam review of how t Battleye are full of*  10/10 would get banned again!  Edit:  off Battleye!
Got banned from several roleplay-servers for expressing my rights. 11/7 dank
 would really recommend this game to everyone. It is a game that really gives what you pays for. I know everyone wont be satisfied with this game but there are a lot of game modes in this game so I think most people will like it. Myself I love it and I intent of playing it for atleast 1000 more hours. My favourite game mode is altis life which is a simulator of real life I guess. You can choose to be a ''hobo'' which do things legally which I have done a lot myself but also be a rebel or drug dealer where yoy can do basicly whatever you want. You can also become a cop which is a lot of fun but comes with a lot of work due to the altis life rules. Most servers have very strict rules and so on. IF this doesnt seem anything you woud like the game is actually most about military. In my perspective it is kinda like a military simulator but you can play multiplayer or coop. The combat is great in the game and you can choose from being infantry aerial or whatever. There are a lot and I mean A LOT of vehicles in the game so I dont think you will miss that feature. If you like fps games you can play in first person but you can also choose to play in third person. This is important to note due to combat you may come in that situation in multiplayer where you are playing in first person and you will maybe see that people tend to ''abuse'' the third person feature and hide behind a wall or below a window and see you with the third person view although you cant see them and they will get an advantage. I have played this game for 665 hours atm so I feel like I can give a pretty good example of how the game is.  Pros: -Good teamplay in coop -Great servers and a massive amount of servers to choose from -Loads of vehicles -Giant maps (Altis is my favourite) -A lot of game-modes to choose from -Massive amount of weapons to choose from. -Editor mode a lot of fun to build and place vehicles to have some fun with -SO much fun with friends. -Good language and no racism as I have seen (most racists get banned or warned) -Supports community maps.  Cons: -Hard to learn the game in the start (kinda bad tutorials use youtube and google!)  Thats all! I hope you buy this game if you feel like this sounds like a good game Bohemia interactive really deserves the attention :). Thank you for the great game and guys have fun! I hope this review helped :).11
his is the best game for PC there is no need to do a review.......I'd like to have one of these vehicles when I'm on the street because in Italy the people drive like dogs.10
I don't even know why I keep playing this game. 10/10
his is my review on . At the time of this review I have capped over 1250 hours on the game.   Points that I like about A3:  1. A front runner in Military simulation no simulator can compare.  2. Stunning graphics.  3. A3 hosts a great multiplayer community.  4. Plenty of mods to improve gameplay and extend the games life span.  5. DLC's are mostly free. Most features are just platform updates. Sadly the biggest features of DLC packs are paid.  6. A3 has some features that should be in everygame such as some AI behaviour. The AI flees loots dead bodies and uses abandoned vehicles. Human instinct!  I'm trying to keep this review short so i will stop it there and get on with the small list of cons...  Things I dislike about :  1. I know I said AI behaviour was a pro but it can also be a con. My teamates wont heal me unless i order them. There pathfinding is awful and sometimes dont budge at all.  2. All that needs to be said is an AI (Hostile) can spot me looking at them.. Lying one 1 Kilometre out in a ghille suit...  3. Some of the physics ar cancer. Hit a rock and get launched backawards. Legit.  Summing  up its a flagship for simulators but AI needs to catch up with the standared of the game.  (update:) A flood of updates has happend since this review fixing alot of said issues. Plus 64 BIT has just been released.10

his game is actually pretty impresive. Real physicslife from a fighter lets call it. Have you spended 60 $ on GTA V Because its fun? Try this oneit will be more greater and more funnier. Want to know why? Gta v is Rubbish. If youll buy  you will never regret that you bought this game. And for Bohemia InteractiveKeep up the Good job that you done there. :)10
This was so much like irl I got PTSD  10/10 Would LIVE this game again
f you're looking for serious fun you've come to the right place.10
 love this game and after playing arma 2 this game was just a whole new world. This game might not have the same guns which is a little bit of a let down but there are some new ones and many different mods to add the arma 2 guns back into the game. If you didn't like the stupid animations from arma 2 this game is alot better like an actual reload animation although it might be the same for about 10 guns or so nonetheless there is an animation. The DayZ universe has quite widened with the Exile and Epoch mods new maps and other things and honestly  is the best arma made so far in terms of Realism. The leaning ability has also expanded with a stance for shooting under cars and one on your a$$ that looks like a dog scratching with worms. and many other things arma 2 could've used. Best $75 Ive ever spent and I bought arma 2 for $6! If your fresh to the game series make sure you have a friend who can mentor your noobyness until you can become a pro arma-er you will definetly need to especialy with Flying.10
 Arma III is pretty good?? ?  » Seriously: The game is great. Tons of different gamemodes and tons of mods?? You can have casual or realistic fighting you can join a milsim group too. When you are more a civilian type you can play for example 'Altis Life' where you can be a cop medic or civilian. There are so many opportunities to play this game love it?? --- ? ? Overall 20/1011
I bought this game last year and wasn't expecting to get enough game time to get my monies worth. I have definitely done that and more. This game has so much potential and the amount of mods and different types of servers to play multiplayer on is numerous. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that I know that doesn't already have the game. Yes it's expensive but you will get your money back just in the amount of enjoyment and time you spend in this game.
I've been playing  Since Alpha and I've loved every bit of it. So many different game types to play. I do recommend that you dont play as much becuase you will develope a case of acute PTSD
eres this game in a nutshell when your first starting out. fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die fly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die ly to the AO die Enjoy.-10
Such a great game the combat is unlike any other game takes more than just pulling a trigger takes actual skill to be good The community is fantastic the amount of things to do on this game is unreal if you know where to look   However you are going to need a beefy computer to run this game    Fantastic game 10/10 would recommend
 personally really like this game. Wether you want to play life some sort of dayz mod or just the milsim part of this game i can guarantee that it will be fun. This game has endless possibilities when it comes to modding especially because the game has built in mod support. The modding community is massive for this game so as long as you like first person shooters or third person this game is for you. It is great to play with friends or just by yourself. Definitely one of my favourite multiplayer games.10
Best Mil Sim I have ever played been playing it since Alpha and I have no complaints. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
The only game that is still entertaining at 20 frames per second.
the explosions r dope
ver 2500 hours. It's a fun game but boring as  without mods and cool servers.10
ArmA.  It's a game.           Cool.
The sheer diversity of ArmA and the support for modding more than makes up for the performance
One of the most epic games ever made. If you want a true simulator of a soldier - ARMA III is the way to go! I recommend it to every hardcore player there!
 have this PC: AMD FX-8350 4.2GHz ZOTAC 960 AMP! 2GB Corsair Vengeace 8GB 1600MHz CM Storm Scout 2 Advanced  So let's say it's a decent PC every game I play works great had no problems. But when it comes to ARMA III... Basically I can only play this game on singleplayer multiplayer works at a top of 25 FPS I guess 25 FPS it's low. I tried numerous settings and stuff no way can someone explain to me what kind of computer you must have to actually have decent framerate?-10
And so with the dlc's the game is now Pay 2 Win how great!
Great game! The exile mod is not that fun :(
 mean you get what you buy it's arma it runs like  the ai suck the physics make no sence but it's glorious ACE3 will make me continue to take math in highschool and i could never afford G3s or air frames in real life.11
If you can understand the controls then this is a great modern military shooter with great mods like atlas life.
I'm still figuring out the controls.
Its okay i guess
he world's formost simulator in muslim killing technology you shoot sandies and blow stuff up america style B)11
his game is amazing has endless replayability and that's it cant say anything else.(The graphics are good too)10
Is a good game. Nice People on the game. 10/10
he most realistic shooter i have ever played. it is not optimized very well especially if you are running older hardware but if you have a decent enough computer you will never forget the experiences this game will bring you. My first day A3 i was on wasteland gametype just running around with my pistol. Out of nowhere a helicopter loaded with enemies was flying directly towards me and i decided it would be a good idea to shoot at drawing attention to myself. Turns out this was a good idea as the helicopter heads directly for me as if it was about to land ontop of my head Instead it takes a nosedive into the ground killing everyone inside. 10/10 would shoot down choppers again(with a pistol)10
This game is the best peice of junk ever. It has so many glitches and its so broken but no one gives a  because its so damn good.
Accidentally killed our entire base  9.5/10 would play again
ontinuing a fine tradition ARMA III brings realism in combat to the greatest level. Maps that are miles across with dynamic weather and day/night cycles (you can even navigate by the stars!) the best ballistics in the shooter gaming world and every type of vehicle you can think of from tanks and helicopters to jet aircraft and small submarines PLUS a powerful mission editor and decent AI gives you an unparalleled amount of content and replayability for your hard earned dollars!10
he game by itself isn't that fantastic. The graphics and gameplay are good but it isn't worth the price.  Using the Breaking Point mod adds a whole new depth into the game and I would strongly recommend downloading it if you have the Arma III game.   Overall I recommend it because I haven't regretted buying it for $60 and therefore hope you feel the same if you buy it.  (Best to buy it on special though)10
Just yes! If you loved ArmA 2 you're going to love this!
ame's price has reduced which is good! Although they're dumb money grabbing s.  The normal game is fine just don't throw them your money by buying their awful overpriced DLC just use mods.   http://www.armaholic.com/index.php?c=news_arma3_mods   I saved you 60USD$ or 77.16CAD$.-10
 true successor to ArmA 2. This is what a sequel looks like rest of the gaming industry not the same thing with a couple of improvements or 'twists' that could have easily been patched in or sold as an expansion. Bohemia Interactive have shown that they are really dedicated to their craft and that they really listen to the community and what they want. If only there were more developers like these along with Valve and other notable examples.  Improved physics graphics mechanics fantastic soundtrack modding support mission editor this is the military sim to rule all military sims and it feels a damn sight more snappy than its predecessor too which really tickled me gleefully. Of course it still has a few optimization issues but it is certainly an improvement over previous titles.  Even if you don't like what the vanilla game has to offer there are many dedicated modders out there creating new and free content for you to enjoy and so are the developers!  This is by no means a perfect game I'm not sure those exist but it's a damn sight better than what most 'AAA' games developers churn out these days. I'm looking at you DICE/EA and Activision.10
My squad went into battle without pants but in full combat gear.
Multiplayer didn't work. FPS terrible. Clunky. Naff.
I don't evaluated a lot of game but really this one need it   Its a good game  -Nice graphic -Nice simulation -and a lot more  But ... the BIG the HUGE BLACK POINT   AI &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; THIS IS DESTROYING THIS GAME  IMAGINE FAR CRY 4 WITH NO AI  CallOfDuty with a AI taking cover behind a small rock like totally   you will get   before you spend 60$ or less on this game understand that : -you will never enjoying the campaign - you will never enjoying the player versus comp   you will play ONLY player versus player on a mod its not ARMA (sic...) like a a kind of a RPG mod   me im waiting an hypothetic update and crying on my 50$
mmediately upon entering a rp server I was asked to enter a strange vehicle (Held at gunpoint of course). I hopped into the back of a black pick up truck and an invisible force prevented me from leaving. I was then driven halfway across the island. It was a long trip the strange man in the front seat told me a few stories some very touching others not as much. By the end of the journey I felt much closer to the not-so-strange-anymore man. Our brief 15 minutes together had me believing I had found a new friend. A companion in this bleak world. That belief was soon torn apart as the man in the front seat let out a guttural scream and drove us both into a lake.  Your experience in  could be similar. 10/1010
oved it After the success of Cooking Mama and League of Legends the developer Activision shines down on us with the masterpiece that is this game (Gears of Halo Thef Auto 5) and with its staggering 69 dlc packs all priced at $4.20 you'd be a fool not to try this game out. Insomniac Games really outdid themselves on this one. 8/6 would eat without package.10
......................................
The most poorly-optimized PTSD simulator!!!
reat addition to the Arma series it is buggy sometimes weird along funny bugs.10
 It's ARMA what more do you expect?     the long awaited sequel to the outstanding Mil-Sim franchise by Bohemia Interactive.  This game is fantastc theres no real other way to describe it. I have been a relative late comer to the Arma franchise starting with Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead though this third instalment certainly seems to fill the spaces with features that i had been longing for since playing its predecessor. Both modernised and revamped in both style looks and gameplay; this game certainly plays smooth and looks amazing - i honestly struggle to find games as 'Open World' as this that look so beautiful at times.  The main draw of  is certainly the online gameplay new gamemodes such as Sector Control offer new light to the often dimming possibilities of such a 'complex' Mil-Sim game. Along with a consistant stream of community content flooding by much like Arma 2. Even the singleplayer campaign developed by Bohemia is absolutley brilliant if not at times frustrating.  However it does indeed have it's draw backs. Having extensivley played its sequel you cannot help but feel like  has 'something' missing. A little something that really does take away from the enjoyment of the game. The collection of weaponry feels at times limited and the distinct lack of certain features (Such as Bi-pods) have been completely overlooked and not implimented.  Despite this  is none the less a fantastic game well worth the purchase and with the constant updates introducing new features - i'm sure it wont be long before all these little issues i have with the game are ironed out.    Recommended?:   Absolutley yes   Score:   8/1010
RMA III has been valued at $60 (€4958) for over two years now and heres why. If you are a fan of FPS or TPS games you have probably been playing COD CS or BF ten hours a day but ARMA III is not a FPS or TPS games its a Military Simulator. Unlike COD CS or BF ARMA III is meant to simulate war making it VERY realistic. Which means its very hard to get any kills when you first start out and unlike in COD CS or BF ARMA III is set in a HUGE sandbox map meaning: no invisible walls almost everything is accesible and snipers are everywhere ;). In order to enjoy ARMA III you have to like VERY slow paced shooters and have a ENORMUS amount of patience. You also must be ready to be killed by that level two sniper hiding in the bushes 1000 ft. (304 meters) away. Even though I said it is VERY slow paced when you do happen to land yourself in a firefight it is heart racing and very intense. In order for you to capture a objective in ARMA III you have to do these five things: A: Get a group of 10-15 people together. B: Carefully plan out minute by minute whats going to happen where it is gonna happen who its gonna happen to and why its gonna happen. C: Aquire transportation to the objective and exit your vehicle about 500 ft. (152 meters) away from the obective. D: Approach with caution because you have no clue where their security is. E: Excute with full pride and confidence. PRO TIP: Always be sure to keep in communication with your team and use a compass to give cordinantes on an enemy. ARMA III is a BEATIFUL game which means it has some heavy system requirments I run it on an Alienware m17 and still get an occasional lag spike. ARMA III is not for everyone or everyones computer but for those who can run it and enjoy this type of shooter it deserves a 9.5/10 (because of high system requirments I took off half a point which is why its 9.5 not 10)10
his game is hella good you can go from Helicopters Jets Boats Submarines Parachutes On Foot... You can do anything that you want freely the choice is up to you. You want too explore you can but...   You always must use caution you never know if/when you will be shot at from any direction any height any distance and from any type of challenge wether it's Planes Boats Tanks Mines Enemies aka Troops and Paratroopers you name it..  You can also create Missions for you and your friends to play you can also do anything set on your mind.. But you must follow Server Rules if you don't want too be Kicked/Banned.   You can also do Solo Missions the Campaign Training ANYTHING! This game has a ton of Mods! So what are you waiting for BUY NOW!!10
est game eu..! Or it would have been if only they implemented the weapons of modern war instead of weapons of a war 50 years ahead.. I mean 6.5 caliber rifles? I use that for hunting moose..  But nothing to cry about when there is mods.. ALOT of mods including modern weapons like hk416 m4 scar and so on.. with every possible attachment u can think of..  I highly recomend this game WITH mods.. And for multiplayer experince i recomend ahoy world eu#3 modded server.. its just a blast.. :D10
Realy awesome game you should realy buy it!
n 11 days i've played 109 hours and i have used the Zeus editor campaign missions community scenarios and put about 45 hours into Altis life. I will edit this review as i go on but so far this game is extremely fun! Although if you enjoy games such as Call Of Duty or Battlefield you most likely not enjoy this game as it is not a 'FirstPersonShooter' it is slow tactical and REALISTIC not much arcady shooting going along. You need to be smart and strategic to win every conflict and thats what i love about it you cant just go in and shoot anyone you see. Right now i have downloaded a good 30-40 mods both public and private from the 4th JSOC Squad. These mods add an amazing array of vehicles weapons 100s of items of clothing and more. This game is POWERED by the modding community and this along with cooperative teamwork communication and realistic military gameplay is what makes this one of the BEST games ive ever played. We need more games like this!!!11!1! PS- a good headset/microphone is ESSENTIAL. Without it you cant play the game. YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU ALLIES!!!!!   -Aidan10
Verry good game and had great fun on king of the hill really recommend it if your into fighting and action games
Arrested a guy in altis life for going 1kph over the speed limit. 10/10
o immersive when played in multiplayer with a proper team. Map reading is just one of the real life skills you may need to use during battle as well as using the radio and communicating with your team. Also includes a great editor to make your own missions for multiplayer and singleplayer and you can upload your own missions to the Steam Workshop10
y mic does not work in . i have tried everything out of everything with no results at all plz help. my mic works in skype voice recs and other games like Gmod. but it dosent work in . there is nothing wrong with my mic. there is only something wrong with  that dosent transmit my voice at all. plz add me on steam and help me im very desperete. and frustrated. and by the way sry for my bad English10
his game is addictive. Yet it has tons of bugs it's fun. If you are concerned that you won't like it try watching some Altis Life videos on youtube and buy the game when it is on Summer or Christmas sale on steam. Now lets get to what really matters. There are two sides to this game. There are the RP servers and then there are the MilSims. The RP (RolePlay) servers are easy to get it deals with Altis and turns your gaming experience into a life which then you have to develop your character and become friends (Or enemies) with others. You can mug kidnap and  (If you're experienced) other people. This gamemode is for if you want to have some laughs and a  ton of fun. If you are wanting the military simulator part of this gamemode then go check the Millitary Simulation Servers. There are fewer of them but they can be still be fun. This gamemode provides a damn good simulation of War on Altis. Ranging from hardcore strategies to commanding your troops this gamemode emits a real life enviroment for you to practice your gaming skills in. That's all hope it helped! (By the way I reccomend this game a lot mostly for the people without large ing anger issues.)11
f you have friends this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play get the money for it. If you don't have the money for it get a job. If you don't have a job rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank at least you tried.11
It's ok -IGN
I dont eaven own this game 10/10
Great game i just dont like the fact that bans carry over from game to game.
nly game where you can have a full unit 100% immersed and in character completely at attention to then be thrown of by a flying spinning quadbike flying faster than sonic's genitals travelling at warp speed through tails' . definitely recommend11
This game got me pregnant
ts a realy good game Allot of action and lovely graphics11
This game has no good servers do not buy this game unless you want to wait for the one good server to open.
is a very special game. The realism that is blended with the game really brings the game to life. The maps in the game are extremely huge allowing for people to roam and have great battles. The gamemodes associated with  show what fun can be had. Battle Royale is among my favorites where the game is a hunger-games-like survival competition. There is a variety of vehicles including aerial and sea. The weapons have many attachments and some have the unique trait to have tracers. Overall the game is a thrilling experience. 9/1010
If you want a really good war game and don't want autistic five year old yelling 'HARD SCOPER' or the game telling you 'You are leaving the Battlefield'
id like to take this oppourtunity and apologize to everyone who was at the BestBuy by my house yesterday. (the one next to Lil Choozie's Bar and Grill) i tried to get the 'scoops' on all the hottest and latest gadget tech but ended up assuming the fetal position in the radio section screaming for my life because a couple of Rogue Pixels called me a 'dink' for wearing camo pants. once again i apologize for the many people i disturbed and next time ill invite my tech wizard pal mikey so that an event like this will never embarass me again. t
Better graphics than real life
mazing game just fabulous like seriously completely brilliant.10
ey all you people Hey all you people Hey all you people won't you listen to me? I just had a sandwich No ordinary sandwich A sandwich filled with jellyfish jelly... Hey man! You've got to try this sandwich! It's no ordinary sandwich! It's the tastiest sandwich in the sea... Skee ba-da bob-a doob-a dob-a dab-a dee dow Yeah!10
is a military simulation game set in the Greek Islands of Stratis and Altis. This is a futuristic game using remote control planes heat-seaking helicopters and amazing new vehicles.  In this game you can play as BLUFOR a teamup of the FIA and NATO troops. You can play as Independent a group friendly to no one but the AAF. You can join OPFOR a CSAT controlled team. This is less simulation and more fun. You can make your own scenarios and levels using the Zeus control menu or the level editor. The level editor is simple and fun to use.  The modding community is big for this game and a Steam Workshop is available to install modifications with one click of a button. Installing new helicopters planes skins troopers and more from the workshop! Lots of new gamemodes exist like Wasteland Epoch and Altis Life!  Wasteland is an amazingly styled gamemode. Complete objectives to gain money and buy new vehicles which come with the game. Pick your weapons and outfits spending your money. You can fly and drive everything in the game but you have to pay in-game money. You can join OPFOR or BLUFOR and assist your online team or play as an independent player being allowed to kill everyone.  Altis Life is a roleplay gamemode for . You can play as a police officer civilian or thug. Being able to smuggle drugs steal cars and helicopters and fly around. The police can setup roadblocks check you for IDs and can do what most police in real-life can.  I would recommend this game for anyone and everyone even if my description hasn't given you much it's a very fun game easy to follow along and learn. For all of you who have the dream of flying in this game it's so easy! It includes flight assistance for anyone who can't get the hang of landing and taking off. There are so many different servers Wasteland being my favourite.10
Great game for any military entusiast.
This is the best game I have ever played. Most of the people are very nice and will be glad to teach you the ropes.
reat game one of the best all around modern day military sim.10
ead this before you buy the game because you're about to step into a massively new world.  was such a big leap since Arma 2 and left many Arma players shocked (Including me). WIth new weapons vehicles infantry drones maps and more leaves you with a brand new world to explore. Now that you can swim you have a wider access to the new maps. Unlike Arma 2 you will actually enjoy swimming in the ocean! There is much more to talk about but it's too much to explain. One word before I go Amazing.10
his game... Is a rollercoaster.. There's parts you will really enjoy then there's parts you wont enjoy. This is a war simulator not like any cod or bf game you would get. What it means is it involves a lot of running traveling and it may require a lot of patience. It is almost 90 % traveling and what it does is it makes the 10 % worth it because when you have traveled or ran for a long long time then you wont really be prepered for combat too much. Even though its almost just a walking/running sim or just a waiting sim when something really does happen you wont be prepered too much and that makes it really thrilling. Not only wont you be as prepered as if you had ran for 40 ft and then gotten shot at killed them ran another 40 ft and getting shot at. There's even a pretty good single player you can play for hours. The most popular thing i would assume is the multiplayer and that is because a the single player is mostly scripted and you can go through it over and over and know what to expect. While multiplayer is diffrent because you can walk somewhere get killed one time walk to the same place get killed again then walk there again and not get killed. (Its not actually like that sometimes.) It's a game that has a BIG focus on strategy teamwork and resourses.   Would i recommend this game? Yes. Thats just my formal opinion. This is a game you will most likely either love or hate. Before you decide get more into the game because its not just all of the same. It's one of those unike games you are likely to RARELY see.10
his game have the best 'realism' where you can easily die by bullets high recoil and no terms of 'one-man-army' like most of the game these days. its possible to be OMA but that requires many tries on each levels. THE BAD THING is that the gameplay is kind of BORING because theres too many information that you recieved but less thing you can do. Instructions/Guide while in game sometimes doesnt help a new player to understand this game. Too many button to use! The AI in singleplayer kindda DUMB. The AI doesnt react to our command smart enough.  Realism : 9.0/10 Gameplay : 5.5/10 AI : 3.5/10 Graphics : 8.5/10 Physics : 7.5/10 Overall : 6.8/1010
his game is DEFINITELY worth $50. I mean who doesn't want to be a drug lord in Altis Life?10
most realistic military game on the planet by far -great mechanics -good community -hundreds of servers/gamemode's -something to suit everyone   100% recommended
Tested the game during the free week-end on 2014.26.10   I have played Arma 2 and I am a fanatic of realistic military/tactical simulations like the first Ghost Recons Rainbox Six America's Army Insurgency etc.  Note that right now I am at the  Tipping Point  mission and I only played single player.  BTW I cannot finish the mission since I cannot for the life of me get into the speeboat. I can drown under it though. I also completed the entire tutorial which was very well made. +1 for this.  However the first impression of this game ain't good:  The 'simulation' part is very lacking .   Simulation? Nah... for real?10
ol...I don't understand how it got such high reviews. people say mods make the game....well that's not the way it should be imo. If the game sucks without mods...well...it just sucks.   First 10 minutes of playing the game 2 major bugs. 1 invisible mobs..2 I got stuck going into the next campaign with no ammo for my weapons...I could not go to the ammo stockpile and do a damn thing about it...don't know why don't care done playing. Where are all these weapons they talk about? Maybe I didn't get far enough through the game but having only 2 or 3 guns to choose from was just boring...and damn the AI is badass...picking me off a mile away with a gun that in reality you couldn't hit a person with from 3 blocks away....absurd.  I don't know maybe the multiplayer is awesome....sounds like that's why people like it...single player? beh...save your cash imo.-10
 could not recommend this game even if I wanted to. Download is horrible way too many gigs of space used for a game that is pretty choppy decent graphics and just a mess over all. The tutorial is fair enough and the prologue is fine. But the campaign is horribly tedious and that's if you don't keep dying at it and having to respawn from autosave because they don't allow you to save for yourself after a certain point. Be prepared to die so many times your fingers will feel it. I'm glad to not be buying this and uninstalling it after I finish typing.-10
irst and foremost the graphics and realism is very very very good. I'd say exceptional.  The controls however are severely lacking as they are in no way fluid. Using the ASWD + mouse for control with half of your controls on the other side of the keyboard does not make this all that fun to do.   Again don't misunderstand me. The game's realism and graphics are exceptional and the storyline was intriguing but the controls are simply horrible and it severely detracts from the game when you're having to remove hands from your movement controls or from the mouse to hit Backspace to clear the squad command windows. In combat this is NOT something you want to have to do but there it is.  Take it as you will.  If you're after a game with good graphics and realism and a decent storyline check out ARMA III.   If however you want something that you can play fluidly and not want to bash your keyboard after ten minutes of dealing with the akward controls move on.-10
 approached this like any other game though I have played Operation Flashpoint ARMA 1 &amp; 2 before.   Played the campaign first flaw I noticed is that once the fighting starts in earnest the game's checkpoint just stops and it won't even let you quicksave for long periods of time. As a result you'll be playing the same sections over and over again unless you're really good at spotting enemies in janky terrain and shooting them through inaccurate terrain hitboxes.  Really most rocks early on in the 'Survive' campaign seem to need about an extra foot of clearance so if you use them as cover you're just wasting your very limited bullets and I grimly suspect they would have screwed up just as many collision boxes if not more later on in the game. The enemies you are fighting in that mission also have some pretty good body armor so you need to accurately put a bunch of 6.5mm bullets on target against targets that are running using terrain and don't have any problem injuring you.   Even having played the prelude I wasn't ready for the long stretch of running with occasional dicey battles and no opportunity to save your progress for a good 10 - 30 minutes fairly early in the Survive campaign. It would have been sensible to maintain flow for the game to at least ALLOW me to manually save before or after each of the firefights that are about 5 minutes apart of just running (or 20 minutes of stumbling along if you take a shot in the leg).   Requiring a marathon jog through fighting 3 - 4 decent enemy squads including snipers and machinegunners with only one ally without even the option of saving let alone automatic saves anywhere in there amongst all the scripted chatter and setpieces that you do encounter would be fine as an optional challenge but not the start of a campaign where you have to get through it before anything cool happens. You don't even start with a single first aid kit to patch up your leg if you take a round through it so one unlucky hit and you'll be staggering between checkpoints instead of a 2-minute sprint.  For my money I'd rather buy either something a whole lot more interesting and deep than  or something just as simple in theme but with tight controls and good flow. For me  sits in that uncomfortable spot between a simulator and an action game where I'm going to be frustrated by the intricacies and slowness of getting to the action and then the battles themselves aren't any fun either especially not with bad checkpointing.  That said this sort of game really lives or dies on its multiplayer. Which I can't be bothered with. So as a singleplayer game no I wouldn't recommend it. If a game's singleplayer campaign can't hold up to scrutiny then it shouldn't have one.-10
 highly recommend anyone in love with the previous ArmA series games to get involved with ArmA3Alpha and provide feedback to make this game as good as the previous series. Together we can make it awesome!10
This is a game where you shoot things and they die. Almost like real life. Except its not real life.
 bought  Extended edition for 50% off at 40$ CAD. I regret my purchase because the multiplayer is a piece of . It takes forever to get to an objective and most of all the FPS is TERRIBLE compared to the single player. I get 45-60 fps on ultra in single player with view distance of about 3000 or 4000 but i get 20 fps in multiplayer.  I have a core i5 2500k and a gtx 970 ssc. During multiplayer gpuz reports my gpu usage at 30% and windows 7 resource monitor shows cpu usage at 50%   Unless I can get this mess sorted out I will not support Bohemia Interactive anymore.  Edit: After trying different video settings there is still no fix. From low to high i still get 24 fps at 500 view distance unplayable.   This is the worst multiplayer experience I have ever had and really wish I could get a refund. The only good part about this game is the single player which wasnt even completed when this game was released. Edit: The single player missions are very small and sometimes force you into a single path. they were decent but not as good as ARMA I missions. The multiplayer part of this game is a piece of .  Edit: as of June 8 2015 the game no longer works for me. I am trying to reinstall this piece of trash game to see if it will work.  The game now works but still crashes and is PLAGUED with other bugs.   Hilarious list of bugs from the morons at Bohemia Interactive:  -Helicopter spontaneously explodes upon entry.  -Computer terminal for purchasing vehicles sinks beneath the earth thereby making it innaccessible.  -Sniper rifle is able to explode an APC.  -Really  framte rates on multiplayer at all times.  and the list really does go on. It seems this game is the steaming pile of  that they have been trying to create...-10
his is actually a really goodinnovativeand realistic game.But I give this a 'No' due to the lack of server with good pings.I live in Indonesia and the nearest available server in my country is China with 200-350 ping.Uninstalled it after I realized I won't be able to play a single multiplayer game from Indonesia. Pros : + Super realistic in almost every single content main positive side of this game. + Stunning graphics + Fun multiplayer games (never plays it but saw it at YouTube) + Lots of cool mods from the community + You can use vehicles rather than just being an infantry like in other games + You can create your own levels Cons : - Extremely confusing controls. This is the main downside of the game. - The single player campaign is really difficult to beat.I got killed over and over by stepping on mines which are invisible. Yes it is realistic to be invisible but it would also be realistic to have mine detector if you know there's a massive minefield in front of you. With the lack of ability to save frustration builds up pretty quickly when you always had to start back from the minefield. - It seems the devs ignores the difficulty of the campaign and only allows us to save ONCE every level. It is one of those games where the difficulty outweigh the fun like Dark Souls and The Impossible Game - Lack of soundtrack makes this game very hard to 'feel'  I don't get any fun from playing this game.Only frustration.My multiplayer's dead and my single player's impossible to beat.If you're from Asiadon't waste your money on this game.-10
his game has serious playability issues starting with trying to see something to shoot at.   Something is wrong with the zoom functionality. It says there is a target to shoot out there I affix a scope and even at maximum zoom I see nothing. Just more white green and brown blobs. On top of that everything looks bad and walking gives me motion sickness after 20min. My solution was to get up and walk 300meters to the target so it would become visible and then shoot it so I could progress. My AI companions did all the shooting when the fighting started. The objective markers virtually disappear and are hard to see against the textures used by the game.   The training starts with an NPC talking about Greenbacks and AAF's and I have no clue who these people are. I started the campaign and that just made things even worse. It explains that NATO peacekeepers are pulling out of Altis (fictional mediterranean island) to fight CSAT in the Pacific.   There are a lot of hanging plot threads that make no sense what's with the earthquakes why do some of the bases get attacked who is this dead guy I find on the road what happens to the guys on the bases?  Finally you get to the shooting part and it just doesn't work. After the first dozen deaths I end up having to put my face a few inches from the screen to try and see any bad guys and that only causes eye strain. You do not see anything to shoot. They see you even prone but you will not see them. No tutorial is given to explain how to nullify the bad guys ability to sense your presence.   I quick view of let's plays on youtube shows they are playing a game that actually displays the enemy.   Moving on to multiplayer would be nice. If there were actually multiplayer games. Don't be fooled by youtube or the tab that says multiplayer in the menu. There is no multiplayer. There is only multiplayer if you join a community through the forums. And they will have a list of mods to play and generally are about playing with people who already know how to play ARMA3.-10
his game is amazing. While the campaign and 'vanilla' multiplayer are extremely fun it's not even the tip of the iceberg in terms of gameplay.  The real experience comes with the mods scripted game modes and editor included within the game or downloadable through various websites. What Bohemia Interactive has done is give those with a vision the incredibly powerful engine (and therefore a means) to create the amazing gamemodes you can download anywhere and play.10
ros:  - ....  Cons:  -Horrible. Constant crashing -Cant play ANY mod at all when ALL I EVER WHANTED was to play Epoch  Battel Royal and Wasteland Chernarus. -60$ game + 30$ for 2 chopper ? ... -100 Gig ( + few mod install )   Wish i have some good words to the game but i Cant get a single match to function and yes i watch youtube video and all but after 3 days i still unable to run any mod.   This game only remind me my experience on DayZ.Crash after crash and bug after bug.  I made a huge mistake buying DayZ and ARMA I will not support Bohemia Interactive anymore.-10
reat idea good controls etc...........but the bugs are horrific. Almost 2 years on and you can still die from clipping through walls missions can't be completed or the AI breaks is just not acceptable.-10
 wish i could both recommend and not recommend... but ultimately i hate it.. it has such potential... if you like single player shooters this game is pretty good. the campaign is pretty neat.. that's about it.. i got this game cause i prefer sims over arcadey type games (CoD)... and the sim level is there... the problems start at online play. you need to be a member of a secret society to actually get any war play going on online. and neither have the desire for that nor the time or dedication.. this was evident almost immediately. all the online servers are really stupid GTA meets 2nd life meets the sims mod crap. its insanely stupid and boring.. unless you hunt down some online community of people who actually want to play a war game you wont get that online from this game.. no official servers or official game modes (that i could find).. its highly annoying.. within an hour i wanted a refund but at the time i had a baby and he started crying and i left the game open and it went past the 2 hour limit (5hours it claimed) i repeatedly email steam trying to explain the situation and all i got was the same auto response... a complete waste of money.. so i uninstalled... then with news stirring that it was going to get a dx12 update i thought i would give another shot since i was stuck with this piece of crap anyway.. multiplayer is still absolute garbage if you don;t want to be active in a community.. so i played the campaign it was ok till the second chapter where the first mission is solo stealth with no guns garbage and i lost interest again... up until that point it was enjoyable.. about a 7 out of 10..   i dunno.. mixed emotions.. if you want to play a slower more boring versions of gta online with better physics.. this might be your game.. if you want to deal with online forums and locked private servers to get a battle in this might be your game...if you like single player campaigns might be your game.. if you like single player target practice might be your game.. it has all the potential in the world... with absolutely no delivery to anyone who just wants to hop into a battle and shoot.. (wasn't expecting a run and gun but i was expecting to play a war game not a run around grinding gold with stupid rules and having to have a job rpg) i would say avoid it.. i tried so hard to get a refund but steam sucks and i couldn't even get a real response from a human being.. now im stuck with this useless single player game.. i keep trying to force myself to find something fun to do with it and it can't be done... on the other hand technically and graphically it;s amazing and the attention to details is great... it was just squandered on a community with terrible terrible terrible ideas on how it should be played... the addition of official servers wih official game modes would make this game a 10 out of 10... until then its like a 2.. unless you like pretending to be an under paid truck driver that gets harrasse by lame people who think they are digital police..  i personally wish i never spent a dime on this game...-10
ve always enjoyed the arma series the tactical gameplay strategic planning of things. BIS outdid themselves on this one and i can't wait to see more of what they bring.  Note to self: Don't forget to bring ammo into the field this is like the 4th time i've done this.11
layed Altis Life. Started a gang known as the Notorious Paint Men. We terrorised the streets of Atlis Striking fear into those who sell paint by robbing them. We soon got investgated by the police and in order to save my friends and I I proceeded to seduce the officer using Marvin Gaye's Let Get it On. It went well as he then restrained me and then strip searched me. Due to my guilt I was forced to tell the officer that I was the leader of the Paint Men. Fortunately I was able to escape his clutches. The crew then jumped out of the bushes and sprayed him down with there machine guns. In our escape i ran into a rock then got launched 500 meters into the air and fell to my death. 10/10 good .11
Bananas are really nice.
o matter what you'll always play this game way longer than expected. 10/1010
est war game ever its that simple.10
eople who mostly are in the military or wanna be military jerk off to this game all the time. You need a decent PC to run this or you will die a lot. I don't know why I was excited to get this when it was coming out. I don't care about the single player at all in this. I wanted it for the 'Hope' for better game play than Arma 2 which has some great things online. Honestly if you like to be with people who mostly do what they want even in teams OR if you actually have friends who play games at all any more then give it a try. If not just watch others on youtube who make money from it and enjoy it that way. I recommend Frankiein1080p.-11
Why is my game crashing so much Why do I only get 20fps no matter what I do Why does none of this game make sense Why are we using 1980-1990's tech in 2035 Why are all the tanks the same Why is everything so boring Why is the MX so  Why is the editor so  Why  Why Whyyyyy  Overall 10/10 would buy 2 copies of again with the hope that my game doesn't crash anymore.
Awesome game! Have played it for only 10hours and i love it &lt;3
10 fps of 10
f your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1.

this game suck
t's so bad that I play it all the time just to make sure it's that bad.11
the realism thats put into this simulatour is amazing i enjoy playing constantly and always will. the msot enjoy aspect si the modding cmmunity so many great minds are putting their hard work into this game i enjoy testing and playing their content.
 just want to say what I must but I'll say it here becouse ing Bohemia Interactive  don't let me write on their forum. This game is a money rip off you buy Arma III game and end up with no multiplayer game why becouse you must buy bunch of dlc crap so you can play on servers or you can't play on 99% of servers or you must download ton of mods that gonna  up your game ending your shity/crapy/ multi with total annalliation. Now after I tryed to mod this  of a game I can't even join to thouse 2 servers where I could before. So it all ends where I brought shity game for 35 euros and they wan't to take another 30-40 euros on dlc and apex .  No way Bohemia Interactive you pice of  go drop dead you hear me never ever again!!!-11
 guys made me their hostage 5 minutes later rebels blew up their base I was the only survivor and was rich of all the loot.  10/1011
hat? Why are you reading the reviews? Why haven't you already purchased this yet?   is the epitome of virtual tactical military-based operations and simulation. In my eyes this game is not just a simulation of military firefighting and combat; I find this game is a great practice for team-based cooperation and initiative. You need to work together to complete your goal follow your Team Leader to succeed.  There are many game modes that simplify the standard operations so new players will be able to experience the game in a friendly and forgiving environment that allows you to improve your abilities.   is a grand game and I definitely recommend it.10
yes i do and its nice fun cool hard to kill me but u can but one prob not enough money for the dlcs thats to much  is to much i recomend price droping to 30$ i sen more people buy it at 30$ not at 60$ but its a good gam best shooting ae on steam beside tf2 (team fortress 2) its good but this is 11/11 good job by far the best game out there and you should bring your freinds to play good mp to play to :)
I eat 
Beacuse Spoon
GIVE ME A FRIENDS GIFT FOR THIS GAME PLEEEEASE
ne of the better games (if not THE best) on my list in which you have complete and absolute freedom. The editor itself is a very fun feature and you can do practically whatever as long as you dedicate some time to learning how to script or the syntax or whatever. In any case an amazing game which I truly enjoy playing with others co-operatively but also PvP. The combat is fun somewhat simple but surely adrenaline-pumping and full of action. If you're playing with the right people it's a relaxing beautiful experience which helps team-building teamwork leadership and orientation quite a bit. The new features (stances) are amazing. Holding control and pressing was or d acts responsively and puts you into a certain stance.  The controls are easy to learn flying isn't all that difficult if you have some patience and the nimble-ness to use auto-hover. Armoured vehicles (for now) contain only Armoured Personnel Carriers but there'll be Main Battle Tanks soon which is AMAZING. The names are altered but you might recognize how the Zamak trucks are actually Kamaz trucks! (THE MORE YOU KNOW!)  Anyhow the aircraft (helicopters for now!) are amazing and perform quite well. My favourite? I don't have one for now! But onto the weapons which I find sauce.  Weapons are highly customizeable and allow for dynamic attachments and replacing the aforementioned. Stealth operation? Slam a suppressor on. Long-range? No problem here's a scope. And it all goes together very well but the content is still lacking. However it's a beta and I can't wait for the actual release of the game (which will be amazing as the beta is saucetastic as it is).  To anyone who wants to explore a mediterranean-esque island I truly suggest purchasing this game and going crazy. As I said you have a lot of options the editor itself you can craft campaigns in that thing. As stupid as it seems it can be something better than singleplayer/multiplayer combined.   It's all down to you and how you wish to play it out. You could even try roleplay servers and be a civilian. But that's not what this is about. This is warfare.  10/1010
his game will give you shivers as you play it it's just too epic. I can tell you that it is worth the price. But when it doesn't overwhelm you with epicness it makes you laugh your  off because some random  happens from time to time like tanks flying into space while backflipping nonstop or sudden raining men.10
gt;mfw i hit a small rock in a go-kart and die  11/10 GOTYAY.  But seriously this game's a hell of a lot of fun. With friends. &lt;311
is an amazing military simulator game (first person &amp; third) it offers an amazing experience from driving a tank to flying a gunship.  It offers a three part campaign (Survive Adapt Win) which is made of between 20-30 missions. There is also a diverse community of clans military styled groups and even more.  There is also an option to play third person by pressing ENTER (NUMPAD) but of course all keys can be re-assigned.  This is an amazing game and I highly recommend you buy it.11
s a reddit gold user I've waded through dirt and mud (referring to dreaded REPOSTS haha!) before so I know what to expect from a real life army man simulator. This was not what I was expecting. I was put in to a tight spot with my team I couldn't even move let alone adjust my fedora to tip at the lady members of our team! (Just kidding there were none! Get in the kitchen! Haha!) and I even died once while I was distracted looking at the funnybanana meme WHICH YES I DID SAVE. THANKS JOHN! It's a great game but I don't think I'll be playing it much when I get accepted in to the r/megalounge! Haha! Get me a whiskey on the rocks autobutler! Haha! - Peter10
There is just no other game like the ArmA series and  has bought hte graphics bang up to date along with a host of new features.  This is far too msall a box to start going into all  can offer you. It is well worth the money and has a rich modding community.  A must own.
it no work for me
Runs like . I want to recommend this but this game has been out for long enough and it still doesn't run well.
You can shoot rabbits. 12341234/10
an This Game Is Amazing. The Physics In This Game Is Incredible If You Shoot Someone It Actually Shows Bullet Hole If You Blow Up Building It Fall And Tumbles On In-packed Of The Building Dust Bursts Out Like a Cloud.  Now Time To Mention Role-Play If Your a Person That Enjoys Role Playing i Recommend Joining The Role Play Servers.  Okay Time To Mention My Favourite Game mode Wastleland If Your a Person That Enjoys Roaming Around Doing Missions Killing People Flying Jets Blowing Up Thing Then Wasteland Is The Way To Go.  There Are Way More Game Modes Like Invade Annex King Of The Hill And Even Exile But To Get Exile You WIll Need To Download it.  Over All This Game Is Fantastic If you Enjoy Any Of Those Things i Mentioned Above^ Then You Will Enjoy  My Rating: 9/1010
Owned the game for 2 months and have never looked back... Great game
ad game I do not recommend it so much time and the game looks like Beta enormous memory and cpu leaks with no fix. on the other hand steam does not refund policy is worthless as you need for at least 5 hours to fully test a game.-11
reat war simulator one of the best communities large number of firearms and vehicles best ballistic system nothing much to add its just a great game...but...if you are call of duty boy then GET OUT!!!11
Install Mods Incinerate Bosnia Remove Kebab Praise Vojislav Šešelj Get put on the NSA Watchlist.  best game of my life
reat graphics realistic gameplay and i had a great experience with this game. Much better than any other shooting games like : Battlefield and Call Of Duty.  Succesfully made me fat. ._.  Recomended 10/10 -DatFpsPlayer11
ot a simulator its a pseudo-simulator.  It wouldn't be 50% playable if it wasn't for the community based addons.  Bohemia SEMI true sim is sold ONLY to the military.  I'm playing since Flash Point i got a milsim corp since Armed Assault we gave up since we couldn't play due to BIS patches ( that always ended ing up the addons versions ) bugs crashes and glitches.  It has a MASTER PIECE concept of 'Make your own scenario and mission' this is the best concept in a game and what gripped me into the series to be true. I've lost more time making missions than playing then the editor was actually very fun and easy to operate.   However  doesn't even have a proper armor system for the armored vehicles you can shoot them with a .50 to death within a minute physichs will always be below average due to the engine and as a great vehicle enthusiast this is a major fact while driving them ( Very wierd to hear a tank lowering it's sound when it's going uphill when the torque is at maximum so the engine sound should be at the loudest point )   Another major fact is that ARMA is not made for CQB you will never see good CQB fights or even decent urban fights you can even see some semi-urban firefights but you will never experiment a true close quarters firefight simulation in ARMA.  I wish we could have some alternative to it bohemia must chage this engine and make the game MORE realistic or it will lose it's fanbase year after year just as Codemasters with that 'cool' Operation Flash Point DR  And finally. it's 2015 and this ing game can make your 10m away surroundings looks awesome but you can see even the back-bush hidden enemy because of the way that the game process the LODs so the farther the enemy the easier to spot him amd think that his a vampire..-10
he campaign in this game is by far one of the absolute worst games i have ever played in my life if not it is THE absolute worst game ever horrible hit detection cheap deaths and terrible weapon sway make the campaign virtualy unplayable. I am a soldier in real life not a reservist a full time reg force soldier and with my experience in the army i can seriously tell you that this game is faaaaaaaaar from being realistic i hate this game i cant beleive i spent 70 bucks on it it worth about 2 dollars in my opinion. dont buy this game you WILL be dissapointed.  LMFAO ive played every mode of this game now and its sooooooo broken its hilariouse i cant beleive this game sells and that people actually play it WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!-11
ompared to Arma 2? This game is horrible. Now don't get me wrong I love the hell out of Arma 2 a game which I've put more than 460 hours into. I've played everything from Wasteland Takistan Life Domination to DayZ. But this game...   Cons:  - The bugs. The desyncs. The clunky gameplay. One would think we'd have a smooth game after all these years but no. It's the same clunky mechanics and awful netcode (expect those close combat 'But I just put an ENTIRE clip into that guy and he still killed me before I killed him!')  - The recoil mechanics aren't 'realistic' they are so bad that with many guns you simply empty entire magazines regardless of shot number (single or burts) and you will still miss. Where in Arma 2 at least the first shot will generally hit the guns here are inaccurate as all hell which kills a large portion of the game for me  - The stamina system is even worse it runs out extremely fast and there's barely any indicator besides a faint darkening vignette around the edges of the screen to tell you that you're essentially ed if you meet any adversaries. In Arma 2 you can hear your guy gasp for breath and your crosshairs fly all over the screen if you've tried to pull an Usain Bolt.   - Where in Arma 2 a single bullet can take you out they seem to have appealed to the more mainstream gaming community and implemented some form of 'Oh look Bob I'm a bullet sponge.'    Pros:  - The graphics are amazing. Don't expect a well-oiled game experience to match.  - The intro story is good.   I will still not recommend this game. I've tried to play it and enjoy it but it's a waste of money. But what am I saying? Go listen to those 'crashed car into pole 10/10 would do again' children.-11
Made me appreciate that DayZ isnt actually that bad
orry but this game doesen't seem to be too friendly to new players. I just can't seem to get in to it. And i've tried it all including the milsim servers. I just don't understand the appeal. Most servers are very boring OR way too intense for a new player to feel comfortable. The mechanics are wonderful. But Arma seems like a very closed community. And that's ok. More power to ya I know where I'm not welcome. I'll go play something else. Just wish I could get my $15 back. But hey I tried. It's a beautiful game by the way some of the best graphics I've ever seen.-11
so i want to play online however most need apex so im like ok lets see how much it is but i come to find out it cost a little less than the game its self.If you are looking to play online only get this if you are willing to buy both apex and the games its self and not to mention alot of the severs also need some of the other ones.
nly played a few hours still testing it but I would recommend this to anyone :)10
he game barely runs don't bother. GTX680 i7 2600k  EDIT: There have been minor performance enhancements to make this game playable.-10
Game is poorly optimized. Don't buy it. Waste of your money!!!
not worth $60.
he morning after i had downloaded this game i procede to relive my life experences. id like to start off my life with telling everyone i had failed english every year till 8th grade it ing sucked. so i was living my life and i decided to live my life like a man on xbox live likes to live to live my life to life long standards of living to exceding life goals set by people who are alive. once apon a time i was  by a asian girl. so next time we meet on the avengers i decided to play . as i was held pinned down in a building i thought of my military training from my time in the military. so i proceded to out military the man in the military and proceded to win the war and saved america. did i mention was was  when i was 14? 10/10 would bang.10
 would never recommended this game becouse their trade policy is so aggressive. After releasing a new DLC (Apex) which is more expensive than a whole game they are adding a new content which is everywhere and if you try to use it your game will crash or on the entire screen i can only see some icons of this new purchesable addons. So i cannot see nothing else and it is unplayable. Not everyone has so much money to buy every new DLC. Whitout this you cannot play other mods which are the reason why i bought this game.-10
 found this game to be extremely underwhelming. It is extremely short on content with very few factions a small amount of weapons that are re-used over and over for different roles and no variety in the selection of vehicles. The DLC for this game is also worhtless and with a high price tag I wouldn't recommend for anyone to buy it. More weapon attachments? A few new helicopters? ing go-karts? Was Bohemia even trying when they developed this game? The maps are beautiful but the under water areas leave much to be desired as very few objects are even attached to the floor. The screenshots for this game are extremely misleading as it shows factions that aren't even included in the game! Overall it offers very little compared to Arma 2 the only thing it improves on is the graphics. If you want a better Military Simulator than this buy Arma 2. As it stands this game was rushed and WAY under-developed. SInce steam now gives refunds I can't sit in my chair and be upset about losing $59.99 which is always good. I give this a 5/10-10
eally boring.. Not engaging very glitchy doesnt feel like a proper FPS game to me. Action is 2/10 due to all the action being from far range online 3/10 dont buy this game not worth paying for. Even Call Of Duty is better...-11
arma 2 is infinitely better than this 'game'
Great game when it will actually be ready for release.
t's like Arma 2 but with less content poorly optimised and cash grab DLC (Loadmasters anyone?).  Was hoping it would get better but it's still worse than Arma 2 in almost every way except graphics I think I'll stick to operating in Chernarus and Takistan instead of a Greek Island that has anti-framerate technology.-10
All I can really say is that I've played this game since it's Alpha days partly on an impulse buy and a minor interest into some more hardcore experiences. My time playing this game usually consisted of short gaming sessions maybe an hour or so at most just to sate any cravings I had for what the game offered. Gameplay wise it's alright but can be a little finnicky with the amount of controls there are to learn with what feels like an extremely long time to kill when it comes to taking out infantry men. Performance wise it's pretty badly optimized depending on what server you go on the majority of the servers will tank your fps unless you have a pretty robust rig to deal with it. Community? Well if you've encountered Star Citizen's community then I can guarantee you that the playerbase here seems to worse much worse. I don't know if they have issues in real life or have an unfulfilled social life but the majority of them seem to be awkward and edgy cursing after every word. I don't know maybe this is how they take their frustrations out on the world by pretending to be super cool military personnel? No beef with them I just think they need a chill out and talk to someone about whatever issues are getting them so ansty.    Anyway there's a free game called Project Reality. A stand alone mod using.. Battlefield 2 I believe? I've had better experiences on that game involving convoys through war torn cities with insurgents jumping out from the alleways. And the community is slightly more chilled and the game is free so there's no loss in funds. I'd recommend it over this title if you're looking for an enjoyable experience.-11
 dont buy if u dont want to waste 30€
hallow and pretty much devoid of built-in content you'll find yourself playing  public high ping servers or best case scenario maybe Battle Royale. Can't speak on the single player bits as I have no reason to play a multiplayer game alone.-10
unplay and fighting mechanics were a major turnoff. The speed drills on the firing range are the perfect example of this.  The campaign was really lacking. The end misssion was what the whole of the campaign should have been (or at least much more of it).   Online is hit and miss even with friends. Again the handling mechanics hold this one back but that's Arma I suppose.-10
is great when it runs as intended the problem is when it doesn't it becomes some what unplayable. I'll keep playing it (as you can see in my hours played) becuase its the only game that does what it does.-10
t this time i finished the story game that was a beautiful story but last mession is unhappy end  anywey i like it    about the multiplayer  i have fps problem i dont know this is just my problem our not becuase i have core i5 4440 but my fps at multyplayer is 30-40 but at sigleplayer is 60 !!! i dont know why bohimia dont fix this ing problem but i hope this problem be fixed at next arma    SO if you like jets  military unifroms . tanks . armored cars or want a tactical WAR and hard i recommend it for you10
ell am an Arma 2 Veteran i was skeptical on getting the 3rd game of the series and man am I sad to say this game is a blow to the series while there are many new things that do look and feel rather amazing most of the content was cut out by the DEVS due to unknown reasonslack of weaponsvehiclesmaps and general content makes the game feel rushed and unfinished.  I have been there since alpha and yet not much honestly has changed I think the creators let this game slip with intention since little information is given about new content from the community managers and DEVS themselfs making this just another generic OCD/ADD combat shooter.  It may best to say wait 5 years until most of the content will be added by the fanbase and community modders . . .-10
War is hell.
n the same theme as Carlsberg Lager being Probably the best lager in the world....  . Probably the best Mil Sim in the world.  Superb in game graphics excellent replayability user creation mode is fantastic. More than enough mods are available workshop for the user created missions if you can't design your own.  One major drawback to it... It requires high-spec machinery to run satisfactory. If you really want this though sort your machine out then spend a little cash on this game. It's the most realistic military simulator ever.  So damned good it makes my balls tingle!10
is good pls buy
 was an arma franchise fan i played Arma 2 and even with it's faults i decided to buy  while it was in alpha. Initally i was impressed the game looked decent for such a big map and all of the changes were progress in my mind but that was in alpha and there is till was a lot of development to be done or so i thought.  Cut to 8 months after full release and little progress was made. The game still runs terrible when in multiplayer the game has constant lag spikes on nearly any server over 40 ppl in it. The content is still lower than arma 2 content on release and very basic thing are still missing.  Much of the content the game does have is also not impressive the 3 teams basically all of the same small arms and vechiles especially blufor and opfor teams with only small differences. Perhaps the biggest tragedy is that  doesnt even have simple 'sim' features that many of its competiors have been using for years like weapon resting and delpolying bipods on lmg (ex Red Orchastra 2/RO2 and BF 2 and 3). Then to makes thing even worse and as a big srcrew you to the fans and customers BI decides to simatanously start developing Dayz while  is no where near ready certaintly not for $60. If the fans of the franchise are honest with themseleves they will release that BI has simply done a cash grab on the consumer's wallet by launching an Alpha then not developing on it. While simatanously dividing their dev teams to work on the failed Dayz which most likley will have a similar fate of .  Overall Arma is not an absoulty terrible game i have over 500h+ in but i can not in honesty say its worth over $20 $30 tops the bottom line is the game feels like a BETA now 8 months after release its just unexceptable and goes to show this 'Early access' craze is more lilkey than not a way for unethical companies to profit off of empty promises and slow + lazy development.-10
t's alright. But it is ArmA. So you know. Poor performance. Buggy mess. Frustrating mechanics but moments that are legendary in all that.10
This game could be so much better if they fixed the ai. Was the same in arma 2 and unfortunately nothing has changed. Stealth is dead enemies will spot you in the dark 200 meters away or from a moving helicopter while your underwater. It is so inconsistant and really kills the immersion when concealment is moot.  Instead of enemies getting smarter on higher difficulties they just get aim bots. Got to the point where even sticking my head out of cover for a split second meant death from a distant machinegun headshot. Thats not more challenging its just cheap.  Best thing about this game is the editor.
his is the worst optimised game I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only does the frame rate stick around 25 and BELOW but even when I put the graphics on LOW Windowed 1024 x 768 it stays the same. Around 25 FPS. I have a great gaming rig and I just can not enjoy this game. Sometimes I joined a game and it stuck around 10fps. Don't waste your money-10
ever played an ARMA game but I really liked BF2 Project reality and Early Tom Clancy FPS games. The pre-order was half of the future retail price and included Alpha and Beta access--so I thought I would give this a try. What I found was a half baked game that was overly reliant on expected croud sourcing assets. The game was bare bones with almost no missions the engine was sub-par controls not thought through and gameplay generally uninspired.   If I'd bought a physical copy I would be selling it right now.  Huge dissapointment. If you aren't already a fan of the franchise you may want to pass or at least wait until it goes on sale for &lt;$10.-10
i love the game but i had to get a new computter and when i downloaded t to the new one it says ' GAME LAUNCH ERROR GAME EXECUTEABLE NOT FOUND. PLEASE RPAIR THE GAME THROUGH THE STEAM CLIENT.' i have done everything i could find and nothing works...this is BS and a wast of my money.....
O NOT BUY THIS GAME! For a $60 game this is one of the buggiest games I have ever played. I'm talking about game breaking bugs too. The recent stamina update has completely ruined this game. You walk 2 feet and you're breathing harder than you would after finishing a 5 hour fap session its horrendously stupid. It makes it impossible to aim down sights. DO NOT BUY -11
he Singleplayer CAN be fun. The graphics Options are pretty good if you have a bad PC you can edit it very well. But Multiplayer is Very bad i got the game for Multiplayer and its a Disaster i cant even connect and when i join it says: Mission failed... I might be a noob. But i dont recommend the game.-10
o i won't recommend this game. I'm sorry but i'm spend more time trying to fix the game to get workshop scenarios to work because steam can't update a game properly and you have to redownload it again. Because every dev update breaks mods compatibilities because mods get corrupted because steam is unstable because mods gets corrupted when the game crash... I barely spend time playing the game too busy trying to get everything to work. What a farce.-10
 have only played this a half hour but that half hour it has been horrible. It's nothing like a good shooter in my opinion. I expected this to be like ... better.  This game really had alot of potential to me and i do not recommend it at all. I simply hate this game.  Pros : - Good Graphics - Refunding  Cons : - You can get kicked for no reason - Bad AI - Nearly every server is Epoch (dayz) - Every other server is some weird mods as well  Please do not hate me i just saw so much potential in this game. I'm sad they made this game like it is.-10
Terrible 1st impressions FPS is huge on almost every server if theres ppl its impossible to play because of the fps if the fps is low theres like 3 ppl on the server. Impossible to find a normal sever I get handcuffed for doing nothing and a lot of other boring ... I WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMEND BUYING OR EVEN WASTING YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME
It's Alright
roblems all around.  Every update creates new BUGS.  Trying to run anything other than the boring Vanilla is problematic at best.  Dev relied on community to build gameplay without instructions then Dev come out with updates to ruin everything that made the game actually enjoyable.  BOTTOM LINE  Potentially an awesome game but Devs keep finding a way to screw you.-11
Its been 3 years and im still waiting for my fps to go above 20 with a titan.
game bad from commies to nazis this game does not have you covered sad sad i am sad this game is bad bad this game is bad!
Really boring game with bad graphics
 have almost over 3000 hours on this game and I can tell you this........  The gameplay is great but the game mp sucks  is unplayable with out a 5th gen CPU and 4gb GPU.  Until I can play this game with a 2gb card and a 3rd gen cpu.........    this game I will just play Dayz standalone when a want to play arma :)-10
t took them far too long to polish this turd for me to recomend anything BIS is involved with. Yeah the game is ok now that they have finally added the features that should have been there from day dot but I bought a physical copy of the DELUXE EDITION from EB and as such i expected a FINISHED GAME not the Alpha/Beta i was confronted with. It should never have been on shelves 6 months ago let alone when i bought it back in 2013. And you would think DELUXE EDITION implies that at least *some* of the DLC would be included. Nope. Not so'DELUXE' then is it?  Imagine buying a new car and on your way out of the dealership the shady salesman casualy states 'Oh just so you know even though you have a dashboard none of the dials or switches work. But as soon as we get some in we can install them for a nominal fee'. Seems a bit rude dosen't it? paying for something and realizing it dosen't even come close to expectations.   And the excuse 'why not just use mods' is just a sad way of admiting the game isn't finished and/or it isn't any good on its own. And even though i may pick it back up and try again i really don't see myself spending anywhere near the time i had intended to as the experience has left a VERY bitter taste in my mouth.  YEARS Later............  2016 and it's still an unoptimized hot mess with the dubious choice of overpriced pointless DLC like go karts or constant ads to buy said DLC should you pick up or use the wrong item. And now most people would rather role play as 'cops and robbers' (d1ckhe@ds and dealers) than play the game as a mil sim. This isn't arma it's the bloody sims with guns and as fun as that sounds it is not. It's still a big 'nah i'll be right' to this game from me.-10
ould rate this 9/10 however this may not be your game as it contains more bush play then the 70s.11
imple cannot recommend a game that filles your screen with dlc adds if you happen to use something that is part of a dlc you as a user don't own.  I do NOT say that I want it for free I rather it was disabled then having commercials that destroys my gameplay experience.   To simply annoy the consumer until they give you the money to get rid of the adds is something I expect when trying a app on my mobile divices not when I spend 45€ on a high budget game.  Just because they give it for free doesn't mean they get away with it scoot free aspecially when this wasn't part of the product when it launched.  (Sorry for any grammatical errors)-10
 DLC the game
Was playing battle royale and as the plane crashed into a city everyone screamed allahu akbar and other racist terrorist .   ing amazing
 few months back... Found an excellent wepon dropped from my enemy and 'You cannot use this weapon because its part of a DLC. Please purchase to be able to use it' - What the hell? 59$ on a game and not able to pick up a weapon? Wel.. I guess we can let this one pass...  Today I was joining a server and 'This mission takes part on a non-owned Apex DLC please purchase it to be able to join server.'  A F*KIN 50$ DLC. &lt;&lt;  This game it's not Pay2win it's pay2play. It would be better to have a wow-similar subscription instead.. if I am to pay 50$ on a regular basis to continue playing the game... (without mentioning all the bugs the poor performance and all that sheet)-10
uch shoot  very pew pew  many deaths10
 ran a few different programs to give me a idea of what settings I could run it at and all of them told me ultra. Started it up and tried running it on ultra; couldn't even break 10FPS. I then worked my way down on settings all combos and still didn't break 25-30 FPS. Tried looking up performance tweaks and still no improvement. The game itself could be great but it can't seem to run on some high-end pcs so it was just a clossal waste of $ for me. It seems that 2yrs post-release that Bohemia would have resolved some if not all the performance issues by now....-10
NREFINED AND JERKY -- describes every aspect of this game. Even with the settings turned down the animations are horrible and the guns are garbage - I cant even hit a window on the side of a building. Bohemia needs to take some pointers from other shooters refine the animations fix the guns so they actually can shoot someone and fix the jerky animations and lag so that whopever you shoot at is not ghosting and jerking around like someone having a seaizure. I wouldnt even call this and Alpha build and this game has been out for years -- NO EXCUSES AT THIS POINT. I want my money back this game is garbage.-10
igh price low fps overall bad game-10
erformance sucks gameplay is ok if you can find it overall it sucks. Running simulator at its best.-10
Shot the floor only to have the bullet bounce from the ground and hit my friend in the head This feature is heavily overlooked But beacuse of this we arent friends anymore thanks 
art of the appeal of this game is the realism (i.e. ballistics stamina environment) which positive reviewers rave about. The realism makes this the most exciting and action-packed pc game I've ever played. The majority of the game is sprinting for five seconds to a badly rendered bush or maybe a tree with three sides then having to pause for 30 seconds so that your aim will calm itself. How did the game know I have Parkinson's? You'll unload three clips trying to shoot one contact 100 yards away in an open field and feel ecstatic after staring and shooting at one another for a good minute. It's almost like playing tag with good friends except for the part where someone gets tagged. I did enjoy the sounds of bullets whizzing by and I'm sure the AI experienced the same bliss since we did nothing but lie on the ground and fire seemingly randomly at one another. Ironically when well- hidden behind a tree or rock (or other random cover) and peek around the corner the AI suddenly becomes an expert marksman and kills you with one shot. That'll teach me for trying to be tactical.  Save points are set within the game and waypoints are even more predictable leading to non-frustrating replays and non-existent monotony. There's no real way to be stealthy or use environmental advantages because the AI has Xray and auto-aim so that's a relief. Your squad will most likely make all the kills and leave you in the dust since stamina does not affect them the way it affects you. Also certain characters have infinite health so there's no real urgency in helping with firefights. Time to kick back and let everyone else have fun.  Then there's the weird controls which will have you rolling on the floor (literally) out of cover right into incoming fire. That's the last thing the enemy expects! You'll try to scavenge weapons and ammo from fallen soldiers only to be shot dead while trying to navigate the extremely simple and intuitive equipment interface. I guess that's my fault for not being able to perform 400 actions per minute. As a plus you can steal clothing and make yourself wear glasses or bandanas which have no real tactical advantage besides trolling a fallen soldier.   I forgot to mention that you'll bleed out and die if you don't bandage your arm with a first aid kit after being shot anywhere on your body. That's actually pretty realistic since it's a medical fact that your arm is the hub of all your blood circulation and health. As you're wounded aim and mobility decrease to the point that's so real you won't be able to contribute in any positive way except to be cannon fodder for the enemy. It's ok though when you die you'll get to respawn with full health. But then when you restart the checkpoint you can't fire your gun because there's apparently a glitch in programming (or is it?) which doesn't allow reloading. This is great since the game already saved your progress and you're stuck with one bullet you can't fire anyways. The realism is scary.   I would not recommend this game for $60 or even on sale for $30. I would wait till the price increases to at least $99.99 so that way you'll maximize your regret for spending so much money on a game that's so realistic you could go outside with an airsoft gun and have the exact same experience. Just make sure you're terrible at everything and the illusion will be complete. Sorry not illusion; simulation.-11
he game was released with very little content. Except for multiplayer it's not worth it and even that is empty because of the lack of content they release the game with.  Good points would be the graphics if your computer runs it ok. Even very powerful machines will have some issues with it. Community is great modding is highly supported and the modding community is extremely active.  My conclusion would be to wait. Basically the game is in beta. The game WILL be amazing however the state it's in now it's barren. Buy it when it's on sale or in a year or so.-10
fter playing this for a very long time I have come to the conclusion that the community has completely ruined this game.  This game is great and it has had a lot of attention put to it but the community is unbelievably stupid when it comes to gamemodes. There are only four gamemodes available in multiplayer and they're all flawed up the . ================================================= Gamemode 1: Survival (Zombies and Wasteland)  Zombie modes are boring and Wasteland is extremely boring. ================================================= Gamemode 2: King of the Hill  This is the closest thing you'll get to proper PVP action but the leveling system is beyond awful! Newer players are utterly crushed by higher level players who are all wearing ghillie suits holding high powered sniper rifles and flying around in jets with unlimited missles.  New players are given a starter weapon which is totally useless and you don't get anything good until you reach level 13 which wouldn't be a problem if the leveling didn't take FOREVER! Then you have the massive problem with team stacking because players are given a big XP reward if they win the game so they all stack on one team making it impossible for other teams to win.  Overall King of the Hills leveling and cash system is awful and the best way to beat it is to camp in the cap zone until you reach level 13 but that will take you a good ten hours. ================================================= Gamemode 3: Roleplay  Its just like DarkRP in Garry's Mod except its super laggy to the point where its unplayable and the servers are all ran by teenagers with serious issues because they setup these convoluted Police recruitment systems then they have there police force act like the KGB.  Overall Atlis Roleplay is a waste of time because of lag and an endless stream of trolls who do everything in there power to make the game unplayable. ================================================= Gamemode 4: Battle Royale  I hope you like waiting in spectate or waiting for the server to unlock. ================================================= OVERALL  Community: The community ruined this game with flawed and boring gamemodes. If you're looking for the real Arma experince you have to join a clan but clans are really strict only play at set times and don't like people who are new to the Arma series.   Game: I could go on for hours about the awful bugs UI DLC and price of the DLC but instead I'm going to talk about serious connection problems and the System Requirements.  Connection Problems: Even if you find a server thats in your country and you have a ping of 20 you'll still lag like crazy making the already broken hitboxes even harder to hit.  System Requirements: Thankfully I have a super computer and I can run this game on Ultra settings but this game will go to war with your CPU and Graphics card!  I miss Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead because people used to play cooperative gamemodes like Insurgency...I miss Insurgency....It almost brings a tear to my eye.  EDIT: After searching for countless hours I finally found a co-op Arma mission people play called Annex its pretty good but this game is still NOT worth your money!-11
ore of an engine than an actual game.  Even if you disregard the absolutely horrid control scheme and terribly unoptimized engine as well as the stiff animations One of the if not The most complicated game ever to start playing.  It's impossible to just pick up and play. You have to download a gorillion mods and other tools that the community considers 'essential'. Once you do get into a game expect 2 hours to fly by where you do nothing but walk around.  Some people swear by the game and have put hundreds even thousands of hours into it. These people have my respect as they have put aside enough time to allow the academic research that this game requires before it becomes fun. I just can't set aside that time.  -10

his game is on the opposite side of most of the games that are simply too afraid to make things too hard. I normally don't like these types of games because they seem to create their own version of reality that makes the game even less realistic. For instance: Enemy troops who have just been established as being too dumb to find their  on a map of their own homeland are now able to hit you without scopes in heavy cover at 300 meters. In contrast a veteran marine gets tired from walking up a gentle slope for two minutes. However the single player is meant to train you for multiplayer and it succeeds in doing this. Or you would think.  The multiplayer allows for plenty of roles so if you are new you can always stick to support. Unfortunately the FPS is going to be around 25 on standard gfx. I also get this feeling that 80% of the people have NO CLUE what is going on. This is usually a sign of scattered game design.  Optimization is kinda bad depite being almost indistinguishable from a game from 2006 with a ton of AA modded in but how else are you going to move those newly rebranded Nvidia cards off the shelves every year?  The keyboard bindings are a tragic mess. Double right clicking to use the iron sites? Five different buttons to use all the menus and submenus? Various key combinations to draw a LINE ON A MAP?? Using a layout standard that does not resemble anything ANY OTHER WELL KNOWN GAME uses? It does not help that there seems to be a .75 second delay to all commands.  This is the Crusader Kings II of FPSs except where Crusader Kings is ed because of random events that cause your King/Duke/Whatever to grow a nipple out of his forehead totally trashed mechanics that allow for an army of 14 archers to defeat your army of 1240 because it was raining and they felt kind of down and AI that seems to really hate you especially for no clear reason other than that they want to capture you and cut out your eyes and testicles ARMA III has controls that make no sense and optimization that makes Company of Heroes 2 look like it could run on a TI-83 calculator.   Buy for the (extremely short) single player on sale. The idea is novel but not so much the implementation.  I feel sorry for those poor designers who got arrested by the Greek Armed forces during this game's production. Not worth it.-10
eview date: 21.06.2014  This game would be great but without its horrible body armor system or how you wanna call it. In short as you see in this video at 11:06  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mal2CMf_PjE  You take 5x56 mm rifle point it at the soldiers chest and it takes 5 hits to kill him when he is wearing bulletproof vest. If wearing stronger vest it takes 11 hits. Yeah you read it right. And there is even more!  When you are trying to kill AI controlled soldier situation usually looks like this: You approach your enemy from back take your rifle shoot him once in second he turns to you you try to shoot him for a second time he gives you instant headshot and kills you. After a while of playing you will start to feel like your weapons cant kill anyone and that you are absolutely harmless to your enemy. And shooting from greater distance? Its just saying hi to them.-10
 broken unfinished mess made by some hilariously incompetent developers. Runs like  on any machine and will never get any better thanks to the brain dead decision to stick with a decades old engine and 32 bit code. Despite arma being positioned as a simulator it is nothing of the sort it is just as much of an arcade shooter as Battlefield of CoD with the only saving grace being a greater freedom of gameplay variety and depth.  Despite all this  is still the most worthwile game to have been released on PC for the past five years and even if it is still effectively in a beta state I can't help but waste more and more time on it.  Any sane person will stay the  away and find something more useful to do with their time.-10
It's a great game and I love it and you can put so many hours into it. But what makes me not want to play it is that the game runs so poorly on MP. How am I suppose to enjoy a realistic shooter if i'm getting like 20 frames? I get it buy a new cpu but im not spending 600 dollars to just play one game i'm sorry until they fix this then I can't give it a postive review. Please fix this it will be wonderful
illed with unfixable crashes regarding memory error I have around 8 gigs of ram and a OP GPU so this shouldn't be a ing problem but it is. Absolutely unplayable theres no fix for this memory error as it stands right now. I've been trying three days to get this working (-Malloc=system Delete files Verifing game cache reinstalling etc) and none of them worked at all. Games is buggy beyond belief and the few times I did join a server the community was absolute cancer. Avoid.-11
his game runs a over 10 years old engine back from OFP days and still no 64bit proper multi-threading &amp; proper multi-core support. this means your FPS is  no matter what specs you have. if you tell that to the fanboys in the official BI forum they will claim that you play multiplayer bad scripted servers even if you write in huge letters that you play SP. anyway here a list of why i do NOT recommend this game:  - all of its features are not properly added like physx etc. - no ponds/rivers/inland water and that for a game which was release in 2013 but in arma 2 ponds were supported ?! - very bad performance in SP aswell as in MP. - Low CPU usage some parts of the engine are very outdated like the CPU usage. This Game runs mostly on one Core. - Its a sandbox game but its more limited than most people know for example: this game can not run huge battles with many AI. this game is more made for small spec ops missions or zombie survival missions where you are alone as survivor fighting zombie AI. one of the reason for that is that the CPU usage of this engine is ****. so its a very limited sandbox game which does not let you make things what you want only if you accept huge FPS problems. - the engine itself is very limited in many terms: modeling is very limited some modder who made buildings for  abadoned theyr project due to the limitations. same for terrain in terms of object placement and size and and and.. - NO proper multi-core / multi-threading and 64bit support and that in 2013 and for a large scale game like this multi-core / multi-threading &amp; 64bit is a MUST! - Alot of problems with the AI  now to the devs why they are one of the worstest out there: - the devs are only fixing minor bugs and making small optimizations but giving the game a great FPS boost by adding proper multi-core / multi-threading support does not happen. - the devs didnt fixed many AI problems and now the guy who works on VCOM AI fixed the AI driving which was not fixed by any BI dev for 13 years! i cant believe that a modder has to fix what BI didnt fixed in such long time. - BI dont care when people steal and selling mods and i will explain why in the community part:  why the arma community is one of the worstest: - people start to steal mods and selling as theyr own for money. especially after  life when  life got away with it and BI took no action. now more and more people start to steal mods or models from other games and sell them. last time a french life mod was found that they stole models from other  modders and sold them same for a mission which can be found at the BI forum and that all after they saw BI took no action against  life. - alot of fanboys are out there who cant accept critism against BI or . alot of community members cant deal with it when you speak about the problems of  (especially when it comes to the CPU problem). most members in the forum are buttsniffer who has theyr head in bohemias ***.   oh and the moderators in the BI forum are stupid cunts. There is a offtopic section where they discuss about religions politics etc and when you write there your own political view which oppose the western politics for example you dislike the NATO or if you believe that the ukraine uprising was planned from outside and that EU support nazis or if you dislike syrian 'rebels' then they give you a warn or they ban you immediatly. so you have two choices: write only good things about U.S government &amp; NATO organization (and never criticize them) or you are silent if you oppose them (otherwise you will face infractions and/or a ban)-11
 have been playing this since Alpha and have vouched never to play it again. Here's why:  Pros:  Some of the best graphics I've ever seen.  Overall physics vastly improved over Arma 2 (especially the vehicle physics).  The land vehicles can finally reach speeds past 60 mph (100kph).  The ability to mix and match clothing/uniforms and what not.  Now here come the cons:  EXTREMELY poor optimization. People with Titans STILL get less than 30fps on this game. And to top it off I get more frames on ULTRA (30) than I do on LOW (25). My PC is pretty good I'd say 4GB GTX 670 Overclocked i7-3770k 32GB RAM I mean come on....The optimization is beyond horrid on this game.  Bland and unfinished maps: While the maps are graphically amazing and have SOME finished areas overall however the maps feel very bland and unfinished. Fly over one in an aerial vehicle and you'll see what I mean.  Stamina: Run five feet and you're character is gasping for air as if he was nearly suffocated to death. This also screws up your aim severely and will probably get you killed (it has got me killed countless times).  The DEVELOPER: Bohemia Interactive really just doesn't care. The game is overpriced and lacks severly in content (I'll get to this later in the review). They rushed this game out and look what happened. Aside from that you can be globally banned (rendering you unable to play online thus rendering the game useless) for no reason and they will NOT help you. There is no way to contact them and BattlEye (the anticheat program) will refuse to accept any excuse for your global ban and blame it on you entirely. They're basically saying that their anticheat is perfect and doesn't screw up. If you get banned than you ed up. If you try emailing them they will NEVER and I mean NEVER get back to you. This whole developer/anticheat service and GAME is basically a HUGE SCAM.  Poor gunplay: There is windage on the bullets in the game but no way to measure wind speed or direction.  STILL no bipods. (I mean COME ON this is a mil sim).  All 7 guns in the game feel the same and are very bland.   You still cant freaking jump over a fence.  This game somehow manages to be more clunky than its predecessor.  The recoil on the weapons is overexaggerated.  The game modes: This game carries over the game modes of its predecessor except they poorly executed in . The game modes feel lacking and are no longer fun like they were in Arma 2. This has much to do with the large lack of content.   And that leads us to my main problem with the game: LACK OF CONTENT:  Since day one there has been little content in this game. There's not many guns in the game and most of them are just basically variants of each other. Same story for the vehicles and just about everything else in the game. I mean for s sake they released a GO KART DLC for this game. A GO KART DLC for a ing military simulator. The go karts are in the game you just can't get in them if you don't have the DLC. ing jews.  Overall I'd say buy this game's predecessor Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead. I have countless hours on that game and let me tell you  was a big let down. Arma 2/Arrowhead has a vastly large amount of content the gameplay is better and less clunky and just about everything else is better. Don't get me wrong I really wanted to like  but I can't. I just cant.  Do not buy this game.  Stay away at all costs.-11
This game is f***ing aids. Its HIV positive if you have an AMD system. 8350 @ 4.6GHz and a r9 280 OC and I get 15 FPS on LOW F***ING SETTINGS.   RIP in Intel HD 3000 graphics :-(
bad optimization
ruh Optimize the ing game more! You need a ing nasa computer to play this .-11
NSTANT BUYER'S REMORSE  I want to like this game. I really do. I've watched soooo many Frankie youtube videos of various Arma2/3/DayZ antics and I thought to myself 'boy despite the billion graphical glitches there seem to be present and the staggering amount of complete aholes in servers and the really really clunky looking UI/inventory system.... this looks like it could be fun!'  Team based objectives mods that have huge open world survival based gameplay vehicles realistic (seemingly) weaponry military tactics....at a glance looks like a pretty decent game  So free weekend 50% off... 30 bucks for a game that has singleplayer AND multiplayer? infinite modding possibilities?  SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY SIR!  4.2 hourrs on my record I would say AT LEAST HALF was spend alt-tabbed googling various 'how do I do this' or ' tutorial' since the in-game help/instructions/interface - is . I don't know if it is because I've never played any ARMA installment or I'm mentally  or the game is simply an unintuitive cobbled together sack of confusing and unhelpful  but either way prepare for a heavy learning curve. Some enjoy this aspect some people PREFER a game with 400 keybinds to take advantage of their expensive gaming keyboards and mice.... I am not one of them. It's a first/3rd person shooter with sim aspects - there should be no need for you to be a contortionist or have a 2nd monitor with a keybind list up at all times. Honestly a lot of the keybinds are whacky and frustratingly unintuitive. I get it new things take time to learn. Like learning a new language. Like piloting a jet. Like learning how to script. For me playing a game and learning the controls should be remotely similar to any of these things. I do not want to dedicated 20+ hours just to be able to navigate gameplay. It's not a MMO. Hell I HAVE PLAYED MMOS WITH LESS BINDS. Not only that but for the life of me I could not get my extra mouse buttons to perform the way I wanted them to. Arma3 is the only game I've ever played where that has been the case.   Get ready to spend hours scouring the web for 'FPS ISSUES' or 'FPS TWEAK GUIDES' for a game that really isn't incredibly impressive graphically. All the same it will make you wonder what your $700 video card and top notch processor 16 gigs ram SSD HD etc are ING DOING. You'll notice if you have monitors up on your PC that they aren't being taxed all that much (20%?) yet performance is still AWFUL. Guides will have you downloading CPU parking/unparking software entering a billion command line switches sacrificing goats to the Bohemian pagan gods but alas very little you do will change the fact that this game is optimized like a bag of bloody . Don't bother searching through forums 95% of people that don't recognize there is in fact a massive persistent issue with FPS in this game (so maybe 20 people on all the internet) will just ridicule your computer or setup and tell you to 'get a guhd computer I get 60 fps must be a problem with your setup    !!!!!' etc.  The campaign is horrendous. The AI is bad. Like mind blowingly bad. Your teammates will just charge in and either kill everything in sight while you're playing 'realistically' (taking your time scouting moving from cover to cover etc) or they will charge in and get annihilated. Either way prepare to be a spectator for a lot of the action simply because your character is bound by the 'realism' parameters that both friendly and enemy AI is NOT.   Examples of this include the enemy have clairvoyant abilities to spot you behind that tree rock building etc and the SECOND you pop your melon out for a little lookie-loo boom headshot. From 300+M. From an enemy who ISNT EVEN RENDERED. Oh okay I thought I was fighting human beings not Terminators with cloaking shields. Woops.  The enemy AI will have astonishing accuracy. Unbelievable and certainly not realistic accuracy. Accuracy that you simply cannot pray to match if you have been moving at all in the last few minutes before you raise your gun. Try drinking 10-15 beers then playing that stupid game we did as kids where you get a baseball bat and put your forehead to the pommel and jam it into the ground and spin around and around and around for a minute. Then pick up an assault rifle and try to aim at something 10 M away let alone 300M away. (I'm not American so as kids we didn't have the assault rifles but the baseball bat spinny thing WAS a thing its not just the 15 beers talking) This is what its like to try to aim down at an enemy after running 15 feet. For a game striving for realism.... yeah. This amazing and ultra realisitic military sim mechanic only affects you in case you were wondering.   Besides the game breaking AI and mechanics and horrid control system and clunky AI and awful on screen instructions - the campaign itself is a lot of 'ho-hum lets traverse the country side for 15 mins listening to horrid voice acting (to be fair its not AS bad as what some people are saying but its still not good and considering its the only god damn thing to take your mind off HOW BAD THIS GAME IS PERFORMING ON YOUR GAMING RIG it just grates on your nerves). Literally a mission starts and they have you run from one in game cut sceen to another with zero action in between with a few fadeouts and 15 minutes of walking... is this deliberate to bore you to  death so that when action takes place you don't notice HOW  the AI acts? Perhaps so. Prepare to traverse the same stretch of not so pretty landscape over and over as the save system is another baffling part of Bohemia's design. I understand not allowing you to save whenever you damn well please (wait..no I don't) but making me listen to same uninspired boring and inane voice acting while running up the same god forsaken hill for 3 minutes over and over and over because the AI consists of super soldiers who can no scope you .5 seconds after a full out sprint to prone is just infuriating after a while.  Even during firefights I did not get an overwhelming sense of 'holy shieeeeet war is scurry man this is so realistic only supreme tactics and skill and will have me come out on top in this conflict.' It was more like why the fk am I druken soldier with asthma who can't run 5M and raise his weapon without swaying so bad it's amazing he's even still standing upright? More often than not you find yourself letting your AI teammates do everything while you cower in a bush hoping you might get to shoot 1 or 2 enemy soldiers OR you allow your teammates to cannon fodder themselves and you mop up while the enemy is busy annihilating them. Either way you barely feel engrossed in the action and never really feel like a main player in the game.  Don't even get me started on the UAV mission.   To be fair this is the single player part of the game.   I have yet to really delve into multiplayer - I'm afraid to. People state (numerous times I might add) that single player FPS is fine but MULTIPLAYER is where it REALLY goes downhill. Oh goodie.   When the game is made so inaccessible it makes it real difficult to start it up again let alone try playing with other people and getting into the lovely world of Arma Community friendliness.  Better make another run to the beer store.  Even if you're not a drinker spend $30 on booze. You will get way more entertainment out of it. Hell if you're really not a drinker give the booze to a bunch of teenagers or your little brother or something. You will be better off for it trust me.-11
Barely a decent game to say the least  -NUMEROUS rediculous animations that will get you killed while exiting/entering anything -Dont try to hide because players only see grass a few feet infront of them -A small shrub blew up my tank -Walk 10 miles just to get shot by a 5 star general of an ai -Not very fluid combat  Just stick to arma2
You think I'M A ?! For watching anime? HA What a joke let me tell you a story so you can futher grasp just who it is you're talking to when it comes to earning the right to call someone a .   Me and my best bro used to play this game where we suck each others'  and call the person who cums first a . I usually win because my bro's never been all that great at ucking and when he es in my mouth I make him finish me off then give him a passionate kiss so he has to swallow both loads. Then I berate him for the next hour or so about what a total  he is. To this day I've acumulated over 1200 victories in this battle of skill and edurance not only over my best bro but over hundreds of other chalengers. Each just wishing to earn the right to even call me a .  So next time you decide to try to berate me by claiming I'm a  for watching anime just remember I doubt you could suck off a  even half as well as I can. 10
So why is this still $59.99 USD? Stop being money hungry Bohemia Interactive please..
this games is really messed up and honesly if you are new to the game you have no idea what your are doing. once you find out the game becomes boring and long.  this game is onloy alive because of mods which also are a pain to install..  dont waste your time.  steam support &lt; request refund&lt; thx gaben got my money back for this crap
The best 30 FPS simulator I have ever played. Game is so good that user mods are better than the actual game. My personal favorite part about this game is the desync where you see people in tanks flying across the map raining down shells across the map.
The worse Arma ever - cannot connect and play co-op with a friend. Always get a response on game invite 'Server is not responding.' when trying to connect and play with a friend. They are just ripping off people by taking so much money for the poor quality. That's so devastating and sad. Do not spend your money on this game. Buy something which works instead.
NOT an AMD friendly engine!!   I have played this game since it first showed up on early access. I also had an Intel setup most of the time (2600 3770K and 4770K). It ran flawless with those CPU's (average FPS of about 70-80). I had to make a downgrade a few months back and i went to a 6800K from AMD. Using the same GFX card the CPU has become UNUSABLE for this game. Average FPS of about 17 and even lower in bigger towns. I know im not the only one and i do know that this engine LOVES hyper threading. But you would think by now it would have some sort of optimization of the AMD side of things.-10
Are you kidding me? I spend so much time trying to keep up with the AI's that I'm always so fatigued when we come into contact that I cant shoot? Half the time I cant even see them. Its either that or never get into a fire fight and spend the whole time running around a forest listening to panting sounds! Its utterly ridiculous. There's some great features and I would really like to play the game but at this point I'm so frustrated that I'm over it.
ad performance it has.. Great graphics it does. Recommend I do not.-11
I have Autism and I recommend this game.
ood game entertaining for hours :D Still requires a lot of bug fixed though.10
ArmA III is a worthy successor to ArmA 2 taking the flaws of ArmA 2 and perfecting the game engine - mostly. There are still numerous bugs AI problems and much multiplayer FPS lag but if you can get around these problems this open-world sandbox military simulator is well worth the money.10
Get it now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am doing this to level up my steam profile.
So many mods available that you will never get bored. Great game with tons to do. You can run missions epoch battle royal king of the hill life etc.10
is a great game with a moderate learning curve. If you liked ARMA 2 you will also like . Be warned this is not your fast pace Battlefield 3/4 experience.  goes for a more realistic approach to the FPS game. This game has a great modding comunity and will keep you coming back for years to come.10
his is a great step up from ArmA 2. They did take an odd turn and remove most weapons from the base game to get people to buy additional DLC. Beyond that the new graphics introduced is a nice update to the game that introduces working screens and a cleaner look. The 'ArmA physics' for vehicles that used to be a riot when in a wheeled vehicle has been largely updated and has less vehicles flying 200 ft. into the air. All in all a great game to play with friends or even random people to get your tactics on.10
One of the best value games on Steam both in terms of its sheer scope and and its unvarying ability to meet its lofty goals. Truly a modern game.10
I really like this game it is so fun the editor mode is really fun to play around with making your own scenerios or just having a massive war for the hell of it so to the creators I say Arigato!
it's a game with some bugs and glitches those will be fixed over time.  you will need a good pc to run it at high FPS. my favorite way to play is millisim witch makes it more realistic. the way the game was meant to be played.
Very good game. If you have played the Arma series before then you will know what you are in for. Lots of Mods and Missions to play online with friends. Also runs smooth on both my PC &amp; Laptop.
This game is amazing!
very good i think yes :)
Great game. Very immersive and would highly recommend!
 recommend this game to all the FPS/SIM players!10
Everyone should play this game. Is rly gud.
Good game with great mod's
Must buy
really good game with tons of mods
robably my current favorite FPS. It's the definition of military sandbox. Be warned however this isn't an easy game and you will die a lot.10
Best game you can get on a pc
This game is worth the buy. So many mods and looks so good. Just wait til a half off sale...
ery goodvery real10
A fantastic game which hold countless hours of gameplay and stories and funtimes :DDDD
english no good. hard to get bored playing is game. easy to get hard playing this game.
I disobeyed my 12 Year Old Commanders orders and mortared our supply station.
ou're going to need a good PC to run this with a reasonable amount of frames and you're going to need to abandon your Call of Duty mentality to truly enjoy this --and you're also going to want to get serious about the mod community- but if you're a fan of military style games and want a massive environment with no invisible walls then this is the game for you.10
est game in the world beautiful graphics...10
is a masterpiece that i think will be played for a a long time! This game has beautiful graphics of terrain and objects. Gameplay mechanics are quite easy to learn but becoming a master takes time and practice you maybe able to kill from 100 meters but you will have to train to kill at 1000. There are a wide selection of weapons and clothing for your charicter ranging from Ghille Suits to Civillian clothing. Where I think this game shines is the scale of combat With two absolutly huge maps and combat scenarios Arma will never give you the same scenario twice! This isn't any arcade shooter Arma is a TACTICAL shooter some would even call it a role-playing game! SUMMARY: BUY this game if you have a moderatly powerfull pc! 10
his is the future of war games.   All it needs now is interactive cockpits for the aircraft tanks and other vehicles but the modding community is superb.   There's bound to be something for you in Arma. It's not JUST war and guns and tanks and stuff...  You can go mountain climbing scuba diving skydiving and even command your own battalion of... butterflies.10
est game everyou should definately try it out!10
Arrested for cooking meth  10/10
un game still needs some work on to fix de-sync and on ingame physics. apart from that its a good game too bad I gotaa run it on low =(10
great game to play with your friends
hat can I say about this game   Good points is that its very modable and enjoyable with or with out mods  but this game comes to light when it has mods installed . Bad point about the game is the stamina bar as seems the devs had so unfit poor soul run his  off as seems if you run more then 50 m you cant hit thing beacuse of your scope bouncing around all over the place when you stop .  But overall it great game to play and the task force radio mod is must adds more depth and realism10
Absolutely love this friggin game!
Great game!!!!
best war simulation game ever
It is like real war with slightly worse FPS in multiplayer.
ot together with some friends decided that our lives were limited to picking cocaine. Nothing else in life was working. Girlfriends dumped us failed out of school in debt to the government. Now I am living the life got ourselves some vehicles a warehouse started a gang and are now ruling the streets with a force. Enough so that now instead of just blasing ' Da Police' we are literally ING them. 11/1010
i love hand cuffing people and making them bow down and kiss my feet.
This is The Best Game i've ever seen ! xD
Hello ARMA i will just go streight on and say it's a good game worth evry 'penny of the money they ask for .
its best game na
Great game just make sure your PC can handle it
takes the best of the series and improves the infantry movement and animation system leaps forward. The game francise has had no competition in the market ( No there really is not competition from BF4 or codemasters tinkering called Operation Flashpint 2). Only other game that comes close is WW2 Online battleground europe. But that game is in respirator and waiting for the doctor to shut down the life support because horrid development decisions from dews.   is the best combined arms simulation in the market period. The mod community around the game is amazing. You really get tens or hundreds of games for the price of one. If you do not like the near future renamed vehicles there allready is heaps of current military gear and vehicles available. All the previous maps of the series are available free and working in the new engine. Main portion of the previous games vehicles are ported to . You even have role playing servers up to hundreds of players per server if that is your thing.  The developer is allso leader of providing combined arms simulator to military. Virtual battlespace 3 (VBS3) is used by US and many NATO countries. Bohemia is committed to update the game and we saw firs major update to the helicopter physics with more complex flight models with rotor lib from Take on Helicopters simulation. And allso physics based slingloading and more to come.   Bullet pearsing and drop is calculated. day night cycle acurate star map to navigate from if you forgot your compass in night mission. endles mission opportunitys in land sea and air.  Its a solid 10/10 because no other game comes even close.10
ons of fun if you know where to look and when you play with friends (either ones you already know or ones you meet online). The communities that I have seen online so far are all friendly and play the objective (for the most part). Overall this game runs great for me with a little optimization and the level of coop and competitive play could last me hundreds of hours of tactical enjoyment.10
y favorite Multiplayer Game also bunch of various mods.10
epends on the mod. Altis Life - Depends on server but most are fun unless you find one that is filled with squeakers and trolls. recommend  http://www.therevolutiongaming.com/   A3L-Glitchy but fun at times roll back and total loss of bank was turn off after finding out the streamers were comp'd.  http://arma3-life.com/   King of Hill Wasteland fun but rarely find people to play with. 10
hooty shooty good driving okay flying hard. 10/10 bullets either tickle or are fired near you and you die.10
does not have time to teach you how to play it. It does not have time to help you find someone to play with. It lacks the common decency to provide a story of any kind at release.  Bohemia Interactive's sandbox military simulation series began life in 2001 as Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis before the developer retconned its own title renaming the series Arma. Updating the game for modern PC players was a tall order and after four long years of development  still isn't done.  Bohemia Interactive made the decision to release it anyway.   may be the most challenging and the most rewarding online shooter I have ever played. But it's missing key components — most damning of all a single-player campaign. As a result it feels more like a huge demo than a finished product.10
If you want to real reality you must play this game! It's wonderfull...
 would recommend the game as played with friends. Campaign alone for example is ing pain in the . The AI companions are  and enemies seem to be at most points superhumans. I mean they aim ridicilously well and they see even the slightest movement in a bush from one click away. I mean seriously? Then you drop player alone in the middle of these superhumans. 'Fun eh?' Well yeah if your ing physics would actually work and the forest and bushes would ACTUALLY COVER SOMETHING. I played OPF series from the start and ARMA series from the start but this campaign and the AI in it is the absolutely worst.  But in the other hand when played with friends (with A LOT OF FRIEDS) it is a good game. Player versus player massive multiplayer matches are fun. Their little ing  campaign is not.10
ake arma not war! arma is the best military simulator out there! You will not believe the hours you can throw away at this game while playing the endless multiplayer servers such as life! - in which nothing can compete!!! Grab some friends and join a server only then shal you understand! Brilliant. 9/1010
his game is awesome I have logged more hours into this game than any other game.10
it is a cool game i like it =)
his is my first time playing the Arma series and I must say this game has changed my perspective of military-style FPS games. The realism is phenomenal and it keeps me coming back for more. Huge learning curve when trying to remember all the commands associated to the game which can get frustrating at times but once you get handle on those it's a lot easier. Outside of that this game has something going whether it's the close-to-reality gameplay or all the other mods you can discover or the required teamwork needed to be succesful in crushing your opponent. Hands down my favorite game currently in my library.10
Great game for hardcore gamers cant wait for what more is to come in this game
retty fun but hard to get used to playing after playing Arma 2 OA for so long.10
ohemia’s gone to immense effort to create real immersive environments for . Across two sprawling islands you’ll find all kinds of terrain from salt-flats to forests to stretches of rocky coastline. Even without a directed experience just spawning into those maps is a pleasurable experience letting you explore and discover some amazing virtual places.  is also that rare – these days – game that will push all but the most powerful PC hardware. It looks amazing even on older systems but if you want to crank it up at eye-bleeding resolutions you’re going to see performance loss.  10
after you play this game ones ..you will never play another
Simply Best of its series so far.
Figured out how to use the new firing positions.  Then figured out you could use them to break dance.  10/10
oving this game favorite game type to play is King of the Hill. Highly recommended!10
A lot of fun in general and a whole bunch of awesome mods.
 have been looking for a game like  since I started with shooters. I always thought Call Of Duty or Battlefield 3/4 was the most simulated you could get without really going to war. This game is war. This simulator requires players to really try it is not a run and gun game you do that you die. You need to be tactical aware of your surrondings and be prepared for anything from a fireteam of men to a sniper team to tanks sitting on the hilll line. Everything about this game is amazing. Grapihc are awesome if you can run them on normal or higher the AI and ragdolling could use some work. One con of this game is the AI sometimes there smart sometimes there dumb. They can get hit with a grenade at point blank range break there legs lay down and bandage then get up and run away.    Over all 20/10 would recommend to anyone who wants a good shooting simulator.10
ame is easily wroth the money the story mode keeps you on your toes the online... well what can i say if get tired of one game mode theres lots of other to try then the workshop add that much more to the game A great game wroth the buy!10
Best millitary game sim ever!
ne of the BEST Tactical Shooters on Market! 9.9/10   EDIT: DLC Policy! really ed up! pay'd 60€ for that game now they want 1299 for 2 helicopters?!10
make even less friends than in arma 2 since more people play it and they don't want you on the helecopters even if you promise you'll be nice
nocked a guy out Stole his kidney then sold it for drug money and got arrested.  11/10 would steal a kidney again10
fter 400 hrs playing ARMA3 i find it exciting and challenging the editor is another world on its own then theres muitiplay a whole lot af different roleplay . From police dedicrebel and even sell body parts . I give it a 10 as far as rpg go.10
his is a great military simulator much like ArmA2 but completely improved graphics dialogue etc. The campaign is pretty long and there is also enough scenarios to keep you busy for a good 30+ hours solo but after that there the multiplayer which is 100% more fun with friends. Overall great military simulator.. but it is a SIMULATOR this isn't Call of Duty fellas yes there is bang bang in every mission but it it a simulator (cannot stress enough)! If you want to get the most fun out of this game then you need to role play and not go all CoD style and run and gun everything with 2 legs (save that for multiplayer). Appart from that I had many hours of enjoyment and many more to come!10
I love this game. I transport drugs and sell this for money to buy more drugs :D
Epic: War  battles.Ck#  It Out
ith a 6+ years of gaming.   this is the best game i played hands down.  with a realistic gamepaly and everything.   there is some bugs here and there but let me tell you even these bugs are fun and enjoyable.   i have over 1000 hours of playing this game and i still learn new things about it.  GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!10
good game im just starting to play the story but for some rerason when i try to play on a atlis life server i lag out and get disconnected.
 only play the multiplayer. Addictive and time consuming but worth it. So many map and server style choices to choose from its hard to stick to just one.10
 shot someone they died. 10/1010
 features in comparison to the previous Arma is sustantial. NPCs no longer have extremely odd path finding patterns and animations are much smoother. The recorded voices for commands and such are more lively and smoother. NPC Dialogue or qeued dialoge seems more in-tone with the situation. Command voices for specific objectives run smoothly and actually sound more pleasent. Bohemia Interactive really showed what they can do this time. 5/510
ad Game lots of fun heaps of content.10
promise not doing this for achievement.
another great hit after the Arma 2 from Bohemia Interactive. Great open-world game. Graphics are quite good with the gameplay and game mechanics. Another feature for this game it is a huge target for modders. Contains many fun modes as well many co-op modes and multiplayer modes. One of the more popular is the Battle Royal mod. And also the campain is very interesting. On the other hand the bad things are mostly the optimisation. It's open-world and good graphics come at a heavy price. Takes a good computer to have a full expirience.10
my lav got explode by a tente 10/10
Probably the best modern shooter and sandbox game!  - Minus points for being a bit glitchy sometimes
 have now been playing ARMA3 for a few weeks or months (Time flies when you're having fun) and it is one of my favourite purchases on Steam. I had ARAM2 and AO (then modded Dayz) so i figured Why the hell not.  For the past 5-10 years i have been more so a fan of multi-player gaming over single-player thought i thought to myself i will try this one single first mainly due to the fact i wanted to know how smooth it ran. Graphics up pretty much full played it and had an average framerate more than 30FPS so all is good. I have a little play of single player and start to pick it up. Game looks great. Few Km of open sandbox.Can't complain.  I try joining a server. Stratis Wasteland. 70 players smaller map then the main one. (19.3km or something i think). Spawn in and streight away i head some explosions and firing. Luckily enough on my first go online i managed to take out the two guys firing and loot a vehicle. Nice rifle and a nightstalker scope. I just sat in a bush my sights scimming around and taking out the odd players 1 by 1. Night time comes Change scope to thermals. Beautiful. Hiding up a hill sat in a bush with a thermal scope and another 2 clips if ammo to use. I felt how sadistic i had become. Beautiful.  This was just wasteland mode. However there are many other modes. Altis RP i would say is the most populated. A role play island where a player will need to gain licenses buy weapons vehicles. Basically it's what GTA online would be like. I reccomend picking up some scenarios from the workshop such as Whole lotta altis and whole lotta stratis. as we as some of the mission generators.  If you're amazing at CoD. Don't expect to be amazing at this. This is a real game and does require a lot of skill and thought. No running in expecting to kill 30 in a row.10
Anyone who plays the arma series will love . All the mods you get with it are great and are moving on nicely!!
rma 2 customizability with a better engine this game will be worth it's money through community made games alone10
oved this game from day one now 6 months later i still love it 10
I Strongly recommend getting this game to anyone that has a good PC and enjoys the likes of battlefield and maybe Call of Duty and anyone that has previously owned a AmrA Game
ery fun few FPS issues but they don't effect it in a mayjor way. Community support is great developers listen to bug reports. Very wide varity of game modes.10
I dont even own this game 22/10 its okay :IGN
I cant write reviews but here is an interesting fact: 5 in 4 people dont understand statistics.
This game is one of the best games I have ever played. It beats CoD and Battlefield by a long shot. The only problem I have with this game is that it crashes alot on lap tops :(
Very nice game !
best game ever made i give this game a 11/10  gamemodes that are the best  wasteland a badass action pvp war game mode  Altis life my personal fav. i have my own server wich is going amazing   patrol ops a realism task gamemode  all life gamemodes  so buy this game if you really want to have a great time and meet new ppl from around the world
oming from Day Z standalone this game was a new and exciting transition. This game brings up alot of mixed feelings from my time in military service; but humanizes it all in goofy and offbeat player to player combat. the balistics are pretty on point for small arms and heavier weapons; and the tutorial &amp; story mode can be beneficial to all who are new or experienced. I have never met so many young and old players who cooperate more and utilize military terminology communication direction and land navigation to enhance my total gaming experience. From gathering a stockpile of marijuana on altis life rpg to spotting a target's range for indirect fire or close air support;  has very little in terms of flaws; but it is those small flaws and minor server glitches that add even more to the fun variable.10
Wasted 200 hrs of my life  10/10
If youre looking for a war simulator this is the game it is the best war game i've ever played graphics are amazing and the detail is awesome. it is so easy to get locked into this game i've played this for hours and never got bored great game..  thanks to the makers of this game for making such a realistic war game.
A crazy amount of single and multiplayer content just like arma 2 but way more responsive with some new welcome additions to the already immersive experience. If you like massive battlefields and as close to real life combat this is state of the art!
easons to play arma3: arma rp servers altislife etc Battleroyale Epoch breakingpoint etc  crashed my truck full of cocaine in a random location in the middle of nowhere next to nothing thought all my work was wasted then out of nowhere a dude runs out of a bush repairs my car i tell him i have no money with me but i have coke gave him a bit and he ran away in a random direction  10/10 would crash my car again10
Played 5 mins really good :)
Play on a life server and get yelled at by a 10 year old admin
reat game love it.  Problems with helicopters and its blades might have been updated but still a great game (And car hitpoints are messed so if you ram someone in the back your tires go =/ )10
Wasteland for days son. &lt;3
Very nice and cool game!
Highy advise to get.
10/10 would  again
best military simulation ever
The best ever! Arma Life is my favorite.
orget Battlefield and Call of Duty Arma is as good as it gets when it comes to military based gameplay. The best Army simulation I have played to date with such a wide variety of game modes both modded and vanilla. I highly recommend that you purchase this game if you haven’t done already you won’t regret it.10
Best game NA why you no buy you scrubarino? :D
amazing game. probably my most favourite. worth every penny.
the game sucks really laggy if your on a laptop and other computers
his is one of the best games I have ever played. One of the most realistic military shooters out there. If you get the right mods for this game you can make it even more epic. I recommend you get this game when its on sale though. Oh and by the way all of the glitches and stupid bugs in this game is what makes this game so amazing.10
Realy nice game... a few bad hacks and buggs still out for it but over all very good game
 love this game mods make it way more fun but with out mods its still a very good game10
really good game !
Best PC game.....nough said....
please give me back my time what I spend playing this excellent game :D
reat looking great playing great multiplayer. It's Battlefield just not for babies.10
Awesome Game. Would definitely reccomend
ERE GOING DOWN WE GOTTA JUMP'  is a realistic military shooter based on present day weaponry such as helicopters vehicles and weapons. there is a large single player that can keep you buys for quite a while and all sorts of multiplayer capabilitys. modding is a great thing with this game cause there is so much you can do (ex. epoch arma life) but its not as easy as it is with counter strike. now alot of people also believe that arma 2 was hard to run chunky hard to play but with  they have a auto setup that chooses what it believes the best settings are for your computer and its amazing (i still wouldnt play it on a laptop that isnt built only for gaming but runs great on my $600 desktop. if your looking for a challenge or your the patient sniper who can wait for quite a while to pick of the guy who is wrecking everybody. or the ace pilot who can get in and drop off 6 people in less then 15 seconds and get out. this game is for somebody who is willing to put in the time. or the single player like i said can keep u busy for a while. so finally cons: even with the setting auto-tuner the game can still be kinda laggy and glitchy if you have a low end machine. the game is very hard if you dont like a hardcore game where 3 shots at most will kill you easy then this game can make your rage very well.  pros: very well made great weapons/vehicles the maps and enviroment are large and expansive for large scale war on full servers is amazing to just watch a ground battle sue while aircraft dog it out in the sky and armored apc move towards the city with rienforcement until a guy in a building fires a anti-tank missle and blows it up the smoke and fire rising to the sky on ultra setting while the survivors run for cover in the nearby bushes ontop of the hill and the sniper takes out the man in the building.  so do i recommend this game? yes i do but you got to be willing to put your time into this game or you wont have the same experience as somebody who loves this game and has over 1000 hours on it.10
Absolutely love it!
 can barely go into any server and event then i get kicked from the very start without doing nothing. Host your own vanilla servers bohemia! That game is unplayable!-10
mazing game The desyncs are incredible10
he vanilla unmodded game is honestly pretty awful. It is nothing like A2 where I could still play Vanilla for hours on end.  just feels weird compared to the games that came before it and the lack of familiar weaponry because BIS was too cheap to buy the licenses is terrible.   On the other hand throw some mods on and play MilSim and you have one of the best games created. It is just a shame that weapons mods vehicle mods and countless others are still required for good gameplay when BIS could easily integrate them into the core game and do away with the need.10
ot Kidnapped by a gang called 'ISIS' they forced me to rob a bank with them then took me into the mountains and made me fill up their helicopter with heroin and cocaine. When I was done they got ready to 'sacrafice me for Allah' just as they were about to kill me the police showed up on mass and killed them all. One of the commanders had responded to my desperate texts he gave me some food and a free backpack.  The system works. 10/1010
ven though I only get 15 FPS in a city/town and 30 FPS in the countryside on this game I still think it is one of the best games I have played. It still has some work to be done to it but thats just what the series is like a bit glitchy. Some of the good points are 290km map with no limits its a sandbox so you can do whatever the hell you want and a quite good campaign (well thats what I think). Some of the bad points are that it is quite boring for some people. It can run pretty well on PC's without having a very good Graphics card. (I have a AMD Radeon 7730m 2GB graphics card and a i7 Core in a laptop and i can run the game!) This is one of my favorite games from one of my favorite series and I am glad I brought it.  9/10  If you like sort-of realistic first person shooters then I would recomend you get this game.10
 very fun game to play and meet new people! Recomend it its 8/8 m810
elly happy with . A very good game after Bohemias previous game Arma 2. I like that you can do so much with this game. From WasteLand and King of the hill to Altis Life but there is also more. You can use the workshop now wich is a huge improvement from Arma 2.  Only bad thing in my opinion are the DLCs. I really liked the DLCs from Aram 2 but i wasn't really so happy when i bought the DLC Bundle for .   First DLC: Some Karts no one really cared for maybe a little bit fun on the Role-Playing servers but didn't matter a bit in the War scenarios.   Second DLC: Added TWO Helicopters. They were ofcourse pretty good with one Hueron (Chinook) and one Taurus. But the bad thing is that this DLC costs around 13 euros. For TWO Helis!  Third DLC: Now this DLC is the good one though. The Last 'Marksman' DLC added alot of new weapons such as snipers and LMGs. I really liked these weapons and they are really good.  So for me this game earnes a 8/10  10
onestly i don't recommend paying more than $15 for this game. No ironsights have to completely stand still to change weapons driving is a joke... too much to really name off.10
un tactical interesting war simulator. Variety of online/singleplay gameplay!10
t bleeds awesomeness and oozes excellence.   This game as gotten multiple updates since release and is still very fun. I love Bohemia and love Arma.10
worst game
it has go carts. 10/10
10/10 would die to a nuke again
ure there are bugs many bugs but the bottom line is that  improves in almost every department over the second game. Well worth the dollar.10
ery clunky game not fully optomized yet in my opinion. Requires a very high end PC and also requires DLC to play on most servers.10
This game smells.
I would recommend this game! But do not run any cheat programs for other games while yuo have this one. I was battleye banned for running a trainer for Wargame Red dragon. I always played this game with friends! Need a good pc to run this though. I played over 1000+ hours in this game until banned.
Fun simulator game with mods such as wasteland great game!!!!
Brilliant game 10/10
ood graphics good game! SIGN ME UP!10
Kids play Cod Boy play battlefield Men Play ARMA
10/10 will ruin your life.
est game ever (y) worth money for this  i recommend to you guys buy this game :D10
ltis Life DayZ Wastelands and a great singleplayer worth the cash 10/1010
Absolutley Brilliant Game!
t's realistic in terms of graphics and gameplay. Lots of different game modes/mods which give the game a broad spectrum thus catering for any type of player. DayZ players would enjoy it.10
 is fun if you have friends to play it with. plus thiers a wide vairity of mods such Breaking Point that can enhance your arma experiance. Buy it on sale and Have fun!
Incredible game. Looks amazing and is lots of fun. I would reccomend a very good graphics card. i have a MSI GTX 760 OC gaming and it is capable of running the most settings on very high with about 25-30 fps.
so you like fast playing games? Do you like simple games? Do you like games where you can kill everyone you see?  If you answered yes than this is not the game for you!  This is a game for someone that wants to feel like he is in a real war. Here you don't shoot if you don't have to you don't have action around every connor and you have to think through every your action.  BEST GAME EVER!!! (Just a little laggy for me so I don't play it anymore.... :(.... )10
 great step forward from Arma II Arma III is a beautiful military simulator with infinite possibilities! There are hundreds of things you can do in this game no matter what your taste and more are being added every day with the steam workshop.   This is a must-have game for anyone who enjoys a good military shooter however bear in mind this is an ARMA game! There WILL be desync and there WILL be other quirky bugs related to the physics engine! All-in-all though I believe the fun that can be had in this game FAR out weigh the small problems that you will find.  I HIGHLY recommend this game!10
Best game ive ever played.
Buggy and not even worth the discounted price. I wish I could get a refund.
has its downfalls yes but certainly has its high points too. I have found a group of people to play with on weekends and it is an absolute blast. Singleplayer is fun too there are good scenarios to find on the workshop and screwing around with zeus is a good time10
This game is awesome!!!
Best Milsim i know so far 10/10 would play it everyday
xceptional. 10/10  Pros: -Moddability -The game sounds amazing with mods (JSRS Dragonfyre Blastcore Phoenix TPW) -Much easier to play than ArmA 2 -Mobility and voice acting is much more fluid. You no longer walk like a tank. -The community (for  the way it was meant to be played not the mods for it) is untarnished. -Simulator for many things. With further refining (mods) it could be a good armored combat/flight sim. -The game by itself looks absolutely gorgeous on ultra. The models are high-poly the materials are great. With graphical mods (which aren't even needed) this game can unfathomably good which is impressive for RV3. -Open world multiple game modes and modifications available. -Mods give you ability to install maps instead of the CoD tactic of DLC map packs. -Zeus feature allows for dynamic scenario creation/multiplayer fun -Singleplayer content is massive. -Easy to create modifications -Combined arms modification is in depth and great.   Cons: -Unless you have a relatively top of the line computer good luck running it on ultra. -Single thread usage is exceptionally poor with this game much like ArmA 2 -DayZ community ruined the image of ArmA and its associates. -Children often play DayZ or Altis life or whatever have you. These kids go onto other servers (milsim/armored combat) and transfer the cancer of those communities to pure ArmA. -While bugs have been ironed out many still do manifest themselves (often hilariously) -AI is still either really overpowered or really useless and dumb.  TLDR: get the game10
It...Is..AMAZING
ood Game Hours of fun and hilarious times in multiplayer10
Best FPS on the market.
Find server. Altis Life. Buy car. Call police. Allahu Akbar. Bans from server. 10/10 would do it again.
What an amazing game. It's looks stunning when you run it on the highest settings. This game is also recommended to play with friends and skype.
best game. cause theres no other words to describe this.
 recommend playing Dayz first as the community taught me all the tips and tricks about playing Arma or an Arma based mod. When I first picked up  even after staring at the config screen I was still confused and got stuck repeatedly. With Dayz it kinda progresses you from how to change from first person to third shooting then figuring out how far your target is away so you can compensate for it. Arma doesnt really teach you that right away thats way I was lost. Also the campaign in arma (what ive played of it) is pretty cool aswell as the multiplayer but its big hitter is definetly the mods. Battle Royal Atlas Life theyre all great and super fun as well as the community. I definetly recommend you get this game as there are endless posibilities.10
If you are looking for military sim with all aspects of warfare there is simply no other choice.
ne of the best games in my library do I have to explain myself it's Arma!10
Without the modding community this game would be useless... Long live modders
Great game and a must buy for in the summer sale!!
Very fun and enjoyable game I would recommend a lot.
is brilliant but the Linux release of the game is still on v1.42 with the Windows release on v1.5 I cannot play on any multiplayer servers :/ 10/10 once they support updates to the Linux client10
ossibly one of the best realistic military games I've played with many features to add a lot of realism as well as it's endless in-game editor to make your own scenarios. Over 800 hours I've played is saying something (lol) and additionally with the help of the amazing modding community the game can be easily adapted to anything from spec ops to city life.10
The millatary experince gives intence awsomeness
retty good game to play altis wasteland in when you have friends to play it with10
 is the best game i own must bye
This Game is for the type of people who have patience
This game is sick
Great game overall with a great modding community!
A very good simulation and game. So many things to! good buy if u like these sort of games!
0/10 best game ever if you like getting destroyed by a plane that drops bombs on your base.10
The best game on steam
reat game a lot of different game modes. Great for multiplaying10
My favourite game so far! Looking forward to Arma 4 if thats gonna be a thing.. Hope it is!  Pure Awesome! 10/10 game - Teethed Goose studios
lright I'm not a professional game reviewer and I probably never will be. So let's delve deep into what makes Armed Assault 3 Such a great game.  *   PROS      Gunplay - The weapons in this game seem liked they were worked on vigourously from the sway the bullet drop to even how the wind effect the trajectory of your round overall this function gets a 10/10 from me.    Vehicles - Most of the vehicles are futuristic as the game takes place in the early 2030's. But that's not a bad thing while 1 or 2 of the vehicles seem to be indestructible with terrain most are well balanced to the rest of the military style vehicles now... Civilian vehicles... those are a completely different story hit a bush... you're on fire roll over a pebble goodbye wheel. This is probably because the developers didn't expect you to use civi vehicles 100% of the time. This function gets an 8/10 from me.    Helicopters &amp; DLC - The base Helicopters... Those are a hoot fun to use manueverable and extremely deadly in the right hands. Now... Let's get into the infamous DLC that people seem to be disliking. Yes it is a purchasable DLC thing but let's be honest most games are doing this style of marketting nowadays and with the new APEX DLC it basically added an entirely new game into  the Helicopter DLC adds new ways to transport materials and mechanized infantry to the frontlines and the marksman DLC added new weaponry to accomadate the exteremely low amount of DMR style weapons the Karts DLC... Well... that was just a mess.   Based Helis - 9/10     Overall DLC- 9/10      CONS      CPU Intensive   [/b] Yes this game is extremely CPU intensive if you don't have a relatively decent CPU you will struggle to run on even the lowest settings this is something the devs must've looked past but seeing as the strongest GPU's back when they made the game was somewhere around 4-8gb on high end it was only wise to run your CPU which would've been cheaper on the player and less work for BI. 10
Very good game has very good graphics and very good game play and very good shoot outs. I really recommend this game to everyone
the sickest stuff
his game is amazing always something to do and wll always amuse you. always a chance to make new friends as well. very good game overall10
ne. Engage that man. Half a klick.' 'Oh no. One is down. Fall back.' Has some fish A.I too. 11
This game is absolutely terrible!  i am not abe to lone wold objectives like a badass so thats lame  the ai keep blowing my head off for some reason   and i dont like walking   1/10 would not bang
briefcase flung me in air n kill me 11/10 wud buy again
Najs game with good fjetures swenglish
Great game! Once your done with the single player there is an insane amount of mods and modes to play.   Some of the DLC is over priced or otherwise not worth buying.
can i use the xbox controller adapter with this
 had  for ages before i got into it and discovered a gamemode i liked and i could have easily wrote a really bad review about it because i just found it confusing and didn`t know what to actually do. One day I decided to research the game a bit and once you find some gamemodes and servers you enjoy this game is amazing. The trick is deciding what to do with it because Arma has no pre defined style it has so many gamemodes. Once you find something you enjoy it is one of the best games out there. Graphically it is a masterpiece and it runs like a dream on a half decent build but it is probably too intesive for lower end systems. I strongly suggest you do your research to ensure you can run Arma before you buy it. There is a huge and active community on this game and there so many different ways to have fun. You can even basically turn it into a flight simulator if you want to. My favorite gamemodes have been TDM and Altis Life but i know there are hundreds of other gamemodes to try and you are basically buying loads of games if you buy Arma. The maps are detailed and varied and most imporantly for certain gamemodes large! Just to top it off there are even more downloadable ones. The game is well optimised and i originally came here from DayZ as Bohemia have never disappointed me yet. I 100% recommend this game to anyone looking for an amazing shooter that fills the hole left by shooters like CoD and Battlefield that have sadly gone south in my opinion. This game is fun to play alone but even better with friends. Well worth the money and definitely deserves a place in your steam library!10
its lots of money for shure but graphics are up to date and sound so yeah i recommend :D
Its grate
get the mod  life and it 10/10
This game has taken away hours of my life. I hate my life so this game is great. 10/10
t's one of the best realistic military shooters out there with unlimited potentional from mods and custom servers. The game is absolutely great one of the best I've ever bought. However a decent gaming computer is needed to run above 30 FPS. Definitely recommend to anybody!10
idn't even launch multiplayer once and I am banned. Battleye - The Anticheat Gold Standard-10
asily the most fun game I have ever played. Hands down. There is literally nothing you can't do with this game. Wanna play stock? OK. Like Zombies? Theres a MOD for that. Wanna make your own missions? There a MOD for that. More weapons? MOD. Like other people? Multiplayer. Hate other people? Solo. Wanna RP? There are servers for that.   Damn this game just has everything!10
he game has the weirdest control setup. Just a small thing like chosing which sight to use requires you to press or double tap a modifier key then the aim key in a special order. Why not just do it like every other game that uses guns? It's also horribly optimized. I can play Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline with 120+ fps but this game struggles to get over 50 fps in the cities with all settings on low/off. And running it on those settings makes it about as pretty as Quake 2 from 1997. I don't understand the hype about this game. Seems the exact same game as Americas Army that I played 8-10 years ago and with low settings it pretty much also looks the same. Avoid unless you really know that you want it for some odd reason.-10
ude this game is soo fun with barrel rolls explosions en grenades you can really play with anything GUNS to Hilicopters in a REALISTIC way! perhaps even TANKS 'n stuff i was always a fan of this type of games...  Fun to play with friends would recommend.   MUST HAVE GAME 11/1010
his Game is probably the best game ive ever owned and yes i have low hours cuse this is my second account I have about 700+ hours total! but i gotta say if youre pc isent good youre gonna have a predy bad time :(11
eats ARMA 2 and it's much smoother. Graphics are nice and will hold up for quite a while in the coming future. Only regret is that the DLC's are kind of  but workshop support makes up for it.10
ou know the funny thing is This game is becoming a money horder. Apex is 34 Dollars. Orignal game is 40 Dollars. Apex isent half of the game... Yet it is more than half of the price. *Facepalm* Dont reccomend buying this OR Apex till a sale...-10

f your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter white sugar brown sugar water cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the crust is golden brown the caramel on the top crust is set and the apple filling is bubbling 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.10
eems good so far.  jk best game ever. Defenetly worth buying. 11/10!11
a combined arms military simulator Is without a doubt in my mind one of the most versitile and diverse games I have ever played. One week I will be role-playing with my buddies as police officers the next week I am hunting for charlie in south Vietnam and when you get bored there is always something new and different to be discovered in the workshop. In my 700+ hours of playing  I have met some great friends and discovered entire communities centered around the game and i love it all!   Bohemia interactive really hit the nail on the head with this one.10
spent 708 hours on this game. wasted 17 full days of my life. That's 24480 minutes. 10/10 would play again.
COOL BUT APEX IS TOO EXPENSIVE!(
very fun to play with your friends wish it would come to consoles
 is an awesome game! Players are young self serving short fused millenials but its still A must buy! but dont speak your mind on chat or you will be phantomly banned by men with no boezack to tell you there thoughts b4 doing so. there will be 5000000000000 servers but only 3 to join since latency sucks and everyone is a sheeple and plays some life role play mod garbage. i have 25mb a sec consistant download speeds and run it on minimal settings so internet and graphics is not the issue. so be wary of the bans is all i can say since there is no forgive policy on any server that i know. Dont be as mad as i am right now when ur banned for not installing some garbage communication software the admins want you to download from 3rd party insecure site! or for not lining up with the rest of the tools with no life on 1 of you 3 possible servers your able to play the vannilla game in! Happy Gaming :)
10/10 would 9/11 again!
k so I got this game for the free weekend been interested a while and was in the mood to buy it if I liked it as a few of my friends have it.  Visually very nice. Except the frame rate. I am familiar with computers so I tweaked a little and gained a few frames but still 17-21. Poor. I find the gameplay a bit clunky for a FPS it almost feels like Space Engineers :/ There is very little visual information and rather a lot of buttons to remember. Ok no problem. Ill work it out? Still cant work out how to jump (if its even possible).  Constantly plagued by slow loading times and awkward playstyle (this is just on the Prologue missions) im really not impressed. Driving. What the actual F* is going on there? Ok so WASD is accel/steer. But you need to press a button for free look press a button to go faster or slower...while the mouse does nothing. I have a controller thought 'this must be better' but its set up for left handers by default? I couldnt find where to change it either. Left stick to Accel/brake? Right stick to steer? For crying out loud.   I finished the prologue and tried to play...but play what? Navigation for starting a free server so I could just get used to the game is awful dont even know how I ended up in some empty world with 'Zeus' and NOTHING! Nothing. A gun grenades but no objective waypoint map reference vehicle or even building nearby. Just a frustrating experience overall.   Not even considering buying this game even for the reduced price. It is advertised to be able to run on my Rig although it is just above the reccomended specs so i didnt expect 60+fps all the time but barely 20 is frankly unplayable considering that is Idle listening to the prologue instructions.   AMD Phenom II x4 955 BE @ 3.8Ghz GTX 560 Ti 1GB OCII 8GB RAM Dont laugh I get 60 on high on GTAV 60 on ultra on Elder scrolls space and medieval engineers Truck Sim Stranded Deep...hell even ARK: Survival Evolved plays better. That is a very low standard to be compared with let alone be worse than.   For those about to tell me to tweak my this and that...I already have my computer tweaked to the absolute pinnacle of optimisation AFAIK and im not too keen on having to write parts of the game myself unless im going to be getting royalties? Or maybe just a hefty discount. This isnt even Early Access but boy it feels like it.   Will I play it again? Maybe I might give it another whirl before the free weekend passes but as I said before I am not likely to be buying this unfinished under optimised terribly interfaced game. Looks fun but its not worth buying in this state. It wasnt even worth the 2 hours it took to download at this point.  Sorry Bohemia but poor show. Anything with a 3 after its name should be better optimised at the very least.-11
aintball simulator  I make shooting in real life and I can tell you this game is not realistic at all. The accuracy of guns here is so ridiculous it is like paintball. Seems like devs have not understand that the first bullet of a gun is always accurate but it's the next (when it get heat and make expansion of the metal) that become less and less accurate the more you continue the burst of gun fire. The breathing control is also totally wtf. In real life the longer you stop your breathing the more your aim is moving (because your muscle get less oxygen and start to shiver). In the game this is totally the reverse of reality the more you stop your breathing the less your aim move... Well ok let's just say the character you control is kind of robotic stuff different as a human.   Then there is the sound. Did some one just threw gravel ? Nop this is some body who've just shoot in your direction with a fire rifle :o The last crazy thing is bullets are so slow you can see them!!! Ahahah made my day!!! But this will not restrain me to unsinstall the game. The driving of engine is pretty realistic I've to admit. Angry military screaming on you is also.-11
0/10 is a DANK game with tons of content.  PROS- is fun CONS- is hard to run even with a 960 -NEEDS AN FOV SLIDER it is impossible to play it always feels zoomed in it hurts my eyes and breaks my heart that a big game like this does not have an FOV slider  ALSO-  This game is not realistic like the game advertised it  Theres no exo jumps 360 no scopes MLG Achievements or killstreaks11
ard to run fun to play.11
WARNING: playing this game can cause PTSD and other severe mental diseases such as nightmares flashbacks anxiety and depression. If you start feeling first symptoms seek for professional help immediately.11
bug free
If you have a decent computer and are into the military field or the roleplay field of games this is perfect for you. With arma you either love it and get addicted to it and the proceed to try and force feed it to your friends to make them love it too or you absolutely hate it and want nothing to do with it whatsoever. I have gotten way more than my moneys worth out of this game and I would highly reccomend it.
gt;Buy game Play Altis Life RPG Buy Car Buy Gun Park at the front of the PD' Oink rapidly Get chased Pull over Get tased Picking up soap for 5-10mins  I play most the game modes the modding on this game is great. If you have good interwebs buy this game.11
i was in the army for about 17 yaers and I have to say  is completely unrealistic. I failed a mission for killing a civilian even though he was brown. 0/0
If you enjoy a immersive experience you will enjoy . Whether you are traveling thew Nam hoping there is no one hiding in a bush or you are traveling threw altis hoping not to be robbed by a creeping terrorist. If its your forte you will be evading police in the city of lakeside transporting your thousands of pounds of meth back and forth from your lab to your drug dealer. There is a mod or server for every person who is apart of the PC master race.

9/11 WAS A INSIDE JOB
ne of the best games i ever played! The optimization is really bad but still enjoyable11
Can't run on Intel HD 4600 with i7 4 cores haswell at all with 8gb.
This game is very fun I recommend playing with friends and getting the game on sale. 10/10
Best Game ever. If you're looking for a realistic shooter come here.
Great game feels like a simulation Super Realistic!!
Great game.
lmost sold my virginity for this game luckily my dad took it first11
The ten step guide to play  Step 1: Start up game Step 2: Pick Loadout Step 3: Find vehicle Step 4: Take twenty minutes to drive to objective. Step 5: Arrive at objective. Step 6: Get killed a minute later. Step 7: Repeat step 3 - 6 Step 8: Repeat Step 7 another six or so times Step 9: Repeat steps 3-5 before you realise that the objective has been completed. Step 10: Repeat Steps 3 - 9 and soon enough you might actually achieve something in this game.
ALL DAY EVERYDAY  + Enters Server + Guy ask me to cook weed or he kills me + 2 hours later  + He leaves + 25 mins later  + im not cooking  + he finds me  + and says cook for me peasent + i say 'no' + and he decides to give me a hello kitty car  BEST GAME 10/10 would play again  Btw: I need a graphics card
is a very immensely amusing game. I mainly play Altis life and i have got to say it has the best graphics ive ever seen in a game it almost look like a on-going movie.  is a military Training Simulation (Milsim). Anyone who liked Arma 2 will like this and anyone who haven't played Arma 2 will like this and yes that wasn't a typing error. I would most definitely recommend this game to someone who don't currently have the game because it is really realistic where there would be realistic actions that need to be taken. I have also persuaded a couple of my mates to get it.  But... There is once downfall of this game You need a high-end computer to handle it which is ok for me but might not be ok for someone who wants the game but has a Mid or Low end computer. And yes if you want to run this game off a Laptop then you will need a very expensive on that can handle it.  All in all i would recommend this to anyone that own or have a high-end computer.11
The best game so far
here to start  Firstly it is highly recommended you aquire a chunky PC before tempting to play this game it has bad optimized servers and has had since release Secondly this game is for the quite experienced players such as myself not boasting at all it takes some time to get into the game and also to get use to the controls as there is ALOT of keys which are used. Finally i highly recommed this game due to its character customization and aswell as the combat movement its very realistic when it comes to that until you see the damaging its quite weak with the weaponary other than that this game is very well made just needs some more tweaking to make it what it is seen to be.  Rating: 9.8/1011
hile driving down the road minding my own buisness this guy starts shooting at me. I proceed to run him over. I got out and dragged his now critically injured body behind a rock so he can slowly bleed out. As he cusses me out on mic a member of his squad blows us all up with a rocket.  11
Famous last words: 'Is that a grena-'
f your social life sucks then this is also the game for you be prepared to spend more hours than you wanted on this game.  Word of WARNING  After developing a small network of friends (And PTSD) you will spend excessive time playing this product that has been placed upon the Pc Master Race for the good of humanity please occasionally sleep.11
prety col game
ikes: scale graphics visual realism detail immersion Dislikes: poorly optimized tacky script and cliche dialogue awkward soldier controls price for a two year old game  -11
GET THIS GAME!!!!!! 10/10
layed a little was OK...11
 have been playing  for quite a while now and thought I might share my thoughts on it for those planning to buy it.  is a great game and with the massive amounts of community addons it never stops delivering something new. If you wan't to run around and kill other players in a massive bloodbath you can do that on the King of the hill(KOTH) mission If you wan't to run around and role-play as a civilian in a deprived country you may do that also on Altis/Stratis life and last but not least If you wan't to fight AI in a team of players you can do that also there are many missions for this gameplay.  What I am trying to say is that I have been playing this game for a long time 1700+ hrs and I am not bored yet. If I am not bored of this game yet then that is saying something. The game is definetly worth buying and it will always be so in my eyes. Thank you to those great people that made this game! :D11
Flying boats and many glitches i give it 9/11 Allahu akbar
 got in a helicopter they flew me to the government base. They had guns I didn't. I followed them when all of a sudden what I realised was a goverment helecopter crashes just up ahead of me in the centre. I approach to see what I can scavenge I touch it and die.  10/1011
is like anal Hard and painful but you'll get used to it.11
ids play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield Men play ArmA.  Even though I'm not what you would considered a 'man' yet ArmA is the best FPS Tactical Shooter simulation/sandbox I have ever played.11
niped a copilot at 1000m then was lining up a shot to kill the pilot got kicked for inactivity.  Best experience 10/10 would get kicked again.11
Good to the point of?  Entry.  How do install?  6/10.
Got kidnapped he told me to lick his balls i did he gabe me a gun out of trust he killed me in a gun fight 10/10
Most realistic game since bad rats.  10/10
very soothing game would buy for my nan
Travis Scott's newest album really dosn't stay true to his original style and has more of a Hip-Pop feel than Hip-Hop
This is THE best military simulation game out there!
wesome multiplayer action. This team-work based game is incredibly immersive and makes you feel like a real soldier. With tons of weapons and vehicles to use and take out your enemy this game is definitely worth the money. It's like Arma 2 but less buggy and so much more enjoyable!10
Rabbits can open doors. Hell yeah I'd recommend this game.
an exelent military simulator i recommend to anybody who likes the military.10
f you have a interest in military similation then this game is for you. A wide range of options for the community and mods as well. However it does have optamization issues. So unless you have a great PC just accept you are going to get 20 frames or less online.10
Grate game for teamwork!!
est game ever so mutch variaty and so mutch realism i get so emursed in the milsim10
Killed by puhed the car 10/10 The best game ever+Best texture . Buy it !!!!!
f you like getting killed in one shot and not knowing where you got shot from you will like this game!10
ery moddable lots of workshop content it really brings this game alive!10
arma is gta 5 call of duty battlefield combined its defently worth it.unless you are a poor freakin noob you poor noob
ing  terribly unoptimised like 20 fps with gtx970
his game is the worst game i have ever played i had the game and it uninstalled itself and then took 4 months to download ( totally not my wifi) and it is very annoyinh having to download all of the ING mods so over all 10/10 great game must buy.10
It's amazing how many memes can make their way into a milsim
If like simulation military ganes this one is for you you can fly a jet thru a wall and not die you can also get shot by a rocket dierectly in the chest and not die BEST SIM GAME EVER
retty well game. The singleplayer is nice... but well all know that is not what this game is for.  Multiplayer is the backbone of Arma you can go from playing out actual scenarios to just tring to make a living making and selling drugs or metals on a altis life server. Zombies for Arma are getting better but this is just a opinion.10
run in arma die in arma repeat  9/10 game needs to add gambling
The Best Game!!!
o uh. a3 right? you have a good computer? aight. you have some patience? aight. get the game and download 25 gb and then download another 5~10 gb to play exile. play exile - find a way to force yourself through wooden and steel walls and eventually cause a major update in exile. play exile more - find a way to make yourself invisible and kill the entire server from 5000+ meters away because youre sitting in the back of a lada on everyone elses screen eventually cause a major update to exile. play exile even more - find a way to make mad money by duplicating literally 20000 weapon supressors and sell them using an autoclicker and your amazing skill at being afk. the autoclicker crashes the server and kicks everyone (but you). the server goes down for 5 days - causes another major exile update.  in my time playing a3 + exile i feel like ive helped the community a lot by breaking . youre welcome.11
 love this game. Has a few Optimization Issues. But that wont stop you from playing this game.  I rate this as much as i rate my Favorite bathroom. I rate my Bathroom a 10/10 Would  again. I Rate this game a 10/10. Definiatally a keeper.10
1650+ hours and I still fall in love with  all over again when I play a well executed mission.
12/23 history
Really fun. Much better with friends. 9/10
It's class
By far one of the best games i think i have played :D would recommend!
This game will ruin my life :)
t's a great game. It looks beautiful.   But I can't use a sniper rifle unless I pay another 12 dollars.  Helicopters? 12 dollars.  Apex? 35 more dollars there.   I like the game but I wanted to be a sniper and I hate being nickled and dimed.  If you got the money and don't mind that get it.   I however mind.    -11
espite the great eye for detail the animated character and the beautiful landscape this game definately does not earn a 'thumbs up'. The main reason for this is because the game is full of crashes. This evening is as one of the many others where I wanted to join arma but I couldn't all I did was just scavenge the weirdest websites in order to find ways to get around the crashes that I stumble upon while joining servers. I am at the point of thinking Bohemia doesn't even care about how well  runs anymore: even on high-end game pc's fps never reaches higher than 50 in cities it keeps on crashing and there is a lot of other weird stuff such as sudden deaths due to rocks in-game or hostile stairs while walking over them.  I love to play the game but the game just won't let me. -1-11
FT-2: Fight For The Territory PLAYERUNKNOWN’s Battle Royale ........... i go to continue to explore great experience of arma!
f you came here to see a review on  you came to the wrong place  A noose can be used as a scary yard decoration during Halloween or to improve your fishing or boating experience. If you're using the noose for decoration know the law before proceeding—some states consider displaying a noose to be threatening and have made it illegal. If you want to know how to make a noose follow these steps.   Place the rope on a flat surface in the shape of the letter 'C.' Find a durable rope that is at least three feet long.  Form an 'S' shape with the rope. Leave the lead of the rope (the bottom part of the 'S') long so that you can tie it to something when you've made the noose.  Compress the 'S' shape. Compress the 'S' shape until all three rows of rope are nearly on top of each other with only a few inches in between them.  Pinch the three lines of rope together in the middle. Pinch them tightly until the ends fan out to create a bow-tie effect.  Take the top of the original 'C' and wrap it around the pinched space. Wrap it from the right side to the left leaving about three to four inches of the rope unwrapped. You should be left with a loop and a string on the left end and just a loop on the right end of the 'bow tie.'  Poke the end of the rope through the top of the loop left by the 'S'.   Pinch the coiled part of the rope. Use your thumb to hold down the short piece of rope that you just worked through the loop on the left-hand side so it bends over the loop.  Pull the loop on the right-hand side of the bow until it closes the loop on the left. If this part of the loop begins to pull on the free rope instead of the loop pull on the other side of the bow.  Adjust the noose. Adjust the noose until the coils look nice and tight and the loop is the size you wanted.11
et's see where I can go with this review.  My overall rating: 8.0  Individual ratings:  Gameplay: 7.0 Graphics: 9.5 Single player: 7.0 Multiplayer: 8.5  Okay so let's start with gameplay.  The gameplay of this game is great. Although the game could use more vehicles the game itself feels modern realistic and immersive. You can have a handful of scenarios to test your skills in or you can jump into user made missions. Both which do the job well. Although the former is limited the latter is not and there can be a large number of missions available on the workshop for you to enjoy.  The weapons and vehicles feel great to handle when using peripherals such as wheels or flight sticks and the HUD is easy on the eyes. It looks very neat so information is organized nicely. You can adjust this to your liking too. No HUD? No problem.  'So why did you rate this 7.0 if you liked it so much?'  One thing spoils this game - frame rate issues. No matter how I play the game the frame rate drops frequently and can be very annoying. I've tried everything to get it to work but nothing changes. Once this is fixed this will jump up to 8.5. Only other suggestions are minor improvements such as a larger variety of controls for vehicles and fixing the free camera.  Graphics are next and when I maxed out the settings the game looked beautiful. The models were smooth the textures were sharp. There wasn't many graphics glitches and you could control the graphics in a variety of ways. I like this a lot. I think the planes should have a larger variety of camouflages but that's about it. I already mentioned how the HUD looks clean so I won't mention that again. The environmental effects look nice too such as rain and night. This is my favourite part about Arma games; although the gameplay is nice the graphics draw me in more. It's a cool touch.  Single player: A lot of workshop mods as well as a good variety of base missions. Nothing to dislike. However campaigns shouldn't be dependant on DLC. I don't know about you but I think the Apex DLC is overpriced. That's my opinion though. VR or Virtual Reality (a mode in Arma where you can test out weapons and vehicles) is cool too good for comparing weapons.  Multiplayer: if you don't find yourself in a game full of trolls and team killers the game can be very co operative. Domination servers are my favourite because it's good to have to adapt to different scenarios. For example taking out AA CAS comes in enemy reinforcements come in so you need to hit a radio tower to stop reinforcements. Things like that. Great with friends too. However I've had some bad experiences with some ARMA admins (I got banned permanently because I was apparently cheating all I did was run from a truck to the BLUFOR base) but this shouldn't put you off the other servers where admins are decent.11
t's not been easy to come to a final solution whether this review should be positive or negative.  First of all I'd like to say that the game itself is really awesome. You get the real feel of combat with a good amount of realism and so on.  Pros: - Catchy gameplay - Tons of different gamemodes (Community servers ect.) - Improving your skills takes time but you learn as the time flies by. - Really fun with others  Cons: Well with all the pros being said there's only one thing that makes me downvote this game. The DLCs. Yep there are DLCs and there are many of them. With only the base game I often find myself unable to use half the helicopters since I need the DLC for that and the DLC for that. 3/4 of the weapons in the game are also DLC. You can however still use them but your screen gets overlayed with notifications that you're using premium content. Call me cheap but as a person with a fairly big collection of games on Steam I feel like the DLCs for this game are too expensive.-11
Best realistic game evah :D
I bought the game and all the DLC for $80 My game crashes ten minutes after I join a server.   Best ten minutes of my life   10/10
Still dont know how to shoot a rocket launcher  11/10
Amazing game with so many different ways to play.  You can be a part of a tactical realism squad.  You can just play king of the hill for fast paced action.  There are lots of mods that you can play like battle royale and breaking point.  Only bad point is the multiplayer can run badly.
It's Ok.
Perfect game 5/7
PEX DLC BROKE THE GAME....  BASICLY YOU BETTER BUY WHAT DLC COMES OUT OR YOUR GAME BREAKS  DAYZ ISNT WORTH IT DON'T DO IT!!-11
This game is crap similar to the steam refund support!
I find the mechanics of this game to be incredibly hard to master. i have played this game for over 100 hours and im still unbelievably horrible at it. its a simple process getting into the game however. simply plug in your N64 controller and try not to tap a wall with your hatchback.
his game is just amazing so much content for the price. Definitely worth the buy :P11
Pros: - mods - looks good  - mods - some more mods  - a mod that's more finished than Day Z - mods  cons:  - so many damn mods   11/10 would download another TB of mods
he game is absolute garbage. I thought it would be fun I guess not. Stick with Arma 2: Operation Arrow Head if you want better experience!-11
You can shoot fish while scuba diving. 11/10 Best Call of Duty
hey did some cool things in this game dont get me wrong. (2000+ hours ARMA 2)  The MASSIVE ISSUE that I have with this game is they have put in DLC (go figure more band wagon devs). But its not so much that they are charging an outrageous price for the DLC its the fact that they water mark your screen to the point that its not fun to play. As if that didnt get their point across before you can quit the game your in you are forced to look at an advertisement for their DLCs that you cant skip and will be unable to leave your game until its finished.  Very very poor model for doing business and I will never buy another game from this company.  The mods make this game what it actually is. Which are developed for FREE from the community.-11
ant recommend this game. you'd think bohemia would of learnt from arma 2 but its still just as buggy poorly optimized and probs wont get fixed. they will just release an arma 4.    game is great dont get me wrong. but the game is ruined by the completely poor performance!-11
Wasteland is the only reason I play.
 was all like hey  me right my PC can run this. Apparently it ing can't and i can barely squeeze out 25 fps in towns which infact makes it way more cinematic so thats good. Hey i mean keep being autistic on RP servers tho thats actually all you can do in this game.11

This game is a must get for milltary shooter lovers. There is an editor and can even get mods for it like Garys mod. This is great and I think that anyone can use this game. Also great story.
A game where the mods are more impressive than the actual DLC and gameplay.
on't buy this piece of .   The campaign is still bugged years after the game got out. Too many bugs and just annoying little things to be bothered playing it through. There is still a bug in place that prevents you from entering a boat and thus advancing with the campaign. The NPCs are often slow and hinder your progress. I found myself waiting for 15 minutes just for the idiots to catch up with me. I've restarted missions at least 5 times because some events just wouldn't trigger making me stuck.  The optimization is a joke. It's laggy as . Especially in multiplayer where changing your settings doesn't mean jack  because the server bottlenecks the fps (??!!).  You're basically forced to buy the DLCs. Most of the servers have DLC guns which you can't use unless you buy the said DLC which makes the game kinda pay to win. Being forced to buy DLCs when you've already paid the full price is a ing disgrace.  you Bohemia-11
love the game such realism
There are so many mods for this game that is A LOT of fun! Pay full price for it and it is still a bargain! Best PC game I ever bought!
ussian tested Putin approved. Needs more Russian mods though.11
I shot a man because I wanted his civ clothes.
....  .....Where to start.... I dont know.... .....So i wont....
ou can go through an entire firefight use all your ammo and not once see the enemy   -11/10 would desync again11
uggy annoying and laggy  srry but its to much :/-11
This game has everything.
ousin lets go bowling!11
I've never played this game before.
he best part about this triple a milsim is that right when you're fully immersed in an all out war with your comrades in multiplayer [I.E KOTH] if you're driving behind a tank and you're in a truck usually right when you render in the capture zone you're absolutely anally destroyed by frame loss which causes this magical thing in arma called desync and then the tank in front of you also loses frames so it ING RUBBER BANDS BACK AND FORTH LIKE THE  SECOND COMING IS UPON US AND ABSOLUTELY ING DESTROYS YOUR  BY HITTING YOU GOING 238021129037120 KM/H AND YOU BURST INTO A ING ARMAgeddon AND YOUR CARCASS GOES ING FLYING OUT OF YOUR KAZAKHSTAN TRUCK AND RUINS ALL YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS IN HAVING FUN    yeah i'd give it a recommend pretty solid game11
 don't know what to write because there is so much stuff to do in this game so I write this.11
o I decide to join an  Altis Life server cause ya know for funs and such. I join in get some free money that they give you in the bank to start off and begin to walk out of said bank when I see around 3 guys in masks with full on assault rifles run in... . So I proceed to run away from them further into the bank and around 3 minutes later they fish my  out of there and say that they won't kill me but only if I join them. If not they'll rob me and take me as hostage. Well considering such an offer money or death I thought to myself eh.  it. 2 hours later I'm one of them. We end up high-jacking a lamborghini looking car and decide to sell it to this one guy who put in a request for one. We sell it to him then proceed to mug him and rob him entirely for around 25K then drug him kidnap him take his clothes and then leave him naked in the middle of a giant forest with both legs shot out DayZ style. All is well until about 2 hours later and the same dude comes in with a group of 4 more bodyguards shoot us up in a drive by rob us for all we've got as we're dying and then leave us to die on the side of a road. All this within the time lapse of about 4 hours.  If you hadn't already guessed this game is ing awesome. The game is VERY realistic and it takes actual brains and game-sense to know how to win a Battle Royale. It's not like a game like H1Z1 where you can just get a lucky spawn get some weapons and call it GG. Instead the game is made for a more realistic approach to where a guy who knows how to use a very small and weak pistol can outsmart and beat a guy with one of the more stronger AR's in the game. Teamwork is crucial in a game like this so when you do operations with other players you have to make sure to communicate with one another. Give callouts provide cover fire if a teammate is running to a more advantageous point or trying to advance on an objective or such. See a teammate who's gotten his leg shot out and is crawling on the floor unable to walk? Go and heal em if you have a med-kit as you pretty much can't Lone-Wolf this sort of game unless you're a sniper and even then it's difficult to get around without getting killed if you aren't the best at stealthing people as you won't be able to face them head on with said sniper rifle.  The mods in this game are also very good. They range from adding new guns vehicles enemy / teammate types either new or from previous games all the way to adding a full on Zombie Survival mod with multiple working servers and constant updates and support. It's funny because the Dayz Mod for  is actually better than DayZ standalone itself.  My main issue with the game would probably be performance wise. Bohemia Interactive has been known for not being the best at making the Arma series very clean to run and as such you see people on 980Ti's sometimes be on the low 50's to 60's in terms of FPS. But if you have the computer that can handle it then you'll be able to run it without having to worry about this issue.  TL;DR - I give this game a drugged and kidnapped pedestrian out of 10. The gameplays the best I've seen out of any shooter ever. ( Battlefield 4 is for men? This game makes those players look like the CoD group. ) The players are around 95 percent super friendly and awesome ( the 5 percent is from that  you always find in pretty much any game ever )  the graphics ( if you can run em ) are REALLY good looking but as mentioned are pretty heavy to run and if you ever get tired from running player made operations with friends then mods will keep you playing for a loooooong time.  In all seriousness get this game. If you're into TRUE tactical shooters that take actual skill logic and game-sense to play and not just 'Who has the most OP gun' then this game is for you.11
Apex make Arma great again!
I haven't played enough too have an opinion.
Have that Steam Error 81 and something with Q:00000... I can launch the game but not when I click on play. It pops up a error. Help? anyone? Maby refund next?
runs as well as a dead kid in a wheelchair
This game will make you lick your own lobster!
Made me spend $750+ on hardware to play it  11/10 would go bankrupt again
tons of mods good servers great campaign THis is War!11
probaly the most unoptimized game ever :V
Very nice military simulator. Very realistic for people who enjoy that type of game. For fast past gamers I would no recomended this game for you as it is very a very slow.
This Game has its moments and it deserves credit for being a great Arma game the engine pretty much aint realistic like Arma 2 but this game is pretty fun to play with.
 absolutely love  and would in every way recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest. There are somewhat valid criticisms of it which I will get out of the way right away before getting into why the pros by far outweigh the cons. 1. Lack of Content - One of the more popular criticisms of this game is the lack of official content in the current build especially compared to the amount of content in Arma 2. The two main factions currently (at the time of writing this review) have no fixed wing aircraft armoured vehicles of different factions have the same turrets and weapons merely reskinned (artillery anti-air and remote controlled turrets on smaller vehicles) and UAVs/UGVs are identical for all factions except for different camo patterns. 2. Performance - Another often heard criticism of  is that it performs very poorly on some machines that it often should perform well on. Like machines with top-end graphics cards and powerful CPUs.  Addressing these points one by one I will say that while there is content missing that even I would have expected the game to have at release it isn't a whole lot. Arma 2 did not have all the content it does today at it's release either and much of it is inflated by there being separate entries for guns with different attachment combinations so that the same gun with four different sight attachments would show up in a list as four different guns. As for the performance issues the game runs perfectly fine on my middle-of-the-road gaming rig and runs at playable rates on the old low to mid-end machine of my best friend. The performance of the game on some people's high-end machines is in no way a sure indicator of bad optimization especially when the same game runs great on other machines with the same hardware.  Now getting to the real meat of the review. The visuals of this game are amazing especially if you have the power to crank up the graphics settings. The lighting is great and makes the game look heavenly especially at night. The texture quality is top notch especially for foliage and I fully believe anyone interested in first person shooters should experience one where you can freely roam a huge 270 square kilometer beautifully rendered island with a rendering distance of several kilometers. Other cool graphical features are the volumetric fog and clouds as well as rain that is rendered as independent particle effects for each raindrop in stead of a mere filter or overlay.  Audio-wise the game could do with some improvements that are guaranteed to happen over time if not by Bohemia Interactive then by community modders however overall the sound design of this game is really quite good as it is.  The gameplay is where  really shines over it's predecessor as controls of your soldier have been improved to feel a lot more direct and fluid than in previous games though the action menu still tends to limits how good the game can feel in certain situations. The inventory system has seen huge improvements from Arma 2 and is much more streamlined without sacrificing flexibility. Vehicles are now physics simulated objects which is a huge improvement over Arma 2's incredibly janky vehicle physics. Underwater gameplay is a really nice addition that looks amazing and gives mission makers a lot more freedom and variety to work with when making missions and giving the players different approaches to completing them. Firing weapons in  feel pretty damn good as most rifles have a good deal of kick to them making them both sound AND feel powerful in stead of feeling like Call of Duty or Battlefield style bullet-hoses. Different weapon calibers penetrating diferent materials differently at different angles and distances gives both the shooters and the people being shot at a lot of things to think about and decide how to react to in every firefight which is great in a game that is so decidedly slow paced as Arma is compared to other first person shooters.  If you get this game and want to dive straight into some fun  gameplay I suggest playing though the first episode of the single-player campaign first to get acquainted with the fairly complex controls and spotting/shooting enemies at ranges that other FPS games would never expect you to. Once you feel somewhat at home in the game I highly recommend looking for a multiplayer server running the Wasteland mission which is sort of like a 3-way Team Deathmatch gamemode with survival elements base-building resource gathering and impromptu mini-missions against AI that all of the three teams are given and can undertake at the same time each team trying to beat the others for the promised reward leading to some very interesting clashes.  So all in all I can barely recommend this game enough but to get some real enjoyment out of it you'll want to run it on a decent mid to high-end rig.10
this is a very good game
L;DR:  Easily the most realistic military game I've played. Definitely much better than the previous games. It's best to wait for a sale however.   Pros:  -Very strong creation engine -Notable Mods/Community -Descent Graphics -Very realistic bullet physics/aiming -Strong campaign  Cons:  -Not the most optimized game ever -Slow-paced (but that's to be expected) -Sub-par infantry animations -A few notable bugs (especially in the AI)  9/10 Overall10
- buy  - go into a server a friend is on - get in humvee at spawn - squeaker next to me is being annoying af - run him over - kid gets angry and leaves - afaid im going to get banned for teamkilling - admin of the sever thanks me because the kid was annoying af 10/10 would run over squeaker again
I Think it's ok
erfect for people looking forward to achieving high fps counters. If you were happy about the performance of Windows 98 this game will blow your mind (or your cpu).-11
So many ways to stand...
nother rip-off of all of the popular good games such as FNaF Minecraft Garry's Mod and Pokemon Go.  In Arma you play as a man or a woman which is strike one of this game since there are NO OTHER GENDERS TO PLAY!!!!! What you do in this game is shoot and survive as well and try to eventually get to the end of the campaign which is the same thing you do in Minecraft. There is even crafting if you get mods! This game wants to be like Minecraft!  Five Nights at Freddy's comes in at night time. You walk around trying to avoid other harmful cisgenders or sit in your base (like in FNaF) and try not to die. This is a carbon copy of FNaF at night time yet it costs twice if not thrice as much.  Then there's Garry's Mod RP when you play a mode called Altis Life. IT'S THE SAME THING! THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE GRAPHICS AND IT'S WORSE THAN DARKRP! You have to grind for hours just to get a gun license and when you get the gun you are shot down by police for being black and have to start all over again.  And finally it also copies pokemon go. In a mode called Wasteland you walk around on your map trying to collect different vehicles to harm other cis-gender scum but there are WasteStops or as they call it in game 'shops' for you to get the appropriate gear as to set out to find the vehicles. or you can just purchase them which I think is a Pay2Win aspect and that's why Pokemon Go is better.  In conclusion this game tries to be what it shouldn't in order to make money.  10/10 game is good11
Brilliance
smoke heroin sniff weed inject cocaine and worship Satan.. Oh and Arma is awesome despite the low fps... just don't come with a ''BF or CoD mentality'' here this is the real ...11
AMAZINNGGGGG but altis life is cancer xD
10/10 would have a terrorist attack in the general store again.
Great game. The sim level is very realistic and the graphics don't dissapoint. The regular updates and most recent Apex expansion just shows the level of commitment the devs have. Recommended for all military enthusiasts looking for a tactical approach to gaming.
this game is the best army/war game i have Ever Played id say its better and more immersive then any other army/war game that i have seen. if you like atkeast 15hr of gameplay in a game that you can play with friends and team up with other players and fight other player this is a game for you there are rp servers and survival servers aswell and teamdeath match but i dont like that but none the less if you like spending hours in a game with friends roleplaying in games get this one because you wont regret it trust me I LOVE IT      oh yeah this is the longest review i have done
 mean I got 1600 hours on this game is ight. Its go  physics for ground vehicles and some other things but overall once you get the hang of it and you got the patience its not bad.   But beware its not an optimized game so be prepared to be playing with 35+ fps in most cities.  8/1010
 very good game play it a lot. certain you do not have this game I recommend this game a lot. ;)  10
Just simply epic.
 great first-person shooter that's been around for a while now but has been kept fresh thanks to the DLC and the mod community. There's a lot of love gone into this series especially with the Tanoa map. It simply is a beautiful map to play. The only issue with this game is the resources the engine uses. It's infamous for sapping CPU cycles. But there's lots of help on the forums with assisting you tweak the game to provide the best FPS possible.  If you're wanting support for this game however it is best to use Steam's community  forum as the official BI  forum is now run by some (not all) overzealous moderators who move delete and lock threads for no real reason other than they're not adhereing to whatever it is they believe is 'their' interpretation of the rules. In short if the mods don't agree with or like your post they'll move delete or lock it.    10
 should you buy it?  I bought  when it was still in alpha even then it was obviously superior to it's predecessor in critical areas. As of now  has passed both Alpha and beta stages and is still being actively refined and rewarded with new content of witch some is free.  As opposed to Arma 2 this game has a noticeable lack of content such as weapons and vehicles but this is something that will change drastically with time be it with DLC from BI or free add-ons created by the community.  The things that have improved from A2 are most noticeably the animations -you no longer move as if you had a refrigerator on your head- as-well as physics and graphics.   -Animation improvements  The movement finally feels similar to other FPS shooters in terms of responsiveness and smoothness but is taken to a new level of control and options with the addition on new stances. Previously in A2 the only stance options available to the players were stand crouch and prone In A3 these stances have been expanded upon.  You can now Lean left and right in 2 different ways in all 3 base stances you can also adjust you height in 6 (or 7) increments. You can also throw items without having to pause for half a minute finally.   -Physics improvements  The addition of improved vehicle driving mechanics and rag-dolls (no more awkward death animations) as-well as some recently added particle effects by Nvidia's PhysX. (Although I am not 100% certain that those come from the base game as opposed to a certain add-on)   -Graphics improvements  A completely new lighting system superior in every way to the one in A2 (no more spotlights or mounted suns through mountains). There have also been some basic texture quality improvements but those are quite minor in comparison.   -Things to come  As of now A3 doesn't have bullet physics comparable to what ACE brought to A2 by default (some add-ons but each varies from another). The basic bullet drop penetration and ricochet are already in but wind is not yet a factor I believe that this will chance with the addition of the 'Marksman DLC' that has already been promised. The same applies to proper flight mechanics the long awaited mechanics from Take on helicopters will come with the addition of another DLC In the future you can expect allot more high quality weapons vehicles and islands by both BI and the community.   -Things to consider  Even though A3 is already fully released it does lack some content that should have been there already this being the Marksman DLC and improved flight mechanics. Minor bugs appear regularly fazing trough walls and stairs is still present to a degree.  Optimization in multi-player needs more work having more than ~200 AI in a server will drop anyone's FPS to near 20 regardless of their HW completely (Your CPU and GPU usage will drop accordingly the game will simply not use the resources if the server is making it wait). I don't know of any server powerful enough to counter this. You need to learn how to utilize add-ons if you want to have the best experience (not a massive learning curve just know what you are dragging and where). Still a bit of a work in progress if you want everything right now in on DL you may be disappointed. Some aspects require you to learn them in time flying requires practice editing require practice and memorization and Zeus requires you to be strategic spamming T-100's is not a key to success.   Conclusion  This is not just a simple arcade FPS it is a game that requires more than twitch reflexes and marksman accuracy. Those will get you somewhere but you will most likely not like the place you end up in.  Teamwork strategy and tactics play a large role. Finding a group to play with has been a key to certain success across the entire ARMA series you wont get much from playing alone.  If you are here from DayZ and want something similar or want to be the anti-armor CQC sniper warrior in a jet you may have a hard time finding servers that will tolerate your existence they exist but not everywhere.   TLDR: Buy this game 10
Plays offline 3 hours. Decides it's enough. Goes multiplayer. Buys a car Teleported by a hacker in a strange place. Gets a parachute from a guy.  The parachute was actually stolen. Gets shooted by the guy. Best game. 10/10 would stole parachute again.
Good Game :))) Realistic
Best game ever!!! Cannot wait for Arma 4.

WAGWAN BLUD DIS GAME BE BARE TRIM LIKE THAT INNIT
If you like to DIE play this game......
LOVE IT
h so you are soldier ready for some action ? Avid sniper ready to take souls of your enemies from kilometer away ? Helicopter pilot inbound to support your troops ? Nope you have to buy DLC for that an overpriced one.   Bloody Bohemia you own best milsim franchise out there one of the most popular survival games and you are telling me I need to support you with these DLCs which are just basic content ripped of game. Don't take the path of Ubisoft or EA you can do better. I think 45€ is more than enough for full content of game.  Game 10/10 DLCs ripoff 0/10  Get your margeting together.-11
h Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead  Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter plus more as needed  Now to make it 1. In a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit or chocolate chips nuts etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more being careful not to burn toppings.11
hmmm where to begin ... (not gonna mention altis after this as 90% of that game is scrolling menu with no animations not even at FB levels ... and the are many other survival games that are just flat out better i could put my time into.)  pros. the feeling of the guns and shooting is incredible the mod community is amazing  sounds are really good map is huge  cons. movment feels sloppy sometimes no jump (not even able to atempt unless on a modded server) textures are par for the course  deal breakers. extreme fps drops  poorly optimized ... very poorly 65$ for a game that alot of the time feels like pre alpha CRASH ALL THE TIME !!!!!!!!  i have come back to this game over and over and each time i just dont wanna epoch is really the semi good mod it just feels super empty as the buildins are mostly literally empty. it's crashes sooooo much it's embarassing the dev's just left this game in such a poor state the should be ashamed ... i just can't justify recommending spending 65$ for a game i might spend 20$ on ... people rant a ravve about how good  is but i personally just don't see it when i have other games that just do everything better ... save your money.
A great alternative to the old Arma 2 feel. Very realistic. Few bugs here and there but that's arma :)
as driving around with a friend in a car. Drove off a small hill and proceded to stop moving. Asked why we had stopped moving. Friend answered: 'We appear to have lost a tire'  Walked 5km to the next objective.  10/10 would lose tire and walk to objective again.11
een playing arma for 3 years now ruined my life  Ex: 'oh hey look Dragon Age just came out' *buys and starts playing* *2 hours later get message from friend* 'arma?' *never touch dragon age again 10/1011
imply Amazing.  After playing arma 1 arma 2  is by far the best.  Guess what? iv never tried the mulitplayer also guess what? iv never even attempted to try the single player...  All 350 hours iv spent on this has been on the Editor making missions huge battles base attacks its just great.  But i have to say this game wouldn't be what it is without the Modding community too Mods are essential.  The only downfall i found with  is that its set in 2035 i think? the future weapons are very tacky nothing beats a good old AK47 show down   So because of the whole future thing i rate it 9/1010
worst optimised game ever. fun with friends sometimes but my god
This game is very good for its price. It could have more asspects to singleplayer but over all very good game! Just wish that the DLCs were cheaper.
is not quite a first person shooter it really is more of a 'war simulator' overall. It is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. The games strong point in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer where you make missions and what not. I find this single feature what makes Arma stand out the best. More shooters should have the level of control  gives players. There were a few 'cons' to all of its 'pros' though so I will list my biggest as follows.   1. Multiplayer Servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your FPS (frames per second)   2. I feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players.   3. Better single player. Arma may be best for its multiplayer but I think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable.   All in all I think  does the 'shooter/ war simulation' best it may not be as popular as games like COD or Battlefield but thats not a bad thing. Imagine if it was that popular then we would be dealing with those 'guys'...10
-_-
est game played it a lot.10
 This a very cool game. Got to play it on a free weekend deal and had a blast. The graphics are amazing it is very realistic what more could you want from an fps game?10
10/10 -Im Hillary Clinton and I approve of this message.
Good to play with a group or solo great game all together
his ia an amazing game. Even for 60$. As it shows I have about 700 hours and some of my friends have even more. Anyone that says they don't like Arma is lying10
Really good Military simulator!
Is a Game like no other Bohemia Interactive is a one of a kind company aswell! They Treat their Customers with Respect they listen to their fanbase and They dont rip us off infact they let us rip them off lol! But the Arma Series Is amazing And  the latest installment is No Acception when Compared to Arma 2 Or Arma 1 This game is just amazing anyone that is looking for a Hardcore Military Simulator Based on the future of warfare (2035ish) The core game is Perfect for you! But since Bohemia Interactive and this games Fanbase are amazing you have thousands of mods at your disposale Arma 2 Combined Operations ( Last Arma with DLC Operation Arrowhead) had mods witch enabled you to expierence the games simulation in WW2 Battles or Vietnamn or the ever now popular DAYZ (Zombie Appoycolypse Survival Simulator pretty much lol) But the mods and the game Give you 100% Freedom to do what you want where you want when you want!11
UPDATE]   is a great military sandbox game that consists of: •Campaign •User-made scenarios •Multiplayer •MANY different game modes •DLCs that aren't too pricy (DLC buyers get items while at the same time supporting the development of  ____________________________________________________________  in my opinion is a very realistic military simulator. You have a lot of weapons to choose from and a lot of attachments. There are: •5 pistols •3 Sub-machine guns •10 different types of assault rifles •3 Designated marksman rifles •2 sniper rifles •3 LMGs  That's not it though! Leave it to the developers to make even more guns coming up in the marksman DLC.  Vehicles consist of: •AFV-4 Gorgon •AMV-7 Marshal •Ifrit •Hatchback •HEMTT •Hunter •MSE-3 Marid •Strider •SUV •Tempest •Truck •Quadbike •UGV Stomper •Zamak •Go kart [Was added in as a joke but people wanted it in the game as DLC content!] •2S9 Sochor •BTR-K Kamysh •CRV-6e Bobcat •FV-720 Mora •IFV-6a Cheetah •AH-9 Pawnee •AH-99 Blackfoot •CH-49 Mohawk •MH-9 Hummingbird •PO-30 Orca •UH-80 Ghost Hawk •Mi-48 Kajman •A-143 Buzzard •A-164 Wipeout •To-199 Neophron •Speedboat •Swimmer delivery vehicle [Submarine] •Assault boat  Think that's a long list? That's a lot but not all! Each of the vehicles have their own unique features. ____________________________________________ I bought  during the alpha stage when it wasn't too great however  has improved so much and the developers have made a lot of tweaks/fixes.10
he best and biggest milsim sandbox out there. If you're a fan of PC gaming this should be in your library.10
t's quite a game if you ask me cod and battlefield fans beware though; while cod fans might say this game sucks battlefield players might like this better; its got more realistic gameplay bullet drop and some what slow and tactical gameplay it's awesome. multiplayer will offer the most re playability although people that play console might be upset because keyboard really is needed to play how ever there is controller support. there's one more thing! just remember every pc is deffirent; mine runs like a dream at a whopping 60-50 and at lows it's more like 30-20 graphics look great up close how ever they lose meaning and look at distance so over all I'd give it 10/9.8 10
 Buy Arma3 after playing 2  Seems alright  Spend 800 hours in milsim  Play on milsim server as per usual one night  Next morning go to school  Kid drops book on ground and makes the classic *SNAP* noise  Had to stop myself from dropping to the floor behind a desk and yell: 'Where is it coming from?!?!'  10/10 would PTSD again
Story: Kerry do this Kerry do that Kerry you get promoted to Sargent after you do thousends of meanial tasks congrats. Multiplayer: Its arma at its finest when you find a server with no hackers and people that want to do objectives it comes down to being an amazing experience and will be time well spent homeing skills overall the multiplayer alone sells this game though the single player is good and has an interesting story to it at the end it will all come down to the online play.  So for summary Story is good but leaves little desire to the AI always getting killed unless you are the best marksman in the world and your stuck doing tasks on your own because all your squad die to 1 guy but over all enjoyable amd the multiplayer really dose sell the game like old arma titles the multiplayer brings good tactics into a battle simulation and overall gives an amazing feel to team based stratigic shooter.  I recomend this to you if you enjoy thinking before doing of battle and seeing a plan come to light and following it threw till your objective is complete. I wouldnt reccomend it to someone who plays call of duty or battlefeild your simple run and gun tactics wont work on a realistic point of view you are lucky to survive if you get shot in the first place so running at the enemy with your finger on the trigger will get you and who ever has the unfortunet plesure of being arround you killed.
Beautifull game  But my PC is piece of . and there for everything must run on Standard During Online gameplay.
I mean I don't know if I've played enough to really have a solid opinion but  seems alright.
his right here this is not a game. This  is an EXPERIENCE!10
Best game ever no bugs all is good
Most fun military game ever so many ways to play 
Not fun how buggy the game still is =(   The game wants to be realistic but in reality there are no bugs. Some bugs which still exist: - falling out of a tower because of switching the view and then die - seeing enemys through walls - when you go crouched through doors you get stuck every time - if you are robbing and some obstacles are blocking you the character is sometimes standing up  - one time i wantet to climb over a rock but then i was inside the rock. I could see out of it and shoot but people didn't see me and the bullets didn't go out of the rock i had to respawn   Not fun seeing Bohemia forcing us to buy DLC =(   - i want to loot someone i killed can't take weapon because DLC needed - i want to play without add everytime i see a DLC vehicle weapon... DLC advertisement is popping up - Bohemia selling a season pass (including all dlc) and now you have to buy 'Apex' extra   The game is still fun to play but it could be greater. I wouldn't recommend buying it for the normal price. Wait for sale or buy a cheap key. In my opinion the bugs are existing since ARMA 1 ARMA 2 and now still persist in . If only were the Bugs i would give a thumbs up. But the DLC politcs of Bohemia are really not fair!  -11
Best Games Ever :D Military Simoulators FTW &lt;3
is like its predecessors. When Bohemia launched it (I mean after Alpha and Beta Phase) it was still incomplete lacking content (for example: I mean the biggest Island ever and only one Jet for a minor Fraction the AAF) and Bug riddled. So nothing changed Behemia is still greedy and the community has to bring it arround. Wich it does! Missions Mods everything is comming from you guys! Thanks for that.11
It has turtles.  wow/10
Great game..
Its alright i guess.
mm... Where do I start... Well imagine this scenerio. You and 5 of your best friends are told by a commander to please take out an enemy/ hostile base. You have an amazing pilot who takes you there. Its night time and you and your crew are all in the chopper getting ready to attack. Ropes come down from the chopper and you and your 4 friends land on the ground. Immedatley one of your friends gets sniped right beside you. The chopper lands and the pilot is asking what happended. You put your friend on your shoulders and start taking him to the chopper for a heal up. The pilot starts giving him CPR. You and your friends go towards the enemy base. Taking them out with advanced stategies and tactics. Finally you finish them off. One of your teammates was hit. He's losing blood. You throw smoke for a helicopter extraction. The pilot responds with an ok and heads towards your direction. You tell your friend he's gonna make it as the helicopter becomes visible. The helicopter starts descending when BAM it gets it. Its starts falling and explodes one of your guys goes down. Another rushes in to save him and catches fire and burns to death. Its just you and the guy that limping holding each others shoulders heading back to base far far away. Your friends gets shot while going over a hill. He dies as you try to save him. You keep walking as suddenly you see a car approaching. Enemys come out as you put your hands up. One pulls the trigger then again your getting shot constantly. You fall on your knees. Someone shoots you in the head. You fall... And its over.  This is just ONE of my hundreds of experiences with gamemodes from Battle Royale to Serious RP to Wasteland King of the Hill and so forth. I could never recommend a game so much...10
This game to good!
Takes me back to the days in 'nam
ey thats pretty good10
f you're into self deprevation and hating yourself than this is the game for you. Every modd for this game looks amazing and turns out to be completely buggy and unplayable. Cheers.10
is a tactical FPS/TPS with vehciles ranging from boats jets and land vehicles.  boasts great graphical fedility amazing combat and very immersive gameplay with vehicle interiors and vast landscapes  PROS: -It's Beautiful -Great/Fun gameplay -Amazing combat -Lots of stuff to do different servers and gamemodes will keep you entertained for hours and not just altis life -If you love tactical games here it is!  CONS: -Paid DLC -Need a semi-good PC -Buggy -The movement is sort of clunky some times  Overall  is a fun expierience down to it's core it's my favourite in the series it looks and feels better then ARMA 2 and it's still adding content all the time it's great to get a few friends and make a squad i think it's worth it although it's a little pricey you will get your moneys worth if you love tactical games just playing ALTIS life is a waste of the game there is also workshop support so more weapons missions and dinosaurs? overall i give  8.5/10 Piggy points for the above mentioned.10
Its not COD 0/10 -ign
Alpha - 5/10  Beta - 6/10  Full Released Game - 9/10
lying tanks aimbot AI and all rounded shenenigans and barrels of Charlie Chaplins everywhere. Get this game!  ROCKET GIVE ALPHER PLZ! ? ? ?_? ?? Give SA! Rocket Plz10
Great game. I don't play it much. The community is what makes this game great. DEVs do a good job at fixing stuff. If you do get this game and love modern gear and equipment make sure to check out the RHS Modification for the game. It's the most epic mod.
he best tactic-shooter on the market. Really like it especially the different gamemodes for example king of the hill or altis life. But even if you have a really good PC it will still be a bit of laggy it needs a lot of resources. 09/1010
Workshop is nice. Also a rather nice physics engine and nice multiplayer
Its a very good game. :D
rmA III is great. Arma II aside there’s nothing else like it. As time goes on will only get better – but at launch it feels a little like moving sideways rather than forwards.10
NOT CALL OF DUTY. NOT CALL OF DUTY. NOT CALL OF DUTY. NOT CALL OF DUTY. NOT CALL OF DUTY. tl:dr one of the best military simulation games available nevr stop plyin dis
roleplay to the point of it being depressing and stop playing it for weeks
o be honest like all previous bohemia games  is filled with all sorts of bugs and unfinished / half complete stuff  however there is something unique about this game  something special that keeps people playing this game .Graphics  gameplay campaign are pretty good even though they could be allot better. Even though there are other military sim's that are not bad at all  Arma titles hold the very top .  Why you may ask ? Its because  provides the user with the tools to create whatever he wants.  You finished the campaign ? No problem  here are hundreds of user created missions for you that you can now play. You dont like the missions ? No problem  here is the editor in which you can make ur own missions. You dont like the  Factions/Weapons/Vehicles /Visual FX/Sound/AI/Realism ? No problem  here  download the hundreds of mods available for free. You want to create ur own content ? Here are the modding tools  you can do / create whatever you want with them.  And this is what makes  special .I am sure bright future awaits this game If the devs listen to the community and the community stays loyal to this game. Recommended.  EDIT (2016): Game has dramatically improved over the years in terms of content / graphics / gameplay updates ... It definitely receives a thumbs up from me .10
est War simulator you can get!!   If you looking for immersive play where you affraid for your life. this is the game!10
oppin caps in   niqqaz asses. Dis shiz it tight af son. GTFO out my trap house BANG BANG KEEP IT 3HUNNID NAW IM SAYIN??10
Great game really love the customization of the game 10/10
10/10 would play again
This is the dogs nads....
great tactical army simulator which has no 10 year old squeaking COD kids who rambo across the entire map complaining that they died from being shot in the head.
Good game so many mods and addons a 3d scenario editor just get teamspeak get a couple of friends and arma is the best game ever but i have 1 problem NOT WORKING ON MAC OS i want to buy a Mac Pro and i want to play arma bohemia pls Apple is the best company ever why dont u support mac almost every american has a mac book or a mac pc and im planning to buy one too cuz theyre so good and the beautiful apple on it is the most important part getting a little bit off topic huh ?
+rep 10 of 10.
pretty good tbh
is slow paced tactical shooter. You can't simply run and gun like other FPS games. Most important thing Bohemia still expanding game with free updates. (3D eden editor weapon stabilizing supressive fire graphic overhaul). Game controls are little bit complex for new comers. Almost every key has a purpose.   pros: + Great military similator. + Detailed controls. + Multiplayer mode variety is high. + Free updates.  cons: - Game engine is old and has some performance issues. - A.I acts weird sometimes.10
 have put in a nice amount of hours into this game and it's truly beautiful I have to say one of the best Military Simulators out there along with all the mods that spice this game up. But anyways with any game there are some bugs and glitches and  isn't rare with those. And one last thing If you're playing with AI prepared to get rekt those s can see you coming from miles away and have nearly perfect aim although there not the smartest about moving into cover when they see you nor are they the smartes if you flank them So yea if you're going to play against AI flank them.10
ey thats pretty gud10
 know it says recommended but if you have no patience or toleration for bugs crashes and a large amount of trolls and hackers don't get this game. That being said if you are ok with dealing with a un-optimized buggy but AWESOME game: it is best to wait for a sale because $60 is a large amount of money. But if you are seriously considering getting the game read below.       \ / \ / \/ \ /   Now to that you have the game start to familiarze yourself with the gameplay;but don't get too frustrated because they can be a bit wonky if you have never played a tactical shooter.  Once you do this;there are two big player bases to this game: RP (roleplayers) and MIlsimers (hardcore tactical military simulation). I am a mixture between the two but I can't say I'm more towards one or the other.  If you like the sound of doing roleplay and want to jump right in;15;17
One of the most expanded game ever made. Every aspect of the physics is independent and gives stunning effects.  + Feeling of shooting + Precisely made weapons + Precisly constructed wehicles + Movement + Stances + Challenging + Lot of mods + Almost every aspect of the game + You can fall in love in it  - Or you can hate it - Some bugs - Too hard for some people
it's ok
Fantastic game. Very realistic and huge map to explore.
very good role play and domination game but note u need good computer (I AM GOOD)
When a full chopper crashes into a tree on a mountain and start falling slowly you know it's gon b gud.
.5/10   If you are a passive and slow in playing game this is the right game for you. It is too slow and has SOO MANY GLITCHES YOU HAVE NO IDEA!! I will give it credit becase it is like skyrim free roaming type but the controls are too much and in general it sucks i would recomend no getting thi sgame and not wasting your 60 bucks keeps it for something better. Please don't buy this game.-10
joined a Wasteland and spawned. ran up a stairway and died. 10/10 would die on stairs again
at first i was like pew pew pew pew but now i'm like ... waiting... pew.
 would not say this game is worth buying at full price but I can tell you that it's really fun nonetheless. There are a lot of bugs and it feels more like a retextured and updated Arma 2 but there are plenty of fun scenarios and multiplayer is very good. The game requires a really beefy computer to not run on  graphics so if you have a crappy computer and you don't want to see  graphics then don't get this game. However if you're up for an intense milsim then get this game.  Rate: 8/1010
This is by far my favorite sandbox game. The base game itself is very good and the multiplayer is a ton of fun (though servers do need to be restarted like every 4 hours of the multiplayer lag gets out of hand). I would not reccomend this game if you have a lower end to mid end machine as this games graphics will destroy your machine. Buy this game.
The vast amount of game modes will keep me entertained for hundreds of hours and I've only played two of them! Altis Life is fun and wasteland mode is some of the most intense FPS action I've ever played.
I Love this game good Job who made it
all of Duty's more educated and respectable older cousin. An FPS for the thinking man who appreciates the real life brutal realities of combat. This game doesn't grab your hand and guide you to its breast this game makes you work for your entertainment. Treat this game right take the time to understand its nuances and never underestimate it's bite and you'll have a much more rewarding experience than you can achieve with most FPS games. When a mission is carried out via your own strategic wit and whim and hours are spent infiltrating and avoiding enemy patrols so that you can make it to that perfect firing position for your sniper it really makes that one shot a lot more heart pounding than any round fired in any other military shooter. If you have ADHD watch wrestling appeared on Jerry Springer think Call of Duty is a good game and/or are the offspring of two genetically similar parents you will NOT enjoy this game.10
 good follow up to Arma 2. With updated graphics and smoother movements certainly one of my favourite milltary shooterrs out there. However I am missing the familiarity of guns that Arma 2 had with it's massive assortments of weapons and vehicles. Would definitely like to see more added on to the game on that respect. AI are more intelligent. Maybe too intelligent. However with great game types like wasteland and an integrated steam workshop it certainly delivers. Mods may also add on to the game the same way dayz and ACE did for ARMA 2.10
Very Good.
epic!!! everyone should own this game!!
his game is epic if you're a Battlefield or COD troll then I suggest you move on to something like SiMS. Don't waste your time on campaign mode get yourself onto multiple player find a clan get on TS and trust me you wont look back.   See you on the battlefield es10
Best consumer grade military simulation money can buy.
Amazing Game would recommend to 100% Everyone
eing a war simulation game (in comparison Battlefield is an arcade game) the community is very mature and respectful. Besides if you are a programmer you can do A LOT with this game.10
I mistaken a rock for a car. 11/10
ood game you can do a lot in it.10
Game has amazing graphics. That is all I need to say.
 wanted to love . so very much. Its the military game i had been thinking about in my head for years upon years. open world. freedom. huge battles huge armies tearing each other to bits as you either control a tank chopper oir take part in an infantry skirmish.  However thats exatcly what  fails to deliver! The shooting mechanics are fine as the ballistics. The sound it complete trash the guns sounds absolutly awfull. It will certainly be worth your time downloading the sound mod for these made by some guy in his bedroom it completly trounces the vannilla sounds of  in every respect. Adding a much needed realism in that department (Bohemia please hire this guy) But back to the crux of what is wrong with . I realise this game is in beta still and the main game campaign is unfinished. WHERE IS THE WAR!? every mission in  be it a user created scenario or the main campaign. Each mission is just a skirmish a tiny bunch of AI controlled bots versus you and your squad. It lacks impact. it lacks excitment. At no point playing  was i immersed in what appeared to be a realistic military conflict. Now this is 2014...planetside 2 an online multilayer game manages to have 2000 players on one map in an incredible seesaw conflict for control of the map...ITS A FREE TO PLAY GAME...why does  not manage this even in an AI controlled sp warzone? let alone a multiplayer arena. Is it engine limitations? WHY DOES  NOT HAVE A WARZONE MODE alongside its campaign and multiplayer. All i want to be is plonked down in a huge island wide conflict. able to choose one of many mission objectives and actually feel involved it something organic and dynamic!  There are a few user created missions that attempt to create this but they fall short something about this game makes it unable to run a huge conflict without causing serious serious clientside lag. Now ill mention the multiplayer...what a joke...its so laggy as to be unplayable. I dont know why either. There is something seriously wrong either with the servers or there is something wrong with the way stuff is optimised and implemented in this game. Please note  has been released for a very long time now ok yes its not full release. BUT MY GOD PLEASE FIX THE MULTIPLAYER BOHEMIA it makes your company look rediculous. dayz SA is in alpha and it manages to run 1000% better multiplayer arenas. Now my last qualm is the price. 60 dollars for something that has an unplayble mulitplayer and an unfinished single player????? HOLY @$%! My advice is very sadly. do not buy this game until full release :( and even then make sure it works properly or you may be wasting your money10
 is probably one of the best games ever in my opinion. The RPG is unbeatable and people who play this game like to actully play it legit.
I couldn't get fps to playable level in multiplayer and I have new 1000e desktop pc. Fps below 20 with low settings wtf?
f you are into Stat Padding then this is not for you. Yes the Arma range has been problematic but  has solved most of that. This is a game of patience team work and skill. If you are a 1 man platoon then yes you can play but you wont get the full experience this game offers. This game has so much to offer and such a large community adding content that you should give it a try….10
isappointing on several levels. Essentially you're paying $60+ for an engine that mods run off. The mods that currently exist are pretty underwhelming and aren't made by the studio. They have universally low production value and there are only a couple that are played. The insulting part is the engine isnt even good. It's pretty slow no matter what settings it's on and this is with pretty decent hardware. Maybe if you can get this game on super sale it would be worth it but the amount of content in this game in NO way justifies the price-10
f you havent already bought this game its a must buy!!!! its 40% off atm get it while you can!!!10
ne of the best military sims out there. If you like immersion/sandbox then you will love this.10
The best mil sim game ever made
Good but wish there were way more planes
i recommend this game
 play  since Alpha it has changed alot since first builds all in plus. Its currently best game to buy if you think about Tactical FPS game and also it isnt just that you buy ArmA and its all you get.  like ArmA 2 is a platform that allows modders to create completly different game modes that developers originally designed also the game has a lot of devs attention. DLC-s like ZEUS make this game even more interesting and avilible even for non scripting gamer society. Only thing i wish to see in future  development is more DLC (no matter if free or not if it bring lots of new stuff) and Directx12 witch will help to improve performance.10
rawling Simulator - Version 3.0  Jokes aside Arma III is a blast. The environments are stunning the weapon &amp; vehicle details so well done the guns actually kick and the voice acting and sounds immerse you into the amazing world of Stratis. With so much land (and now sea) you can really do any scenario on Statis. The modding community is already creating/porting amazing mods into  and the community is great. If you want a real shooter that feels &amp; plays great then  is your game.10
 love this game it has brought me plenty of fun and I can assure you that you will like it too. If you have enough cash to buy this game (as it is expensive) I highly highly recommend.10
his is -the- tactical shooter. If you're tired of the often trite and rediculous 'military' shooters out there and want a more realistic simulation of military endevour give this game a try. Not for the faint of heart or the incautious it's by far the best military FPS experience I've had to date. That is not to say it isn't without it's faults or problems (touch on those in later on) but the overall experience the sense of scale and the frankly the amount of fun I've had in this game are what make this game my go-to for tactical combat.  PROs - Scale of the environment; you're not going to find anything remotely like this in scale save possibly in WWII Online which is comparitively more dated than this. The enviornments are huge even on Stratis it takes considerable time to simply walk from one location to another. Both maps offer a good variety of cover concealment and terrain to fight in from forested hills and mountains to underwater stealthy goodness. - Realism; What I mean by this is that the game provides fairly realistic expectations on human limitations such as the amount and types of gear one can carry fatigue and the surprising turns of fragility and endurance of the human body. Marksmanship is important and vigilance is key in firefights. It's easy for the unwary to lose track of a target if you don't keep your eyes peeled and your rifle ready creating a sense of tension in combat unlike most any other I've experienced. There are swells and lulls to it that speak to an environment that lends itself to a more realistic combat experience. - It's pretty; While not the top tier of graphics this is certainly an accessible and sometimes stunning gaming experience. It takes a poet to describe the sweeping vistas that reveal themselves at the oddest moments. With your intense focus on the environment around you you can be trekking to an objective location in multiplayer with some friends and crest a hill to see a marvellous Mediterranean sunset over a quiet sea-side village. And there's a poignancy when that serenity is broken by an artillery barrage from the forward observer on the opposite hill. The character models can be customised in a way previous titles of this series could not giving voice to the inner tactical fashionista (really sometimes dressing in all-black gear just feels -good-). - Modding support; Mod support for this game is building slowly but surely and for a few of my gripes in the CONs section there are mods that help alleviate the suffering somewhat.  As a niether here nor there sort of observation: The game interface is much improved over previous versions of the game especially the inventory system which is a marvelous improvement compared to the frustration generated from the previous title. However it's not perfect and especially the contextual menu needs some major tweaking and re-examination by BI.  CONs - Optimization; the game could do with some. Settings I can use on most games with comprable graphics simply do not hold up in ArmA III but it's rarely crippling. I still wish it'd be less of a struggle to have settings on a level that makes the game as pretty as it is without a lagging frame rate. - Lack of choice; this applies more to gear and weapons than anything. While the stable of available gear for use has been increasing gradually since the Alpha Supporter edition there's still a surprisingly low number of choices for small arms and vehicles in particular. I'm hoping that the Campaign extensions will also continue to provide more variety to the in-game gear I have to choose from. - Dinky guns; It's a bit of a pet peeve I'll admit that some of the weapons feel weirdly underpowered in this. Perhaps its simply because I'm less used to using them but a few weapons take more than half a magazine at short range to bring down relatively lightly armored foes with well placed shots. I'm looking at you SMGs and 5.56 weapons.10
You won't regret this! Unless you're FoshoTM
Epic war simulator. Beautiful attention to detail. Definantly recommend this game to anyone to try.
this game took away all my downstairs hair
ood graphicsimproved gameplay. An oveerall improved experience !10
Good game. It's not worth 60 bucks. Game is glitchy and still needs lots of works. Feels like a Alpha/beta game.
grate game fun game modes and very enjoyable with friends
The engine man! get it now!
It's ok i guess
hat's people complaining about? DLCs a rip off? Then don't buy the DLC. No one asked you too. But if you do want the DLC then buy the dlc bundle if you have the game already. BUT if you don't have the game right now buy the Extended Edition. (You can wait for a sale on that) This game is such an improvement over Arma 2. Graphics are better physics are better and now BIPODS. If the game isn't running nicely you can go into the launcher and tweak the settings like adding more RAM for the game to use and how much cores.10
RMA II was one of my favorite games (and it still is) but ARMA III is just in a testing (Alpha) version and they upgraded everything which was bad in ARMA II (better physics ragdolls animations... and they even added cool new things such as weapon modifications uniforms first aid kits and underwater life) the only bad things are bad optimization and the funny animations when you're climbing a ladder (I don't know why they left that in there unchanged it was funny as hell back in ARMA II). There are some mods for it already and the game doesn't have even a month so the modding community will be big like it was for ARMA II I think. There's even a sandbox zombie mod! :D I really love the graphics this is the most photorealistic game you can get (Crysis 3 has unrealistic lights). Audio effects are cool too but not as cool as in Battlefield 3 for example. Gameplay is almost the same as in ARMA II but there are some new things like your character's stances. I was messing with the editor for like 5 hours in a row and I did some interesting things. The editor has a new look but works exactly like in the previous game. I think ARMA III will be ever more successful than it's predecessor and I'm proud of our Czech brothers for such an amazing game.  My recension will change with the upcoming Beta version.  Overall: 10/1010
 loved (still love) Arma 2: CO and  is a brilliant successor. They've added a lot of polish to the game made movement feel much smoother and really improved the graphics. With Steam Workshop new content for the game is just a click away and there are some excellent user-made missions out there. Moreover there are a ton of mods available which can change various aspects of the game. I've put more than 400 hours into  playing and creating missions and that's just in single-player. I can't recommend the game enough to anyone who likes realistic open-world shooters. It'll be installed on my PC for a long long time.10
I have to admit I was hating this game in the beginning. I couldn't understand why I kept dying. I couldn't get the controls down and everything felt WAY to complicated. Then a few weeks ago I decided to sit down and learn the game. As other reviewers stated this game is not Call of Duty or Battlefield. You have to be patient. You have to learn the weapons and vehicles. This game is worth every penny as long as you invest a few days to learn the controls. Add in Steam Workshop and other mods (Breaking Point is my favorite) and you have a fantastic war simulator.
 laughed I cried I shot people in the face....10
best first person shooter!!!!
xcellent game I would highly recommend.10
he graphics are awsome the weapons sound are excellent and the singleplayer missions are excellent10
reat game for realism even more so if you have patience and friends to play with10
oh soso good :3   This is one of the best games of forever :D  10/10 IGN 'kinda good i guess'
Although I havnt played it yet to me it looked like a very good game and since i have got money :I Im buying it :D
great game my friends need this game fun to play with a bunch of people
lol my computer couldn't even run this when it was free weekend ;v;
ear beiber fan _69  Here my love xoxoxoxoxo HB  sort yo ping den wees play togeth  gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg   Lov Dirty mike and the boys   - Trev   Thanks bro for this Amazing game  and the Review: this game is amazing smooth engine great missions a nice step up from arma 2 Downside: multiplayer is to time consuming. qq10
yea if price goes sown
ing Love playing this game. need to be worked on some more but great game and modding community.
Ater around 150 hours of playing this game I firmly say it is worth the money.
its like an army simulation its so real ! it might laggy at somme points but still a good game
ing Epic Game! endless possibilities!
ne of the only game where i spent more time on the graphic settings for optimal 60fps and training in the tutorial than actually playing the game. Aside that the control are smoother than arma 2 and feels more optimized but the content is still lacking. It become a great game if one get invested in it otherwise pass your way if you expect playing it like a regular FPS with WASD and left click you'll become a machinist on your keyboard.10
I tricked a 12 year old cop and stole his cop car.  11/10
Its so real its almost like am actually playing a video game.
his game is one of the best simulators I have ever played. It contains many improvements to the engine graphics and controls since ARMA 2. This game has been made better by the steam workshop to host a ton of downloadable senarios. I would recommend you play this game with friends or some sort of community.   Some negatives of this game is its performance I requires a powerful computer to play even then there is some sort of performace drop. Also there was a lack of single player content but there is now some being released.   Im looking forward to the future of this game as it gains popularity and plus with all the cool expansions ARMA 2 had there will probably be new content in the future. One more thing is that there is a huge difficulty spike because its a simulator. This is no call of duty or battle field and requires alot of time to get used to. If you never had any experience with ARMA games and you are not shure if you should get  buy ARMA 2 + OA it has been on sale recently for really cheap.10
an't recommend it more try it out!10
akes a good few hours maybe even days to get used to the controls and how the whole combat system works. Once you have gotten the hang of it it gets awesome. None of the 'I am a 12 year old running through 10 guys killing them all with a knife CoD style t.' The realism is rediculous. YES there are some bugs and like all the ARMA games has it moments but its the closest you'll get to a virtual reality war game.  DEF GET IT KIDS.10
his game is the best Arma game in the entire series it is truly an amazing game. The graphics are suprisingly good and the gameplay is very fun especially if you like realisic war games that takes teamwork and strategy to stay alive. But I would not recomend this game to the daily Call of Duty fan boy guy this game is slow paced and takes LOTS of strategy and teamwork unlike Call of Duty's run and gun and lone wolf type of game. If you are familiar with Arma 2 this is everything you love with better graphics and physics for example. Arma 2 you shoot a man he stands there for a sec then falls down and dies with no blood affect.  you shoot a man he realistically falls (some what rag doll physics) and there is a realistic blood affect. Overall I think the game is great and I give it a 10/10.10
mazingly fun I love altis life and wasteland. 10
This game is too hard for me.
Probably one of the best games I have ever played. It is very highly recommended that you do buy this game. I play it as much as I can!
Best game ever. No need for explanation. On of the only games created that should be worth more than $60.00
Keep Calm AND SMOKE WEED EVERYDAY :P :P
he newest game in the Arma series from Bohemia Interactive offers a wide variety of new vehicles weapons and gameplay options. If you like war-games but want something a bit more realistic than 'CoD' Arma III is for you!10
fter playing this game for about 20 minutes I decided to leave most every other shooter game behind. The scale of this game what's possible and what you can do in it is next to none. You can create your own mission or try ones that other people have made. In that sense the game is infinite. This game has realism tactics stealth weapons vehicles and so much more. You can approach any task in a million different ways. 20/10.10
it is a good game i love it
hooter simulator? i just crawl around on my  till i get shot usually but ok.10
in  balls
this game is awsome
o start off this game is AMAZING. There is so much you can do in this game. I would call it basicly Garry's Mod with its own engine amazing graphics and a even better gameplay experience. There is multiple ways you can play this game. One being its singleplay (Its 'okay' not the best very good to learn the basics). Two mission gamemodes these can range from being 'Wasteland' to 'Altis Life' which are all fun and you can put tons of hours into them. And lastely Mods the PC community is known to make mods for popular games you can play mods like 'Epoch' or 'Breaking Point' which are mods that are made to be like DayZ. Then there is the popular mod 'A3L' which has brought a lot of attention to mods and  it self. Sometimes at night with the light setting on Ultra it was the best looking lights that I have ever seen in video games EVER. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate this game 9/10.10
I played the 2 days for free and I really recommend this game It's a shame about the high price though but for people who have a decent income will love this game. Just wish I had it for longer as it would be a great game to start a clan on.
he game is Great but when I try to host my game crashes!!10
alking simulator with 3 great modes: hills valleys and drowning!10
 have to say this game blew me away the first I tried it. Here's what I think of the game:  Pros: -Realistic if you get shot twice your dead no regenerative health. -Editor allowing you to create your own missions. -Hard combat makes you think on how to complete said missions. -You don't always have to be the commander or even fight.  -Multiplayer gameplay can be intense and make you think even more than against the AI. -Makes you work with your team to actually get stuff done. -Actual terminal ballistics. -Booming mod community.  Cons: -Hard to learn controls (If new to series) -Some minor bugs (This will go away hopefully after beta so I'm not taking a point away for it)  I can't think of any more. So overall I give this game a 10/10.  EDIT: Just thought of 1 problem that affects a lot of people:  Optimization issues. New score: 8.5/10.10
its   a simulator you can simulate everything from real live to ARMAgedon  nice grafics  nice gameplay  9/10 almost perfect
f you get bored of all those CoD/BF clones out there try something 'new' and more real. In  one bullet can be your end at 'full health'. How it should be. It has far better emersion than any CoD BF or CS game ever had.10
0/10 Game would play again and again (what I do) - BWG Altis Life &lt;310
an for barely a minute couldn't run anymore. 10/1010
this is a super realistic millitary based game. i mean whats not to love?
his is the most realistic game i've ever played. Everything from the cars armored vehicles helicopters and jets to the boats and combat this game has it all! The controls are completely realistic to a certain point. The possibilies in this game are vast for a war-based shooter. You can customize how you look how your guns look even how your vehicle looks! I highly reccommend this game to anyone looking for some realism.10
 is a rather good combat simulator which I would recommend to people which have an interest in this sort of game.
Roses are red Violets are blue I am a dog  10/10 'Would Takistan again ' -IGN
he game that you will most likely never get 60 FPS in... other than that one of the best games I ever played.10
f you like DayZ style mods this is the game for you.   A true survival sim yes you still have to use your imagination and yes there's a steep learning curve but it's worth it if you think you have what it takes to be a survivor.  -Breaking Point (DayZ with factions) -Epoch/Overpoch (DayZ with base building and more guns) -Exile (Haven't tried yet but it looks like to be the best 'DayZ' out there atm  Keep Calm And Respawn10
mazing forget my old review. This game is gold. As a Arma lover I was super hyped about the game. The reason I hated the game was because I only played Watseland and Altis Life. But I joined the more war servers. And damn it's fun.10
/10 Excellent game great tactical shooter with first person and third person perspective. Lots of game modes and even more coming out all the time so many to name and not enough words for them all. Great Campaign very challenging with many challenge modes to also play. Play with friends or by yourself in land sea and air combat. Weaponry ranging from Pistols to Rocket launchers ATV's to Tanks Hummingbirds to Jets.10
A very great game to play
antastic game...but fowck the people in the game bunch of fowkin d1ckheads-10
BEST GAME EVUR BE A REBEL KILL PIGS
Buy it as !!! you never try you never know!!!
0/10 game. Fun game overall you just need to find your type of gamemode/mod.10
antastic game with a lot of mods. The best military simulator i have played you should get it if you have the money. The  Life Mod actually reminds me of GTA V but a lot of more role play in it. I recommend this game 10/10.10
This game is awesome ;)
Amazzzing game ing mate love this ing  game great grafik and much more  LOVE IT
an't get the hang of the real game but Altis Life is definetly awesome.10
I dont own the game but i can write a review :3  Now I DO own the game and I can say it's amazing :)
i personally love this game would be better if more modes became available but it is basically a great game overall well woth the money
this game is amazing it offers hundreds of joices so you can never get bored. this is a definite ten out of ten
eally fun and realistic game I just wish setting up servers that work were a little easier...10
some one plz buy for me
reat Single player FPS isn't too good even with good computer Needs patch badly. Multiplayer isn't good as the FPS drops 1-20 FPS not good at all Needs patch asap since it has been out for a long time I guess they don't want to fix it at all..   Making packs without patching the FPS problem is a problem.  Other than this is good graphics and good game.  Will not recommend till they fix the FPS problem seems like a waste of money..-10
ands down the best military simulator I've played to date. Player content is a bit rough to get working and large explosions on one side of the map can make a whole server lag out but for a community editable game platform it more than beats out almost every shooter I can think of.   If they could make player created content ratable and downloadable after they check it over to make sure it does not crash the whole thing it would be just about perfect. An additional service i would pay 10-15 US dollars a month to have up and running.10
f you like sandbox games and especially military sandbox you have to play  but if you're bad at games that require tactics or you think this is CSGO you should not buy this game. Personally I did not enjoy this game because for me it is pretty boring or maybe has no action but you decide. However I recomend .10
his game is one of the best games i have ever played so far even if it says its a simulator it is still a game. I have played this before and my computer cant run it very well but decent. I recommend you get something higher than a gtx 560(ti) something like a gtx 670 or R9 280x. Also yes i don't have the game but i have played it before and i recommend this game  Rating:11/1010
h Arma… How I love you.  I have put a pretty good amount of time into this game and I believe I can give my opinion on it. Where do I start…   Experience. This game has SO much to offer and I can easily explain why. I have the worst computer you could possibly have… It is total trash. With my computer I can only run arma at minimal settings I cant play multiplayer and I can only play on one of the 3 maps. My machine is 9 years old. The graphics card is totally outdated yet I still manage with 32 fps on minimal settings. I have a bad memory leak with my shity 4gb of ram. It stops me from playing any type of multiplayer and I can only play on the smallest map Straits. Yet I still manage to have so much fun playing on a tiny map without multiplayer. Worse still I can only play for an hour before my game crashes due to the memory leak. Yet… I have over 320 hours played… That is how much this game has to offer. Id say I only experience about 5% of what arma has to offer and just look at my time played. That is how many hours you can put into this game and still be entertained.  Repetition. Most games tend to get boring after you play them for a while however good ones manage to keep you into the game for a very long time. Take civilization 5 for example. You try to play for 15 minutes but end up playing for 12 hours. Arma does the same for me. I can keep playing this game for hours at a time before I finally stop and remember how shity my computer is... That is saying something.  Fun. How this one you might find funny or bad. While arma will state that it is a “Realistic Military simulator” it has some really funny glitches and other things. I have sent my helicopter to space because I tried to land it on a quad. I have taken screenshots of some really funny death poses and body glitches. I have used a set speed script to make my tank go 500 miles per hour. It can be really fun to do however if you are not a fan of being able to do this in a “Realistic Military simulator” then that might put you down.  The steam workshop/Modding sites. One of the main reasons that this game has so much to offer is because of the mods available. There are so many great scenariosmods maps and so much more that so can simply download in a matter of minutes. I can even begin to describe them due to how diverse they are.  While I would like to make my reveiw longer… I have yet to experience the rest of arma. I will be getting a new machine soon and then I will make a full review but for now I will leave it as it is.  Overall this game is great. I can easily say that this game is worth the price and I can easily say that you will enjoy it. Even with a crappy computer I have managed to spend over 320 hours playing this game with the machine I have.   (Note) There are a few negative things that I do have problems with but I wanted to keep my review as positive as possible.10
Best Game In the arma seires yet. Love it
Closest you can get to a real life war simulator. 10/10
ood game poorly opitimized but its all about the battle royale. The mods are amazing look into  Launcher Epoch is a ton of fun and lots of loot too. DayZ but WAY better10
This game is amazing I think everybody should have it king of the hill is my favorite game on you should also try to get modded things like  life maybe Takistan overall it's a really good game I'd recommend it to anybody
its has good graifcs and gameplay the servers are as lagy as on arma 2 rlly good tanks to trucks and hellys. buy play and play .
on't know why but at 5 pm every server can't support us with our internet for some reason so be careful when buying it.10
The Shooter worlds Skyrim.
This game is really fun to play especially with friends and dont worry if you are a bit disoriented at first with all the controls and mechanics of the game you will get used to them pretty easily.
his is an ever developing MilSim. awesome realism and with the community mods out there what more can you ask for?!  Get it you will so enjoy it.10
ing Great
1/10 Ruined my entire life. Arma will ruin every single military shooter on the planet for you. If you are looking for a game that will completely cut you off from civilization Arma is the game for you!10
This game is amazing
If you want a realistic multiplayer shooter  might be a good game but the campaign is complete  the story is average the allied AI is complete  and makes some missions close to impossible cause they love to run strange ways into the enemy line of fire and they dont know how doors or stairs work the AI regularly drives over you or your troop members if you are not really really carefull I have never seen such a bad AI
No tutorial and no easy way to figure out how to play this game. A case of trying to make a simulator but not realizing it still needs to be a fun game. Not fun at all.
he game is pretty open ended which is a very good thing and gives the oportunity to have a possibly endless spectrum of gameplay experience and oportunities. From the casual gaming fun moments to the hard core full on military sim career  the easy to use moding system (i say easy but needs caution and alot of research) guaranties that the possibilities are endless. personally i came for the full on mil-sim experience and i gotta say i got all i was expecting and then some.10
amazing graphics and pretty cool gameplay got it in alpha so it was only 30bucks get it on sale as it doesnt merit 60$ yet Imo
So realistic it'll give you PTSD.
this is a hardcore militry simulator you could roleplay from marines to navy seals and has an amazing editor and unlike arma 2 it has under water experince and submarines and way better graphics now i dont play many simulators but this is one of my favorits
its great
 
Lol xD Rawr Did it for the Badge: But still a really good game. Would recommend
I would reccomend this game. :D
My rig could barely hold 20fps so i ran around in wasteland shot some people drove a guys car full of stuff off a cliff.  10/10 would run around again.
is a really good game you just have to know how to use it. I mean combat actions and stuff like that is okay and playing Arma 2 and OA it was really easy but the editor was alot different and I still dont know how to fully use it. I also dont like that on some servers it tells you you can't join because of explantions well give me a link for me to download these. Overall this game is one of my favorites and I know they can't appease everyone and its better than any other Millitary Simulator out there.10
highly reccamend
Would Recommend. Includes moments where you flip your Car for going a little to Fast on another player.
 bough this game and was thinking how cool it was gonna be by watching videos. Sadly the game nees to have a a buffy computer to have great experience and you need to download/pay for a ton of stuff to be able to play on most servers because it seems like vanilla servers are dead. I don't konw.. On the search system I tried to find TDM DM CPTF but couldn't find any and if I browsed for one I would need to pay for the apex dlc :/ Honestly this might be just me who doesn't quite have enough experience to know how this game works and stuff you can do :P I'll update this if I feel like this might be a good game after all. I have to say that if you like realistic military games then this is the perfect one it has almost everything that you would have in the army! Hopefully for my future playings I might be able to enjoy it as my wish was to since the start.-10
I used to have a job and friends. Now I have Arma.
f you're looking for an FPS like Battlefield or Call of Duty beware this is a military simulator and you will need more than reflexes and gamersense to master it.  Honestly Though:  This game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. This game is difficult with all of it's features and I love it. It is NOT easy to hit a target with a rifle from 300 yards in real life and this game matches that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life;  makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear otherwise you will have a hard time hitting your target. The AI in this game is sharp and they have great vision. They will punish you for making silly mistakes. The AI is more advanced than most average fools in other games. For someone who is military or interested in military combat this is your best choice for simulation modding and enjoyment.10
o you enjoy constant CTD? Get this. It's all it does. Get a good desktop wallpaper because you're going to be seeing it alot.10
Great choice if i do say so myself.
Great war game! Got it on my last PC for a free weekend! I had loads of fun! Thinking about purchasing it for real now!
I belive this game is the best army simulation games you can get and the game is worth the money i have played 568 hours of the game and im still not bored of playing its because there is a lot of things to explore and not just that you can download things from the steam workshop and you can put up things you have made to the steam workshop to share with your friends or to share to everybody.
est shooter since well arma2. Make sure you try its wasteland mod specifically sa-matras wasteland. the only legit version of it. Arguably arma2's version of wasteland is better but arma3 is the future.   pros: realism  cons: not enough realism (sci fi elements)10
good realistic game (y)
This is the best Army-Stratgy-War game you will ever find trust me. you NEED to GET THIS
his game is the best and worth the money spent enjoy!10
Best game ever you can play as a rabbit. 100/10 masterpice!
too pricy but from videos its fun
n my opinion much better than any of the previous Arma games. First and foremost where do i start? The animations the graphics and the physics are all improved perfectly and it just feels like you are at war! The optimization gives you much more freedom to tweak graphical settings. The Co-op just has to be the best feature knowing that everyone depends on you and you depend on everyone as a team.10
fter 3000 hours in this game I feel like I can finally write a decent review that depicts my feelings about this game.  My Review:  Excellent10
Must buy! Sure to provide hundreds of hours of gameplay!
he very best Arma that has ever been made great Game.10
o you like good ragdoll physics ?  Do you like good realistic poses to get into cover ? Do you like good reactions to your character when you get shot ?  Do you like to not get flung into the air by a rock ?  Then this is not the game for you!  However  if you said yes to any of those things  welcome brother HISSSSS  TO  ' hiss '  You can throw grenades through walls ! You can revive people through walls ! You can get killed through walls !    The possibilites are endless!  How bout you take a break from the military simulator and play a rp gamemode called Altis Life !  You can get arrested by cops ! You can smoke weed ! You can pick peaches and apples ! You can get killed for picking peaches and apples ! You can get kicked for high ping !   ITS SO FUN!  Do you want to enjoy a fun game ?  Me: Yes!  Do you have money !  Me: Eh  not realy  THEN  OFF10
Everyone knows it is a nice game
Love this game
Do people REALLY accept the price of that DLC??? I can't accept that price not what so ever until I'm provided more than enough reason to.  Love the game though. Bugs suck so much but meh whats given is pretty awesome.
ood game Its fun and it's cheap for a big game so get it :)10
mbitious but still ugly to the core just like the last Arma. Feels like you're in the world's greatest terrain sandbox but playing with G.I Joe figures instead of any realistically resembled soldiers.-10
One of the best Simulation Military Games around.
Eats time like the cookie monster eats cookies
started off quite boring for me &amp; a bit hard. The game isn't very 'noob friendly.' The controls in this game are quite weird compared to other games. However besides that the game has many multiplayer modes however only a few (about 3) are only played by the public. So if you don't like roleplaying playing a survival or a king of the hill battle then you won't like this game. This game isn't as much of a military realisim styled game as people say.    Is it worth it? Yes.  Is it fun? Kinda10
Simple.I loved it gj.Putting money on this game.
The Best war simulator I ever played! Worth to buy.
f you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter white sugar brown sugar water cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the crust is golden brown the caramel on the top crust is set and the apple filling is bubbling 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.10
ame of the year i would say. Beautiful graphics awesome maps a great groups community. This is is awesome This is 10
Great Game Very Realistic And amazing
Great game with lots of content updates and is an all around great game for the Modding Community. How ever you do need a decent computer to get good FPS. Other than that this game is amazing and i highly recommend it!
20 fps is more like 60 fps in this game :P
framerate is overrated /s
it is a lote of fun i hilly recomend this game
Would recommend like recommending you to that new restaurant that just opened up.
One of the best FPS games ive played by far recommend to anyone
Its Recomended
t has to be one of the best games i've played and i have played almost every single console and pc game out there. just literally everything about the game is incredible. the realism the gameplay just its a truly amazing game i paid $59.99 im fine with that price for future expansion of the game... constantly updating the game. i currently play  Epoch and i really enjoy the mod most of my hours are from the mod and i havent even tried the other mods yet. highly recommend the game to anyone unless your a call of duty fan boy or your a young kid. As soon as the marksman dlc comes out of course i will be getting that. so if your on the fence with this game DONT even think about NOT getting it. The one and only one con to this game is gonna have to be the opimization. If you DONT have a intel chipset its gonna be very hard to run this game i currently am using a AMD 8350 and i only get 30-low 40 fps in multiplayer server Standard settings with a GTX 960 so with me loving this game soo much i am currently saving a little money to purchase a Intel I5 4690k so i can run this game at ease with my card. So if you have a intel chipset and a decent graphics card you should be fine with this game and I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend gettng it if you dont like the vanilla game the mods make it 200% better. Men Do Real Life Young Men Play Arma Boys Play Battlefield Kids Play Call Of Duty10
fter buying a 'digital deluxe' version of this game now comes the new DLC APEX. Pretty sure the version i bought was supposed to cover all DLC but no. Another 30 odd $ US thanks you very much.10
hat can I say about ARMA.... Well I've logged well over 200+ hours on the game  mainly on CTI. But none the less the game is a masterpeice. I don't mean that it's perfect (because it is far from it). But you will find something here most FPS games will neglect or even bother to look into. REALISTIC WARFARE is the game and Dan is my name. But seriously you will not find another FPS besides BF4 that will entice you so. When you play online and you kill someone from a mile away with a very powerful sniper rifle I DARE YOU not to feel a bit giddy about it. There is something magical about this games that appeals to me above all other FPS games. When you are in a fire fight you have that feeling of being on the edge of your seat whilst your heart pumps away at the thought of respawning or even when just playing side by side with your mates and helping each other out to defeat an enemy. I have never regretted buying this game and never will! Happy hunting -DH10
his game is amazing the possibilities you have playing it are endless i would rate it a 11/4 totaly amazing game10
Must play game!
 ai but is great fun. pls buy
his game is the bomb. Coming from Arma 2 this game made many great improvements (such as allowing you to speed off road unlike Arma 2) and still kept many of the good things about it also. This game is challenging creative and overall a great experience. I would HIGHLY recomend buying the dlc pack also as it adds many great features to the game. Everything from the sounds to the character models you can tell have been worked on in great detail. If you haven't played Arma before there are some great tutorials to help you get started. This game also gets even better with friends as you can be tactical and outmanuver your enemies. I really can't say enough about this game it is just great. I would say the most annoying thing about it though is that your singleplayer saves get wiped as soon as the game is updated which is why I haven't finished it yet but besides that you should really get this game you won't regret it!10
Good game to play with friends but if you don't have friends you can find a lot of friends in the server 10/10 would buy again
i want code to play
ver 1000 hours in  and 2000ish in arma 2 This games performance ruins all gameplay mechanics no matter how amazing they are. while somedays fps is at 40-60 others (Now) 3-15 quite frankly its pathetic if i could refund it i would HOWEVER lets say u have a solid 60FPS ALLL the time then this game is 100% ing amazing and i love it when its like that the pure nature of the game is unlike all other militarys u will ever find and even though the performance sucks and makes this amazing game unplayable for the few times ive had where i go a full day on 60FPS they have been the best gaming days of my LIFE. In conclusion if u can run this game at 30FPS and beyond 100000000)% get itif you cannot get CSGO :P10
the best militry game there is!!!!  you can play for hours and never get bored. theres an amazing multiplayer with one of the best communitys i have ever seen in a game and the millions of mods there is what just make the game even better.  if your thinking about getting this game you definatly should.  100/100
I have killed like 5 people in all my playtime.
Nice game!
BUY APEX worth every penny
e: *Surrounding a small farming town with my 2 friends.* Autistic Kid: *Looks like he's trying to get a 3-wheeled tractor to drive tractor only has 2 wheels.* Me: *Shoots kid* Friend: *Inspects tractor- has an extra wheel in the back*  10/10 would watch an autistic kid try to make a tractor drive with 2 wheels when there is an extra wheel in the back again.  10
 knew what to expect going into Arma III from previous experience with Bohemia Interactive games yet I was still overwhelmed by the amount of features I had to wrap my head around before I could play it with even moderate proficiency. It’s a first-person shooter alright but it’s not another “left trigger to aim down the sights right trigger to shoot” kind of game. You’re going to have to use almost every key on your keyboard memorize specific key combinations and what each does depending on whether you’re on foot in a tank a helicopter etc.  I felt comically inept fumbling through my first few hours. With so many different firing modes stances movement speeds and other options I had difficulty just walking drawing my weapon and firing to say nothing of using my equipment making sense of the map and working with my squad. I had to wonder what my AI squadmates thought of me the clueless rookie stumbling into the bushes before I accidently pulverized myself with a satchel charge I didn’t even mean to deploy.  To make matters even more difficult in its current state Arma III doesn’t offer a real tutorial. Its Showcases (playable scenarios showing off its many features) follow a logical progression that introduce you to increasingly complicated mechanics. However they each do a poor job of explaining how to use them or how they may be useful later on. The only real instruction comes in the form of on-screen hints that tell you which keys do what. It’s an inefficient method to teach you how to fly a helicopter and practically useless when it comes to explaining the tactical value of more esoteric equipment and features.  In one of the more interesting Showcases you are given access to a non-lethal aerial drone and an armed ground vehicle drone which you can use to eliminate targets in a nearby town. After much experimentation I devised a tactic of sending my aerial drone ahead to scout and tag targets which then allowed me to coordinate mortar fire and corner enemies in the town. It was satisfying because it allowed me come up with a strategy which felt entirely my own and one which nearly no other shooter could accommodate. On the other hand there was a needless amount of frustration along the way that could have been avoided with clearer UI and better instruction.  As you can imagine Arma III’s potentially much more enjoyable when you’re playing online with real people – especially those who already know how to play and can teach us its secrets. It doesn’t have a capped player limit so in theory a server where 100 players are facing another 100 players in a gigantic sandbox where almost everything is possible is one of the best shooters I’ve ever played. But without investing long-term in a clan or other group that will ensure a reliable team of significant size those are hard to come by. In practice new players are presented with a list of servers half-full of random people who aren’t communicating and where everything that can go wrong is going wrong. Since Arma III doesn’t offer obvious incentives for players to cooperate or even funnel them to the same areas of its enormous maps multiplayer’s mostly uncurated chaos. It’s amusing in its own way but something I would rather watch in a YouTube video than it play myself.  Counterintuitively smaller matches are more fun for a new player trying to find his way in this world. In one pick up co-op game six fellow players and I (and a group of AI bots) were tasked with a simple mission: find a way off the island. We spawned at a random spot along the coast and were given two locations miles away where we could find a boat or a helicopter for extraction. We ended up not even making it halfway to either destination but I enjoyed our journey quite a lot. We heard a gunship in the distance and dashed across a field to take cover in a forest. We stumbled upon and successfully seized an enemy outpost where we commandeered a truck. We arrogantly tried repeating the same strategy with a larger town on our way to an airfield... and were caught in the open by snipers. This is what developers mean when they talk about emergent gameplay and it’s where Arma III shines.  Altis and Stratis the two islands that serve as its massive military sandboxes (270 km² and 20 km² respectively) are truly impressive and the foundations that make everything else about  possible. Whether you’re scuba diving to disable mines or sniping from a church atop a high hill everything looks crisp and sufficiently believable... as long as you don’t look too close. There’s an obvious amount of recycled assets used to fill all this space and many empty buildings. With its overall clinical style Arma III can seem sparse even boring when you stop to smell the roses.  Its sound design however is disappointing at any distance. It suffers from laughably cheesy electronic music and sound effects that make some actions feel insignificant vehicle movement and firing in particular. For all I know that’s what tanks and helicopters really sound like but it makes them feel like toys.  But like I said this is a game where we have to make our own fun and at least Arma III makes that much relatively easy with a built-in mission editor and Steam Workshop integration. It’s inherited the modding community that brought us such hits as DayZ and as its marketing materials insist Arma III really is a “platform” more than a stand-alone game and what it may evolve into in the months and years after release adds immeasurable replay value to its $60 asking price.  Arma III’s complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend but once you’re comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure you’re able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat that’s simply not offered elsewhere. Weak sound and a sparsely decorated map are forgivable making Arma III’s nearly endless content definitely worth experiencing as long as you know there’s a long dark tunnel to get through before you can see the light.10
10/10 would glitch again
ts okay performace is a nightmare even if you optimise the game but I guess thats what you get for using the since 2001  disclaimer: i dont actually know for sure if the engine was made in 2001 i heard it and im too lazy to google it please dont ing lynch me10
een playing since the original BIS Operation Flashpoint in 2001 (now ArmA series) which has come a long way since it's still the best overal Military game / sim that's out there :)10
It's aight
Honestly the best game ive ever played.
Very good spawns in Gun Game
Game of The Year! Even after the release was Published in 2013! 10/10~
I built my PC so I could play this game. This is the only reason I spent over 500 dollars on a computer. This is such an underrated game. Although this isn't a game for casual gamers. Only the hardcore gamers will enjoy . It is by far the best shooter I've played. I will be purchasing any DLC for it on the day of the realease.
Amazing game! Two thumbs up.
This game is Amazing but does have its moments online co-op like getting shot through walls. But this game is well worth the money even though its in alpha its has so much to offer for the engine platform it uses is amazing. the graphics are outstanding for multiplayer. over all I would give the game a 7 out of 10 on Campaign and a 10 out of 10 on Multiplayer just because the Campaign is kinda hard in the beginning of it the Multiplayer you have a good community of players on the coop. I just love it i will keep playing this game until Bohemia Interactive comes out with Arma 4 if they do it will be hard to top this game and the cooperation of other players. they just need to add more stuff but its still in alpha.
Really great game. Put in so many hours. Different types of game play and many mods. I fully recommend this game.
military simulation game it have some great moments CAN be fun
ood Game But Too many GlitchDie For No Reason (5.1/10)10
 has stopped working  420/10 would buy Karts
he most joy you will get from this game isn't in the playing itself but instead the creating of your own custom content and seeing others enjoy it.10
is a eagerly welcomed upgrade from Arma 2. The new stance system upgraded engine and water gameplay truly helps you experience the life of a military operator. The best part is that the modding community is stronger than it was for arma 2 with mods ranging to advanced AI to weapon resting and custom gear to real world weapons this game does everything better. Arma is the only game you're going to find where it's a good idea to find you're grandpa's old army handbooks.10
I like this game when I get bored of Cs
rmA3 brings me back to the original OpFlash games with slightly less clunky feeling controls. They were always the downfall in these games. I know the 'Simulation' that these games are trying to offer do exhibit what would be deemed as clunky controls but ArmA3 strikes a great balance between realism and gameplay.10
ather a group of friends and play on a wasteland server! Very fun and very intense gameplay if you go for the missions that pop up on the map but make sure you gather resources like good weapons armor food and water beacause your enemies will.10
its very fun and amazing escpecailly battle royale
ilitary simulation at its best. If you want to try something different other than arcade COD/BF definitely give this a try.10
this is not a game you play on your own. youll be missrable
i dont even own this game XD
Top  t
an max this game out graphically and you are in for quite the treat! This game is incredible in the short time I have played it. Did most of the tutorials and simulators and started Campaign mode. I absolutely love the realistic way of the shooter (if you can even call it that). They did plenty of research and work for this simulator and it shows.   I would recommend this over any other title in the genre any day. Looking to take a break from the run and gun? Arma is your answer.10
There do not exist a better realistic tactical shooter out there. The mod support is also a bonus.
ood Campaign Excellent Graphics Fun RP10
You know. This game is great! If you love flying helicopters and getting hookers!You will die to play this game forever! I know when i first bought it all i did was watch my guy sit on a rock! Its like im watching a second me watching another person play this game watching a hooker inside a game inside another game! what im trying to say is... This game has hookers!!!! GET IT!
Absolutely   the best war sim out there. I can play as the Mujahideen (the bees knees of the opposing forces) and bomb my enemy with C4 strapped to my scrotum. 9/11 would bomb again.
any 1 givin  away i would be most gratefull
Love this game amazing game to play meet new friends hang out with friends i would recommend this game to everyone i knew.
L;DR Score: 9.0/10  Quick Review: Just from playing a few game modes (it has many) the games are endless. good with friends good anticheat i personly play Altis Life gamemode alot since its basicy a better gmod in terms of graphics. Controls are still a bit like you want to scream at your guy however it does still get tweaked here and there with updates still rolling last i saw. Tons of replayability.  Pros: » Tons of diversifying gamemodes. » Ok-ish graphics » Good anti-cheat » Some major communities you can get involved in.  Cons: » Feels like my character is unable to follow simple 'turn the  around' orders sometimes. » not much major difference compared to Arma 2 in graphics but i might be wrong (been a while)  Main Review: Again as with Arma 2 review iv not played much besides king of the hill and Altis Life (which i love) but the game has improved alot has a ton of gamemodes all varying from each other alot and a massive amount of items in the game. (weapons gear armour clothing etc) hell iv not even scratched the surface of what to expierience in the game yet nor have i done the basic operations on single player. xD  Any Updated Review:10
reat game fun especially on Altis Life and Wasted crazy Kavala will have you in stiches and you'll never want to leave your seat with the plentiful events and activitys to do with your friends during the game. Truly amazing game bashed it allot.10
 owned it once but for some reason i dont anymore i didn't refund it idk but it was cool while i had it the campain was hard dough10
beautiful game and good fun with friends
love the game so glad i got this!!
I got in an Altis Life server and was arrested for stealing a police truck
It's pretty good  when you have mods.
ingleplayer  -It has it's own Unique Features in every aspect of the Game it has it's own style. -The Game is just Simply Perfect. -It has loads of fun playing in Singleplayer.  Multiplayer -Once you've step up on Multiplayer I think you couldn't go back on Singleplayer unless if you don't have an Internet Connection. -The different Gamemodes of Multiplayer is just Simply Fantastic! -The Gameplay of different Gamemodes is really awesome! -Tons of good words that I could say.  **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** What are you waiting for?  Buy it Try it and Play it now!10
Amazing army simulator that's more than just 'DayZ.' Buy this game if you want a more realistic experience than 'Call of Duty' or 'Battlefield.'
his game is well worth the cash. It has a pretty hefty price tag I know but the gameplay is amazing. I can't describe how beautiful the game is even with a lower setting. With ultra the game is just gorgeous.  is so well optimized you could be playing from medium to high in almost any decent rig. The number of things you can do in this game is almost unlimited. From tactical ground combat to flying multiple CAS &amp; AA jets. Not to mention Various helicopters that come in civilian armed or plain gunships are really fun with friends. Tanks ranging from high armor and huge  guns to lighter Anti- Air tanks. Armored vehicles such as APC's to trucks equipped with fully automatic grenade launchers. Theres so many things you can do at almost any time. Having to master your flying skills to shoot down another jet or getting a kill 1100 meters away with a .50 cal sniper rifle gives you a surreal feeling and is indeed very rewarding. This game takes patience and with time and practice it will give you lot of satisfaction.  Further more if for whatever reason you dislike the gameplay or get bored (which is highly unlikely especially with friends) remember that this game has an active community who constantly makes multiple mods of almost any genre all available for free at anytime. Zombies may interest you if you have moved from DayZ or the Dayz mod from Arma 2 in which both can be replaced with much better graphics and gameplay.   10/10 a must have game in your library!10
This game is fricking amazing its got HD textures and the driving and shooting is well thought out and that just makes this a whole lot better. There is nothing I dislike in the game
recommended !
Arma for life
et frankie sada and psisyndicate. 10/1010
 ton of content community content of course. -not allowed to pick up  DLC GUNS IF YOU KILLS SOMEONE10
just as good if not better than Arma 2
got one word for y'll 'epic'
Victor Troshka approves
Ran than jumped off a stone wall than flew like supa man than flew to my death 11/10 BEST GAME NA
ell after a short time in this game i could instantly see that it's rubbish tho i gave it a couple of minutes of more testing and while it was enjoyable.. i can't find a single reason to give this game even one more minute of my time.-10
 very good gamestill needs some work on it. I love the arma games and this is the best yet. Keep up the great work guys.10
This sucks balls compared to A2.
Only game I really play on steam now. Highly recommend getting it if you like realism in games
ried to run it got to the title screen that's it. 7/10 would play again10
his price is outragous i cant speand this kind of cash. sure this game is great but still i want it but for like 20$ pliz.  10
Really good game! Highly reccomend
is a semi-new game that was released in 2013 and it is thriving with players! From game modes of Team Death Match King of the Hill Zombies and Roleplay  has tons of game modes for you to play! My absolute favorite game mode is King of the Hill where three teams pit themselves off against capturing and holding a point there are vehicles a leveling system and different weaponry and perks all included with a cash system.    is open for modders in the Steam Workshop and this increases great chances for the game to survive upon the universe of gaming in general. Modding is perfect for games because players can do the work they can create what they feel is needed what they want to see in a server and what they know is perfect for the community.   Good things:   -Great combat  -Tactical combat and meant for strategy not run &amp; gun  -Has Steam Workshop support and availability great for modders who want to help the  community out!  -Plenty of gamemodes ensuring to keep you endlessly drooling for what may happen next  -Plenty of vehicles   -Large full scale maps with the ability to go inside almost every building  -Destructible enviroments (limited to some different entities)  -Amazing campaign and tutorial (the tutorial kept me entertained for a good while)   Bad things:   -The game has a semi-steep learning curve to it  -Some minor bugs like playermodel glitching etc  -Things arn't fully destructable like in the Battlefield 4 engine (but good enough)  -Graphics may seem outdated on some models  -It's abit hard to get into the game as a new player but you'll grind into the game eventually   Neutralities:   -The game requires teamwork and a mic if you want to be involved in so although there are many lonewolfs out there  -Your average PC might be able to handle it it all depends  -Cats enjoy watching you play it (atleast mine does)  -You may have tons of fun in this game if you know how to play it in your own special ways wether it is transporting toops via aircraft or by infantry squads/ground missions to full-fledged combat in the many suburban towns of the maps in   Overall I  do  recommend this game to anyone and everyone that is around 14+ of age whom can understand how to work things and avoid the sharp learning curve along with that I really do hope that for any of you that have quit the game because of the learning curve to give the game a few more tries as I did this before and I came back loving the game.  If you'd like you can add me and play with me on  Garry's Mod TF2 CS:GO Battlefield 4 and many other games that all of you should commonly know if you're an average gamer anyways take care.  10
I regret buying this game. It reminds me of the sensation you get after stepping in wet puppy  while walking to the bathroom in the morning.

uch freedom very tactics much stress wow10
irst i want to start off with the graphics... AMAZING!!! Next it is a fun game many many many game modes to play. I think there is some gamemodes that seem nerdy like RPG but give it a try it is fun. This game with the graphics it is hard to run but you can also optimize it a bit and when i mean a bit you can increase the fps 10-15 with easy steps. Sum it up GET IT!!10
is a military simulator. It's not supposed to be played like Call of Duty or Battlefield where you run and gun but you most certainly can. It helps to play this game with other people because the AI isn;t very helpful. There is also the problem with bugs that come with any Arma game. You will break your legs from running around you will get trapped in the world and you will get stuck doing simple actions; you will also love every minute of it. When you learn how to deal with these issues the game is an absolute blast.The draw of the game isn't the base game it is the mods. Just like Arma 2 this game will have a long lifespan because of mods like Arma LIfe Epoch Battle Royale Breaking Point... just to name a few. Just be sure before to watch some videos or read the instructions on various websites before you mod the game so that you don't have to reinstall your game or spend hours trying to figure out what you did wrong.  9/10 Would fly a helicopter into a tank again bring a friend but please fix the annoying bugs.10
ros:  Better Graphics Better Controls Better Sound  Cons:  Same laggy multiplayer as Arma 2 Same terrible interaction system Still using outdated Arma 2 mod tools (All mods are just ports) Most vehicles and weapons are the same between factions just different textures Still uses 2004 Netcode Its trying to be more casual  As of right now I do not feel as if this game is worth the $60 it still plays like it's in Alpha. Unless they release proper mod tools I would not buy until it drops atleast 50% in price.-10
Does not contain traces of nuts.   0/10
 find  hard to play. It's single player is though the AI is merciless and some game mechanics are hard to get under control.   But wow  really comes to live when you play this game online with other people. There are tons of good fun servers you could lose yourself in for days. Doing missions taking hours at an end under professional leadership from an HQ pilots Squad Leaders and your mates.   You get to know them. You don't want to die. You leave no man behind. And after a while you try to take leadership. And people give you that.   The game is though the community takes that and owns that toughness by making the rules on yourself as a player though. No lone wolfing this isnt Battlefield. This is a battlefield.  10
To much fun
Brilliant graphics and aazazing multiplayer gameplay!!!!!! 5 stars
his game is the . If you haven't played it then you should probably save your money instead of buying cases in CS:GO. Only problem I have is that the game is only optimized for Intel Processors so basically anyone who bought a AMD processor is screwed. With a team as big as they have you would think they would work on it. Especially for all the people who spent money on this game but never got to experience it as they should have.10
you can see your legs when you look down in first person 10/10
Best army game 10/10
yes i red rconnend it but its not working on my computer it was a waste of money
This game is one of the best I've ever played on PC. Amazing player interaction and very realistic gameplay. This game took military simulations to a whole new level. Definetly worth it.
This game was so fun until this new Apex DLC came out and completely ruined the game and play style and the new UI is cancer. I just wanted to play it i opened it then realized it has the Apex DLC and i slowly moved my cursor over to the X in the top right and clicked... RIP 
this game is great
h Man I Still Remember The Old ... So First Off Yes The Graphics are Pretty and so are details. Theres many stuff to do in this game like  Installing Mods Co-op Maps Weapons And So On.. Animations Works Good I Remember the old animations on  Alpha it was back then the game wasnt really that good as now Animations is changed. Weapons and DLC's Adds in the game and  Updates Come Often.  Now The Servers Are Fun Playing on To. There is Roleplay Mods Missions Dayz and more. The Price is little bit to high do i think 3599-3999 Euro Would Be Okay For A Game Like This But if youre into these games i recommend this game for you Its Fun Playing with friends ALOTS OF FUN!.  10/10 Well Made ! Impressive Game !10
ost if not all reviews of this game took place before they had a campaign workshop support and Zeus. I love this game... Thats all i have to say.10
he premier military simulator.  This game encompasses so much of what can be done in a video game. I've spent a long time mastering small sections of the game but the level of content here is an ocean.  Want to master the handling of medium range assault rifles? That'll take a very long time to become a proficient master and even then you need to get used to special conditions (night combat ranges recoil of the different rifles).  Want to master helicopter flight? Don't even get me started. The flight model is excellent and mastering just one model is going to take you quite a while.  Beyond just the detail in each mechanic is the fun had here. Multiplayer servers are sandboxes and turn the game into a free-roam adventure with open-ended goals. Alternatively you can join servers where you are part of a cohesive unit fighting against other players or AI. 10
 don't even know where to begin with .   Pro's: Realistic combat that really gets your heart pumping at time. Realistic scenarios complete with standing by to stand by while you wait for your commander. Fun that just makes you smile for hours and hours.  Con's:  framerates online regardless of your system. It simply doesnt matter what you run for a system. You will have poor frame rates if there are more than 20 people in your game. Desync detracts from a lot of the fun however you can generally play through most of it.10
/10 buggy but it's still to roleplay every once in a while10
Awsome game ;)
its such a fun game its little laggy but i have a crapy pc careful thouth only buy this game if your ok with kinda curdey multiplayer and the occasional crash the map tends to not loaded corectly and your haveing fun when oh no battle eye dident respond so please crlt+alt+delete in this game is fun as hell and im a big fan
 DO NOT READ IF YOU'RE HERE FOR AN ARMA LIFE REVIEW ~   is a great game. Although it can be hard to enjoy it when you are constantly playing on domination servers with frustrating teammates. That is why it is important for the players who are interested in the tactical militaristic simulator Arma is meant to be that they get in touch with the many groups out there. I was so bored on Arma until I found my group now I actually play with a group who know each other by name and don't just mouth you all the time.   + Great Game Highly recommend! + Huge amount of mods to improve gameplay + Amazing private communities!!!!! +MODS &amp; MAPS +Mods lol   - Vanilla AI are  - Public servers can be frustrating with noob pilots and high pitched children.10
his game has destroyed my life graphics are amazing im addiceted halp Plz stahp the fun i got like to many hours #PRAY4CONOR10
This is a very Fun game and worht the money if u like it sure some parts could be a little berter but over all it is a really good game I can get 30 FPS on a muitiplayer server with a 500$ labtop
Not as good as Arma 2 but ok might get better with the time.
ood game. I probably spend too much time playing it but there is just so much to do.10
Watch your back
Its the greatest game i ever seen in my whole life
This game is extremely well-made.
Best of its kind ot their. However you need to be a patient learner as their is a steep learning curve and i would recomend finding a group or friends to teach you
asily one of the best games I ever played. Lots of game mods customizations and a rly good comunity. Add to that some constant updates and u got yourself a true triple A game. Beware though that u may need some time to get used to the controls if u havent played any of the arma series.10
I shoot at 3 men in a field   Killed a goat  11/10
great game most realistic fps and a lot of fun content to play with
t's one of the best FPS/Simulation games out there to enjoy non realisticly or realisticly however you want to play it. Really fun without friends to easily meet and make friends online but if you play this game with friends mod-wise or vanilla you will have a blast I can guarantee.  The most fun I had was the cooperation servers on Linux server betas where we all worked together to destroy the enemy and unlike any other game the AI is pretty smart to notice you're not a friendly. So it is challenging to fight against them and its fun new experiences all the time that's just the vanilla out of one gamemode. There is plenty to try and I really do suggest this game if you love working in a clan or solo against the enemy.10
 enjoyed playing this game on the free weekend but I don't think this game is worth $60. By now it should have dropped a little and Arma II should be free buy now.  10
This Game Is Very Very Awesome.
This game is the most realistic tactical simulator there is. I've spent many hours playing it and trying out different mods and i can guarantee you that it is worth every dollar.
 If you like to use a compass cordinates and other things to calculate range and place of the enemy and don't understand like every person who plays the game this game is for you         +The Realistic graphics Mil. Simulator. KoTh Altis Life Battle royal And zombie MODES wasteland and many other modes. and LOTS of running if u don't have a car like in wasteland.....Or exile/Epoch..........Or Altis Life................OR KoTH............OR almost every mode. 10
This game is great. if you say its bad........ i will cut you
its gay you idiot why make a game which is gay
Great Game! worth every cent!
ery hard to get bored of I love military games myself and this is by far my most favorite game and I haven't even played much.10
 started of playing ArmA 2 but came out somewhat frustrated because of the controls and interface the game explored new concepts but was not an enjoyable or intuitive interace.  and a completley different expirience for me. The game still looked and felt like ArmA 2 but they have fixed my few problems that I had with the previos game making probebly the best expirience in a game ive had in a long time The map 'Armory 2' by Happy Comedy makes the game easier to learn alowing players to test out vehiclels a must have map. The 60 dollar price point can turn people off but trust me if you are looking for vehiclels guns boats scuba diving drones tanks cars planes helicopters and a @#$% ton of amazing and cool mods this game is definitly for you.  -Fuze10
Played it for some time when it was free BEST GAME EVA if ya have the muneyz buy this! :) it has allot of mods to so :*
I can be a rabit 10/10
Amazing Game with a great community.
Pretty amazing game lots of addons and user made missions to play would reccomend 10/10
 will not be recommending this game to my gaming group for two reasons:  1. The interface is not intuitive. During the tutorial I was unable to find and install a scope onto my rifle. The tutorial could not go on even though I had a scope mounted on my weapon.  2. The designers chose to have the characters use unprofessional language.-10
ust dont buy it......it needs a NASA pc to play (no 30fps is not playable in this game....dev why u do this??? then you can have 35fps in solo but 4 fps in multiplayer!!!??? again why? (while in multi we have lesser players/aircraft e.t.c.) most servers are rpg's....almost no coop server. its VERY HARD to find real strategy/realism/gameplay here.....the vids you see on youtube do happens but its very rare....dont buy it.  is maybe the worst game i have ever bought after shogun 2..... and i really wanted to buy it....-10
is a great game making many improvements on Arma 2. But it does'nt feel like its finished yet I know it's still being updated but as its out of beta I thought it would have more than what is has at the moment. Saying that it's still worth a pick up.10
ifficult absorbing I want it so badly.10
absolutely love it
ve been playing since release and have expierenced so many great moments with this game. The potential is huge with thousands of missions on the steam workshops and many great mods. The Devs really work hard on the game and have made many great improvements since release like when they improved the gun sounds (MASSIVE improvment). This game will provide hundreds of hours of fun no moment like the other in the 2 islands the game offers (although a third will be soon released). The only semi negative point I have is the multiplayer. I find the gamemodes that allow for regular combat simulation (not talking about 100% simulation) are pushed down by gamemodes like altis life (a gamemode I love don't get me wrong and others like wasteland. The game offers huge customization vehicles and weapons like for example static AA launchers static MG's just as a vague example all of which aren't used in the popular gamemode. It would be great if it was simpler to find gamemodes such as a good PVP server where you play as a soldier and no 'money' to buy weapons just a good simulation where both steams are palyer and just fight10
Hey guys can i run this game on my pc ? If i can how may FPS will i have  I5 cpu  Ram: 8   Graphics: GTX 960 GAMING 2G    power supply 500 w  Mother: Gigabyte  Hdd : 1 TB
ell. This is going to be gud.  First off was playing King of the Hill.  So I was running around and a  sitting on a hill killed me.  Then I respawned was hiding in a house and stairs killed me #fakyoustairs  Then I got in a chopper and some  kamikazid me what a .  Then I ran into a wall the wall killed me.  Fell through the floor of a house.  builder #BlameTheBuilders.  Then I got a jet. May or may not of recreated 911   There is my review of . THEY ARE NOT BUGS THEY ARE FEATURES!!!! :D10
best game ever. it is fun a while with the singleplayer editor and campaign but the real fun begins at multiplayer and mods
o play this game properly I highly recommend watching Brandon Buzards Guides on YouTube on how to tweak your PC for higher Performance. Also his video on how to optimize  was a huge help. I went from avg. 15-20 FPS to 40-60 FPS. Without these tutorials this game will be hard to enjoy.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LwIfcW0EnY   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgckg16UC-Y  (They are about 2h but its worth it)10
best game to ever be created  especially if you have the kart dlc :D 9.333333333333/10       half life 3 confirmed?
not bad needs a few improvements
This game is really fun i would stongly recomend it. It is good to have freinds to play with.
TactiCOOL
attle Royale is one of the BEST mods for the game.     'It's like the Hunger Games with guns.'   -Wernher Von Kerman10
u shuut guns and fly helicopters wich is fun bt hard i giv this gaim 10/10
As real as military simulators get. Barebones.Hardcore.Challenging.  This game is not for wussies.
ust purchased Arma3 on the 50% of sale. I have to say I am a huge Arma2 fan but I was blown sky high when I started playing Arma3. The reviews somehow just did not do it justice for a big Arma2 fan. I actually did not know if it was that much different form Arma2. I was so wrong. Arma3 is better in every way so far. Weapons graphics sound player interaction UI menus etc. etc. I have only had it for one day now and it is by far my best PC purchase in a long time. Also I have bought into all of the survival games on EA to which even though I am happy to support the games i chose to support none of them have become fun to play for me. I like DayZ Mod and let me tell you Breaking Point for Arma3 is the answer! You get a zombie game plus all those vehicles and weapons! The Epoch servers are also so much fun in Arma3 vehicles everywhere on some of them planes helis tanks...etc. So much fun. Good Job Bohemia Interactive and Good Job to all the modders out there!10
Been with the series since the original flashpoint. There's simply nothing else like it. It's versatility exceeds anything else out there. Wholeheartedly recommended
a great game! if you can run it........
ake me back to the better days or Arma 2. :(  The mods were better the movement was better the controls were better the optimisation was better there was even less hacking.  Not sure if I'm bias because I've had such a crappy time with  and such a great time with Arma 2 but I would honestly recommend Arma 2 over  in a heartbeat.-10
nice shoot :D
If you like open word shooters this game is EPIC! best to get with friends
I watched ISIS molest a goat.
First time playing arma was unexpected to say the least. Classic king of the hill match. Im apart of a team of SIX guys in a ghost hawk with some stanger that came along. We enter the AO in the heli. We begin taking fire from both sides. One shot takes out the back roter. All you hear is JUMP NOW! Only 3 of my group jump out and the rest blow up in the air. I land in a tree and my two other group members are no where to be found. We meet up only to be BLOWN UP by a nade.   12/10 Nades
10/10 would buy again - and in 10 Years it might run without fps drops :D
014 Best Military Simulator available for the general public. make sure you try out the mod King Of The Hill (KOTH) 10
bout the singleplayer  it comes as a combat simulation mainly simulating various combat situations. Now the game is more about the multiplayer. The multiplayer can be scripted which means you can have every mod you want. There are roleplay mods  king of the hill  deathmatch and so on. I would clearly recommend buying the game.10
nlike Arma 2   can give much more. Not that Arma 2 is bad its just that  is like gmod. If you want to play DarkRP you join a server other than downloading the addons and only picking from a small ammount of servers sometimes. Along with the ease of access to the numerous amounts of gamemodes it also has a certian play style to it.10

get this
he game is just great sadly im waiting for some better hardware to play it xD I bought it when it was 25€ on alpha. No regrets at all! Love the series. From arma 2 i feel so much improvement in the game its amazing.10
Bad game. Horrible game engine. System requirements for what? Nope company. Few models. Multiplayer always glitches. Waste of money.
rove 10 minutes to get to the objective i hit a tree and my ATV broke. Had to run for 20 minutes to the obj. and got immediatly shot. 10/1010
Great came especially with mods installed. And a great game to play with a large group of friends would recommend 10/10
10/10 best game in a while haha just because...
ros - This is by far my go to PC game of all time. Are you looking for a gaming experience like no other? Then go with Arma. I've been an Arma veteran for awhile and don't regret any minute I've put into the game. Yes you do need a somewhat powerful PC to get the best Arma experience but the community and the people that you will meet while playing the game are what makes it amazing. Check out the video I linked below with some 'Wasteland' gameplay with friends I've met through playing the game! Hope this helped!   https://youtu.be/EZHJVrx7wX8   Cons - Controls are  and not as optimized as it could be.10
Great Game!!! a more Adult Battlefield 4. Good Graphics and the Best Modz Ever!
eart game enjyed a lotbut not much of a multiplayer game..10
Help i c.u.n.t run this on my Toaster
Phenomenal military simulation
y mods dont count most of my hours 1k+  best game i have ever bought honestly.  all the mods they have for it its a game you can get sucked into for hours on end and not realize it.  a must buy.10
 highly recommend  if you're into Army games with a (high) sense of realism. You can make this game as awesome as you want yourself. Depending on which (modded) gamemodes you play or with who you're playing. I'm part of one of the largest  clans out there (Joint Task Force 2) and it really adds to the experience having a Tactical Realism based clan. Think of stuff like Basic Training military rank structure working with a chain of command teamplay based on military tactics and manoeuvers etc.  check us out over at  www.jointtaskforce2.com 10
Absolutely phenomenal game. Expect lack luster performance on AMD chipsets though.
absolutly amazing game!
Terribly optimized and leaves you wondering what the difference is between this and Arma 2. The entire arma series needs an overhaul. The only keeping these games alive are player made mods. Wish Novalogic still made games.
or the tactical junkie. NOT for those who want another Call of Duty. Even Battlefield and Ghost recon (some of the best shooters of our time) don't stack up to the tactical and realism aspects of this game. There is a LOT to learn about playing this game. It's very control-intensive and takes a lot of memorizing how to execute certain functions. This is truly a simulation not a typical shooter.  This game gets extra points for its expandability and modability.  Only negative points: Can be difficult to learn (but worth it!) is a little slow to respond to control movements (sort of adds to realism though) and there is not enough campaign (yet).10
ike it's predecessor  really raises the bar in the gaming industry. Graphics Beautiful... Physics Fluid... Gameplay... Enagaging... You won't find a shooter like it! The number of mods is growing rapidly and that's what really makes the Arma series what they are today. As with Arma 2 you are purchasing a game with many separate games embedded for mulitplayer or singleplayer.  Due to the fact that this game is full release there are no major issues and it's only recently been available! However I would recommend waiting for a sale or buying this game elsewhere as I do think £40 is a little steep atleast for me.10
f you like buggy  that doesn't work this is the game for you. Thank you Bohemia for another glorious crapfest.-10
Back In Highschool I ran Track. This one kid...lets call him 'Ray' was overweight and very slow. Near the end of my highschool experience he got stronger and thinner...but at the end of the day he was still slow..Way to slow he just ran slow...he wasn't ment to run.  This game has little content. FPS problems will occur on most high populated servers...sometimes regardless of hardware. Not worth 60 bones.
 you thats why
his is a great game. They've fixed a lot of the wonkiness from Arma 2 and the community workshop adds TONS of content.10
t's a amazing simulator it has amazing communcation techniuges the bring gamers toghethor and make them use there brain more.10
DON'T PLAY WITH JOHN COS HES A FK-ING LYING PIKEY TW@T SRSLY
rma three fits into the modern FPS category very poorly its not a bad game its just not CoD a better category would be TFPS Tactical First Person Shooter cause thats what it is its also a very fun and challenging game.10
ood game much game mode.10
I PLAY THIS GAME ALOT GOOD GAEM YES FUN
o you like to spend 30 minutes waiting to get deployed only to have your helicopter shot down by an enemy jet? How about spending 20 minutes to get the the AO only to realize that your team has already captured it? Do you want to know the feeling of waiting for hours to get into combar just like real life? If you want real military simulation (including the time it takes to get into combat) then this game is for you.10
This game is 'ok'.
2700hours and still playing.
Pretty gud if you're not a CoD pleb
reat and adictive game and even more addictive when you start to install mods A little buggy. 9/1010
Because  physics.
great game. 11/10 if you dont mind it murdering your system
his game is like no other.  I have many hours spent in every build of this game from Alpha to release and I can proudly say that I enjoyed every single one of them.   This isn't a game for everyone there is no real guidance on what you are intended to do the tutorials are confusing and you will find yourself dying from all directions in combat missions. Much of the game's fun is drawn from the sheer uniqueness of it's conflicts - from small 4 man espionage missions at night to full on assaults with armored sections and infantry alike. There are few games that I could irrefutably consider a true sandbox and  is probably one of the best sandbox experiences around with practically limitless mission oppurtunities from the community due to the excellent mission designer already implemented.   Visually this game is absolutely breathtaking at high settings - night time is probably the most stellar with it's pitch black atmosphere and night vision opticals are almost a definite requirement - vehicle lights and weapon lights cast beams through the shroud of night tracer rounds meander across the vast fields of Altis destroyed vehicles emit a vicious explosion and emit plumes of smoke. Daytime is equally impressive with Arma's mesmerizing sky boxes and vast expanses of land which seem to travel infinitely.   I don't feel like writing more right now but ultimately  is a visually stunning virtually endless sandbox of military endeavours.10
ecommend to anyone who likes any sort of combat game. Has great balance of first person combat and vehicle (sea land and air) combat.  The weapons don't customise very much but that doesnt matter so much as there is a VERY wide range of weapons and attachments. Very well optimised and runs smoothly on all occasions. The only problem is if you are playing online with a computer running at low settings as you cannot see enemys as clear or as far away as those with higher grade computers can and sometimes becomes annoying. But the game is worth the purchase just for the campain.10
Really great game i recommend many downloadable mods and playable servers for everyone to enjoy!
his game is very realistic and i like it a lot. It has every thing guns vehicleseditors good AI Its better than eny call of duty game10
This is a game changer. The games given me loads of entertainment!  It may be a lot but I see people pay $20 for a movie that gives 2 hours of entertainment and this game has given me nearly a thousand hours.... I have no life now.....................................
Military nerds! Buy this game for all the military porn you can play with.
o be honest i might go for arma 2 this time i dunno i think it has more... besides it's cheaper and it has dayz as well nice community (both actually) but there is something  has never came up with..... bikes man i use bike as weapons here real talk... what are you going to do when you are out of AMMO!? i till what to do use a bike simple as dat deadly yet convenient.10
My tank hit a bunny and exploded. Anti tank bunnies- great game fully recommended.  1500/10
2 Words: CORE CLANNNNNN
id two drug runs. Bought a gun took two people hostage. Made them phone the police. Killed two police officers. I was then tazed and arrested then put in jail. Someguy flew in with a helicopet and broke me out. 11/10.10
Awsome Game ..
this is a good game!
or anyone planning to buy this game be advised. This game is more like a platform and not something you buy and get a similiar experiene than the majority. This game is fueled by the amazing community making mods and missions and that is what makes it stand out above the rest. From hardcore milsim modes trough battle royale and king of the hill to role-playing servers this game can be played hundreads maye even thousands of different ways10
reat gameplaygraphics and content but can be daunting when first starting out. The tutorials are a must and also watching video tutorials helped a lot. Definitely worth sticking with.10
The game is very fun but the 20$ for a helicopter dlc is completely insane.
ou pretend to have fun but the framerate is just so bad...I like it  9/10 the only exception for getting 30fps in a game10
 realistic military simulator based on the island of Altis and Stratis.  There is a campaign and multiplayer. The campaign is not that interesting since the multiplayer is where it's all at.  You can play gamemodes such as King of The Hill Wasteland Battle Royale and Life Mods.  This is not a fast paced game. You can not just run up to building expecting to kill someone. You have to slowly advance and make sure you are not going to get shot at if you were to stand up.  Shooting is really difficult if you stand up it is nearly impossible to aim crouching is easier and going prone is very easy to aim with.  The game has a virtual Linux and Mac port meaning it is not a native port. All though the performance is nearly identical to Windows. The port is an open beta and may be discontinued if the developers feel there is no reason to maintain it. There is no Battleye (Anti-Cheat) workshop scenario support (crashes on start) with this port and the game is slightly outdated. Meaning that servers running on Windows PCs (using the latest version) will not be able to play with Linux and Mac users sadly. I really wish they go on with this port.10
10/10 would fly my teammates straight into the side of a mountain again
ood game the freedom of choice to play multiple game modes. Spent way to many hours playing life servers.10
started game -runs around like a idiot -suddenly hearing gunshots hits the ground besides me -start looking around in panic stioll hearing the gunshots -seeing two of my AI teamates die infront of me -run uphill while the rest of the force fires rockets and all that stuff into the entrance of the enemy camp -after five minutes it is very quet -realize that everyone of the ais i landed with is dead -tries to go to camp -hearing one shot and im dead  10/10 would run towards a enemy camp while watching your teamates die around you10
reat for realism and simulation enthusiasts. But if your just buying this for wastelands or because you liked DayZ you can promptly  off and not get this game.10
e and my team took down a enemy tank on 'Escape Altis'. We forced the tankcrew out and killed them then proceeded to repair the tank. We drove for about 1 mile and then hit a rock the tank flew away and we escaped Altis.  10/10 would escape in a plane-tank again!10
I can't tell you how good this game is. Insanely good. And then times that by the biggest number you can imagine. There I  can  tell you how good this game is.   Lets lay down the basics:  Kids Play CoD 'hard lads' play Battlefield Real men play .   The mods are extremely extensive. Heard of DayZ? There are no longer DayZ mods due to obvious reasons but Epoch and Overpoch are pretty much the same as it. Like the Hunger Games series? try Battle Royale. Like massive open-world money-based (ingame of course) team deathmatches? A3Wasteland is your mod. And then there are the singleplayer mods. Iron Front the WW2 squad based one (which I believe is multiplayer too) Dynamic Universal War Simulator a massive war of which you are pretty much a field generalblowing up those damn OPFOR kiddos. These are only a few examples of what are to come if you just buy this game.  And could I forget the voice commands? GlovePIE or VAC whatever your thing is you can just shout into your mic THREE SUPPRESSING FIRE or TEAM RED GET IN THAT TANK and they will and you will feel good about yourself.   That's just the mods nevermind the in depth campaign which is very extensive or the multiplayer vanilla gamemodes the DLCs such as Kart mode and many more that you can just find out for yourself.10
easily the best milsim available
t's good get it.10
Was told not to run over goats with truck. Did it anyway. 10/10
0/10 I have probably spent too much time in this game! The game has so many areas to it so there is always more to do. For example there is RP mods DayZ like mods and even servers like CTF. It is so much fun and it is a total must have!10
I will put this as simple as possible.  good. Battleye bad. nuff said.
he game is very fun to play with if you have a team or a squad of friends to play with HOWEVER this game is not worth (what it currently is) to buy. You still got the bugs like walking down steps and dying dying from walking into a door getting launched by rocks. The AI is still pretty  compared to arma 2. Plus the damage system is ING HORRIBLE. The fact that you have to PAY to get marksman stuff is disgusting. Is bohemia turning into the next EA? Probably. Altough its a leap from arma 2 in graphics Arma 2 was actually better IMO.   Basically it still has the same game breaking glitches that should have been fixed a long time ago. AI is still . Damage system is . And the only things that they did right this time seems to be the ZEUS addition and the graphics.   TLDR: Bugs suck p2w sucks too much focus on graphics zeus is probably the best thing-10
Hands down the best military type game there is. Cod and battlefield can't hold a candle to Arma.
ould be nice if not every server uses the new dlc map. I've spent money on the game but it's not worth it since I keep getting kicked off of every server I try to join 'cause it uses dlc. And €30- for dlc is a bit much. just €5- from the game itself. But don't worry. once you've found a server that you can join It's extremely fun....if you can speak german 'cause that's what 99% of the servers are.-10
reat game can't go wrong with it. Low end PCs may not run the game very well but still will get at least half of what the game has to offer. Great game to play with friends some of my favorite game modes are - Alitis life KOTH(King of the hill) and some 10mil start servers. Most realistic war simulator out there Its just an AMAZING game overall can't go wrong with it considering all the game modes and side features it has to offer I would recomend playing the game a little while untill you get used to the game before buying the DLC's since some of them are pricey and you wouldn't want to waste 40 odd bucks or so on something you aren't going to play ;). 10/10 Purple stickers10
 Hellmann's and Best Foods are brand names that are used for the same line of mayonnaise and other food products. The Hellmann's brand is sold in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains and also in Latin America Europe Middle East and Canada. The Best Foods brand is sold in the United States west of the Rocky Mountains and also in Asia Australia and New Zealand.  Hellmann's and Best Foods are marketed in a similar way. Their logos and web sites resemble one another and they have the same English slogan: 'Bring out the best'.  Both brands were previously sold by the U.S.-based Bestfoods Corporation which also sold several other food products in addition to Hellmann's and Best Foods mayonnaise. Bestfoods known as CPC international before 1997 was acquired by Unilever in 2000.?10
Awesome game! Improved graphic from Arma II. I like this game so much!
buy it its awesome !!!
is a military simulator It gives the game a very realistic feel to it but the only issue is the fact that the developers of the game break things quite often and don't fix them for extended periods of time. Such as the new update that came out today.10
ven though I just started playing this game I would already say it was worth my $60. The graphics are amazing and the detail makes everything look cool af. The only cons I would say are there are so many different controls that you will be referring to the field manual very often. Also the keybindings are very awkward. For people that play different FPS often and are used to things like ctrl or c for crouch or space to jump or e for interact they'll be annoyed when they constantly forget it's x to crouch. I was also sort of  that I couldn't change the keybindings...10
I ING CANT BE A COP BECAUSE IM NOT ING WHITE LISTED AND I CANT BUY A CAR
I killed a friendly with my rocket launcher backblast 10/10
reat game with a lot of potential to be something more than it is unfortunately the game engine sucks. After more than 2000 hours on arma 2 and 3 its still the number one complaint. Maybe they'll get right one day?  If you like Mil sims get this. This isn't like COD you won't be doing any 360 no scopes. You may be running to get into position for over and hour to get to your objective and for that one chance of a shot. Tactics is a must there is no god mode. Do anything stupid and you will be punished severely.  7/10. (would be 10/10 if they had a better engine)10
Great game lots of fun in the editer and so glad that they added a 3d editor.
Really great. Mods that lack 12 years olds. 10/10
the best shooter game i jave ever played. PAD SUPPORT NEEDED
nice game but you will need a beast of a pc
Ebola Recommends this game
ith all the different multiplayer modes and missions plus custom made scenario missions from the workshop this game never get's old. It is a great game for hardcore players. The game is gorgeous. Especially at night. I paid full price for this game and never regretted it. If you see it on sale it is a must have for military fps fans.10
- spawn - meet people -die Best game ever 8/8 IGN Would Play Again
this game is good and all.. but its complete garbage. first of all its fun..... when it actually works... i bought the game for 40 bucks. had fun... but now i cant even ing connect to stupid piece of  server without the game ing about how its stopped working. if it worked 10/10. but its so  i have to give it a 0/10
+
One night I found myself alone on a wasteland server... After fighting for some good 10 minutes in a base I request help from my team and they sent someone in a tank with infantries. Never in my though would I have believe peoples would come to help me. 6 hours laters : We built a base and were 30 fighting for defending our own built base from other peoples that wanted our loot from mission.   10/10 Will meet random strangers and be in a team again  -A True Unique Experience that one needs to witness
its arma. buy it
the BEST game for war nuts like me :3
Great game I will never get bored of it and there are endless scenarios that you can put yourself in to make the game more fun :)
10 Kart DLC advertisements out of 10.
 have put over 1000 hours into this game played the  out of it edited and made missions all night till the sun came up. It is the best military sim you will ever play. Anything can be done in this game and the mods make this stupid realistic.  It can fit a run and gun play style or you can do it tactically. Personally I played it with a handful of friends and even underwent training from a guy with 9+ years in Special Forces. This game is the real deal. And you will not find one like it.  That being said I have stopped playing Arma because of their money loving developers who really bent their fans over and violeted them in their no-no places. The game still runs poorly on high end systems there are hundreds of content missing from the game that was promised since prior Alpha but God Forbid they are releasing pointless DLC's to squeeze every penny out of our wallets. (Go Karts? Seriously?) And not ot mention a Helicopter DLC that adds 2....2!!!!! New Helicopters that are ALREADY in the game you just can't fly them for $15. If that's not the BIGGEST Scumbaggery I have ever seen then I don't know what is.  Overall the game is fantastic but the Devs have completely lost my support and respect. That being aside. I will give this game my 10/10 for the sake of Arma. But I'd rather give it a zero because of Bohemia Interactive.10
irst thing I'm getting once it's 75% off (bless the family sharing and thank you Tora). Pure gem for military sim with next-gen icing on top.10
irst of all I played it while it was free for some days and I must tell you This game is freaking awesome and contrary to popular belief you dont need a 3K Rig to run it properly or get decent fps.  My PC:  Intel i3 5005U 2.00GHz Nvidia GeForce 920M 2GB 2x 4GB Crucial Ballistix  I was getting 35-45 in mid-high settings and I think this game is greatly optimized.10
is a great game there are some down sides like the optimization and the hackers but they have cleared mainly all the hackers out but the FPS is still kinda bad. Lots of ways to 'Fix' it but overall the game is amazing it has so many different game modes to play like Wasteland Altis Life King of the Hill and many more. I really would say if you are looking for a game to have hours and hours of fun never run out of things to do get . So many different things you can do.   I rate the game 8/10 because it looks amazing so many things to do but the optimization kinda sucks.10
9/10. Would give 10/10 if it was better optimized.
all round good game
 killed someone on a go kart with a lightning bolt then i killed another guy by putting several planes on him that glitched and blew up. Buy this10
After playing the entire ArmA series I have been very impressed with this game. It brings together many aspects that make it a game worth every penny. While some of the bohemia content is not as desirable as ArmA 2 the modding community has much more than made up for this. The biggest thing however is the fact is ArmA is meant to be played in large groups not as individuals but as cohesive groups which is why I highly advocate joining a realism/ milism unit. All in all I have been very impressed over the 1k hours ive put into this game and will contiue for many more hours to come.
t's frustratingly fun. So thumbs up.10
oly What can I say? Bohemia you did it again there is never a dull moment with this game one moment I was walking through a forest with my men being stealthy (I took my pants off to be super sneaky) and one guy set off a mine killed 2 of my men we had to fight a whole squad of the enemys my heart was racing.   Think you have had enough of this game? Your wrong there is TONS of modders out there creating mods for our entertainment from zombie killing to diving contests there is a mod for you.  Don't feel like playing a mod? Go to the steam workshop and find a mission that others made for you to play!!! All in all 12/1010
fter spending a fair amount of time with this game and pretending to live on a mediterranean island for the sake of a review I can say that  has it's priorities straight. The single player campaign is realistic enough and everything else about  is brutal. Remove all thought of Call of Duty or even Battlefield from your mind try anything you see in CoD and you will DIE and get laughed at. Health regeneration auto-aim engagements less that 100 meters and shotguns are all things you will/should NOT see in . However you can live every stange military fantasy you wnat to. Shooting people sniping killing civilians being civilians drones diver assaults air support tanks cars SAMs mortars helicopters APCs towns camps hills forests valleys RPGs and more can all be part of the custom level that you build for yourself or even the world. You owe it to yourself to at least try  at least once.10
reat game for immersion and Infantry simulator... IF... You can find a good server. Many servers will claim 'realism' but are just a bunch of 'Call of Duty' players who run and gun. That's not what this game is about. If you can find that server sweet spot however then you have a very eventful and structured experience. Real squad tactics are welcomed.10
 good game altis is best mod :D10
I don't have lots of hours but its a ok game.
 pre-ordered on the first day it was available. I loved ARMA 2 and was not disapointed. Intense co-operative and worth every penny. Wether you want to blow a guys head off from two kilometers away with a .50 cal go diving and disarm sea mines fly a transport or attack helicopter or roll a tank off a cliff. The possibilities are endless. Its older brother Arma 2 is available for cheaper and give similar game play with more mods currently available but with a better weapons attachment and gear system UAVs and diving  has much to offer.10
ery fun game you can have custom missions but also the 3 fun multiplayer gamemodes life king of the hill and wasteland each has its special perks10
great game but hard to learn but still great game u know
Loving this game
great game really recommend it
Great millitary simulator game would recomend for people who like to feel like there in the action
he game needs a larger arsenal of guns and more vehicles for civilians otherwise I see that the game is going along quite nicely.10
he latest edition of the best military simulator series. Has a steep learning curve and requires an up-to-date machine to run though.10
ith all the mods you can apply  its like having lots of really top army sim games all in one  one of the best games ive played absolutely brilliant10
For my opinion this is the best shooter on steam brilliant game.
uch a great game! I'm thoroughly enjoying the campaign at the moment but I love the different multiplayer scenarios and stuff 10/10!10
I walked and walked for days. Found one guy. He killed me. Had to start walking all over again. 10/10 Would Recommend.
For advance players. Not for Eddie Hultman.
 Is Great!!!!  Let me just start by saying are you sick of the troll kiddies running around with the cheapest weapons and using an auto aim assist and killing you right away? I know i am. This game Gives you an immense feel for war and keeps you thinking constantly. Sometimes the Action is spaced out quiet a bit but when the battle hits it is the gaming moments that stay with you forever. Plus Getting that mega kill is something to actually be proud of with your skill and not just stupid luck.
Shot ten people with an LMG without any pants or shirt on 10/10
Ooh you got DLC:s coming nice! Ooh I have to pay for those :( What OVER 10EUROS FOR ING CONTENT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE ING GAME FROM THE START? Aah you got expansion coming nice... How much do we have to pay for that? Let me guess... If you own arma2 and arrowhead you will get some % off? NO CAUSE  YOU! WE DON'T GIVE A FLYING  IF YOU PLAYED ARMA2 and pre ordered ARMA3! WE ARE HERE TO MAKE MONEY AND  THE CUSTOMERS!  Still recommend this game if you like Arma at all.  Good Work Bohemia! You have become full BS  YOU   http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9jpk0_oDRhA/hqdefault.jpg
t's one of the most addicted and best games i've ever played it's a must buy!!!10
he Best Mil Sim I ever played. I just finished campaign it's amazing immersive and not too long or too short. There are also a lot of good mods and the multiplayer is amazing.  10/10 :D10
Awesome game. (As long as you have an extremely powerful CPU.)
Good Game for Roleplaying
I have PTSD now
AWESOME SAUCE FOR $32!
has some good memes
his is a very immersive game with high attention to detail and a seemingly limitless amout of possibilities. Every peice of your gear is changeable... i mean sh*t you can run around the battlefield in nothing but your underwear and a t-shirt if you so please. You can change your camo and helmet and LBV and backpack and every other thing you carry. Everything that is in your inventory can be dropped or moved from bag to LBV or pants/ shirt pockets(and vice-versa). It provides a very similar experience to hardcore milsim airsoft (if thats what you're into... I am into airsoft) without the 'Hey call your hits' or 'Hey are you dead' BS. You are even able to create your own missions somewhat easily with the in-game mission editor. Anyway I figured I'd share one of my most memorable experiences in any operation in Arma- or any game out there.    I was playing on a mission that I created on Stratis(One of the in game maps). I was leading a 10 man assault on Air Station Mike 26. We were all riding in an APC. My gunner was doing great taking out ground troops and even took out an Ifrit or two. Out of nowhere an enemy hit the APC we were in popping all left side tires stoping it dead in its tracks. I immidiately got out and threw a smoke grenade to either side and told my men to disembark. Unfortunately only 2 men made it out before the APC exploded. In that same explosion the 2 men that had made it out were killed. worried I threw one more smoke grenade and waited for the smoke plume to build and ran straight back behind a small hill dodging what seemed like the bullets from 1000 angry hostiles. Once behind the hill I healed my self and radioed in for a helicopter extraction. I waited and waited until the heli showed up. All I could hear above me were the screams of the miniguns that the 2 door gunners were operating and the swooping of the rotor. The heli flew right over my head and began to circle around the base taking out enemy after enemy. I knew the helicopter would not last long as it was simply a helicopter meant for extraction and not any sort of combat so I called in an attack heli for some added assistance. After the attack heli started to engage targets I sprinted inside the base behind a large H-barrier. I could see lots of enemies. I quickly engaged one enemy and started to advance to another H-barrier when I was hit. I quickly went prone and healed up and threw my last smoke grenade inside the base. After about 10 seconds of letting the smoke build I ran up to a building and began to take out target after target in some sort of spec ops manner(Yeah I was that good). I ran around the base with the supressive fire of the helicopters and cleared the entire base of any threat. After I called in the evac heli and flew myself back to base because the pilot was killed on landing because my area clearing is garbage. It was quite the experience to get the juices flowing.    This game never fails to impress and I still find myself learning new things about it every day.10
ighly recommend  for various reasons perfect for both casual and serious player bases. Sandbox and a large amount of game types allow for different forms of gameplay (Roleplay Cooperative Singleplayer PVP etc.)  Must have game for all highly replayable and worth the dosh.10
while playing i take off my clothes and carry bloody men around while they float like ghosts behind me like ghosts
 have to say  one of the best Military Simulator ever  Pros *  - Gameplay Type - Mods - Mods w/ Servers - Consistency of Gameplay - Scenarios - Tutorials with Gameplay - Squadplay  Cons *  - FPS Optimization - Mods that sometimes Lags/Drops - Servers that make your PC cry - Game-engine - Deserves civil stuff (not talking about altis life) - DLC's making people angry I really don't wanna spend money for few snipers helicopters or karts. really  But I have to say ARMA3 is good. Mods helping alot to make this game live in my opinion Buy it if you have good spec PC and some money. LOL because this game is actually expensive.10
 true life like of experience of war is to be had in this game  Certainly the conflicts of the Middle East are encapsulated in the King of the Hill servers. Driving around in your 200 dollar rented pick up truck not really knowing where you are going you squint awkwardly into the horizon; then you zoom in with your scope because you realize you are dumb. Seeing little dots appearing you suddenly hear the distinct crack of gun fire. Being the smallest of the three factions you barrel out knowing the overwhelming s***t flinging powers of even just a small detachment of enemies. The gunner fires wildly as the tires blow out and the car smashes into a wall. He is now dead. The passenger attempts to fix the car whilst you take over the gun firing randomly into the distance until the shooting stops  The car is fixed you are still alive. You make it into town and rendezvous with your comrades. The truck stops as an rpg slams into it exploading and killing all inside. You are dead. You respawn and do it all again.10
You can shoot people n' stuff 12/10

Not worth the 60 bucks but i find its graphics to be a very nice upgrade to arma 2
his game is just great the combat the feel it feels so amazing the atmosphere is so realistic. I must say tho online when I played at least seemed to lag or just wasn't optimized correctly (might be due to it being online and having tons of mods and so on.  Besides that the game is fantastic its so live you feel like a real soldier in battle taking shots and being shot at. Not like COD or Battlefield. Where your the leader and do pretty much anything. But ARMA has never been like that its been more of a real team based where every move you do counts towards the team and can and most likely put them at risk.  I would recommend for those who like full realistic combat.10
Best Game in the world guys.  Best Mod Altis Life.
yeah i reccomend it as i crash all the time but im hoping to fix that soon and the times ive been able to play it was a fun time killing ai
Great game :)
This is a fantastic battlefiled simulator game which is great if you play with a community :)
h this game. It's amazing. The possibilities seem endless in this game..Altis Life..Wasteland..Life..so many more. And that's just the mods. The normal  itself is amazing. 10/10.10
his game is Amazing! Battle Royale King of the Hill Breaking Point Theses are just three of the awesome gamemodes/mods10
this game has got to be one of the best ive ever gotten  the only problem is it is so key intencive
This game is one of the best Military shooters. It requires a clear head and patience. 10/10
Gave me aids. 100/10 IGN
there is not enough keyboards in this world to get every keybind harambe/shot
The game is awesome very realistic army simulator.
ameplay is perfect the idea is perfect. But expect low fps ( even on high end pc's ) Some times my gpu load drops below 20% this happens on low to ultra settings. My friends have the same problem. It happens in the city;s. Not in the open. Looks like this game can't be fixed cause the problem ik the engine were the game is build on. The only fix is a entire new engine. Like they are going to do with dayz standalone. I get 75 fps average but drops which are like in the 20's  If you can live with fps drops to 25 buy it. The gameplay is the best part of . The sound is below average. Not the quality but direction of the sound is coming from-10
i cant even begin to say how fun this game is at first theres a huge learning curve but after u will have so much fun theres so many severs and game modes and great moments its fun solo and with friends i would buy again for 80 if your getting any sale its sooooo worth it and its one of the best games on steam 10/10 only regret is not getting sooner   ps cant spell
ne of my favorite games the normal game modes and campaign are really good but the mods and other community content give this game very high replay value.10
m going to give my honest opinion the community is what makes this game worthwhile everything from arma life to wasteland i really enjoy it. However the base game is not great...10
dat graphic is sick as heck. Worth all the money. The controlls is not that easy to learn but you get it later. RECOMENDED!!!
 DONT LIKE WARFARE IN THIS GAME. SOUNDS WIERD RIGHT? well I prefer the altis life!  Update - what a stupid review i actually now enjoy warfare and would say i am good at it i have my own gang/clan on  now and everything with a lot of members who respect me and follow my orders.  Update 2.0 - that last uopdate sound slike i am 9  my life...   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^GONNA KEEP ALL THIS FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT IN THE FUTURE BUT I AM NOW GOING TO WRITE A REAL REVIEW^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Pros-   - no litle kids - no aim assist - really good mod support - best community ever - insane realism - Beautiful graphics  Cons -   - big learning curve. Took me ages to know how to play properly.   Overall-  Great game lovely looking with fab community but is very complex...+10
Great game. In my oppinnion its probally the best military game i ever played graphics are outstanding but the multiplayer was disapointing when i got banned from 80% of the servers after only playing it for a few days . They wouldn't even tell me what i was being accused of and never gave me a warning about anything just random perma ban on most servers. Very disapointed and sad because i was just getting into the game and having a great time with my new computer i just built to play it :(
hen I launch it it just comes up with the thing with Parameters and the other three options HOW DO I GET INTO A MISSION OR MULTIPLAYER!!!!-10
est from BIS 10/10 now just wait for ACE2  10/1010
Arma III altis life = real life at 20fps
I absolutely love this game
it´s very fun game buy it now !
why is this game still $59.99
Most realistic shooter I have ever played...and thats a lot.
WTF....... 260 ping and getting kick curse you Battle eye..... and all password server......
Buy it or you are ratchet.
Game performance is far too horrible to even play this game past the introduction. You want to look at all the benchmarks online before you decide to buy this.
Worth every penny. Fantastic military simulator.
The good one
well can i get my friend this game for free cause he really wants it he has to walk 1k to his friends house so yeah
Intense moments and clenched butts.
This is one of my favorite games to play!
exelent mod support and overall support for the game 10/10 would waste 1000 hours again
I was able to pick up a snake. 10/10
Game runs like  but still worth it
is a really great game. I loved Arma 2 and I love this game too. It's really awsome and fun to play the graphics just look amazing the gameplay mechanics are better then in Arma 2 ( a lot better ). I don't like the DLC thing that they are doing I mean  got so much less weapons and vehicles then Arma 2 + expansions and the idea of charging us 10-20€ for simple dlc like marksmen or helicopters that should be part of the main game ( beacuse there ain't much weapons in the game atleast compared to Arma 2 ) I understand that you want to make money but atleast make the DLC 3-10€ MAX! It's just not worth spending 13€ on a simple dlc that adds few guns and a full ghillie or few new helicopters or if you are going to make expensive DLC's make them atleast bring much new content with them.  ~Ratings~ - Gameplay: 9/10 - Graphics: 10/10 - Story: 7/10 - Multiplayer ( best part ): 9.5/10 - Price: 6/10 ( beacuse of the expensive dlc but if i had to rate the price of the game without the annoying dlc: 8/10 )  ~~My overall rating is~~ 8.5/10... why?  - The game is worth buying but as I said above it has expensive DLC with not much content in it and it makes it hard to play the game without it ( mostly if you play mp you won't be able to acces the new weapons / vehicles and you are kinda in a disadvantage ).  - Sorry for my english it's not perfect but I'm doing my best :) -10
ol. great game just get it already dingus10
The best tactic game i ever known and such good grahpics and such smooth gameplay i rate 10/10 also no lag at all
e IDK... I only play moded version: Dayz Mod Forever10
bohemia did somthing right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love you bohemia but dayz fix it.  Update:since playing this game alot now i have a great understading of it and once you know it it's one of the best games i could play right now 9.5/10 one bad thing altis life squeekers (WORST IS SQUEEKER COPS BEWARE!!!!!!!)
This game.... is ING BEAST   No in all seriousness if you like mil sims and want realistic and fun Military game this is the game for you.... Just make sure u have a supercomputer to play it though     10/10
mazing game. If you're a fan of the other Arma games you need this.10
is an improvement in many aspects from ArmA 2. The graphics are more realistic the movements are more fluid and I find the vehicles are easier to control. This is a game that you will either absolutely love and play a lot or you will hate it.  The ArmA games aren't easy to learn by yourself. It takes time and patience to become fluent in the controls. You need to approach them with an open mind.  Great versatility for mods and modders. The ingame mission editor is fantastic to use and great for trying out all that  has to offer.  10/10 do recommend10
his game is very fun and open and alot of things to do. The singleplayer is very amazing with the stunning graphics and visuals. The audio is somewhat clear but I can understand people clearly in chat and I can hear gunshots and explosions from a long distances and it is very cool. The multiplayer side is amazing and playing from the combat simulation with others to the Altis Life RPG addon and to the epic zombie survival mod of DayZ to surviving and fighting in the world of Wasteland. Last but not least the editor for  is very good but very advanced to understand right away just get used to the basic things of editing until you can create large scale battles with the editor. This game is not for the regular FPS players this game is way more intense in my opinion than Call of Duty or Battlefield. You actually have to plan and use tactics to get the job done and the maps are very large and you can't run forever. So at first it might be irritating for new players but you will get used to it. Very fun military simulator and it is very addicting. This game is a thumbs up! :D   12/1010
Best damn thing EVER!
I love this game. so much fun!!!
 wish I could Pull the sh*t Frankie does. Oh well I still enjoy getting executed.10
his game is amazing just like the previous 2. If you play with mods you will have the time of your life. So many diffrent modes and diffrent types of mods you'd be overwhelmed.   10/1010
wesome ***** Have only played a few minutes of the single player NPC asked me to shoot the medic WTF ? But 50+ hours of Altis life (mod) has me hooked not since the early GTA games have I experienced the wonder of an enormous game world.  Add the pvp elements from dayz and a thriving community its the best thing going.  10
is an ambitious title with a style of gameplay that will polarize players. The many complexities and amount of controls to master can be a daunting task for any newcomer to the series while seasoned vets will feel right at home (for better or worse).   There is a great deal to learn about playing Arma in a way that is enjoyable. The default campaign mode is passable with all the tropes you'd expect to find in a military shooter with a few surprises here and there. Missions vary in length and scope ranging from short range patrols to full on combined operations assaults.10
Arma3 is a great game for anyone wa ting to burn hours From a developer standpoint the game is easy to code so if any devs are reading this and is thinking about being in the  community it's good don't worry I'm a dev for  and I wouldn't change nothing about it
This is indeed the best Arma game we have ever seen.
ot for the COD or BF player there is no bunny hopping here. Arma is a combat simulator. The learning curve is high but the overal exp IMHO is awesome. I've played them and I cant wait for the polished version to be released.  10
FIA is taking over Stratis and NATO doesn't give a sht 'bout it
ecommended Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 or AMD Radeon HD 7750 with 1 GB VRAM or better'    hahahahahahaha no. this is a very graphically intensive game and you need a gtx 970 if you want your game to look like the screenshots on the store page and play at 60fps.10
ery little content. Cant be compared to Arma 2 when it comes to the amount of maps vehicles and weapons that came with the original game. But of course you can spend like $100 on all the DLCs if thats your thing.-10
It's awesome! Especially Altis Life
hint 'BIS sucks donkey balls';
10 -10 Full paced action packed real good graphics military simulation deffinatly would recommed for people to play  :)
razy Developer:'What about making an open world based simulation shooter with good graphics many weapons and really interesting vehicles? But since it has to be something special so lets set in the the future and maybe add something like... like DIVING and flying JETs and using UAVs and using Artillery tanks and much more. But since 300h playtime is not enough for us lets add FULL MOD COMPATIBILITY AND a built in editor.'  Programmers:'YES LETS DO THIS!'  And well. This is . A mod compatible first person shooter set in the future with an open world and MANY ways to solve a (multiplayer) mission: Diving? No Problem. Sniping? No Problem. Driving in full-ham using tanks? No Problem.   In other words.  is a sandbox. A shooter-sandbox.  You like zombie games? Just download and play the breaking point mod. You like RPG (with soldiers civilians and even Suicide bombers? Then join an RPG server. You like the vanilla gameplay of tactical shooters? Join a vanilla server. You'ld like some modded gameplay with lets say 20 30 well no 50 modded weapons? THEN GO AHEAD DOWNLOAD MODS AND JOIN A SERVER USING THE SAME MODS!  But there is one thing which may turn down some 'xXxCoD-Fanboyz'. The realism. You got shot in the lag? OH YOU WONT BE ABLE TO RUN THAT LONG ANYMORE. But realism doesnt mean that the game is impossibly hard. It just means that you have to play as a Team while using tactics.  The main problem of the whole game is the optimization. While PvP-only servers work pretty well on my 'normal' PC with about 30-40 frames servers having many AI's will make every PC die. The frames will drop to 10-20 even if you dont see the many AI Soldiers running around.  Still go ahead and buy this game. Every Teamplayer who got bored from Battlefield of Duty: Medal of modern warfare and 08/15  will enjoy this game :)10
it is realy fun i recommend buying it there are mods like wasteland and altis life those are really fun
 The Thrilling sequel to the Arma series. Featuring an entirely new set of environments weapons vehicles and voices  brings a unique gameplay experience bound with everything from Fps and Tps firefights to large scale battles on a grande scale. Unlike many shooters of its genre  features realistic bullet and damage characteristics: if you get shot in the arm weapon sway increases if your vehicle takes hull damage you are more easily susceptible to bullet damage. Arma also brings futuristic weapons of modern warfare into the mix: the developement team did a good job of mixing modern weapons and giving them a unique futuristic twist.  also brings an unlimited gameplay experience. With millions of different missions each different from one another in the gameplay the potential to create play and enjoy missions is endless. Incredible for team building and communication building  gives everyone from recreational players to strict military based players to have an enjoyable and realistic experience.10
The Best
mazing level of control and realism. Great variety in gameplay when playing as different classes with different weapons and vehicles.   However this game still has ye olde ARMA feel to it meaning that occasionally you'll have to wait a decade to join a server you suddenly drop to 2 FPS or get lifted into the air. The amount of FPS you get also is kind of terrible I must say but hey it's a beta and it'll get some kind of polishing before it's released I'm sure about that.10
Awsome game pritty nice grapics ran on full blast fps around 30 but will need a beafy computer to run it on full grapic but i really wish they could combine all arma 2 oa weapons and vehicles into this game and THEN it would be the best arma to me.
Hooked! when i got it on the free weekend deal.
o fresh so clean!10
The multiplayer in this game is amazing you can do almost anything.  Could use a bigger variety of guns.
So epic I want it so bad
An amazing game and a great in-depth simulator. Well worth buying if your system can handle it.
ot worth $60 constantly bombarded me with DLC notifications modifying is extremely unorganized. A super fun and well made game besides my complaints. I recommend only buying if you like multiplayer and if it was cheaper than $60.-10
 love  Altis Life The Quality of the server you play on depends on the admins I love the game over all. 10/1010
o after a while I decided to purchase  beacuse of the simple reason that my friends were playing it. With some hopes of better optimization the game does disappoint you as hitting more than 30+ FPS requires a lot of extra work due to the poorly optimized engine as always.  Interestingly enough I've spend most of the time playing Altis Life (Roleplay server) which is facinatingly fun to play. I've played some more vanilla gamemodes and the main campain but subjectivly Altis Life saves the reason for me to recommend this game. Arma Mechanics are a bit tricky to learn and made overcomplicated you ask me but it's fine once you get it all working properly. The graphics are better than Arma 2 but I don't really see any huge graphical improvement. I think mods and addons are the things that actually make people play this game.  I recommend it if I just really like vanilla  or if you're going to mod it a lot. And also if you've a few spare moments to optimize the game with some 3rd party fixes to hit higher FPS.10
xcellent sandbox simulation but unlike others I will not say it is a total military simulation. vehicles and aircraft and their controls pathfinding etc. need vast improvement for this to even be considered a survey sim. however  is an excellent infantry simulator and the vehicles and aircraft used as a supporting cast are sufficient. thrown in the community mods game modes and missions and nothing can beat . i just wish the grass was not so cheesy looking when you crawl though it and the graphics were a bit more cinematic. i guess one cannot have everything.10
the graphics are hard to get right like you havec to mess with it for a while the missions are challenging and mind blowing this game has done a good job of bring virtual war to life but their are always ways to improve like the huge price tag.
Best Military Simulator Ever. 12/10
any Simulation Very Millitary Such Inensity Many lag such wow  11/10 - IGN - would blow  up again10
Been a big fan of what BI does. Now that we get to Epoch it all up it's even more amazing. From great single player missions to user created content. This is a game that can keep you entertained for years to come!
You don't buy crack for sometime in the future just like you dont buy Arma if you plan on going to work the next day...
The best game Ewer
No other game offers such vast ammount of customization and replayability. So many mods to download to make the game even bigger than ever. Get some friends and have a blast.
Very fun game. Need a pretty good system to run it but it is very good none the less. Performance issues no doubt it is fun. Not to happy on the price though
Excellent 1st or 3rd person tactical shooter. More cerebral than most. If you're tired of twitch FPSs and totally stupid AI who forget you exist when you go behind a tree then this might be right up your street. An easy to follow tutorial gets you ready for the single player campaign. I've only played for a few hours so far but I'm hooked. And it is BEAUTIFUL! The island setting is so rich that I get a great sense of immersion and tension. Combat is sudden and brutal. Loving it. 10/10
Nice game !
Broken peice of ....
Great game! bad dlc content!
One of the most immersive Military simulator out there... 9.5/10
i still dont know how to play this game
Crap..the gun shots and movment sux ... cost too much for how the game plays..
I really like this game. :D
ood tactical action multiplayer game :) 10/10 A lot of weapons i like it !! :D10
loody Bloody Fun Game! A Couple really fun gamemodes! Especially Altis Life. 70% of all my hours on this game were on Altis Life. Definitely worth the buy just try not to get banned.  P.S. Would have atleast 21 more hours if not for 'The Cheeky Nandos Dean Hall' for globally banning me. Deez Nutz10
This is a really good game but dont get me wrong when i say this but this game breaks quite a bit i dont really know if its just me but besides that the game is amazing so many things you can do in it.  10/10
Great Upgrade from arma 2. Highly Recommend!
rma III is a very complex game and requires a little bit of a powerful computer to run the game but with all that said there is many more positive things about this game such as its wonderful community the mechanics of this game the strategy and close quarters and long range fun fights that are very intsense and the ammount of mods there are that are a availible with this game.  Some of my favourite mods and gamemodes for this game include: -Arma III Life mod -Wasteland -Dayz (epoch and overwatch) -Sector Control (aslo known as King of the Hill)  Pros: -Graphics are beautiful with extreme detail. -Variety of guns and open world exploration. -Realistic Combat.  Cons: -Controlls feel a little bit clunky at first but you will get used to it over time. -Some technical issues. -Takes a good computer to run this game and get 60fps.10
ne Word Amazing. I don't recommend games much but this is definatly one I would recommend.10
hat I love about this game is that it's not about the firefight it's about the pressure leading up to the firefight.10
f you have friends this is a great game to play with them. If you don't have any friends this is a great game to play alone. If you don't have the game to play get the money for it. If you don't have the money for it get a job. If you don't have a job rob the bank. If you get arrested robbing the bank at least you tried [10/10]10
reat Mil-Sim. I love the graphics gameplay and the amount of content it has. It's endless fun really. Do you like realistic shooters? This is for you. Do you like military simulators? This is for you. It's been 2 years but this game is still hella fun.10
 was under the impression that by preordering and purchasing the Alpha The DLC would be free as stated in the initial sale.   How dare!-10
is basically arma 2 engine tiny bit improved here and there but suffers from the same problems as arma 2.  - game runs like crap - user interface is as clunky as in arma 2 - charachter movement is still horrendus like in arma 2. When you change your gun your charachter stops and stands still so you can get shot easily. If you want to climb over a fence charachter stops. When you change stance charachter stops. Etc... - servers are really bad. For some reason they can't run for more than few hours. Common connectifity issues etc etc.  If you liked Arma 2 despite It's issues you will be satisfied with . If your hopping for better experience you won't really get it.  is mosty content upgrade over arma 2.-10
10/10 Must buy.
eally Good Game Thats For Sure!!10
ust look 2000+ hours and I still enjoy it. The modding community is what makes this game so great!10
This game is just one of the best fps i have ever seen.
Very fun to play whit friends and whitout friends still fun. Its good grapichs but if you have an  pc dont get it. Its some really fun mods and so many mods you can play so it never gets boring.
a game that blurs the lines between being a military sim and being absolutely rediculous. The engine is powerful enough to allow for small countries to be mapped have thousands of ai's and also have over a hundred players. Mods offer near endless content. This game can be litterally whatever you want it to. Zombie survival milsim roleplay or whatever. The limits are your imagination and not if Bohemia will add functionality to allow your mod to work correctly but when.10
ne of my favourite Games ever: definitely my favourite shooter  Almost all of my hours have been placed into Wasteland survival and just practising my helo skills - If you are to pick this game up be aware that there is a steep learning curve and practically every key has a function. I've put 100's of hours into many aspects of the game and i've still only scratched the surface.  One thing i'm eagerly anticipating is the arrival of the 2017 mod which is a Dayz esce revamp of the game focused more so on surviving then Wasteland. 10
antastic sim/game. Learning curve is fairly small and incredably rewarding! If you like action games blowing sh!t up team work driving flying and diving! Then this is probably the best game out there!10
mod breaking point dont miss it
reat infantry mil sim with a modding community that is truly unparalleled in terms of customization multiplayer experiences unique content and enormous sandbox maps.  The downside of the this game is the clunkiness of the engine and pretty crappy FPS during online play. Even my i5-4670K @4.0 struggles to maintain more than 40 FPS in towns during some games/mods or even out in the sticks in others.  Watch some streams of Altis Life Breaking Point Battle Royale or Wasteland and see if this game is right for you.  10
n amazing game despite the bugs and excessive payment for extra content I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys realisitic shooters and a childish community.10
n awesome game with a great community worth the money and more.10
the definitive go karting experience
ood game great fun to play with friends10
i'm just so glad this game doesn't have dayz.
... Where do you start all the kinks of arma 2 have been cleared the engine runs smooth... the animations even smoother and the optimisation is always on the Up and Up. throught out Arma's history it has been clearly building up to this. the Arma game to end all Arma games. IF you are considering Buying remember... this isnt a fast action shoot em'up (But sometimes it can be) this is tactical and stealthy. Also if you buy this game and need someone to play it with you ... Hit me and the 45th up :D10
Amazing game. hours of fun played on this and many more to come.
 have played this game for around 130 hours now and i just extremely enjoy it. Here are some pros and cons.  + In-depth combat + Realistic + Infantry Ground Water and Air combat + A  ton of mods + A  ton of custom missions + All the DLC is basically free. (every new feature will be available for everyone. While you cannot drive certain vehicles you will be able to ride them as passenger. And when there will be new features like the ability to slingload cargo you can do it as well without paying for the DLC.)  - The game doesnt run that well even on the highest-end machines you most likely won't get more than around 50 fps. - There arent that much servers gamemodes like Altis Life seem to have taken over the server list resulting in a low amount of co-op missions. So expect to bring friends to this if you would like to play missions online. - The game's performance is heavily decided by the server. If the server laggs you will not only get lagg but a low framerate as well.   Here are some final ratings as well: Gameplay / Fun = 9/10 Replayability = 10/10 Performance = 6/10 DLC = 8/10 Servers = 5/10 10
o along time ago i did a review on this game. But now im older and i understand more about what i said so heres a new one.   I love this arma its not as good as cold war or Arma 2 but its still just as much fun. I play this one alot and as im writing this im playing it i do think you should get the game because its alot of fun and has alot of things you can do in it like.... King of the hill Life Coop and much much more   What i like to do is go in the editor and make mission for myself and my friends and we have alot of fun with that also theres so many mods if you dont like the factions in the game you can just go online and download more.10
The fact that i can buy drugs and can ride a pink go-cart 10/10
joins server 10 fps to 30 then i get shot 10/10
is a good successor to ArmA2 with some great improvements to the engine visuals vehicles etc. Mainly I have played the Wasteland King of the Hill and Epoch (Alpha) mods. King of the Hill being the most rewarding and enjoyable over all. I have only just dipped my toes into the campaign however I will be doing more of it I think. With all the improvements to ArmA you'll still get those good ole ArmA moments like clipping through walls/floors and your vehicle exploding on contact with a weed or bush.10
ear Bohemia you guys made a nice game yes. The cons are easily noticable starting witrh the beta ready engine (we all know this but still love it) The fact that you're money farming people for helo's dlc's and seeing if it works.  The fact you pander more for the life community side this time than the core fans.  But hey you take what you can get.  It's still a good game if you can find a good unit to play with and mods. Games legit worth is about $3999 USD without the modding community.  I recommend this if you are someone who has a vast majority of free time playing Army Barbie or just a kissless virgin who never touched a woman and spends it playing out a simulation of a real life. If you're a core fan. don't bother 90% of core servers are hosted on 4gb of RAM10
Base game is somewhat lack-luster. What make this game worth the money is the modding capabilities. Have 50+ mods currently in my game and it makes the experience awesome.
There should be more sales on this game
well i was driving along in stratis life and a cop texted me gg and i was kicked off and global banned..... im not hacking lol even if my account looks sus because of my vac ban my ing  brother gave me im searous i liked this game it was great then i was banned for no reason gg game. 60 dollars wasted on this .
I just like flying the jets in this game.  Jets are cool .
f by chance you are fortunate to be right-handed use default controls at all times don't mind that even this comes with several impairing elements don't mind tons of glitches and unstable content don't mind wading through to find actual significant content yourself or want to put in dozens of hours of effort to make content in a steep and vague learning curve...then this game is the best a military simulation can do for now.10
GREAT GAME !!! I LOVE IT EVEYTHING ABOUT IT IS REALLY AWSOME!!
refried beans go great with salsa
his is a realistic shooter with teamwork and everything. At some points you can be so immersed into this game that you think you are a real soldier that is fighting in a war. I also think this is a game that people would say 'Buy this game for me' to their friends or family for the holidays.10
liked it but was annoyed by the lack of content compared to arma 2 i love arma 2 but  is a disapointment compare many features of arma 2 to the lack in  i like the workshop but i needs more with the base game
ther than the few glitches and bugs this game is about the best simulator I have ever played. ITS YOUR CALL! YOU CAN PLAY IT SERIOUS such as RPG servers or even for fun such as Stratis-Altis- Life. The mods available are very fun and diverse! Top NOTCH!10
his game is an total Masterpiece its the closest you can ever get with trying to remake a Millitary Simulation Game. i say buy it! you won't get dissapointed. and you even have tons of awesome mods like a DayZ:  Mod (Epoch)  which looks and plays even better than DayZ standalone itself you have base building mechanics tons of weapons and best of all  you can play on player made maps and don't make me even start talking about  Battle Royale. yeah and btw The game runs much better on Intel CPU'S than on AMD CPU'S especially in Mulitplayer.10
 love killing people and selling drugs in this game awesome game 100000000000/100000000000 great game who ever the hell made this10
or me this was in my list of one of those legendary releases of 2013 this is a perfect game for an open-sandbox reaslitic military shooter and has numerous gamemodes instead of just being the typical army type first-person shooter where you just do a mission shoot and it's over. One thing is to make sure you have a great gaming rig because this is a very demanding game and is still going through some updates to increase optimization.10
imply the best team team orientated tactical sim there is.10
ame is fun but to many bugs/hackers glitching trough walls and floors people shooting you trough walls i mean do they even test games before they publish?-10
his game is a lot smoother and has much better gameplay than people give it credit for. Animations and stances as well as squadplay in this game are efficent and smooth. The campaign is an epic story about your average foot soldier changing the way a war is playing out just by doing his part and staying alive. I have played an extensive amount of multiplayer and campaign and I have to say that it is an experience most can enjoy if they pay attention. While I literally can't say anything about the unfolding storyline without spoiling an entire episode of its three I will warn you and clarify that if you like explanations to everything this game is not for you. You will be a Sergeant a low ranking soldier with mind experiences and skills are his most effective tools. This means he doesn't get the classified info of let's say a Colonel or a Brigadier General or the President. Absorb information and make your own conclusions because that Spec. Ops. Captain over there sure as hell won't. This game won't make any shortcuts for you to recap its story so you better keep your head up the whole way through. The military strategies and plans carried out are phenominal and deserve a much bigger spotlight other than its famed multiplayer. Considering I got a solid 30+ hours playing through the campaign alone I call that a BIG win let alone held up against today's standards. Hopefully you get a good picture of this game's features and don't worry the campaign will help explain them as well. Happy hunting and don't forget. Survive. Adapt. Win.10
0.0. The graphics for this game are amazing but you may need to turn it down in case of lag. The Co-Op is awesome and its great to play with friends. Also on some servers it will get extremely laggy and hard for you to enjoy the game. Do research if you can run it before you buy it. Not a waste of $60.00.10
if you like fast paste games dont buy this
I stopped playing all other 'war games' the day I got this ! Brilliant game 12/10
The most realistic warfare game I have ever played!
ot the best game in the world. And when they launched it; it didn't even feel finished. This Game is NOT worth $59.99 if you have arma 2 UNLESS you want better graphics or your a die hard Military Sim. Monkey. Now as for the sale's which one is going on right now ( 2/24/2014 ); Its 40% off that makes it about $35. BUY IT! This game has many diffrent mods just like arma 2 and if you dont have arma 2 DONT BUY IT! Get this; its $15 more. SO in all: Pros :  Better Graphics More In Dept For Military Sim Monkeys  Cons: Price Less Mods Higher PC Specs ( Expected ) Worst Graphics Than Arma 2 If You Run On Lowest.  Still Doesnt Feel Fully Finished.10

RMA III  In my eyes personally i think this is a game. Thank you for spending time for reading my review:P10
ros: This game is just beautiful. Very Photorealistic! When I first looked around in the game it was like 'whoa!'. I can max it on my GTX 980 in 2k at around 40-50 fps Multiplayer allows a large amount of people to play on massive maps. The controls are great you can have total control over you player. Weapon accuracy is realistic you cant hit anything without being tactical. It has a great training section that I advise you play before jumping into a server.  Cons:  The muliplayer... i just dont understand.  I admit I haven't done any research on how to play I didnt know I had to. I have not met a friendly entity in any game yet. As of now EVERY encounter with another play has resulted in them shooting me tazering me or hancuffing me to sell to another more advanced player... there is nothing you can do about it both the faction and the police have simmilar procedures. There are it seems 1k commands. It will take a while of remapping for comfort and accessability let alone learning the bulk of them.  Conclusion: It looks great and is the most immersive FPS I have ever played. So get it! Very taxing game on the graphics card. Screen shots look amazing but the 45fps is not enough to be competative so I will have to turn down settings =( OR buy another 980 =)10
one of the best sim games ever made
Molasses Foot
Played King Of the Hill Stole helicopter Everyone entered Helicopter i tried to fly helicopter  I crash helicopter into spawn Got abuse in chat  10/10 would get called  Pilot again.
een here since first Arma I've seen huge improvements and still a long way to go.  is way better than Arma 2. The alpha version itself has fewer bugs than the released version of Arma 2 - but that doesn't mean it is bug free. I play it in a realism unit and we use the game extensively trying to get 100% of what the game can offer either using Zeus or other mods to improve the experience.  The scenario depicts an unstable region currently constituted by two Greek islands located to the south of the balkanic peninsula on the Aegean Sea. The first one is Stratis (Agios Efstratios -  https://www.google.com/maps/@39.512281925.013901113z)  and the second one is Altis (Lemnos -  https://www.google.com/maps/@39.902396525.22632626328m) . Bohemian crew actually went to those islands and took pictures of the towns located there so the in-game cities looks almost exactly the same as the real cities (Just like Kavala in Altis that looks very much the town of Limnos:  http://youtu.be/e5urNdAogpA) . There are four factions struggling for power in this region. They are: NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) CSAT (Canton Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty) AAF (Altis Armed Forces) and FIA (Freedom and Independence Army). In all missions the game depicts CSAT as an invading force and NATO as the peacekeeping force. AAF and FIA are local forces and their allignment varies along the missions.  The game still has some latency issues lagspikes dedicated server crashes frequently the framerate is extremely low (tops 25) even using the 'standard' settings over a high-end rig the learning curve is very steep if you didn't play the previous titles from the franchise but once you get things going it is some unique FPS experience that no other game can give you (and I've played enough of them to know about that).  Be aware if you're willing to hop in a server grab your gear walk 10 steps and start killing people this game is not for you. This is a complete combat simulation suite focused on realism which means that usually if you spawn too close to action you'll die and you'll never know where from. If you fly your helicopter too close to the objective you'll probably be shot down. If you drive your Hunter directly inside a hostile city you'll probably gonna blow from land mines or AT soldiers. Be ready to drive cars or pilot aircraft for 10 minutes then park the vehicles and walk for 5 more minutes prior to hope for any action at all.  It is a great game and if you are a fan of simulation AND combat genres this is the perfect mix of both.  For some footage check out my youtube channel:  https://www.youtube.com/user/PFCValls 11
I swam for 30 minutes and the black man ran over by boat.
this is the best game ive ever played and i recomend it to all players. this fantastic game gives you endless hours of fun with several free to play community mods built into the game my favourite being altis life .
I hit a tree in a tank...The tank didn't survive. 11/10-Ricky's Coffey
Looking for a chance to do whatever you want in a military environment? If so this is the game for you 10/10 would hit bush and blow up again ;)
An immersive FPS that includes realistic strategy and awesome battles with a range of weponary. Stunning visuals and gameplay 10/10 from me!
Memes can be created therefore 10/10
et me tell ya sth bout this gaem... 1) ITS 10/10 for noscoping noobs that think that bcz they are good at BF and COD they are good at any game. 2) 15fps on LOW in a City still worth not playable but WORTH 3) graphics meh...id go for full high no matter whats your PC your so or so not gonna have good fps even on low so why watch sh*t when you can watch the 10/10 graphics 4) engine meh you cant jump... still 10/10  10/10 would play again if it wasnt for desync and my sh*t net11
Badass game with badass graphics and badass mods and badass sound.  Buy it 
 don't think I enjoyed Arma At first because I had to overhall the pcNot the biggest fan of low fps. After I achieved +30 fps constantly I was in love with this game. Coming from HL mod CS dedication to a game is at my heart and this now holds the title as my current game with 2k hrs and counting.  And just remember the Wiki page supported by Bi-studios if you get lost nothing is exluded down to additional memory allocators and how to use them  Just a thought if you plan on those jumping no scope flick shots rememer this is a military simulator Not DukeNukem Meets Modern battle field where rewards come to those who out smart and out maneuver their opponent.11
Got the game Played for 2 months Have  tons of fun Played Altis Life Found a man with no pants running around Ask the man for drugs Smoked crack   10/10 Would ask the man for drugs again.
i killed a man with a gun  10/10 for originality
I wish this would go on sale already so I can murder my friends like I've always wanted to
t's optimization was done by an autistc four year old and it's pretty much only fun with friends. Would recommend.11
 barely got this game and let me tell you I had the most terrifying experence ever (to me that is)  I just finished Basic Training and finally knew how to play and understand this game I joined a King of the hill server with 103 people in the game. As i joined i bought the first gun given to you and went on I marked where my objective was at and catched a ride from a fellow teammate flying a helicopter over to the objective. I introduced myself to him He Introduced his name as well. His name was John as we were waiting for more teammates to join us on the ride to the objective We chatted about this war (Trying to RP Here and he joins me in RPing) As we were chatting he told me that he been playing this game for 769 hours now and that he was going to quit soon. I told him i understood why The helicopter was full now and we began to lift off and go to the objective. As we were going there we were shot at and began to crash everyone jumped off and was killed Me and John were still inside the helicopter that was falling slowly He told me 'Jump go now you er.' I jumped and made it into the ocean with a broken leg I swam up as fast as i can and saw the helicopter slowly fall and crash into the mountain side and then exploded. I swam to shore quickly and patched my leg up and ran to crash. I found his dead body and said in chat 'RIP IN PIECES John.' i took his gun which was better then mine and ran to the battlefield. As i made it to the battle field there were explosions gunshots Helicopters crashing and then exploding and People dying right in front of me. I have indeed seen some  I saw a fellow soldier on the ground i asked if he was ok he replied' Does it look like im ing OK?'  'I'm crawling for s sake when i could be running at the hill and be taking it over.' I said 'Ok ok here' I dropped a med kit and ran to the Hill we were suppose to take over.  I saw 3 enemies run pass me i shot at them and killed 2. One of the enemies saw me and began to fire at me and shot at me chest once. I ran and the enemy followed. As i thought i was going to be found and then shot I attempted to heal up but then he found me and was about to fire when 2 teammates came to me and killed the enemy.  I thanked them healed up and ran to the belly of the beast. I met a teammate being shot at heavily and was wounded I told him to run to me he told me he couldn't he was hurt and couldn't run. I threw a gernade at the area where all the enemies were shooting at and got a double kill but 2 enemies survived. He had time to run towards me and survive but as he tried to run towards me a Sniper got him in the leg and made him crawl as he was about to die he told me to run the sniper finished him off and hen payed attention to me. The sniper shot me injuring me and i began to crawl. 4 Enemies ran toward sme and all four shot at me. And i respawned. 10 out of 10 will get shot at by 4 people and wounded by a sniper again.11
layed Battle Royale... 30 minutes of looting 20 minutes of walking died. Did the same thing five times in a row. 10/10-IGN11
Found a chance to try RP. Bought a car and equipment before a crew bumped to my car. They stole my equipments and my clothes also my car. I've said them I need to find my kid. They said we will help. They took me a place where they stole your kidney. They stole my kidney and literally gave it to my hand. Then they took it back and put a bullet in my head.   10/10 Would take my kidney on my hand again.
an-freakin' tastic! Its all you'd want in a wargame unfourtunately i cannot say the same about the download space. Still great game overall.11
This ame sucks I can't stop playing it
BEST GAME ever. Make sure your 16 or older cause if your not you wont have friends.
ery cool Very swag I live it11
This game is really pretty.
I hate this game
Better than ninja Gaidon on hardmode
 start wandering around the streets and suddenly out of nowhere a man walks up to me and tells me to get out of my truck. I do as he says and then the police walk up to me and ask me if I have seen the man. I say I did see him and that he stole my truck. The police officer thanks me gets back in his truck and drives away. Now I'm without a car and I figure the only thing to do is to go to the nearest ATM and buy a quadbike so I can drive back to my house. Before I got to the ATM however I was stopped by a notibly drunk naked man who stole all of my money and took me hostage for a bank robbery. The man takes me to the bank and points a gun to my head telling me that if I move he would shoot. The police pull up five minutes later and arrest the bank robber -- and me. I ask why I was arrested and they told me I was accomplice in a bank robbery. I tried to explain my story to the officer but he wouldn't listen.  When I later got out of prison I went straight to my house. I went to the top-floor of my house boot up my computer and started playing ArmA. It was pretty fun.11
is an interesting game with all the god awful driving physics for the trucks... But hey! let's get past that one con.  in general is a frun game But when you have friends that play it when i first bought  i played scenarios and got bored as hell in ten seconds flat but when you really get into it and start playing Altis Life and make a gang with your friends and do all that kind of stuf like my friends and i do all the drug dealing it really hits how the fun this game is and how pretty it is depsite the driving physics.... 8/10 realy fun game  Pros: Gameplay Altis Life Online Multiplayer  Cons: Physics Single PLayer11
this game might be the best game ever! it both got the tactical wasteland-take peoples base build base etc + an RPG mode that are really well done! if u want a game that u actully learn from buy this!
Like Skyrim but realistic.
OSS End of story11
is my favorite simulation game I have played on Steam. It's fun to play and you won't get tired of it. The workshop is amazing for Arma there are always lots of missions to play. The helicopters and jets are fun to fly around in. I don't like that there are limited amounts of weapons (so if you want more guns you need to download a mod.) there is also no melee attacks. over all  is a really fun game and I highly recommend this game.11
Stop reading reviews and buy the ing game already.
t first I realized that my gaming PC could not run Armo 3. I spent years becoming a doctorate graduate in theoretical physics to have access to a supercomputer. The supercomputer was able to achieve an astonoshing -1 fps something I didn't think was possible. As a result it divided by zero and the universe collapsed.  6.9/10 would play again.11
Yeah is good! Good stuff! Lot's of shooting like pew pew pew. Cons; no dinosaurs :(
 purchased the Delux Edition expecting the DLC to be included.. Well its NOT inluded OK fine its 2 helicopters and the carts suck i can live without them..  BUT !!!!! WHY THE HELL do i have to see adds for the DLC while I am in game...????????? The ADD's are big massive translucent helmets tilled across my game screen with a large popup window in the centre of my screen that appear every 5 odd min and you cant get rid of em unless you select L/+P..    -11
tried to get in my friends car and got hit by the side mirror and died realistic/10
Literally every comment i see on a  youtube video -  can i run diz g8me me m8'z? i hAZ GTX TITAN 4X ULTRA EDITONUTNN I HAVE 4 OF DEM SO YE I ALSO HAS 69 GB OF WAM AND I HAZ A TOP KEK CPO IF U KNOW WUT I MEN? YE DO?? YE U DO BUTT CAN I RUN DIS G8ME AT ATLESAT 69 FPS??  But seriously this game is a great amount of fun.  Really good and dramatic gameplay. Get it when you can
guys i got this game on the free weekend and now it says update queued and purchase game and it doesnt let me update it haaaaalpppppppp
 was a newbie now still a newbie.11
im not addicted
jumped over a fence and died 10/lol s straight fire yo buy it
oorly optimised piece of  game pretty good gameplay if you can get past the 10fps tho.-10
I was surfing a quad bike around a gun store. 10/10
A BIG step up from Arma 2 game is much more optimized and the visuals are stunning. Would defenitely recommend this over Arma 2
elcome to slow asthmatic jogging simulatar 2015.  From the constant retardation of your teammates to the never-ending kilometer long walks to the AO to just get killed by a random pistol round from some guy 2 kilometers away. I've listened to my soldiers heavy breathing for hours on end because he has the stamina of a 93 year old man. All vehicles will basically one shot you before you can figure out what 9+10 equals. I can't express enough how much I love it when every little bump and rock on the road will completly destroy any vehicle that isn't armoured. You also never know when the game might decide to fling your vehicle half way accross the map when you hit a rock. The lag on king of the hill at 120 players makes my eyes bleed and my head hurt. This game is just amazing!  11/10 would hit a rock at 15 km/h to fly 30 kilometers again.  But in all seriousness: I have always been a fan of the ARMA series because its really different than the other shooters. There are so many different ways to play this game I spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. I don't play multiplayer that much but it's still a great experience when I get to it. This game is very heavily GPU and CPU dependant so I wouldn't recomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming PC. Mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of FPS drops below 30 fps. This game is really fun and easy to get into. I am proud of the work that Bohemia Interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. The only problem I have with  is the poor optimization of the game in multiplayer. Lag spikes and random fps drops sometimes make this game a real pain to play. I rate this game a 8.5/10.11
This is great game very fun to play i mostly play altis life which is prety cool how everything works the storyline for single player is fine all together a great game
10/10 player once liked it
 is fun.  my life.
his game is a lot of fun especially with friends. Once you get tired of  you can download the mods - Breaking Point Battle Royale and others make this an epic title. This game has  my wife off because I play it so much!  10/10 Would  my wife off again.11
This game is so ing hard it gave me PTSD  10/10
his game is awesome for its multiplayer and campaign and dont forget the editor part oh gawd how many hours i have spent on editor so yeah i recommend this game if you like action and tactical combat. the dlc's on this game is great my personal favorite dlc is the heli dlc cause i love to fly helicopters in that game it has also a go-kart dlc and that's very fun with friends to race with. so yeah i rate 10/1011
I got to play this game for free as it was one of the free games for the weekend at the time and ive got to say that the experience of war that you get is amazing and would recommend this game to any one who likes role playing games and military simulator's.
f you played BF1942 you've played this.-11
Like Skyrim with guns.
this game is swaggy
It would be fun they said... It would have cars they said... I would not die horriobly they said... I would not get run over they said... My framerate would not dip below 60 FPS they said... I would have no bugs they said... I would not get pushed off the road by some  in a gokart they said...  They lied...  11/10  Would get run over by russian guy again.
i dun played dis game it was fun it was lik de tim i shot jimmy
I mean seriously? It may be a laggy piece of absolute cow . But it's Arma in 3. 420/10 Would Blaze.
reat game truely is. Just if your expecting instant fun like like you see on YT just watch the videos its more fun XD11
 couldn't reccommend this game anymore if i tried. It is very fun very replayable and intense at times. The Zeus addition to the real time editing of scenarios has made this so much better tahn arma 2 its practically silly. The modding community is as good as it has always been maybe even better. There is plenty of servers and people to play with etc... Go buy it!! nowwwww!!! :p11
ar changes people..  Taking a stroll through the woods in single player campaign. Hear a loud explosion. Look over and my sergeant is dead. Killed by landmine Kneel over his body crying 'Sergeant Adams no!' Im lost without him. I know what I must do. I must become Sergeant Adams. I Remove all of my cloths while i stare over his lifeless body Emerge from the woods 20 Mins later wearing bloody cloths and a helmet Return to camp 'Sergeant Adams Reporting for duty!' No one asks why I'm wearing his cloths I continue to wear the helmet throughout the campaign Adams is love Adams is life.  10/10 Would PTSD again 11
ah hours dawg need I say more...11
Its pretty good game.
It is a lot of fun if you have friends to play with.
rilliant game with an outstanding modding community it just needs more Bohemia maps and vehicles!11
his game u get shot alot and you go argh but u keep playing cas it good when u drice car and go swimming. i lik cas you can drive really fast and stuff in this gam eyou can t shoot anyone cas the y kill you fisrt lol11
ts a great game for the player who likes realism multiplayer and sandbox games in one deal. by far the best military game i've played. 10/1011
I love and I hate it
One of the best games ive ever played! :) &lt;3
ery hardcore game for anybody who likes Mil Sims as much as I do although if you are nto used to the ARMA series I do not reccomend it to you there are so many controls to remeber but you can still learn them! Def a 10/10 game11
ick of the absurdness of the Call Of Duty franchise or the so called 'realism' of the Battle franchise? Well switch to ARMA. With stunning graphics and amazing lighting effects. The realism in this game might be too much for some but that's what the game's about true realism. No idiot sprinting with a sniper rifle or ramming a jet at tanks here. This game is for the mature audience not prestige 12 year olds.11
his game has brought me hours of fun and i'm sure it will bring me many more. If you have the cash pick it up ASAP!11
Great game and great community content provided us with an awesome experience. KEEP IT GOING BI!!
Best simulation game ever!
es i recommended this game but its not that great. this is only my oppinion to me the game is ok i guess but it has a lot of bugs. Also its not that fun. The game would be more worth it if it was about 25 bucks but nooooo it has to be super expensive. Yes the game looks nice but it didnt change at all from arma 2. (again not worth it) well if your into this kind of game go ahead and buy it don t let me stop you. but if you are not that into super hard core serious games than i suggest you dont get it its a waste of money.10
un army simulator game although I play it for the RPG city life element. It's also less buggy in comparison to it's predecessor ArmA 2.10
beast... BEAST
his game is nice I like vac I like vac bans. I  yo sister in bed she number 1 prostitue in kazakhstan!10
reality -reality -reality -support to mod and workshop -everything except low fps.10
Awsome military/sim game for sandbox lovers!
Brilliant game. Awesome RP on Altis life! Especially NG ZA-Life! come and join us!  www.neutralgaming.co.za
Great game. Would be great with more weapons and a useable bipod. Controller support is great; just a few button maps don't seem to work. Awesome game overall. 9/10 would eat.
prob one of the most underrated military shooters ever
excellent millitary simulation that has amazing graphic and action!!!
The most complex and realistic Tactical Military Shooter ... once ghost recon went down the tubes after ghost recon 1 this filled the void for me and gets allot of my attention and game time :)
reat game. Awesome mechanics a great improvement from previous armas. Beautiful and astonishing graphics. Wonderful atomoshphere extremely detailed. Now with the campagin there is much more to do besides creating maps or playing with friends on a server. My favorite is that it has its own workshop !10
uy it for wasteland mod never regret10
est game so far many great mods fantastic community Awesome atmosphere 10/10 would recomend10
Pretty Awesome
10/10 this game is ing briliant
I found solitaire more fun  1. scopes dont zoom propely 2. multiplayer games are boring and have no point to them.. If you enjoy running around empty land gettin randomly shot by nothing and getting kicked out for no reason its great 3. No way to communicate with others in multiplayer and single player would be better if controls worked  Jus glad i did the free weekend and not wasted 30 bucks like i was going to
Absolutely marvelous piece of art.
o sum up . Amazing workshop community and creations. The Singleplayer scenarios are great and well put together. On the other multiplayer can be a little spotty at times FPS could be much much better. Your FPS is somewhat dependant on the server your playing on which is kind of unfortunate. With that being said It is an amazing game or milsim which ever one you like to call it. I would recommend it to anyone with a decent enough computer and a knack for hardcore military gameplay.  -The Only God10
8/10  There is so much content to enjoy in -from cooperative missions to battle royale to wasteland. I guarantee you'll be spending hours playing through it all. The experience becomes even better if you have friends to play with. Even though the single player isn't very enjoyable it's a huge leap from that of Arma 2. If you can catch  on sale I definitely recommend you buy it.10
Soup
Fantastic Game ... Best Mil Sim game i ever palyed !! :D
m not sure wether I should recommend it or not but it's enjoyable so I will. The game was released unfinished. There were close to nothing to do in the game because of the lack of content. There's 2 factions in BLUFOR I think and one in OPFOR one in Independent unless I'm mistaken. There's no weapon variation there's like 2 weapons per faction if even. Only independent have jets and it's just one jet with another variant of it. The lack of content is what completely ruins this game.  The combat however is very smooth (unless your FPS is on 20 which it usually is unless you have an absolutely extreme gaming computer) well-made and convenient. There's 9 stances you can take high stand normal stand crouching stand high crouch normal crouch low crouch sitting (while firing) lying down and lying on the side. There's also a combat pace and a running pace which is great. In the combat pace you run slower with your weapon up so you don't have to walk to fire like you did in ArmA 2.  I love the game for it's mechanics which are much much more smoother than ArmA 2 but I always play ArmA 2 more because of how incredibly much content there is for it. Especially with ACE.  The graphics are awesome aswell. The lightning the textures and effects are amazing but they'll most likely drop your FPS drastically. Not sure if it's due to bad optimization or if it's because the maps are so huge and detailed.  Also Altis the main map of the game I've noticed is very popular and everyone talks about how it's 270km2 or something like that but travelling from one side of the map to the other is only 20km and takes like 2 minutes by chopper which was kind of dissapointing. It's still a great map though with alot of nice places and things to do.  To summarize: This game is really well-made and cool but when it comes to content and features ArmA 2 beats it by far.10
its good. stop being a  and play arma.  since there's some whiny baby down int he contents  imagine all the things Chris Roberts' said about Star Citizen being able to be any game you want it to be  then make that the truth  that's .
Chased a rabbit into enemy territory without any pants and died.  11/10.
 suggest waiting for it to come on sale then it is definitely worth it. I will forwarn you the game does not really seem complete at purchase. However the modding community is amazing and their mods have not ceased in amazing me. I would strongly suggest the mods that add the old arma 2 units and maps (MARSOC and Spetznaz maybe on armaholic for units?). It is really great to go back and see these remastered maps then playing on them with the updated engine.... WHEW BOY thats some good stuff. Id say that finding people to play with is really important too I dont do the altis life games but i have friends that do and they enjoy it. Finding squads that are nice enough to allow pubbies on are generally the way to go. If you will be playing MILSIM then for the love of all that is good.... GET TASK FORCE ARROWHEAD RADIO! It will enhance the gameplay experience tenfold. The only real con to it is that sometimes good games are few and far between but the time you spend to find one is well worth the reward when you get to play! Make sure to star it in your server list. I am not a part of a squad but if you really want to boost your gameplay then i would strongly suggest it.  Overall Im not impressed by BI's work but moreso the modders. (AND TO ALL THE MODDERS OUT THERE... THANK YOU :D) If you wanna game thats run and gun this isnt for you. If you wanna game that will challenge you and put your skills to the test this is it. I will honestly say one thing that pisses me off more than anything is the AI's accuracy but it is possible to change. Nothing like getting capped in the head by and AI with a pistol 45 yards away...  I would definitely recommend it to people who are tired of COD or BF or are like me and never really liked those other two in the first place because I jumped into arma :P Enjoy it and have some good times you may even make a friend along the way!10
s always for every single ARMA game the engine is terrible the real selling point is the community mods that have been made.10
his is Petty much BF4 but more realistic.. Better Vehical machanics Better Graphics and Alot more recoil. I give this a solid 8/1010
Really good action game.
 is buggy but very fun with friends scenarios great every thing is beautiful couldnt reccomend it any higher
im Jong-il (Korean pronunciation: [??imd?z??il]; 16 February 1941 – 17 December 2011) was the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea commonly referred to as North Korea from 1994 to 2011. He succeeded his father and founder of the DPRK Kim Il-sung following the elder Kim's death in 1994. Kim Jong-il was the General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) Chairman of the National Defence Commission of North Korea and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army the fourth-largest standing army in the world.  In April 2009 North Korea's constitution was amended to officially refer to him (and his later successors) as the 'Supreme Leader of the DPRK'.[3] The most common colloquial title given to him during his reign was 'The Dear Leader' (???? ???) to distinguish him from his father Kim Il-sung 'The Great Leader'. The North Korean government announced his death on 19 December 2011[4] whereupon his third son Kim Jong-un was promoted to a senior position in the ruling Workers' Party and succeeded him.[5] After his death he was designated as the 'Eternal General Secretary' of the Worker's Party of Korea and the Eternal Chairman of the National Defence Commission in keeping with the tradition of establishing eternal posts for the dead members of the Kim dynasty.  Birth Soviet records show that Kim was born Yuri Irsenovich Kim[6] in the village of Vyatskoye near Khabarovsk in 1941[7] where his father Kim Il-sung commanded the 1st Battalion of the Soviet 88th Brigade made up of Chinese and Korean exiles. Kim Jong-il's mother Kim Jong-suk was Kim Il-sung's first wife. Inside his family he was nicknamed Yura while his younger brother Kim Man-il (born Alexander Irsenovich Kim) was nicknamed Shura.  However Kim Jong-il's official biography states he was born in a secret military camp on Baekdu Mountain (Korean: ????????) in Japanese-occupied Korea on 16 February 1942.[8] Official biographers claim that his birth at Baekdu Mountain was foretold by a swallow and heralded by the appearance of a double rainbow across the sky over the mountain and a new star in the heavens.[9] According to one comrade of Kim's mother Lee Min word of Kim's birth first reached an army camp in Vyatskoye via radio and that both Kim and his mother did not return there until the following year.[10][11]  In 1945 Kim was four years old when World War II ended and Korea regained independence from Japan. His father returned to Pyongyang that September and in late November Kim returned to Korea via a Soviet ship landing at Sonbong (??? also Unggi). The family moved into a former Japanese officer's mansion in Pyongyang with a garden and pool. Kim Jong-il's brother drowned there in 1948. Unconfirmed reports suggest that five-year-old Kim Jong-il might have caused the accident.[12]  Reports indicate that his mother died in childbirth in 1949[13] however unconfirmed reports suggest that his mother might have been shot and left to bleed to death.[12]  Education According to his official biography Kim completed the course of general education between September 1950 and August 1960. He attended Primary School No. 4 and Middle School No. 1 (Namsan Higher Middle School) in Pyongyang.[14] This is contested by foreign academics who believe he is more likely to have received his early education in the People's Republic of China as a precaution to ensure his safety during the Korean War.[15]  Throughout his schooling Kim was involved in politics. He was active in the Children's Union and the Democratic Youth League of North Korea (DYL) taking part in study groups of Marxist political theory and other literature. In September 1957 he became vice-chairman of his middle school's DYL branch (the chairman had to be a teacher). He pursued a programme of anti-factionalism and attempted to encourage greater ideological education among his classmates.[16]  Kim is also said to have received English language education at the University of Malta in the early 1970s[17] on his infrequent holidays in Malta as guest of Prime Minister Dom Mintoff.[18]  The elder Kim had meanwhile remarried and had another son Kim Pyong-il. Since 1988 Kim Pyong-il has served in a series of North Korean embassies in Europe and was the North Korean ambassador to Poland. Foreign commentators suspect that Kim Pyong-il was sent to these distant posts by his father in order to avoid a power struggle between his two sons.[19]  The 6th Party Congress and heir apparent (1980–1994) By the time of the Sixth Party Congress in October 1980 Kim Jong-il's control of the Party operation was complete. He was given senior posts in the Politburo the Military Commission and the party Secretariat. According to his official biography the WPK Central Committee had already anointed him successor to Kim Il-sung in February 1974. When he was made a member of the Seventh Supreme People's Assembly in February 1982 international observers deemed him the heir apparent of North Korea.  At this time Kim assumed the title 'Dear Leader' (???? ??? ch'inaehan?n jidoja)[20] the government began building a personality cult around him patterned after that of his father the 'Great Leader'. Kim Jong-il was regularly hailed by the media as the 'fearless leader' and 'the great successor to the revolutionary cause'. He emerged as the most powerful figure behind his father in North Korea.  On 24 December 1991 Kim was also named Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army. Since the Army is the real foundation of power in North Korea this was a vital step. Defence Minister Oh Jin-wu one of Kim Il-sung's most loyal subordinates engineered Kim Jong-il's acceptance by the Army as the next leader of North Korea despite his lack of military service. The only other possible leadership candidate Prime Minister Kim Il (no relation) was removed from his posts in 1976. In 1992 Kim Il-sung publicly stated that his son was in charge of all internal affairs in the Democratic People's Republic.  In 1992 radio broadcasts started referring to him as the 'Dear Father' instead of the 'Dear Leader' suggesting a promotion. His 50th birthday in February was the occasion for massive celebrations exceeded only by those for the 80th birthday of Kim Il-sung himself on 15 April that same year.  According to defector Hwang Jang-yop the North Korean government system became even more centralized and autocratic during the 1980s and 1990s under Kim Jong-il than it had been under his father. In one example explained by Hwang although Kim Il-sung required his ministers to be loyal to him he nonetheless and frequently sought their advice during decision-making. In contrast Kim Jong-il demanded absolute obedience and agreement from his ministers and party officials with no advice or compromise and he viewed any slight deviation from his thinking as a sign of disloyalty. According to Hwang Kim Jong-il personally directed even minor details of state affairs such as the size of houses for party secretaries and the delivery of gifts to his subordinates.[21]   Idealized portrait of Kim Jong-il By the 1980s North Korea began to experience severe economic stagnation. Kim Il-sung's policy of juche (self-reliance) cut the country off from almost all external trade even with its traditional partners the Soviet Union and China.  10
uge open world sandbox. Multiplayer desyncs a lot too many kill trades online. The content is created by users so there is not that many good missions or multiplayer modes. Theres is about 3 Main modes that people play; King of The Hill Wasteland and Altis Life.  This is still a great buy and many people are working on creating new missions and improving current missions.   Warning: There appears to be a high number of squeaky kids considering how kids usually are into more casual games. Must be all the Day Z fuzz arma has gotten into.10
The best Game you can ever get for 59.99$ worth every penny   Graphic 9.5/10 Gameplay 8.8/10 Story Mode 8/10 Multiplayer (laggy and fps drop as hell but damn it's soo fun ) 10/10
awsome game! :)  but can get very boring if playing alone on altis!
A+++++  Would Bang
Amazing game love the physics Lol but very fun :)
Great game with the Breaking Point Zambies Mod :)!  You need a good PC to run it good though xD
illitary sandbox you can spend days and weeks imersed in epic battles if you have a good ping... I've spent more time in RP servers no other game comes even close to the RP experience arma has... well... garrys mod?... no... not really... but it does remind me of it. This is a great game.10
1. Play Arma 2. Pick a gamemode 3. SHOOT THEM ES! 10/10 IGN would rate again
Brock the Rock approves.
as a fantastic game at one point. It has been ruined hard by power creep. Bohemia made the weapons in each DLC pack more and more powerful to basically force people into buying them and we are to the point where laser accurate AK-12 7.62x39 rifles can one hit kill people through MRAP armoured windows.  A pile of garbage at this point.   Oh and by the way did you enjoy being able to hide behind things like walls and smoke? Well then congratulations you cant anymore. They changed the way the renderer works so things fade in and out when they're supposed to be drawn or when LODs change. This has had the side effect of making it so that you can see through walls. This isnt even a thing you have to exploit just being near something else (ie the window that you are shooting out of) can glitch out the renderer and make walls no longer draw which means you can see enemies (who do not fade in and out).  Its something you personally can avoid but all the guys shooting you through buildings with AMRs wont.  Wonderful...-10
Goes great with the Breaking Point mod! Way better then DayZ!  Edit: seems Exild Mod is pretty fun as well!
Great game. Why is everyone in the world not playing this? Especially the NastyNak server. So much fun!
ont buy this trash game Looks good on streams looks and sounds fun as F! but the game is trash! FPS chop all servers in games with 1-24 players i got like 100fps + all max settings games with 70-100 people i got like 20-40 fps chopping also the game lags alot the mic chat is GODAWFUL annoying! people in global chat with there mics lagging bad due to severs. The game is worth 10-20$ tops until they fix the problem they never fixed in arma 2 or never will fix cuz they suck at scam money from people. Worst game of the year No joke10
his is a combat SIMULATION...  NOT a FPS. With that in mind:  This game focuses on war/combat as a complete package. As opposed to something like Battlefront (a classis FPS where you are shooting/fighting constantly) here you may never even fire a shot on a given mission. I personally fire very rarely. You will spend time in transit to/from multiple objectives. Sometimes this will be in a helicopter sometimes a truck sometimes on foot. While there you may spend literally hours stalking/sneaking to avoid detection by groups of enemies that can kill you with a single shot. Yup. Just one.  You can also drive a simply jaw-droppingly wide range of vehicles and equipment. You can pilot/ride in everything from fighter jets to tanks to cars top speed boats to even a mini submarine. The game is also extremely extensible meaning that it is very easy to mod in almost any way you can imagine. While installing some larger mods may take some basic computer knowledge (find a folder put a certain file in that folder then specially edit another file that sort of thing) many addons are as simple as visiting the Steam Workshop *in-game* and subscribing to new content. Everything else is automatic from there.  Who will like it: People who like depth and details. You like to plan every aspect of your approach to get the best possible advantage. You like working together with other players (many missions are co-op against a deadly AI).  Who should pass this up: People who like constant violent action. While there are definitely times when you seem to be constantly embattled this doesn't happen very often.10
awesome game. Get it when it goes on sale. Play it for the mods. I mainly play it for Battle Royale an extreme survival mode.10
Its a pretty good game got a few hours in it.
ike its predecessors  succeeds at supplying a realistic entertaining and accurate game experience that provides great scenery new weapons and units a community-based scenerio workshop and a game that can be played professionally with a developed community or leisurely on a public server.10
rilliant game love Battle Royale and would totally recommend  10
GET IT
quality meme right there
L;DR: Pros: -Extreme realism (damage movement fatigue healing equipment ect...) -(sink or swim) training of very valuable combat skills used in real life and useful in other games -very useful AI companions (most of the time) -everything has a counter and can be taken down with the right equipment and/or exceptional skill and/or lucky shots Cons: -Extreme difficulty (probably harder than darksouls at times save often between engagements and stay with your team) -Characters occasionally feel emotionally stunted -obvious 'god mode' NPC sometimes (coughcoughfirstmissioncoughcough)  Too Long;Read it anyway:  One of the most realistic warfighter simulators to date. As such it's also difficult to the point where anyone who plays a 'standard' FPS will quickly die due to lack of caution. Everything is simulated to an extreme degree from the problems associated with exaustion and fatigue resulting in slower movement and trouble aiming to the reality of taking fire causing tunnel vision realistic injuries and extremely quick death.   One of the first lessons you will learn in this game is to keep your head down and look for cover. Always be looking for ways to find your enemies before they find you and never take any advantage for granted. The second someone knows where you are before you know where they are you are at a crippling disadvantage as it is all too easy to line up a steady shot and kill someone before they even knew you where there. A good way to learn just how scary it is on the modern battlefield today for anyone involved since you'll find yourself relying on your AI and player teammates almost more than you rely on your own skills. You might find yourself actually following around the AI for cues and clues on how to fight and the level of communication between both players and the AI allies is far above what most games have ever accomplished on a practical level. Simply put this game has NPCs that you may actually find a bit of value in compared to the inaccurate incompetent prescripted 'spehshul farces' NPCs you see in other games  The actual campaign is pretty good too giving you a good look (in my opinion) of what combat arms guys would actually deal with in a desprate situation (out numbered and out gunned in a hostile foriegn country with little in the way of support) I wont tell you how things got this way but right from the start the entire remaining NATO forces (in that particular area of operations) are hanging on by a thread and fighting a larger albiet less experianced local military and it's extremely satisfying to survive each mission and see the desperate struggle continue.   Now as great as the AI is in this game it's not without it's flaws. They are skilled but occasionally have path finding issues in vehicles that make you wonder who gave these guys their license. In the campaign occasionally the 'god mode' will kick in and reveal that the character is obviouslly story critical before they actually are but it's rare enough that you won't be annoyed by it long and chances are that you'll be too busy trying to stay alive to notice it.   There is also the fact that I think that maybe they could have increased the emotional factor by allowing the characters to grieve a bit more over the loss of their buddies during and after combat as sometimes it feels a little cold that they just ignore it other than a call out that someone's down. You see it effect them every once in a while for certian characters but really it seems they either aren't really feeling it right then or are really good at not showing it which is something that legitimately happens so I find it forgivable for the devs to have not made the call outs for each death a little more emotional. There is another factor I think could play into why they can keep it to '(number) is down' but for spoiler sake I won't say that theory here.10
un and realistic odd quirks and bugs but can't be blamed. Only real gripe is laser-sharp accuracy from AI but you can counteract it. Technically a limitlessly playable game due to the workshop content that get's released so it's definitely worth it's value.10
 is a good game you should buy it unless you're a part of isis
ell based from the time that I have been playing this game I think you should really buy this game! :D  1000/10 really recommended ;)  10
Fantastic and has a great community and Life mod
I love this game a lot. it's sad to see that it's poorly unoptimized. DLC is pretty much mandatory
If only physics would be better it will be perfect game for me. According to any other games like Arma this one is a game changer
Awesome military sim
reat game while playing this game the time just fly away after playing 1 hour i realized it has actually been 10 hours. Tons of different servers that are really fun.  10/1010
Probably the most realistic combat sims ever
ell if you can play this then go for it but dis game not optimizsedsed and not run good my 2 gtx 780s can run this fine but with occasi0n4L problems game pley is gud but sumtimes lots of running and driving but overall 75/10010
Definetely worth the money!
here is no way to give a mixed review so this will be listed as positive:  The ARMA franchise is a fantastic one. I have logged around 300 hours across their games that's two weeks of my life.   This game has stunning graphics incredible gameplay and realism... However there is one MASSIVE problem with the game.  My friends and I want to play cooperatively without people we don't know messing up our gameplay - the Zeus system seems like it would be amazing fun. However is impossible without hours and hours of trial and error on server hosting. The fact that they don't have a simple hosting system in this game makes purchasing it to play with your friends almost irrelevant. Hours of stress disappointment and failure await you if you do so. On ARMA 2 this wasn't an issue at all so I am hugely disappointed that they changed the system.10
i dropped the soap
an't open the game but the launcher. If I want to start the game there is:  Application Load Error Q:0000065432. Already verified Game Cache Reinstalled tried everything but no changes. If anyone got a solution pls contact me on my profile.-10
greatest game of all time
at Breathe and  Military life. Fantastic.10
Still runs like a big pile of poopydoodoo. Single player campaign is not finished. Feels like a beta but it is the 'official release'.
ing mint game m9 9/11 would recommend
this is so good game its pretty and realistic military game I love it only a few hours playing and I love it
Walked 5 Miles just to be Shot by a Sniper  10/10
 love arm 3. the graphics are like god giving a credit card without any limit. the gameplay is super fun but you should definently download the nmd menu (workshop mod). the sounds are amazing and dont sound computer gen at all they sound real.   to sum it up probobly the best and most realistic military sim available on the steam store10
 highly recommend this game. very realistic very hard. what i like most about this game is the combat is not over in 5 seconds like most action game eg call of duty. Also with all the wide range of guns and very unique future vehicle makes this game incredibly fun.10
Amazing graphics and amazing sound quality! It is a heavy game but most gaming PC's can run this easily!  Battle royale for life!
anilla  is alright but ive found it to be better with mods from both the Workshop and Armaholic. Ive got in total about 30 monds that run everytime i play.   I do however dislike the fact that they went all futuristic with the guns (the MX series is 'based' on the ACR) Leaving it up to the modding community to devolope mods that add in better guns :)10
est Game EVER You wont regret this one10
mazing military sim! Endless expansion posibilities and already plentiful mods!10
reedy DLC The game is 'still in Beta'. The funnest thing to do by far is KOTH online but good luck getting in a server randomly the server broswer will flip out and report 0 servers. At which time the only solution is to completely restart the game. Every time hearing that STUPID theme when it starts up DUH DUH DUNNN DUH! Server broswer reports 0 servers restart.... DUH DUH DUNNN DUH! 15 bucks for a couple of rifles and diffrent color guillie suits &lt;.&lt; helicopter pack 15 bucks still in Beta my . Money Grab Poorly optimized  6/10 DUH DUH DUNNN DUH! ....... 5/10-10
reat game you will never get bored with it. Unlimited possiblities. New gameplay every single time I play. No other game will compete with it.10
his game is fun to play with friends or by your self. There are lots of game modes you can download and install such as: Battle RoyalWastlandAltis Life ext. If you are bored of playing multiplayer (Dont know how you would be) you could play the campain or play some of the show cases. 10/1010
get it or u a gay boi
10/10 Would recommend to anyone! Great game and many things to do!
Need Super PC to play this game.
reat game if you are interested in having a Dayz like experience I would recommend downloading the Breaking Point mod.10
he best sandbox war game of the year'   is a continuation to the Arma series by Bohemia Interactive taken to the next level. With increased player control/movement enhanced mechanics for vehicles weapon systems (if you buy it) flight models (if you buy it -_-) and much more! The control in tight spaces should be worked on this is no call of duty the controls are clunky but are a vast improvement over the previous installment (arma 2). Another of the top complaints of this game is the NETCODE. It is terrible under load but again is much better than arma 2.10
packs a full punch improving on all aspects of Arma 2. From the weapon system the flow of your character or even the smallest thing such as your side mirrors and rear view mirrors in your car actually work. Pick this game up. You will not be disappointed.10
n absolute great military sim! The commmunity mods are wondeful and the game's editor/campaign is bugless and very enjoyable. Overall this game's new mechanics and engine make it a must buy for an avid military gamer!10
0 - Graphics 9.5 - Sound 10 - Gameplay 9.7 - Voice Acting 10 - Potential (Modding and custom mission scenarios)  Overal this is a great game! 10
Pretty chilled brah.
est real life combat simulator hands down there is no better foot land air and sea Arma series does it like no other game I have played.  Player made addons and missions making this game stand like the leaning tower of pisa it may not be perfect but it does look and feel great.10
t's tough to review this game because Steam doesn't have a so-so category. The game is gorgeous even though it chugs on my rig that works great for any other game. So here's an easy way to review the game:  Gameplay - 6/10 - The singleplayer elements... I don't play MP on this yet are really hit and miss. The weapon accuracy albeit accurate still leads to the AI being incredibly cheap. You can hide under bushes and the AI will shoot you from 2 miles away and you will definitely die you shoot at them 20 times and you will maybe hit them once but they seem like terminator robots that never go down. This can be incredibly frustrating because you'll get sent back 20 minutes to a way earlier part of the mission to do the next thing that I have a grip about. This game could definitely be called FOREST RUNNING SIMULATOR 2014. You will spend hours running in the forest and really doing nothing at these point to traverse to another part of the island which is not too amusing when you do this and get hit once and then have to do it all over again. Lastly from the negatives is the control and interface it's fun to learn and difficult to master is one thing but this game has it's own language practically when it comes to the bizarre control set. Lots of bugs but what game doesn't have a ton of bugs... especially games that come out of Eastern Europe. (Note: Not trying to be offensive it's just that a large list of games from that region started with bugs galore except The Witcher)  On the good side of gameplay is the fact that the extensibility of the game is HUGE! So many options so many details and subsystems that it's honestly cool to see new options you have seen once after playing for a few days and spotting something new each time. The realism factor could either be a great selling point or loss to you. Warning if you are expecting Call of Duty Battlefield or even Operation Flashpoint... then you will more than likely dislike this game from a gameplay perspective.  Graphics: 6/10 - The game is gorgeous in every single way. Navigating the underwater areas and the night settings are especially a sight to see. The only reason that the graphics score is lower than perfect is the fact that the animations are really hit or miss. This is also particularly clear when it comes to watching people talk during the gameplay. It's something that takes you out of the realism of the game.  Sound: 4/10 - The voices and gun noises are pretty awful. They're definitely workable from a gameplay aspect but sometimes you'll just hear something like one of the truck horns and think did they record a boat horn mixed with a clown car?   --------------  All in all if you added up the score of the game from this little review it would make the game overall be pretty crappy but that's the beauty of the game so far. It's a work in progress being made by a team that really cares. Each time I play the game you'll see a note from the dev saying that they polished xyz or the community addressed the issue. Who knows in a few months most of my gripes may be solved by the devs but regardless of all of that i'd recommend this game to any hardcore PC gamer.  10
 have played the predecessors for a long long time and always thought of them (although crooked) the games to end all games for me. Then  came along and now I know that ARMA 2 and especially ARMA were good games but far from being the nearly perfect games I made them out to be.  I´m not on about realism because it is a game after all. No game can ever come close to the real thing and it would be a horrible game if it would. Think of realism as things like 'take a bullet to the head in game and never be able to play ever again'. What I AM on about is the level of immersion. That  can put you under real stress can make you involuntarily shout out 'INCOMING!' or make you race for virtual cover make you flinch and instill fear for your virtual life.  This time around the experience is hindered by far fewer bugs and glitches than in any ARMA game ever. The inventory system has been reworked vehicle and aircraft physics have been improved the engine has been rebuilt from scratch. All while retaining a 'feel' very much like ARMA 2. In essence this game is the best ARMA ever released - improved on all fronts no features lost in translation.  On top of the technical aspect even though this game hasn´t been live for a long time now it has already been modded customised and improved by the vast loyal and savvy community to a degree that ARMA 2 saw about 2-3 years after its release - and there is far far more to come.  Can I recommend this game? Yes. Is it a game for everybody? No. But it is a game *everybody* should try. This has been the only game I have bought for full price (44.99 €) in years and I don´t regret a single cent spent. What are you still waiting for? get . It will be different from anything you´ve ever played. Except ARMA 2.10
emme tell you what i think about .    is a fantastic military sim game. The physics are great the graphics are awesome and everything about it i enjoy especially the addons. It's a great improvement and i don't know why dayz isn't running on this amazing engine. The zoombies mod that i enjoyed is gone now thanks to bohemia and dayz. I hope you guys rot in hell.  What i hate about this game comes from a deep part of my soul and also a very external part of me too. The amount of dip and try hards and ing posers i come across rattle me bones like no other. Going into a server with 'Spec ops' as your slot to choose to be makes me want to shoot my brains out. The moment i went into these servers felt all i heard was 'SPEC OPS READY FOR PICK UP' 'THIS IS SPEC OPS GOING INTO FIRE' 'THIS IS SPEC OPS SUCKING  FOR CRACK MONEY' that last one was a joke but you can see my anger in this. So i ask in the chat bar that doesn't have a scroll up option for some ing reason 'are you guys in the military or have any of you served' and with a gust of wind that screams oh  here we go it came 'no we have never served luckily we have this game' my wtf face was not big enough to show how i felt. These  heads have no idea what it's like to be in combat i don't know yet my self but i plan on knowing very soon nor military tactics nor anything of particular military from anyone not just these 'spec op' dumbasses.   anyway i get out of this server cause at this point i am growing a giant vein on my temple because i am holding back my self tearing these guys a new one. 'Alright' i tell my self as i decide to browse through servers. 'ah this one must be great seal team 8' OKAY seriously i get that you're a ing  and don't want to actually serve but naming your ing server seal team # doesn't make you look cool. It pisses people off. I go into this server and ask if any served or serving. Noopee seriously. what the  do you think you're doing? what part of being in a seal team do you ing know besides call of duty or some stupid ?   okay well there's alot of that. let me get to my closing statement.   is fun i love the game graphics are nice but the mulitplayer is so un-optimized it drives me insane. Having a nice pc and trying to enjoy games but without devs optimizing their games or using 64bit gaming EVEN THOUGH THE GAME YOU RELEASED IS A PRETTY HEFTY GAME TO PLAY baffles me. The physics engine is great physx engine it's called from nvidia it's some cool  too bad it doesn't look cool at 20fps and i am trying to drive but go right into a ing rock. physics are working though that some good . anyway. also the game feels stripped like there's nothing compared to arma 2 regarding weapons and vehicles.   I would not recommend this game if you have ever served/serving in the Military or you want something casual. If you have served or serving you will want to gut everyone. There's no point in playing a game where no one knows what they are doing and pretends to be some badass that they will never be except maybe online but the pre pubescent or going through puberty voice doesn't sound like you want to follow them. The amount of posers and wanna be's ruin this game for me. oh and especially the '15th MEU' oh pretends to be a real marine MEU. LIke seriously these guys think they are Marines. Their website says how much of they follow Marines. they even pretend to have medals and shadow boxes. what the  is this .   As someone working his  off to join a special group of people i can no longer play this game without getting rage. singleplayer is fun though. i like the single player. mods are nice and i really can't say much else. I would and wouldn't recommend this game. It's up to you.-10
reat Game Fun to play with friends. only down side is dlc prices since you can get mods that do the same10
othing to sayand Great Game. (i'm Speechless)10

You can fight wiithout pants! my gawd best game ever 79 fishsticks out of 56 cakes
z epic  EDIT:  Ok so since people probably didn't find this review good enough I decided to write a real professionally made review.   Pros:11
his game has one of the most powerful graphics that has been seen in any game so far in a fps and survival etc game. No screen tearing Hardly any graphics problems on terrain or sky etc.  This game is a 9.5/10 game and will beat the bf4 and cod series if the developers concentrate on this game for the long term run. 11
reat game fun with friends and the storyline is great.11
its bloody crap fam
RMA/10 Arma 2 but with better graphics and butt sliding  SOLD SOLD SOLD SOLD THE BEST GAME EVER  SERIOUS REVIEW   is the third installment of the milsim series ArmA.  significantly improves upon controls and integral mechanics compared to ArmA 2;but suffers from a lacking vanilla setup of equipment and vehicles. Modding is HUGE in this game;however
: is a good game but has it's bugs but over all and rilly good game
 More like Ar-this  is not fun. I played Arma 2 a fair bit and it was 'fun' but this game just didn't peak any of my interests.  the people who forced me to buy this -ma 3-11
his game is great at times. And thats the issue. The game is a steep learning curve for new players and that can put people off the game. You have to be in the right mind set to play this game is it requires skill and concentration. The game feels clunky at times also because the physics are a bit crap. For example when you crash a jet into the groun the jet turns black the wings fall off and there is an explosion. This should be improved upon because the game in some aspects feels rushed.  Overall i recomment this game because if you put in the time and effort this gam can be really fun and worth while.11
 will rate this game very 5 ways VERY SPECIFICLLY:  1. 5 points for physics/ballistics (very life like) 2. 5 points for gameplay/style (if your looking for that real gritty down to earth COMBAT experiance this is your game) 3. 4 points for diversity ( from weps vehicle guns its not too much and not too little. just right although perhaps a few more rifles) 4. 4 points for tactical (in order to be succesful you must work as a team in this game i didnt give it 5 because of the lack of communication quality between squads) 5. 1 point for optimization( HORRIBLE HORRIBLE optimization. Good or bad pc we all basically get the same level of performance wth higher end pc's pbvoiusly getting a LITTLE TINY bit better performance)   this is the major flaw which can kill this game for some. FORTUNATLY for ME i have a pretty powerful rig so i can opt out 31-37 fps in cities with 75+ people online. which in all honesty is RIDICULOUS but boehemia is what it is.   MY HONEST OPINION:  If you sick of disney-like run and gun war games liek BF4 or COD and want a more real play experience \ i'd reccomend this game HIGHLY.   +=+WARNING+=+ If you think you are going to get amazing graphics AND above 40 FPS (LOL) you are either nuts or rich. You WILL need the TOP OF THE LINE n i mean at least $2500 rig to run this game MAX at 60fps. but you can still run it at Mediumhighish and hope to get 30fps.   well good luck and make the best descision.11
Freaking AWESOME game. Love It &lt;3
efore i start this i want to say this a great game. best game i have but.. They are asking for money all these DLC's. This game is't cheap and they are asking for all these 3 dlc's thats out and APEX will cost too?! Anyways it's a good game.10
Great to play!
Fantastic game. Full or suprises and great realism!
THEYRE GONNA RELEASE THIS GAME WITH 64BIT EXECUTABLES HOLY 
est game ive played in a while  needs some optimization but its good10
This game is great! It is its own category of games and is like no other. Its one of the best Military simulators I have ever played. It has a great community and many people dedicated to it! 10/10
Awesome game countless hours of gameplay and theres always something new to experience.
 loved this game and had a great time with it playing with my friends (king of the hill) untill my account and all progress was wiped when i merly looked at my in game profile. I lost a level 25 character with a katiba MX 338 MG Cyrus Four Five pistol MK 14 and i had optics on all of them. From what i have found there is no fix for this so i guess im just not gona play anymore.   Cheers Bohemia-11
000+ hours on all accounts tasty game.10
0/10 great game would do again -IGN10
aw a War Movie went to play ARMASaw anything related to combat or warfare went to play ARMA ;)  One of the most addicting Games and Military Simulation i ever Played! Endless mods packsmapsmission and game modes! You can just can do there almost anything that refers to war and military simulation and even more than thatStarting from making missions in the editor and playing with friendplaying on public server or even joining a clan that suits youjoining a PVP server as king of the hillfree for all or just any other pvp modes also if you feel for some role play there is also some from that as well!! As i said game of endless contact that keeps expanding and getting new thing while thats being created only by the community there are also the devs that are keep updating and making the game better. As you can see i Realy recommend buying this gameworth it! :)10
layed Altis Life Smoked Weed Got Arrested 10/1011
t's a very good game and lots of fun especially with some of the mods you can download.10
 is for scrubs. joe is a  10/10 wouldn buy this  again
s1ck
Very good game just need to fix bugs i recommend it to all
 very fun game however the game itself has many things that need to be fixed; most of them are well known to majority of people who already play this game the netcode could've been done better too. I do recommend this game however I would strictly wait until it's on sale before buying not worth more than $20 in my opinion in it's current state.  Also not knowing where you get shot from is a BIG deal breaker... sound engine is mediocre.10
THE BEST GAME
Optimization but great game. After 2000+ hours on this game I've been able to experience almost all the gamemodes. Best gamemodes: KoTH A3L Wasteland and Invade and Annex. I've yet to get bored of this game10
Played it a litle it wasn't bad
xcellent game excellent military style shooter. Lots of controls and many different ways to play. Game is pretty tough but you can alter the difficulty...my only real complaint would be that the enemy AI is VASTLY superior to your team AI. This seems to go for the whole campaign. First real exchange of fire and most of your team goes down. Maybe I haven't played enough but that seems to be the general formula.10
efinetly a very fun game. The recent DLC that they released Apex I think is slightly over priced and you should wait for the price to go down or for it to go on sale but it's also worth it. A lot of work went into this game and is a lot of fun with friends. There are a lot of awsome mods for this game that really add to this game's worth as well as a lot of fun life servers. But it can get kind of lonely without friends to play with so defnetly consider that. I would give it a 9/10.10
I love this game!! I love the future aspect but it needs some things. But I hope to more things return from arma II!
this is the game i got a pc for and im so glad i did.it looks amazing and.there are a lot of buttons to get use to but u can just use basic buttons to get started and learn on the fly.the battle royal mod is worth the price alone.cant say enuff good about this game.get it
highly recommend playing with lots of friends
This is a superb game! I have played it for years and I highly recommend it!
i have 1130 hours on this game and i can say it is worth it there is so much  to do and lots of mods if like to play lots of mods adn all types of game modes this is the game for youuuuuuu
It's a Very Good Game ! I Really Like it i have more than   1500 Hours   and i never was boored in this game ! I like more than all Role Play mode !
Like this game. It's one of the best game's i've ever played!! +rep
would buy
A very good game.Thx Bohemia
ak need windows 98 to run dis sheet. my gtx titan said no and blew up.10
I would reccommend this game to anyone who wants to play arma life or wasteland however if you want to play for the millitary simulator aspect of the game i wouldnt recommend it you will find the majority of the servers are arma life wastland and epoch ect. there are a few servers and if you want to play for the realism i would recommend invade and annex as you work together as a team to accoplish objectives against the AI. also it is pay to win there is content in the game which you can not use in multiplayer matches such as sniper rifles and helicopters without purchasing the DLC i understand they need to make money however i beleive they should develop the game to make more maps and encourage people to buy the game as there is only two maps in the game (without spending £25 on the expansion and getting one map and some extra content) and the terrian is quite simular. also infantry is more obsolete due to most vecheials having thermal vision and being able to spot infantry much easier however if you want to play life ect. i would recommend however from my point of view this game is a waste of money (i have also brought the marksmen DLC at first to invest in the company to hope they might bring out some more maps and more content however my funding has gone towards APEX which i would have to buy for £25) remember this is not a rant this is just to help people decide on the purchase on this game.
antastic game in my opinion. Definetly requires friends to play with. If you're looking for a hardcore shooter look no further than BECTI hardcore  servers. Rolling in transport choppers with entire squads of players rappeling down with armor being lifted AND Close air support is the exciting and fun. I give a solid 9.5/10 I only give the 9.5 because of the fact that there are still some bugs that can cause crazy things to happen (Such as a tiny one foot high post blowing up my armored car)10
..
Two thumbs up
he framerate is an utter disaster. I couldn't even get through the training missions and that was after I'd aplied every documented optimization trick.-11
Pretty good but you need all of the dlc most server require it
isual Quality - 10 (Outstanding) Gameplay Mechanics - 9 (This may not feel like your average first person shooter.. Slower paced then most mainstream shooters The controls feel solid and actually shooting someone feels increasingly satisfying. Also the game will slowly force you into using a more planned and strategic tactic when facing your target as using the 'Run &amp; Gun' tactic will get you killed in this War simulator.) Multiplayer - 6.5 (Poor Performance drives away the whole experience.) Sound - 8 (Although clumsy at times Some sound effects may postively enhance your experience.)  I would definately recommend this game.10
10/10 they fixed (for the most part) the optimization issues. I am now able to play at a stable FPS.
 is fun
his is a must buy game... The mechanics of this game are so wonderfull... Like really who wouldn't want to have these physics in real life like getting hit by a jeep flying so high just because you ejected out of it and you fall down intact... Jk you die just by vaulting over small breaking your legs. I rate physics and game engine 9/11. FOR SCRIPTERS AND MISSION EDITORS: First day of testing editor '  THIS IS SO AWESOME I CANT WAIT TO EDIT SO MANY THINGS ' 2nd day of testing editor ' HMMM THIS SEEMS EASY ' 3rd day of testing editor ' HMMMM WHY DOESNT THIS WORK ' 4th day of testing editor ' THIS GAME IS A PIECE OF  ' 5th day of testing editor ' OMG I AM GETTING BALD ARMA WHY WONT YOU ING WORK ' 6th day of testing editor ' OMFG YOU HAD ONE JOB DEVELOPERS ONE JOB ' And on the 7th day of testing GOD said let this kid have cancer. 9/11 would do it again.10
ids play COD youth play BF men play ArmA. 5/5 would glitch and fly to the sky and die again.11
Real War ;3
his game is slowly dying along with its servers very hard to get into and just not worth the price  refunded-11
is good game but its not like common run and shoot game like COD or BF. Since  was made more like a simulator than a normal game the controls is a bit spesific. You wouldnt understand it if not played it before but you will learn it quite fast.  The graphics is great but not the best. the details though is very well done.   The gameplay:  is a game you will probably either love or hate. In the sigleplayer you get to do almost whatever you would like to. From diving and desarming mines to defending towns in badass helicopters. the multiplayer can also be amazing. Team up with a couple of friends and you got it! Thats some hours you will probably never regret spending.  Now there are som bugs and all of that but screw them! If you like detailed and huge maps  is for you. If you like realstic shooters  is for you. And if you love having a good time with friends driving around in various vehicles mowing down stuff this game is deffinitly for you!10
One hell of a good time!
The Sims of fps-me A good concept ruined by dlc that should been in the game since launch or free.
 want to like this but I just can't. The controls aren't nearly intuitive enough especially switching through the aiming modes which seem to only work half the time with no explanation? The campain starts by putting red squares around the enemy then without explanation completely drops this behavior leaving you to have to visually locate and identify the enemy that are camo'ed and prone all around you all while they can spot you from miles away and snipe you to death without you even knowing where they were. I gave up after the guy I was following was blown up and have no desire to return to this mess of a game. Maybe the mods/multiplayer are better but the campain start is such utter crap I can't even bring myself to keep this installed.-11
his game is a HUGE improvement over ARMA 2 in terms of the engine and its looks graphically. The game works much better than the second installment of the series and is much easier to use. But the game's setting has completely ruined it for me I really dont appreciate what bohemia did moving the setting to 2034/2035. I really loved the setting of 1990-early 2000s ARMA 2 provided and i dont feel that  provides a very immersive feel (For me anyways) I'm sure there are mods to change the game for the more cold war 'feel'. But i havnt found many that are what i want.-11
his game is one that is either love it or hate it in regards to the original unmodded game and it's concept. It's realistic and while people call it a 'running simulator' in real gameplay modes unlike Wasteland where you start with a good set of military assets you only have to run for long distances unless you wrecked 4 vehicles and don't have friends in a squad to pick you up or to respawn on.   Here is the easiest way to explain the concpet of this game look at a game where you fight in a plane stuff like Star Fox and Crimson ties are arcadey gamey takes on this then there are combat flight sims that are in-depth thoughtful and inforgiving as well as realsitic as hell. This game is basically the flight simualtor approach to the concept of a Battlefield game where military infantry land sea and air units fight in a very large environment with a lot of units at once in a game session. Except this has very in-depth coop and singleplayer unlike Battlefield.   It's not for everyone but for those who always wanted there sooter game's guns and vehicles to feel more realsitic who wanted strategy tactics and thoughtful choice of action to be more important than in arcadey military shooters and who wanted a military experience over a hollywood michael bay interpretatino of a military experience like in CoD and BF. This is the game for you.   Developer support is great new DLC and patches that actually help are regular occurences.  Mod support is arguably the best in all of gaming offering anything from new experiences like zombie survival to post apocalyptic warfare to doubling and greatly expanding the amount of guns vehicles units and gameplay mechanics available all for free through playermade content heavily supported by the developer a modding contest with a large pool of prize money is even comnfirmed by the dev.   9/10  Some tips for potential buyers:  -If you are new to Arma play the 'bootcamp' campaign first that gives you a tutorial to teach it's unique and pretty complex mechanics and controls this will make it much easier and less frustrating to learn.  -Never use Vsync in the in-game menu it causes frame drops and sluggishness adaptive Vsync via gpu driver software may be a better option  -Never put view distance over 2500 meters most mp servers lock it too 1600 meters maximum anyway (and override your settings) and anything longer distance than 2500 is not optimized and is meant to be enjoyed by future machines who easily overpower the game.  -For specs 8+ gb of DDR3 RAM and a modern CPU with a high clock speed is most important you only need a mid grade video card to run things on high and medium with a distance below 2500 and vsync off and having more than 4 cores in a CPU matters very little but clock speed does I'd say at least 3.5 Ghz for over 30fps.  -Don't expect to fully understand or master the game anytime soon and expect to be challenged a lot if you do so you'll get a rewarding experience that others wanting instant gratification (which is fine but just not what Arma is good at) may find frustrating.  Hope this helps as an Arma maniac I want to steer peopel who won't like this game away from buying it as much as I want people who would like it to put their money down.10
this game needs work on some of its finer functions such as difficulty aiming and lag time as well as sensitivity.
on't buy this game unless you're willing to pay more money for a game you already payed for.  The game has the est marketing system I have ever seen you have to pay $70 just to get it and an extra $20 to be able to use half the guns in the game you would have thought its original hefty price tag would have been enough.  Other than that it's a good game.-10
he last of the 'Arma''s series...  What to say? A great 'technical' game a really poor overall display.  Not fun: buggy AI dull mission difficult controlling of vehicles not so many vehicles not so many good (and bug free) mod...  It's Arma 2 with some improvments and better graphic...  Really disappointing.-10
This game. this game is ballayoloswag420
s someone who plays Wasteland a lot. You either live long enough to be the person to kill fresh spawns or you die quick enough to become the fresh spawn a lot.10
I love this game more than Selena Gomez.  (That's a lot)  :)
its so good add a f15 f16 and c17s
Good graphics Authentic military simulator.  Addictive multiplayer. Lots of mods to download
lc that should be free or 1/5 the price I used to love this game but the price of dlc and the size of what you get back to the drawing board you ruin this game by taking to long to release new content and over charge for it I'll buy another 4 pack of terraria at least their content updates are free and don't get kicked from every second match because you refuse to pay for over priced extra content-10
his game has constant DLC in order to play Bohemia Interactive is becoming like EA. I could play with certain mods and now this Apex DLC came out I cannot use certain mods without buying the DLC. Please dont support Bohemia Interactive as they just strive for money and not customer satisfaction-10
10/10. Would walk 6km and get one-shotted again.
ea this is an excellent game. If u like single player/multiplayer scenarios WLA Almagamation is a mustu basicly have to take control of the entire Island of Altis. Online multiplayer servers is massive and has everything from hardcore military sims to harvesting and selling dope.11
wesomesimply the ultimate military simulation. Fantastic graphics and visual and pure realism. Incredible weapons feedback and perfect accuracy of balistic and physical.  Many awesome user missions such as: Altis life RPG Wasteland and many more .   10
Great to play with friends. Awesome support from the community with mods and players alike.
Graphics are pretty shocking and the tutorial is very simplistic but when you begin the first mission there is little help regarding what to do. As a soldier you're left to your own devices and to complete goals solo. Yet some of the goals aren't clear.  Not sure if it's just my old PC but if you're running windows 7 you may have a rough time as I found myself constantly lagging which heightened my annoyance.   I personally would not recomend this game to anyone and I can 100% guarantee I will not be buying the full version of this game.
This the tactical shooter you deserve. Buy this game along with Apex and all the add-ons.   doesn't dissapoint.
yeah its pretty cool i guess
his is defenently a work in proggress but with a leap in animations from Arma 2 but still requires jets planes and more variety of cars and classes with an ability to customize your firearm10
Basicly the best game ever made.
his game is hands down the best shooter ever made. It is a very immersive game that has features that make it feel like real life. You get injured and if you heal you will walk slower carry too much and you won't be able to move realistic stamina etc. The amount of weapons and vehicles is nice but nowhere near the competitors. Yet those few weapons have the most realistic damage and ballistics of any game I've played.  Now after seeing that you are probably asking why I didn't suggest this game to others. Well the game has a lot of cool features and is very promising in all the different ways you can play. But the game is unplayable at times and is very unreliable. In single player a $2000 dollar computer will run at 40-50 fps on all maxed out video settings. (That being one of the major faults of the game itself; a game shouldn't require two to three thousand dollars for a computer to run single player at subpar frame rates.) That same single player also has one of the worst AI systems in a game. If you're in the line of fire prone with your group of guys they will shoot you to get to the enemy. This happens more often than you would think and it’s such a problem your squad mates will often kill each other. The enemy AI is far superior in combat and you will find yourself leaving your AI squad behind so you can actually accomplish missions because they tend to get the attention of the enemy AI which seems to target you first no matter what. The enemy AI can see you through bushes 800m away crawling through the 3ft tall grass. So if you want a stealth shooter go somewhere else. In fact if you want a better AI and squad experience go buy the original Ghost Recon because it had a better AI and squad system than this game.   WHO CARES ABOUT SINGLE PLAYER JOHN!   Ok then so you give up on the single player and you go to multiplayer expecting a similar experience without having to worry about the AI. You'll start up a moderate sized 40 man server that has a ping of 30 when you join that is about full and your system will bog down to 10-15 fps. You go around a corner checking for enemies in a town and you won't be able to move your gun fast enough and you'll get owned over and over. If you try to be in a vehicle with a person who has a junk computer good luck seeing anything.  All in all great features on a horrible performance platform and to make up for it you need a server for a computer. -11
h Arma....what do I say about you? You have given me some of the most satisfying video gaming of my life. Theres nothing quite like being dropped into a hot AO with tracers lighting up the sky as you dive out of the chopper and run like your  is on fire to the first available cover. After ten minutes of trading fire with an enemy squad 700 meters away you run up on some poor  CSAT ba$tard ten feet away and you both frantically try to switch from semi- to full auto fire and take each other down. After 30-40 minutes of tense frantic combat with your squadmates who actually want to win and survive and not just be  the enemy town is clear and you pop some cool colored smoke and have a dance party while waiting for the exfil chopper. Halfway to the next area of operations an enemy jet screams by and blows out your helicopter's main drive rotor. As you and ten other of your fellow soldiers plummet towards the ground in a flaming mess the pilot screams out over voice chat: 'I'M SORRY BOYS I LOVE ALL OF YOUUUUUU!'  Boom.  Dead.  I love this game. It has a steep-a$$ learning curve but you will feel like a hard tough deadly warrior when you figure it out.  10/10  EDIT: 64bit is a game changer11
 will admit a fun game BUT DO NOT BUY NOW! Now for $60 and a lack of content this game does not deserve the cash. Especially since their already coming out with these DLC. Wait for the price to drop or for more things to be added. In addition you better have a beast computer  EDIT: Now that price has dropped buy away. The game is defiantly worth the price.10
HIS is an AWESOME game to play. The developer team is really caring about the community. The workshop and map editor helps you to do a LOT of things that no other games can. The hardward requirement is pretty high and you will not get the best experience if you can only run on low or medium. PLUS if you one of those people who play COD or battlefield a lot you may need a few hours to L2P this game.  is seriously an simulation game any gun can pretty much 2 shot or 1 shot you at any distance(and the AI is pretty good at aiming). Stay in cover move quick and you will enjoy this war on the island.10
AI is still 
is a big fail.Not in Alpha state but definitely not completed. Game changes from update to updatealso addons stop working with new version.You might say it's normal because new version has fixed the bugs.Wrong again.New version go on conflict with addons that worked very well from day 1as for bugs...stil not solvedvery often fps drops and connection issues between client and server. Gameplay...LAME...for 2015 Arma 2 was a big hit.  is another version on Arma 2 with 'new' tweaks. Annoying DLC screen while flying in vehicles from DLC.-11
t's gud.  10/10 Best most helpful review ever. (I did this for the badge)11
uper awsome game still playing it - Has endless game modes and endless experiences playing overall only good to say about this.10
his is 1 of the best games i ever played its so realistisc and evrything whit it is good!11
ikes.........Out on patrol focused on the mission. The filling of the pants as a round cracks passed your ear. You hit the ground wondering where the hell THAT came from......get the picture. This game has it all ships planes choppers and for the CoD player tanks and APC's. Sure it has a few bugs but once you are in the game just waiting for that round with your name on it.........  By the way I WAS in the army for 18 years and have heard the one that just missed  Dis-likes..........waiting for that round :)10
so much fun. a good friend gifted this to me and only a few hours in and its so fun! you should try it
Another minecraft ripoff
ow with almost 700 hours on Arma i would say that this game has so much replay value to it.  is a Army Shooter Simulation. The campaign is excellent including all addons and mods on the steam workshop are FREE and Arma releases their OWN addons. Overall its a great game all around where you can use teamwork play against each other competitivly or join a unit to get the full experience of a Military Suimultion out of Arma. At it's current stage i recommend this 100% Great Buy :D10
eally nice game if you're playing wasteland or altis or something like that but if you dont have a good pc and you hate having 30 fps i would not recommend this game :)10
rmA III a product by the company in which has been the start of my gaming days. ArmA III offers a new atmosphere to the gaming community with countless diffrent modding communities diffrent maps to choose from and a long list of game modes such as Survival Zombie Survival Roleplaying Military Simulation and much more. New game modes are always being made and overall the game its self is worth it becuase it has an endless line of fun and variation.10
hildren play CoD boys play Battlefield Men play ARMA.11
Great game! Need a very good rig to run with decent fps online though. Servers stack memory causing FPS issues in multiplayer sometimes. But this game is another Arma classic and is absolutley gorgeous.
Its a great game. Really fun gameplay and nice graphics. Better than CS:GO btw. Its one of the best games i have ever played. Buy it! xD
ate 9/10  Hi there!Personally i believe that all Arma series games are just perfect and they deserve every single dollar you pay for them.Very nice graphicsUltimate battle simulationmods supportedperfect gameplay and much more.... the only minus is the poor optimazation in some PC's... that they dont have a decent cpu-gpu combination....11
 is a really nice simulator. I really like the custom content here and this simulator is definitely going places.
Perfect game!
ITTLE BUGGY BUT GREAT FUN.10
 don't know how to write a game review so I'm going to show my favorite Fish Pie recipe  Ingredients  400g skinless white fish fillet 400g skinless smoked haddock fillet 600ml full-fat milk 1 small onion  quartered 4 cloves 2 bay leaf 4 egg small bunch parsley  leaves only chopped 100g butter 50g plain flour pinch freshly grated nutmeg 1kg floury potato  peeled and cut into even-sized chunks 50g cheddar  grated   Method  Poach the fish. Put the fish in the frying pan and pour over 500ml of the milk. Stud each onion quarter with a clove then add to the milk with the bay leaves. Bring the milk just to the boil – you will see a few small bubbles. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8 mins. Lift the fish onto a plate and strain the milk into a jug to cool. Flake the fish into large pieces in the baking dish. Hard-boil the eggs. Bring a small pan of water to a gentle boil then carefully lower the eggs in with a slotted spoon. Bring the water back to a gentle boil with just a couple of bubbles rising to the surface. Set the timer for 8 mins cook then drain and cool in a bowl of cold water. Peel slice into quarters and arrange on top of the fish then scatter over the chopped parsley. Make the sauce. Melt half the butter in a pan stir in the flour and cook for 1 min over moderate heat. Take off the heat pour in a little of the cold poaching milk then stir until blended. Continue to add the milk gradually mixing well until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat bringto the boil and cook for 5 mins stirring continually until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat season with salt pepper and nutmeg then pour over the fish. Assemble and bake. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Boil the potatoes for 20 mins. Drain season and mash with the remaining butter and milk. Use to top the pie starting at the edge of the dish and working your way in – push the mash right to the edges to seal. Fluff the top with a fork sprinkle with cheese then bake for 30 mins. Make up to a day ahead chill then bake for 40 mins.11
More complicated than an instruction book from Ikea.
This game is outstanding it has so much more things u can do in it and its only in beta right now. So i can just imagine how good it will be when it comes out fully.
eautiful graphics massive scale (terrain is huge and PLENTY of weapons and vehicles to use). The game has a growing mod support gametypes like Wastland Battle Royale King of the Hill and Domination gives the game a big lifespan where boredom is a hard thing to find. The requirements are a bit demanding but with an old phenom processor and GTX 660 I run the game fine.10

unoptimized game with overpriced dlcs
 very good game. Admittedly I haven't played it very much since Counter Strike took me and didn't let go. However if you are looking for a good military simulator game with a intresting campaign and fantastic multiplayer this is it. Play PlayerUnknowns battle royale it is a classic and where I have spent ~75% of my play time.11
Not much i can say one of the best games i have played
Great Game One Of The Best Game's Ive ever played you really can get stuck in :)
f you like playing games at low fps this game is for you.        No joke lol.10
The one and only in military simulation sandbox games.
f you are the type of person that likes military shooters and/or Milsim this is the game for you. Great graphics but slow at times. Mulitplayer fps is not the best. But this game is VERY CPU dependant. I reccomend this game if you have a good pc10
Full of dank memes
supeer funny and super realistic
is amazing to say the least. At first I did find the game to be mundane I had played a little bit of the editor and some KoTH which yes was fun but it didnt feel like I had spent my money well at all. Then i jumped into co-op It was amazing I found myself up everynight till about 3 am playing From uphill battles among hills trying to push back enemies and reganing control of the area To being perched as a sniper with the immense pressure of providing overwatch for my squad From piloting players to help in battle To gearing up in a mowhawk only to be fired upon in almost every situation From trecking along plain grass for 1 hour straight to only getting gunned down by one well placed machine gun To having to chose weather or not i save the squad leader or save a sniper to provide cover for the rest of out squad. Co-op is fantastic  Then i discovered mods It was Amazing Playing as a russian in soviet winter To becoming a solider in Vietnam being gunned down by a heli while i was chillin...I mean on lookout in a boat  Not to mention the fact that I have met many fantastic people throught his game :D  ...and also have created a few enemies &lt;3 :  Overall Arma3 Is brilliant mods the community and all the different types of gamemodes equait to a brilliant game.11
Remember when driving into a chicken-wire fence would blow up your car around 60% of the time?  Let's bring those days back.
best milsim of all times. period
Buy it now :)
When I shoot it gets me a little wet I get super soked
ude get in the car' 'Hang on. What is that weird sound'................... 'IT'S A ING BATTLE TANK!!!! ING RUN!!!!'10
This game is hands down one of the best experiences you can get on a PC. The gameplay is amazing and the amount of great mods is breathtaking.
Did not buy for military simulation experience. Bought to dress up as priest and role play with other like minded idiots. Was not disappointed. Would recommend.
Fun and epic game.
First hour of playing  I played some gamemode (I dont remember what one) I then took a helicopter and went to fuel it up at the gas station had no clue how to fly three seconds later ran out of gas and crashed the helicopter  200/10 love this game!
or the little I played this is definitive game for military simulation lovers.   It has some bugs but the game is great and offers TONS of customizations and options to make it your own. A word of advice: You will never learn what is to play Arma if you are alone. So get an unit soldier!  10/1010
Great game to play with freinds
ntel 2 Cores 2 Thread = 10 fps 2 Cores 4 Threads = 11 fps 4 Cores 4 Threads = 40 fps 4 Cores 8 Threads = 80 fps 8 Cores 16 Threads = 140 fps AMD 2 Cores 2 Modules = Doesn't Run 2 Cores 4 Modules = 12 fps 4 Cores 4 Modules = 20 fps 4 Cores 8 Modules = 22 fps  Solution to good gaming experience in . Waste $3000 on a decent PC.10
ad controls buggy as hell. You get to 'step over' objects which is stupid because half the time it glitches out and ing kills you. Why is there no jumping? The physics suck you run into a car from behind as it's going 70 mph and you're going 80 and you ing explode and die in a fire but if you run into a wall at 40 mph you're fine just a scratch. I like the vehicles and I like how I can swim and shoot the editor is really fun and a lot of other things. I can't imagine how I have over a 130 hours in this game.-10
ts a good game great community. I have played it a while.... just a bit to..... test things out11
good game but my pc is  :/
MG THIS GAME!!!!  BUY IT IMMEDIATELY because with this game you gona play a lot! A well done game focused on pure realism and made for the players in mind!  It has a great game engine you never seen before everything in the game is simulated. the guns the bullets the choppers tankstruckssoldiers etc.  It is a tripla A title based on multiple real life islands the biggest is 270km2 wide with astonishing deatils!  And if you get bored with the original game theres tons of mods you can play.And dont get me started on the multiplayer part wohooo its really where the game shines!Tons of players online everyday and top tier servers available for you without paying any addinational fees.  If every game could be this well made we wouldnt have enough time to live our lifes....10
on my first  BR 15th Oct. feelsgoodman great game.10
My experience with the game     over 1350 hours    mainly played with realism units    have spent a lot of time mission making and modding    Positives
I SUCK AT THIS GAME!
Arma Arma Arma.   Live like the original U.S.A Soldier Life.
This is a good GAME!!!
One of the only games on steam that has a 10GB update just for sound.  Great game with unlimited stories and gameplay.  Would recommend to all.
People realize this game is a MILSIM and developed for it! Exile and Altis Life are modifications and don't blame BI that they ed your server isn't their fault. BI creating a game for military simulations not a dayz or altis life there is other games to play if you want exile buy DayZ if you want Altis life go play smth else but this game is for military simulation and don't cry!
Dont buy apex. Tanoa is way too big and widespread. Not worth the money
un casual game to play with a friend. But once you joina a MilSim it no longer becomes a game it becomes duty10
hh what button do I click to send this review? 10/10 game must buy10
his game is addictive but so bad with its stupid physics if i crash into a bush in an armoured veichle I ing die next minute if you ram into an SUV in a tank.....guess what the tank flies to china.....................Thanks for the overpriced game but its fun with mods.......... HERE IS A VIDEO THAT EXPLAINS  IN 30 SECONDS:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdmRUiA3Xhc 11
reat game! Though I do recommend to someone that is considering buying this game to have a 'somewhat decent' PC to play it. It's no fun playing a shooting game when you can barely even shoot accurately due to having bad performance!10
ery good game I think Apex is overpriced though.10
est mil sim so far. And besides that you can have fun in the rpg servers.  Bad side is if you really wanna fully enjoy the game you have to buy all the dlcs and the latest Apex dlc is like 27 bucks.10
 have a lot to say about this game and not a lot of time to say it.  Soldiers of the future are kinda dumb but the mods make it cool AI are immune to pain and they can headshot you from the Greek island of Altis all the way to you sitting at your actual computer.  I like RHS pretty fun. Uhhh join my milsim unit.11
his game is extreamly addicting fun and diverse... And the maps are HUGE!!!10
Nerly 4K on this game what shuld you say?
you should buy it    Yankee Oscar Lima Oscar
xcellant game great graphics and physics10
xcellent open world map plenty of things to do wasteland fly heli's sell drugs in altis life. Fun tactical gunplay really easy to screw up but very rewarding when played correctly. Tons of fun and highly recommend it.10
ou don't have it already? Just get it. It's the best thing on Steam hands down.10
salutes*   Pvt. Cocomunches reporting for duty sir!!!   If JROTC has taught me anything it's that I WANT TO JOIN THE ARMY. ARMY STRONG. I'm a real pilot in REAL life. *Crashes helicopter*  FRIENDLY FIRE SOLDIER.....DONT GO AWOL ON ME.11
f you seek a big community this game is not for you. 6000+ Servers with about 500 players online a day scattered around. Give or take 50 to 100 people. So you have 5000+ Dead servers up with 0 players. Game probably use to be active now the community is dead.  I would not recommend this game if you seek company. If you like playing by yourself i recommend this game.10
;= Making drug runs = Killing turtles because they are worth a lot of money = Getting mugged by people with guns because you dont want to die = Ai seeing you from a mile away and shooting you = Killing your friends  = PLANES =HELICOPTERS = $60 well spent = BY THE GAME
Plays battle royal Survives hour and a half with good loot gets in truck drives into bush truck stops working gets out truck explodes.- 10/10 so realistic.11
here to start............ CONS   the engine is total  !!!!.  multiplayer server perfomance is poor the ammount of content isnt much at all (needs MORE WEAPONS) no shotgun............WTF no support for ballstics and wind ASSLOADS of bugs. some that are gamebreaking little to no support for errors most of all (steam ticket check fail) WTF IS THAT??? its been in the game since alpha why hasnt it been fixed. why does this game continue to crash randomly???   PROS..........  the community mods (better than BI could make IMO) VERY VERY VERY slow improvements flexability     if you are considering this game PLEASE think it through it can be fun but there are MANY problems.  i wish i could get a refund honestly-10
oming from someone that played A1 and A2 when they came out away before it Dayz Mod.   is a big ing cluster crap. There are some improvemnts on the gameplay but the problem in the game is the engine. I have a high-end PC i can't play it with more than 30 FPS ( singleplayer i can max 50 fps without any AI spawned) with the last updates i am now unable to enter any multiplayer server. I have search for solutions everywhere and nothing. The game is more like a bug that you have to deal with if you want to have fun a bug that was present in the other Armas but not as bad.  Don't buy this game unless its really really cheap the DEVS don't care about the game as a long long long time fan of the series this is certanly the last Arma or product i will buy from this company.-11
E CAREFUL YOU ARE PAYING FOR A BETA GAME!  this  has release in 2013 and is bugged as  crashers glitches all the  you meet at Arma 2 this game does not seems to be finished and the devs aren't really trying to  the content of this is laughable is lower than Arma 2 with that half futuristic   mods and the comunity are the only thing that save this franchise other wise it will be dead quick mod are not flawless the are very buggy more than the main game but still wort to get  so if you will buy for the vanilla GET OFF this is not a good game but if you want to play with mods you can give it a try i recommend you to buy on a steam sale to not be too painful for your pocket.-10
ell the game seams to run. Other than a few dozen deaths from exiting exiting boats in water or crouching on a rocks. FPS with Dual Titans is a slow as 20FPS at times. With updates come the new waves of hackers (literally scipt kiddies here) there are as may cheaters as legitimate players on the best servers.   Sadly the hackers seam to stay while the honest players sick of team killers and friendly looters get Battle Eye banned accros the board by Kids somehow running Official servers. Yes you buy the game connect to a server have bad blood and some joe shmo can ban you accross the board on all Arma games while whitelisting themselves. Any of the unchecked self appointed Admins can literally shut down your game permanantly. The is no control Bohemia is ok with this happening to you as they already made their money and expect you to rebuy the game each time this happens.   There are tools if you get sick of playing on the smaller map Stratis Atlis is a big map with towns and forests but only Role PLaying Servers run that map? So back to the Tools there are  Tools to build maps but it doesn't work even after 60+ hours put in the editors still throw constant erors and crash befor booting.   This is by far the Best 'Alpha Release' I have ever played but is also a game that in a mere week has become a bore with broken editors and a 'Single' Multiplayer Map. Blah.  It should be called ARMA GUN STORE SIMULATOR as the majourity time in game your not even fighting your just running for hours to a gun store but are being artillery spammed to death 30 times before you can even get a gun.  FPS where the game is designed to facilitate farming.-10
ot recommended even for people who like a good military simulation game.  Good: - Lots of potential for realism and immersion - Massive variety of ways to interact with game elements  Bad: - Lack of variety in terms of gear (three colours don't make three different items) - Lack of any real weapons: it's all near-future stuff - Gunshots sound too mechanical or like movie sound effects - Weapon animations are loose: effects don't sync up right (two gunshots when you shoot three bullets etc.) - Vehicles are very difficult to control without dedicated joystick/wheel  VERY Bad: - Needlessly complicated control scheme which will take hours on hours to get used to (literally) - To say the learning curve is steep implies that there is a learning curve - Many functions of the game are hidden unexplained unintuitive or poorly implemented - Potential for realism is destroyed when each mission becomes a sprint between ambushes  There are several different tutorials - some in the 'virtual reality' some on the islands some as text-only and none of which are adequate. Each tutorial is about ten-thirty seconds long and involves no actual help assuming that because you pressed the right buttons once you now know how to do it in combat. The team seems to have put zero effort into making the game intuitive: you will spend much of your time looking up various controls and reading about methods of interaction.  This game is not finished. If you're looking for a good intuitive fun military simulator to get away from the Call of Duty bullcrap pick up Operation Flashpoint: Red River. It might not be as extensive and it suffers from a lack of replayability but it isn't nearly as frustrating as Arma.-10
wesome and pretty realistic game.  If you have an AMD setup do NOT buy this game ! If you have a 800$ pc do NOT buy this game because even on lowest settings you can't get more than 30fps other than the first 10 minuts of game then it drops half way down.  If you are ok with games that run at 20 fps then you will be happy with .. since it sometimes run at 25fps.  The amount of desync is insane so if you have the battlefield 4 getting killed gehind walls don't buy this game because it's even worse literally . The huge FPS drops when there is an explosion is insane and the sound crackling and making you drop to 5 fps is constant.  The amount of times where you empty a mag on an enemy that just turns around and 1 shot you is prety common.  If you have +1000$ build a intel setup with nvidia gpu and buy this game. Then buy a streaming pc if you want to stream. well if you have +1800$ actually and not 1000$  If you have +1000$ build a amd setup with ati gpu and DO NOT buy this game. Then buy any other game and play with +60 fps on ultra while streaming.  The graphics and the resources this game demands makes no sense at all. Arma 2 looks as good if not better. Oh yeah there's ragdoll in  woohoo. No seriously. Do NOT buy this game constant DLC that you have to pay for optimization updates followed by lower performance... unless you have intel/nvidia setup.  This game is based on x87... the most  thing to do. 3 years of dev and yeah... you get the picture.  Just deleted the game myself will never reinstall will never recommend it and will never buy a game from Bohemia interactive in my life and will beat my kids uo if they buy one! JK or am i?   game is at 50$ on steam and then you can spend 50$ on DLC (probably 50$ more when future DLC will be released) and 1400$ on a PC just to play this game. Isnt that just great?!  Oh if you have some spare money after all this feel free to donate some to me so i can play a game that i bought 2 years ago when i had the same performance (~25fps) on my old dual core pc with gts 260 that i have on my 8350 with r9 270x setup.-11
irst off this game is amazing. It has something to suit everyone even though it is a military simulator. This is because of a dedicated community of modders. So if you don't want to be a soldier get on an Altis Life server and fish or something. If you want the fight a gladitorial battle to the death try Battle Royale. If you're into zombies there Breaking Point or Overpoch. If you want a strict PvP mode that plays similaryly to BP or Overpoch get Wasteland. There is so much that this game has to offer that I couldn't begin to list it all. This game like every other is not without flaws however unlike many games the dedicated community of modder also takes care of that with their own patches and fixes. Seems like Bohemia Interactive did everything right with  and the opposite with DayZ Standalone.  EDIT: DayZ Standalone actually seems to be coming together although rather slowly. But back on topic with almost one-thousand hours of playtime on  I can say that there are very few (noticeable) issues within the game. And most of them stem from mods that aren't properly configured. All in all there are few games of this scale that have a truly dedicated and helpful community and developers that work so closely with the community of players. It really forms the base of some of the best experiences that I personally have had with any videogame.10
Even someone with a tricked out PC can't play this smoothly. Otherwise it would be awesome.
his is a waste of money. You'd think it would be good but it isn't. It has all the pieces of a good game but lacks emotion even for a sandbox.-10
The most boring game ever!
fter nearly 400 hours in  I have to say its really good. I played on Altis Stratis Australia Lakeside Takistan and many other maps. I really recommend playing with mods. Its just funnier with friends also. If you like to buy it tell other friends of it! Yes. There are many bugs but also still many updates.10

I've been running for an hour in this game
hat can I say about  I've played 832.5 hours in  purchased all the dlc's and will purchase the upcoming dlc's I have played everything the multiplayer side of  has to offer and enjoyed it the community isn't perfect but far from the standard that the cod community has become.10
I like the hardcore nature of it but it is just inaccessable. You wait ages for something to happen and when it does you are often killed quickly and have to start alll over.  I want to like you!!

Nice game))) 10/10
 rarely rate a game this high but this one is a perfect 10/10 for the genre it represents vs. any competitive products out there.  Bar none the BEST military simulation on the PC that is available to the public and priced under $10000  Yes there are flight sims that do flight more realistic there are tank sims that do tanks more realistic etc etc etc. However there are no other games that combine ALL the aspects of a military simulation in one full package like the Arma series does.  Arma III is the continuation of the Arma series which started out as 'Operation Flashpoint 1985'. OPF1985 was considered the best of it's time when it was released and the Arma series has continued that tradition with many of the same developers that created OPF1985.  With a simple quick mission builder a full blown complex high-end mission editor mods mods and even more mods to make Arma III something really special to those of us who enjoy these type of games.  If you want the same feature set but more realistic you would have to actually be in the military and have a security clearance and thousands of dollars. But you can get close to the same thing that real militaries around the world actually train with for less than $60 and you don't need to sign-up for service.  If you want to enjoy this but can't afford it at full price or have an older or slower PC then Arma II almost as chock full of features and mods so if you can't get this get Arma II.10
ossibly the worst game created so far even compared to really  indie titles. This game was never optimized for a computer from the look of things. If you run intel anything you'll be fine but god forbid that you run AMD you'll get 0-20 fps no matter what situation. The developers for this game are autistic  who have clearly never cared for gameplay in anything sure you can argue 'It's a simulator not a game' but it's still a 'Military Simulator'. There is no effort for gunplay whatsoever in this torm of a simulator. All the guns feel the same bullets never connect where they're supposed to you run around feeling clunky as  shooting nerf guns at nothing.   TL;DR Pros: It's a game  Cons: It's a really  game Low/nonexistant FPS  gunplay Models are ugly Server list sucks  Just about every game out there is better than this  and that's terrible seeing as there's a full dev team that made this.  Just take your $60 and spend it elsewhere that's all there is to it.-10
his game runs poorly on new state of the art systems. I honestly wish I didn't even buy it. I spent hours trying to get the game to run on my 6700k and gtx 1080 and in the end requested a refund that was denied because I spent more than two hours trying to make it work. Gpu boosting is terribly implemented with underclocking in game unless zoomed in. People will tell you that the framerate depends on your cpu but while zoomed in and the gpu boosts the framerate is almost playable. As far as the game get use to getting shot at and killed by people you never see. The game is a frustrating technical mess that the programmers optimized with the proficiency of a potato.-10
o this one is a weird one. On the one hand this game can be an amazing amount of fun whilst playing several different mods already integrated into the system. It is some of the most tense fun ive had in a strategic FPS. The game also looks pretty dang good  On the other hand this game screams BETA with bugs a plenty lack of many features that was avilible in arma 2. For example bi-pod integration still hasn´t been going in. That alongside the DLC being added even though the game is extremely unpolished.   Simply put:  is great but also a big dissapointment from me. 6.5/10  p.s performance is still a huge problem for many people so make sure you can run it!10
h after putting just a little bit of time into it this game is OK i guess   ¯\_(?)_/¯  Love  Jester81411
Amazing game! I've put over a 100 hours in this game mostly in the Editor and it still has me coming back for more. The mod support for this game is also freaking awesome with evrything I could ever ask for and more! The campainge isn't the best but the multiplayer is everything a tactical shooter should be.
start king of the hill shoot someone from 0 range i get killed. played for the free weekend and now ill buy it      best game everrrr
 wish i could play this game if anyone wants to help a poor child in africa pls gift me this game10
Used to be a good game. dont even get me started on the  dlc that they basically force on you if you wanna play the game right.  you bohemia
I have really enjoyed this game for a long time but the new DLC is way overpriced. I don't mind spending a bit here and there but $34.99 for some new weapons and a few vehicles is a bit much. With 5 more dlcs planned in the future. If prices stay the same thats another $174.95  Lets be honest this game isnt worth potentially $200+ for all the game content.
 well made military simulator with a great community. The game puts you right in the action during those tense moments when the bullets flying around you could kill you in one or two hits making every battle decision worth thinking over. Missions with a team could never be more realistic then when you are just a band of gamers who have never met before hunched over your computers and just barely making a dent in the OPFOR forces.  Even when you are on the move to the action the game still keeps your attention. The moments when you are completely oblivious then suddenly ragdoll to the ground with the respawn screen popping up really teach you to be aware.  Overall ArmA III is an amazing game that made a lasting impression on me considering I'm new to the series. Originally buying it to play Altis Life I soon found the rich treasure trove of content this game holds.10
Buy this game. 20/10
Do you recommend this game: Yus
I would recommend this game to CoD players
xtremely realistic military simulator with an amazing campaign that keeps you on edge at all times. Multiplayer is pretty badly organized but is still fun when you find a gamemode you like. I would pay the full price for the campaign so this is definitely worth it.10
is a great game with a steep learning curve. If you are willing to put in the time then you will have a great time playing this game; you will make friends enemies memes and everything in between playing on servers. I'd recommend bring an irl friend along for the wild ride that is Arma Epoch/Exile/Overpoch and building a base. Great Game - 5/710
It's a great game if your computer can run it.
reat game if you have the patience to play it but has quite a few bugs/glitches.10
The only game I can play on 30fps without any problems.  30/60fps would play again.
Really fun
f you're looking for intense Realism buy it. Simple as that.10
ove this game with a passion there's so many things you can do and I've spent nearly 1K hours on it with both my accounts together I can highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys open world roleplay or playing tactical10
 makes me wanna kill my self due to getting completely rekt everyday.  You get shot once with full body armor you die. You shoot a guy with no armor at all with a 50. cal hew doesn't die. Yee! ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????yee?
I ing hate this game yet I'd buy every single DLC made.
its cool
0/10 I cant drift my tank pls dont buy this game.
heres really endless possiblities when it comes to . Overall the game is a great military-sim and I strongly recommend if you don't already have it buy it. This game really suits everyone because of how flexible the game is. The only thing I would like is for the game to get optimized. ????? 4/5.10
reat gameIt's a must buy.10
here is just so much to do in the ARMA series that if you're a fan of first person shooters there really is no reason not to have this simulation in your library. I may be a little bias since I've loved the ARMA series since the very early days of ARMA 2 but there is also very little not to love in any ARMA simulation. If the base game just isn't enough for you there's also a few hundred mods you can install to make the experience funner and more immersive. I would recommend  to everyone there is so many different roles to play offline and online it'd be hard for you to not be able to enjoy the sim and have some fun.10
Very good game if you like to rolepay.
Got Arrested for standing still for too long. And got kidnapped 6 times in one hour. Great game playing with friends.
wesome graphics and plot but game's playability is very low. Controls are very hard to use. You can not change them in the way you choose. It is the worst game I ever played for 4-5 years. Really annoying just because of controls. There are universal keys like 'T' for chat or 'Y' for team chat they are totally different. And another problem is that Bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like DayZ. Another not recommended game for me.-10
When i die i feel like rubbing sand paper in and out my .....10/10 for the pain
aving spent about 1000 hours on Arma2/OA (between D2D/Disk Version/Steam) and 70 hours in  it's no contest in anything but graphics. Arma2/OA is much better in terms of realism. The bullet sponge AI in Arma3 (sorry body armor doesn't let you just keep trucking like it was a bee sting) just kill any immersion whatsoever along with the ridiculous fantasy Iranian units. Also simple things like the 'flying' drop down when placing units are gone in the new editor for no apparent reason.  Overall  does look a lot better but still runs pretty poorly regardless of high end hardware (i7 960@4.1Ghz+STRIX R9 390X/ 3930K@4.2Ghz+STRIX GTX 1060/ i7 4770K@4.3Ghz+780Ti MATRIX SLI (previously 290X MATRIX CF and 390X STRIX CF) / i7 6700@stock+GTX 1070FE / i7 5930K@4.5Ghz+STRIX 980Ti SLI (previously 780Ti MATRIX SLI).   Rather than wasting time on a dubious futuristic setting it would have been far better for the developers to focus on quashing performance issues and providing a believable simulation with realistic damage based on impact point+round+angle. Also AI is still very dumb and STILL unable to haul @$$ with a sense of urgency.   I see  as a downhill slide for the series being far more casual than previous iterations in terms of attempted realism compounded by unwillingness to expand the core mechanics for realism that had been laid down since OPFP. In a way it's more like the Battlefield version of the series.  Also on the campaigns; they are straight up trash. Resistance and Red Hammer have not been bested to date although the Arma 2 campaign was pretty fun.  is just a slog of monotony; APEX is a waste of money.-11
shot my friends helicopter and it leaked all its fuel  10/10
Glitched into the ground and stuck for 3hours.  10/10
it is worth buying
i am  off so bad right now i cant connect to any servers in arma i am really !!!!!!!!!!
here do I begin...  Well Arma III seems really fun hints the reason I bought the game however the game is really really really really poorly optimized. Im only getting 20-30 fps on both SP and MP however I have an awsome system. Im going to show you the recommended specs you need to run the game then im going to show you my specs here they are...     RECOMMENDED:  OS: Windows 7/8/10 (64bit)  Processor: Intel Core i5-2300 or AMD Phenom II X4 940 or better  Memory: 4 GB RAM  Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 or AMD Radeon HD 7750 with 1 GB VRAM or better  DirectX®: 11  Hard Drive: 25 GB free space (SSD/Hybrid HDD/SSHD storage)  Sound: DirectX®-compatible  MY SPECS: OS: Windows 7 (64bit) Prossessor: AMD FX(tm)-8350 (Eight Core Processor) Memory: 16 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA Geforce GTX 970ti DirectX: 11 Hard Drive: 1.81 TB free space Sound: Doesn't Matter  MY SPECS REACH WAY OVER THE RECOMMENDED AND IM RUNNING 20-30 FPS ARE YOU KIDDING ME THIS GAME IS A JOKE IN MY OPINION. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone to me its just a waste of $60. This game needs to be optimized waaaaaaaaaaay more before I play this crap again. : (-11
nice game. full of lean mean spicey memes
ve gotten this game out of spite from many youtube videos and mods. I've paid money so you can save yours. This is why  Armed Assault 3/Armed Assault III isn't so great.  BattlEye: *shiver* don't even get me started on this false positive piece of  lol.  Optimization: Warframe = Max settings runtime tesselation on my AMD Athlon II X3 455 and Radeon HD 7770 Factory OC 60 - 75 fps  = Lowest settings possible same specs as above 13-*20-30* depending on map level and the server  * mostly Also graphics don't affect  if you don't have a 'perfect build'  Gameplay: Could fix a few things like standing up when crawling over rocks. Overall not too shabby.  Mods: Prepare your HDD/SSD space gentlemen. Half the 'realism' or 'USA/RU' content is 500 - 3000 MB Oh yeah remember optimization? You'll love it with mod optimization too.  Community: Everyone plays Altis Life or Island Life or basically RP those who don't play it play insurgency/ctf stuff but there's a small percent who play 'realism' squads. I've attempted this good guys   experience. CHATLOG: Kawurftha: mfw playing realism with this group I recently joined Kawurftha: i die Kawurftha: they don't let me respawn Kawurftha: i've been waiting for 1 1/2 hours Kawurftha: they are finally almost done Holy ing  'Because you don't respawn in real life' Oh  I'm sorry I didn't realize banding all your wounds no matter what and injecting morphine instantly cures everything in real life? *cringe*  Graphics: Could be improved pretty good overall but see optimization.  Overall: 4.5/10 Now I hear you ArmA people saying 'WOAH WOAH WOAH SUM1'S ANGRY THE CAN'T RUN ARMA!!! SO THEY GIVE BAD REVIEW!!!!' No Your just too  to realize that BIS isn't gonna fix optimization Not just that but 66.49 CAD? FOR A FULL GAME IN 2015? THIS ISN'T THE 1950s. Warframe is free and it runs better than this  and I can max it. 'b00t teh warframe is missions not open wurld' I mean Warframe has a pretty big ing view distance (I so think) Warframe would probably still run better than ArmA if it was open world.      I'm still gonna play this game every now and then though.-11
now i really want to thumbs up this game but i just cant unless u have an amazing pc most game modes especially king of the hill will run at 10-20 fps i dont have a bad computer it rund far cry 4 on ultra at 40-50 fps but this game will only frustrate u if u dont have a really expensive pc ....... i loved it personaly with its team based tatics and damage model yet whn ur in the war zone it lags so much so thts y i dont thumbs up this game
Not worth 60$
If you want a game where you can  around and have fun then this is it.
This is as real as it gets for war games. If your looking for a good realistic game this is for you 10/10.
he bible is wrong Arma has proven the evolution because you can see fish walking on land10
/10 - An evolution from previous installments. Nice graphics and solid simulation. Great squad placed multiplayer over a massive 400km sandbox. Lack of content hurts it's score although more is being released and developed. More campaign missions coming this December.  Pros: Nice graphics solid shooter simulation mechanics. More accessable compared to other titles but looses none of it's depth. Great combined arms MP.   Cons: Lack of content only a partial campaign. No training missions and still plenty of bugs remains.10
his game has pretty good looking graphics. The options or configure menu could be hard to understand to some players. The controls are overcomplicated. Ragdoll physics is horrible. But the game is trying to be more tactical likewell its not tactical at all most of you enemies run out in the open like 'Hey! Look at me! Shoot me!'. Playing alone isn't to great but with friends you capture the whole experience of . The maps are huge so you have to do lots of exploringpretty cool if you enjoy exploring. The vehicles have their own controls maybe except the land vehicles and some other type of vehicles. The air vehicles are hard to control unless you played the rest of the Armas.(BTW still don't know how to use air vehicles). Is this a full release or a beta? I do not know it has plenty after plenty of bugs to fix. Like when that time I shot some one his body had an oversized neck the body itself had its body armor turned into a size of a pea. This game is 4/10 hard to recommend.-10
irst of all  THIS GAME IS AMAZING.  If you like military games realistic stuff vehicles big map pvp (There is much more). This game is for you. If your bored of doing missions you can always go and play other gamemode like King of the hill in which there are three teams and one town and the team who can hold off the town for the longest wins. There is altis life in which you make money by selling drugs/ mining etc. and then spend the money on stuff you can rob people gas stations and become a cop (RP). Its a really fun game to play.  I would rate it  9.5/10  because of some fails in the game's mechanics its still a really fun game to play with friends or alone.10
too unoptimised my game carn run so many other games like witcher 3 gta v but not arma i have even done some optimising the files still low fps
ell why should you buy this game?  If you think you've seen some glitches in your time of playing games then this is going to raise the bar a bit higher.10
t seems the nice folks at Bohemia took a step back when making . Theres no armory mode like in Arma 2 there's actually not much of anything. It seems Bohemia slacked off in order to make the end user finish the game through modding-10
This Game is really not what i wanted i runs like  and feels like crap with these wonkey controls.
his review has been amended and updated to reflect a major change in the game.   brought the ArmA infantry formula to it's most refined and now it features a more advanced flight model to compliment that.  It's still overpriced at $60 but would easily be worth a reduced price on sale.  This review will be amended if and when they change the AFV physics and interface.10
verall this game is very realisticfun and tactical ideal to play with friends; This game is solely for people who love Military Simulation and Realsim please if you are one of these people I only have one thing to say. GET THIS GAME! :D10
I may not have even played 10 hours of this game at the time I am writing this review but  THIS GAME IS SPLENDID.
It sucks 
Not a military simulation despite all the available military information on the internet.
Game was great until BattlEye launcher patch. Now I have a fucntional game that won't let me join any multiplayer servers because BattlEye won't work.   Deleted game and contents x2 with no fix.
fter playing this game for a while the dlc comes and the game still has horrible lag and bug issues.... They do not support the main mods for this game that actually keep the game alive. After about 2 years I have seen little improvement just more money dlc. Some of the glitchy deaths bugs have been around since Arma 2.. I would not buy at full price.. I bought this in alpha and apparently it is still in alpha -10
this game is absolutly incredible
e before playing Arma III: ??  ?? ?( ?° ?? ?°)  ??? &lt;???  ???/ ? ???  ?? /??/? ???  ?? ?????? ?_?  ??/?/  ? /?/  ?(?(?  ?? ?? ? ? ? ?) ? ??) / ? )??L?

Feddback: +lots of mods +great maps +nice sp (never thought) -the egine makes problems  9/10 SP 10/10 MP
It's a nice game but the only thing i hate is that some servers are unjoinable or whitelisted and for the first time playing an ARMA game it's hard to know the controls. I like the altis life and the battle royal servers.
best war game atm
 have to say that I enjoyed Arma 2 and Arma2:OA better than I enjoy . They should reimplement CTI which was literally the most played Original Game Mode And I say original because the only thing the game was other recognized for was DayZ. Which I always prefered Regular Arma 2. There were so many vehicles in Arma 2 like literally a few hundred different varients or different vehicles. Where this new Arma you see many of the same things. Lack of Base Game Multiplayer gamemodes. 'CTI....' I have literally over 1000 hours on Arma 2 and 400 or so on . I have to say I was happier on Arma 2.-11
I have really enjoyed this game in the past. I would have even written a positive review. The game has some flaws in actual gameplay but its something you can't really find anywhere else. However I am giving a negative review not because of gameplay issues but due to the ridiculousness that is the multiplayer system. I just attemped for half an hour mind you to get into a game. This is the process in which you have to attempt to get into a game.  Launch Arma Multiplayer Wait 5 min for all grazzilion servers to load Find a server without any restrictions such as on locked games or full games because that fuction doesn't work Join server Get an error Sent back to multiplayer list Doesn't load any servers Restart arma Repeat for half an hour to get into a game  The system is ing broken and ridiculous. Favorite servers? Doesn't work. Limit servers based on certain criteria? Doesn't work. Refresh list? Doesn't work. Great game except you can't actually play it when you want because of the server situation. Instead of fixing this what do the devs do? Release new ing helicopters and bipods. Whoopie Thanks Bohemia.
DON'T BUY! OPTIMIZATION IS TERRIBLE!
This game a dream come true for military enthusiast the combat is brutal a punishing some time I jump when I make unexpected contact with the enemy I find my self feeling real fear something I've ever felt playing a war game  gets a 10/10 from me.
Cant stop playing!
At no point did this game start to feel like it got out of beta.
20 Frames per second of pure fun
mazing game with a detailed and epic campain sure to keep onself busy for a decent amount of time. the co-op is also epic great to jam with friends. 10/10 would buy again.11
his is honestly the best game i have ever played i bought it two weeks ago and already have 148hrs. There is just so much variety to this game really reccommend buying this game.10
just a sphere moving around the screen.  More entertainment playing Pong.   10/10 spicy memes again
Love this game
Absolutely fantastic and never played before game. This game is a beast! I recommend this game with 9/10 Stars
f you can deal with the painfully un optimized engine this game is probably the tride and true sim with an amazing editor that keeps me doing stuff for hours. Alot of fun but the ENGINE UGH WHY. See the thing about this game is it doesnt run well for us AMD boys. Even though its CPU intensive Arma lacks the capability to use full capicity of them octa core processors. its primary need is for a mainly speed for 2 cores. so bascially even though we have 8 cores to use its only mostly putting stress on two. so if you suck intel  you wont have an issue but for the amd guys be weary. Advice would be to turn your graphics up as it puts less stress on cpu for gpu and since i got a decent gpu that works well for me.10
ery Tactical Strategy I've enjoyed this game way too much I recommend it. You'll have way too much fun if you bring friends.10
ARMA: III Is Well.... A Good Game :D
very fun but cam be a very low fps game
ve played Arma for a long time. But when mod developers ban you from their mod because of a VAC ban more than three or four years ago that is absolutely stupid. If you like being banned by admins that were destroyed by you and your friends in a firefight play this game. I was banned by an admin with the message ' YOU LYSTICS' GG.-11
 campaign is a big powerful deeply engrossing thing but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt there are no tank missions no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why to a point: Arma's vehicles especially its airborne offering take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue and it's frustrating that 13 years on Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience. If you want to get familiar with Arma's military machinery you'll need to look to the showcase missions download one of the many community-built scenarios out there or jump into the enormous multiplayer. There are a vast range of multiplayer game modes to take your fancy. King of the Hill challenges three teams of 16 players to wrest control of a particular objective using small arms tanks helicopters the works. If you're of a more co-operative bent there are a range of developer missions that require teamwork to beat the odds including the enormous Escape From Altis mission which tasks your plucky group with safely reaching the coastline while avoiding the sights of a vastly superior enemy force.  Yet the most interesting of Arma's multiplayer modes stem from the community. Wasteland is a survival mode in a similar vein to DayZ but without the zombies and with considerably more military equipment. Altis Life meanwhile eschews the focus on soldiers in favour of a cops-and-robbers scenario where players tired of making money through picking fruit or mining ore club together to perform elaborate bank heists and player-police hunt them down. A lengthy paid alpha followed by six months of staggered campaign releases has given 's multiplayer an extraordinary range.  This is largely thanks to the fantastic foundation that is the island of Altis which makes every mission every multiplayer match every combat engagement feel unique. There's something about Bohemia's world-building that inspires people. Importantly though 's vanilla content now stands on equal footing with those third-party inspirations. It's still a little rough around the edges but it's a darned impressive package nonetheless.10
LOVE this game people. The base game is awesome a bit buggy but great. And if you want more fun with the game you can download a -ton of mods to make it what you want
exy ambient also lighting.10
awesome game you should get it
Greatest slideshow ive ever seen!
 Apex Edition (All DLCs to date)
the continuation of the series by Bohemia. New players will love it old players will love it. At the end of the day it is still Arma and it will still make you frustrated. But when it goes right it's worth it. Even if it only goes right once.10
I wish DayZ would be this smooth.
his game was released in September 2013 without a single player campaign. Part 1 of 3 DLC s to add it was released in October. Its now Christmas and and whilst there has been other updates for multiplayer the final 2 DLCs that add the missing single player campaign are no where in sight....  It will probably be years before we see them and the fan boys will consider that good service.... Personally I do not.... My advice... save your money for something else.-10
The quintessential first person military sim for the seasoned military shooter fan or first-person shooter players looking for a bit of depth and substance in a game.  This aint arcadey casual rambo CoD or Battlefield rubbish folks. This is the real-world modelled experience every FPS player *should* be looking for. And if you haven't been... you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and tell yourself to lay off the drugs.
Love this game ! So many game modes and things to do when you get in to the game. have had alot of fun with friends on this :) Highly reccomend it :)
Who needs more than one video game when  has mods?
 really good game altis life is really good you can role play and make the game the way you want to this game also allows you to make groups and do different things together for example robbing the ved with friends and cops come you and friends can always help in the combat.   There is always something to do on this game that can help you make moneym.  defently worth buying this game and checking out the features.  this game is best playing with friends than alone you can so much more fun.   defently worth trying this out.10
very good game its very good for misim and if you don't like that there are a lot more game modes to try
ith over a thousand hours on this game I can say that Arma III is truly amazing. The first time I started playing this game I knew right then and there that I am going to be getting my money's worth. I was impressed on what was being shown right before my eyes when I launched the boot camp campaign tutorial. It was very immersive from the start and was that way until the end of the campaign. I recently joined a military realism/simulation unit because I wanted to get more experience in the game and learn more about the infantry before I am going to enlist in the Army. Joining this unit got me into modding this game.. alot. I will tell you this now the game is completely different when you add a few mods. I would place this game as a nine out of ten itself but adding mods as simple as subscribing to content from steam to downloading files from a website just breaks the scale unlike many games. This game is capable of being a very basic training simulator in the military. Overall this is my favorite game in my steam library and most definitely recommend you get this game. I just cant wait to see whats in store for this game's future DLC's and feature to the Arma Series. Hoaah Bohemia and HOAAH AMERICA!10
My fav thing to play when I want to cry and die at the same time.
oming up on 1000 hours of play time and I still enjoy it.10
its lit
his game has a steep learning curve but if you can push through this game will provide you with countless hours of fun!   The Sheer volume of high quality community content is staggering!  The Devs are pretty dam good too! after releasing some very good free and paid for updates you could be forgiven into thinking they would move onto new projects but no! Bohemia have announced their roadmap for this game with many more updates and new content in the works!10
There is so much to do in this game.Worth the price tag but better with mods
 pretty much only got this game to play Altis Life which is a server mod for Arma III Multiplayer.  I tried out the single player mode and as an ex-army man myself I found the gameplay to be too over-realistic and died too many times. I'm sure if I had my peripheral vision and my best mates beside me like I did in real life then I'd survive a lot further in single player mode.  Altis Life on the other hand... I was a mad gansta motherf*cker!11
80 hours in and I still haven't figured out the controlls
Altis Life: Walk into a town Get sniped in the head by rebel  Steals my  and calls me a  Respawn in Athira Get arrested for calling a cop a dumbass Get out of jail  Farm money from weed and cocaine Become rebel  Go to city Get shot in face by hacker  Called a   11/10 would recommend
est game i ever played. I love the realism in the game and the different gamemodes. The options to create own mission and modification is great and if you ask me the game lives from these. In my oppinion there is no funnier and better game then this game. There are actually a lot of bugs but after playing some time you will learn to play with them but most of them are the bugs that make arma that special. I personally recommend  for each player which has an interest in a military simulation.  Recommended: 10/1010
y first Experience with Atlas Life Multiplayer-  1. Logged On 2. Cop pulls me over asks if i am a criminal then leaves 3. Second cop pulls me over and in the deepest voice imaginable says: YA KNOOW WERE TO BUY SOME DRUGGGGSS? Then leaves when he sees the other cop coming back. 4. A Cop pulls over a car near me the guy gets out and shoots the cop without taking then drives away 5. I steal the cop car 6. I get arrested 7. 2 mins later i am set free 8. Guy that killed the cop makes me join his gang 9. He buys me guns 10. He reveals he is the owner 11. We raid the police station 12. I die 13. I leave stunned that all this happend it under 10 minutes.  10/10 Would become a Flabbergasted noob again.11
It's a great game with great graphics and is probably the best war simulator but its pretty hard to run
The game is very overpriced but if you're a fan of military simulator you should buy it
 realize the Army's unofficial slogan is hurry up and wait. I didn't think developers would create a game completely embodying that statement.  I have never been so bored trying to play a game before. Keyword trying as once you actually get to the combat area (15-20 minutes after loading up this un-optimized mess) you get shot and have to redo the same process again.  0/10   Would not wait in a Humvee again.-10
k i recommended  this game is awsome ! .. but ! you need veryyy good PC... the FPS is the problem. i have i7 3.6GHz 16GB RAM and GTX 970 OC .. and the game run's on ultra 30FPS... this is kind of sucks .. but if you want to play this game. buy it only if you have a good PC ! if not  dont buy..10
My cars go slow uphill.
I extremly love this game besides the people online that can abuse thier power but never the less I still love this game and definetly reccomend it to anyone else willing to splash out on it.
This is a great game it has beutiful graphics good gameplay. It makes me fell like im actuall in a real war.
Amazing game Love it so much :3
Verry Cool
eah 10/10 ing stupid pay 40 dollars for the game no problem goes to join a server = needs dlcs okay? Tried every server there is all need dlcs look there's an extra 50 bucks all up thanks Arma you t system-10
he Dlc is Often the same price as the game. Base Game does not include missions other than a few tutorials.  Most tanks and weapons and features including sniper rifles are only in the DLC. Life this is an Awful Cash grab of a game that was poorly put together with recycled A.i from Im pretty sure The original Operation flashpoint only dumbed down to save money im sure. Do not get this game unless you like the MOD Community who have saved this game for the creators.-10
he sole purpose of  is the advertisement of overpriced DLC´s - and therefore beside the singleplayer campaign the embodiment of 'pay to win' in PvP. You want a decent weapon? To bad - you don´t have the DLC. Ran out of ammo on the battlefield? To bad your opponent has the DLC - no weapon for you...   The performance of  is sub-par. 30 players on an online-server work fine. Every player added to that will drop your framerate - even on a killer-rig you might end up with 20 fps. The bugs in the game are plenty and sometimes beyond funny. The game has its moments. Yet those are rare.   If you can grab it in Steam-sale... do it. If not... well - I warned you.-10
Unoptimized POS. low frames even with highest end computer. Put an entire clip into an ai and they just turn around and 2 shot me.  The ai can shoot at you perfectly while injured standing up in the distance 700+ meters away. Paid DLC made by devs that 3rd party mods solve anyways and are usually better.   No Thanks.
 Joined  Wasteland for first time and scavanged for 1h. - Got pretty good gear and realized that the town was invaded by enemy AI. - 'LOL BOTS' let's kill them i thought. - Saw an enemy AI running away from me. - Started shooting him in the back with machinegun. - He flicked the wrist and shot me in the head with 1 bullet.  10/10 would be killed that fast again by a bot11
Game is still broken after all these years... The guys are Bohemia Interactive are bunchve ing cokeheads selling a few helo dlc's to get more coke.
Runs like  on everything.
Bohemia engine.... enough said.
fter the great Operation Flashpoint (Now Arma: Cold War Assault) the first two ArmA´s where not THAT great but still very good and I enjoyed playing them for a long time.   is my favourite part of the trilogy thanks to a good and thrilling campaign (much better than CoD or BF) and the ArmA formula that perfectly works now. AI does what you want their aim is very good and they are very helpful. Enemy seeks cover and is a real threat which makes the missions very thrilling. Like in the first three Rainbow Six or the first Ghost Recon.  The campaign feels very tense like Operation Flashpoint or the Addon Resistance and I really enjoyed it.  The game runs perfect on my two year old PC and it is sure beautiful. The sound is also very good and the rifles don´t sound like toyguns which adds to the war atmosphere. Voice acting is great too. The controls are a bit difficult to master at first if you haven´t played the other games of the series but you get there with a little practice.  The new item system is also very good and now you can quick and easy change weapons put attachments on your rifle or grab some other gear.  Overall this game is one of my favourite games of all time and it´s a true masterpiece and thanks to the community you have tons of content for free.   Get it and enjoy it! :-)   10
Outright unoptimised
un game but the poor fps across the board hurts it its more of a game engine problem than optimization. I have a gtx 1060 and i7-6700 (non k) and i get poor fps in multiplayer and generally 60 fps in singleplayer. Fun game but i wish it ran better i would recomend the game if your looking for single player only due to multiplayer running so poorly. I love the idea but dont like the bad performance i feel they could have done better.-11
idn't play much but seemed good.11
ew weapons new equipment'  t AK's and the RPG are ripped straight from a mod.  other weapons are just the same weapons with new spray paint...  Only One weapon is new thats it.  Uniform. only some uniforms are new rest just re-coloured.  One new backpack one Ripped Backpack from a mod. (Bergan Heavy Backpack.)  Basicly it's just reusing old stuff and make them look different.  Now for the big part.  I am a admin for a server I can no longer connect to monitor the server. I have family that play this game thats shares the same IP. We can no longer play together on a server we get kicked out.  Dissapointment BI The only things they did not rip or reused are the Heli and Car's. THATS ALL.-11
You will never know a real game till you play this and learn to play it . 8/10 on game play 9/10 on gfx. love the game check it out.
how could you really describe the best Mil sim on the market?10
cooler than vape
The best army game on Steam so far... It has so much to do in it and it has alot of servers + you can purchase a dlc for it! The only downside to this game that its badly optimised and it uses alot of cpu usage so get your new i7 bois and buy !!! :D
 hardly play Multiplayer in any game dunno why I just don't.... is one of the three games I player multiplayer in. Here's a story that    As part of a PMC team I deployed into a contested area to eliminate an HVT. Our chopper got shot up EXTREMELY bad to the point where one pilot and both gunners were KIA and the remaining pilot was struggling to get it on the ground. We proceeded on foot and got savagely attacked only after twenty minutes of trying to not die did a jet arrive and rake the area with bombs. Once the area was cleared we verified the HVT and stole a luxury car to escape.   Just...insane. The realism of  coupled with the fact that I was fighting alongside guys halfway across the world who were just as invested into the mission as I was made our plight that much more intense.   As a veteran of the ARMA series I can attest to the progress Bohemia has made in . Almost (ALMOST) everything I griped about in previous games were fixed...including some that actually made me stop playing for a while. I was a little  at the lack of units at first but then I remembered the crap-ton of user-made addons avalible in the Workshop and on Armaholic. I now have units from the cold war up to the Vanilla units of the future. I can play any war that I want and I can't think of any other game that can do that.   The island of Altis is HUGE Stratis is pretty big but meh...it's a fruit fly compared to the Budgie of Altis (look up the difference it's a suitable comparison...don't you judge me). There's a lot of space to destroy with a variety of different areas allowing for different combat. You can do anything from marching across a shallow river to an intense firefight in a city.   The variety of fighting is outstanding. Being able to fight as a soldier then go to a tank commander then a gunship pilot and a plane pilot then to a special operator....it's outstanding. I've played in user-made campaigns where you literally cover every aspect of the war. To sum it up it's like starring in a dozen war movies on your own.   If you've got patience and a desire to learn you can take a spin at the mission editor. It has a STEEEEEP learning curve it'll require some serious investment to get good at. I've been playing these games for a while now and I STILL haven't mastered the editor (I'm good but I can't do some of the insane stuff others have). This allows for almost unlimited replayability once you're done with the vanilla campaign and whatever custom ones you downloaded you can simply hop into the editor and make your own!   Now time for the gripes  There's some aspects of the game that are...difficult to cusp mostly in the editor. I feel like the game is actually all that finished yet I won't go into detail about this but there's features that don't seem all quite there yet. I also don't appreciate minor DLC's being thrown out there with only a bit of content. I liked it better when Bohemia released a DLC with an entire new army and several new maps like Operation Arrowhead (which was actually stand-alone) British Armed Forces PMC and Army of the Czech Republic. I haven't sunk any money into them because I'm holding out for ' Pan-Asian War' or ' World War III'...or something of that strain....something with new armies maps and weapons instead of just a few new features. (To specify I'm not saying that the DLC's are bad but I'm not willing to pay for them until something monumental comes out).  All in all this is an outstanding game without peer (say all you want about CoD and Battlefield I love both franchises and have sunk many hours into their various incarnations but they don't hold a candle to the glory of Armed Assault). If you're a serious gamer this is your game. Military fan? This is your game. Modding fan? This is your game. Micro-transactions to restock energy and make moves? SCREW OFF AND GO BACK TO YOUR PHONE. You're not welcome here and we'd prefer if you kept your micro-transaction covered fingers out of our bowl of Steam.   Score for those of you who like numbers and slashes (they get  my  motor running something about it just really gets me riled up) 9/10  PS For those of you who had ARMA 2 there's a lot of ported content on the internet. I personally have the vanilla maps from ARMA 2 and its expansion packs. It's pretty damn cool going back to Takistan and Chernarus with the updated engine!10
Good Game needs powerful computer
Self defence is RDM.
This game is awesome because I kill . KKK +Rep
Good game snipped my life away from reality now i dont go outside 8/10
is amazing! It has so many things for so many different people its not just a milsim game its a role-playing game or a strategy game it is anything you wan't it to be. There is Altis Life or Life mod servers which are just RP and there is Milsim untis which are for the people who enjoy the military side of the game. It isnt just a shooter its whatever you wan't it to be.10
I hold a gun for the first time. 10 out of 10 game.
ne of the buggiest and most unfinished game I've ever played.  Starts game on medium settings 20 fps sets to ultra 50 fps. That's also a very bad framerate for having 2 r9 280x  Firstly none of the sound is working. Sound is working everywhere else except for .  Then I got into a multiplayer game which takes a few restarts btw. I couldn't find a single server so I had to end up just joining my friend through Steam and it worked.  Then I got into a server and after waiting for all textures to load I noticed the bad framerate.  Then we started driving around for a while and even the driving is really bugged. If I start going forward I can't stop going forward and the same for going backwards. Then I decided to go out of it. I got thrown out high up in the air and landed so I died.  Also a small little thing the cursor is still visible. It flies over all monitors but the game doesn't tab out or click anywhere so no big deal just a little bit annoying...  One of the buggiest games I've played in a while. :/-11
reat game worth the money10
this game rocket blow boom and flying or land vajhicle go EXPLODESION! fli helicopaaater and land is gud too. but but no good that muich game. fun with friend but alone is okay.

n this game you have everything role-play open world survival battle royale TDM Co op etc. Makes me come back to it all the time.10
 love the editor in this game the only limitation is your imagination. Plus this game offers a lot of mods that from the workshop or on websites. The game looks amazing and the maps are HUGE! I give this game a 9/10. If you like building your own battlefield and having vurtually unlimited customizationthen this game is for you.10
I really like the graphics and the realism about this game. No negative comments.
Fix your ing server browser.
 have a crappy PC and this game runs like it's nothing wtf?11

Broken multiplayer + horrible singleplayer campaign = Bohemia Interactive.  Thanks guys.
Nothing beats playing multiplayer to see a giant exloding rocket peniz flying around in the air.
ampaign is veru frustrating but multiplayer makes up for it. if you have time and spare money pick this game up. campaign is 5/10 multiplayer is 9/10 10
oorly optimize and Bad DRM  It feels like it’s rushed to the market and still in the alpha phase of developing-11
ardly any other game like it. well worth the money including apex and marksman as you get to shoot more guns in a game with awesome guns. any way you play it to create to engage to mess around with you will have a lot of fun. the engine may be wonky at times but all the other epic moments i had playing this game certainly makes up for that10
es this is the fanciest milsim(actually it's mostly a walking/driving/looking for only-god-and-thermal-scopes-know-where-they-are enemies simulator) you can find out there but -  AI can't get more stupid vanilla weapons can't get uglier dlcs can't get more expensive the new running animation can't get more awful. 'please exit  to manage your mods'. yeah can't even check out what mods i have loaded - i have to either exit the game or use the clunky mod list at main menu. Recently the game starts getting random crashes and black screens. But to be fair it could be caused by mods. Annnd... BI probably found it was a good idea to charge a few extra bucks for some more ugly guns and the bipods which should be implemented years ago. Some mods already had functional bipods/weapon resting way before the official bipod update. Not to mention there are plenty of weapon mods holding a higher quality standard than vanilla and dlc weapons.  So this game only have got worse after all these years? Good job duh.-10
his is a realy nice game well made fun military Honestly i Think this is the best Military roleplaying game .  -The comunity is full of awensome addons  like climbing addon rappel addon ...... and many more  - I do recommend playing with friends for an awensome coop military experience  - Oh yhea and we also have A steam group it Nammed Shadow Company123 (a group that anyone can join and form a team with us  have fun  talk etc ) - The vehicles are are very good and easy to control  - Game Mods: thers a Big variety of mods  - Workshop mission : You can download missions made by comunity and play with friends   Conclusion : this game worths your time .10
m going to be honest here. I bought this for tactical military simulation. (Back when it was new)  It was great so many servers and people that were actually pretty fun to play with. Heck there were so many tactical milsim servers!  but as time moved on Game got ravaged with Life Roleplay servers. And then got invaded by Zombie s.  And the currenty stage?  Well Real Life Roleplay or Zombie/DayZ clone mods.  hard to find tactical servers anymore  The core game itself is dead.  Only 2-7 servers exist if you wish to enjoy true arma experience. Other than that.  Feel free to purchase this Zombie raided title.-11

Year 2060: Intel I7 85326k 64 Cores - 512 GHZ nVidia GTX 3840 ti 128GB DDR12  Battlefield 30 - 150-200 FPS COD 50 - 150-200 FPS GTA 10 - 150-175 FPS  - 20-59 FPS
Bad game for AMD users if you want to have 30fps compared to Intel 40fps+
its okay i suppose but not worth £40
his game is beyond disappointing. It has so many elements to make it the best... whatever the  it wants to be but it's too buggy and unoptimized. There really is no excuse for  to run this bad at this stage of development. Honestly this game is in alpha whether it says 'full release' or not. There is a huge lack of content compared to the previous Arma.  has just about 1/4 of what arma 2 had. The saddest thing overall is the fact that there has been no effort to fix this game in quite sometime. I am fairly certain that Bohemia has the resources but they refuse to even bother with it.  THEY SERIOUSLY USED RESOURCES TO MAKE ING KARTS (a presumably broken waste of money) INSTEAD OF FIXING THEIR  ING GAME.-10
nother day another ArmA game another load of bugs and lags. Don't expect this game to run well if you want a solid 60 FPS it will always find a way to ruin your performance. I'm constanlty monitoring hardware usage and ArmA III lags even while not loading my CPU or GPU above 70% (I'm running the game on a 6 Gb/s SSD). I cannot help but compare this game with Battlefield 4 that runs almost perfectly well. I do realize that BF4 isn't running a whole load of AI and scripts plus its maps and object count are much lower but somehow I feel DICE could do optimization much better than BIS. Seriously what excuse would you have for a game that lags without hardware bottlenecks (so it seems)? I'm definitely not recommending this game as I'm absolutely convinced that steady performance is above fancy visuals. I've tried all kinds of performance tweaks for this game - launch parameters custom memory allocators edits in the .cfg and .ini files unparking the CPU cores changing process priority messing with settings &amp; etc. All they do is give you a tad of extra FPS and nothing more. No tweak will change the fact that ArmA III uses a 32-bit executable and obsolete overcoded engine with no proper multicore support.  On the other note I don't really like the pseudo-futuristic setting of this game. It's indeed pseudo-futuristic as most all present equipment is denied prototypes or current tech that has nothing futuristic about it except being exotic. Mid-2030s? Even while not being a mil expert I understand that realistic portrayal (isn't this what a tactical shooter is about?) of this age is not possible as we have no idea of technology that's going to be used at the time. Scopes with built-in rangefinders and auto adjustment? That's something already created greatly promising and not even present in this bogus - same as triton oxygen mask google glasses smart bullets thermal goggles and even real time active spectral matching camouflage (EDIT: The current version now includes Nightstalker Scope that has a built-in rangefinder). A3 setting ended up on the side of cheap pulp fiction. That's not really a major problem since I'm looking forward to mods like ACE 3 and RHS Escalation that should reintroduce the modern stuff by adding new or converting old assets and it's really good to note that EULA and A3 engine allow this.  The game wields many improvements over ArmA II. The inventory system is marvellous radio comms sound much more like live chat visuals animations and sounds are vastly enhanced but is that really enough when the game often lags like hell because it's purely unoptimised?  A3 is too expensive for its content quality but I may change my mind if devs manage to improve its performance. However it's unlikely they ever will. The way I see it in order for ArmA III not to lag BIS will have to code a new but reverse compatible engine on the basis of DirectX 12 with proper multicore support and a 64-bit executable.    http://img.leprosorium.com/2096814  Pathetic performance: core usage RAM usage GPU usage and video memory usage. The game barely used 50% of availiable computing power horrific 22 FPS are of course the result. The only solution is to lower the viewdistance and object distance to the point where whole world turns into a permanent hazy  like your Silent Hill. Needless to say that flying aerial vehicles becomes a questionable undertaking.-10
WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY 15 DOLLARS FOR 2 CHOPPERS WHEN THE GAME ALREADY COSTS $45?????? SO STUPID
PDATE 07/06/2014  I was a big fan of OFP. I am playing 'this' game since literally 2002. I was hoping that developers will take it to a completely new level not only graphics wise but also improve and sophisticate its Simulation part.  That didn't happen. Instead what we have now as ArmA III is simply an OFP converted to COD/BF/CS:GO. This game is dead and not worth spending a dime on it.   PROS + Improved graphics soldier equipment is detailed + Improved movement features leaning several sitting positions etc. + Bullet ballistics + Big areas available for play as an Islands  CONS - Horrible and non realistic human damage system (aka CS-like) - Fictional and not practically realistic weapons - Helicopter can lift and carry a heavy MBT while it is using its main gun in the air... - Sniper can shoot a person sitting inside armed IFV... - Aircraft/Helicopter simulation is at the PS2 arcade flying sim level... - Tank/Vehicle control is simply W A S D + Mouse click horribly simplified - Vehicle movement on a terrain is a joke totally screwed up physics - Helicopter can lift 5 ton truck drop it from 10m and truck continues to drive normally... - Flying physics for Aircrafts/helicopters is a laughable joke - Shooting enemy Aircraft with AA Vehicle is all about 'button-press-hold-click' - TONS of bugs without attention.  I do not see a value in this game.  Developers should have been fixing the above issues and improving our gaming experience instead those clowns spend time on releasing trash like KARTS in order to suck additional buck from us!   KISS MY A$$ BOHEMIA!-10
 was a fan of the ArmA series. I really played ArmA II totally grey.. But I had high hopes for ArmA III buying the alpha  promising us more stuff will be added later...  Yes that part is true.. ArmA III on itself is totally empty... You have to get Mods and Payable DLC content to make the game interesting... It is like they gave you the engine of the car only.. You have to pay for the wheels  chassis  doors  windows  lights yourself.  It is suppose to be MilSim  in order to have that label  it should give us also.   What made me being so disappointed about ArmA III... It is that the Helicopter DLC costs 12 euro.. Like WTF-10
eh.  i have a couple of issues with the game.  1. you need a fantastic cpu and decent gpu to handle this game. otherwise you will be constantly playing at 20 fps 2. for how much processing they take up the ai is downright stupid. they are still too slow and hardly use enough cover to blend in with players. -to make up for difficulty the ai is incredibly accurate and good at detecting. 3. the vanilla campaigns are set so your teams are at poor odds with the ai. this is supposed to be realistic where real world tactics are used. why is my team running into an enemy town through a valley? 4. the armor system is awful. it takes 5-6 shots to kill with the medium caliber assault rifles. i know they say its because of plate carriers. plates don't necessarily stop bullets they take a lot of energy out of them so you don't die immediately. getting shot is still going to put you out of a fight. anything past .243 or 6.5 is going to start breaking bones; it would be amazing if you could even still move on your own let alone shoot back accurately. 5. the campaign is mediocre with missions that take too long and put too much responsiblity on the player trying to have fun. arma2 also had bad voice actors with bad lines but this is a little better. its stilll not much of an improvement.  6.wonky user interface. this have improved on a lot over time and there are mods to make it more intuitive. it still takes a while to do anything in your inventory though; maybe because in real life it would take time to rummage through your pockets and ruck sack to find anything. it still sucks though 7. no tutorial. yes i know there is a 'boot camp' thing now. that hardly explains how to use anything. it still missed subjects like actual fighting flying helicopters and jets taking cover.  8. mission editor. how do you use it? i don't really know. ive been messing with it for years i still dont think i know much about how it all works. 9. multiplayer. it doesnt happen. at least from what ive seen. just about all the servers are locked clan servers or empty public matches. the server browser is cluttered and confusing with no explanation of what it all means. i mean call of duty was so successful partly because of its join a random lobby feature.  i know i mentioned all the bad stuff. there is much good to this game and im sure other reviewers will point it out. i played this game franchise until i got sick of it. now i play insurgency because its much more fluid and refined with the same idea of critical dammage and little hud.-10
his isn't really a game it's more like a dev tool kit for a military shooter. Soldier movement is dated probably the only negative comment related to graphics/physics. There are a couple missions made by arma...and a couple 'showcases' that show you what their vehicles/weapons/drones can do. The training in this game is below average..and the keyboard mapping is  poor overly complicated and hard to reference. No built in multiplayer like it suggests. Players host their own servers but it's not like BF4 these servers most are locked others if you d/l this workshop item you can't get in or if you didn't download another workshop item you can't get in. If you do get in there's weird rules and no one to tell you what to do.   Conclusion Great platform/developer kit but i paid good money for a 'game' and as such there's a handful of single player missions no fmv cut scenes the 'multiplayer' is not supported through arma only through community no mission types or user friendly options. soldier animations are oddly dated for an advanced military shooter.-11
t first this game was a lot of fun to play. But with the time it rather got worse than good.  - The game does not go above 29 FPS for me (on i7 4770k GTX 770 SSD) - It easily drops under 20 FPS when there is a bit of vehicle movement around the map - The AI is programmed really bad. Not finding paths. Not moving at all when told to.  The game is just as good without AI as it is with them. Maybe some dummy targets for your enemies. Which again are overly OP compared to your AI... - Since the shutdown of GameSpy it is completely unavailable for Coop missions with friends. Hosting Steam servers was not working since the games release  And last but not least the price is way too high for a game said to be 'still under development'  I regret every Cent of the 45 Euros which I payed for this game.-10
I'd rather stab myself with a rusty pair of pliers repeatedly until death than endure this buggy mess.
The game seems to be ambandoned from the developers... Has bugs and i cant find a multiplayer season with serious players to play. Also a hell of the lag
RMA III is one of those games that is really cool in it's own unique way. Unfortunately ARMA can't stay out of it's own way long enough to remain cool. Before I start I should mention that this review is based only on my experiences of single player and the editors with the deal-breaking focus on the editors themselves. That said I'm expecting the dislikes to rain.  This is a difficult one to review. As of writing I've played about 40 hours of almost exclusively single player/editor use. In some ways I really enjoy this game. The biggest draw for me was the editor(s) in this game. The ability to create my own skirmishes anywhere on this giant island and watch them unfold is awesome. You can basically make up any scenario you can imagine and play it out. This alone has kept me entertained for at least 30 hours by itself. I got past the extremely unintuitive user interface and AI quirks and genuinely had a good time hiking around and blowing stuff up.  But if ARMA is anything it's a shining example of why documentation is so important in software development. The documentation for ARMA's editors both 2D and 3D is bad. And when it's not bad it's non-existent. What does the Game Logic object actually do in the editor when it seemingly has no inputs or outputs? Why do some modules need to be synced to each other when others don't? How are you supposed to figure out what to sync to what and when?   Usually there is no answer. Or the answer is outdated or inconsistent between the different editors. Or you'll find other people asking the same questions with the responses basically shrugging. The answers I did find always came down to a 'copy paste this script' or 'follow these exact steps' with no further explanation as to why I was doing these things. That's great for getting something working instantly not so great for learning how to use the systems and building the intuition needed to take things further.   I don't think this is about the complexity of the editor I think this is about bad design decisions and lack of consistent clear documentation. I've worked with Garry's Mod coding for at least a thousand hours and have developed software for many different languages from Python to assembly. The only reason I was able to accomplish these things was from the comprehensive documentation on how things worked and _why_ they worked. And even if they didn't have those things they at least gave a brief snippit on what is required for the function/module to actually work. Something that the ARMA amazingly doesn't have for the vast majority of it's objects. Just looking at the MP editor modules on ARMA's own wiki page only about 3% of the listed modules have documentation. The game TIS-100 is more approachable than the depths of these editors.   So I've had fun with ARMA for the most part. But this well is running dry for me quickly. I wish it wasn't because this feels like the kind of game I would enjoy if ARMA didn't tie its own hands behind its back. For the reasons that I bought this game I wouldn't recommend it. If you play it for multiplayer your experience will probably be completely different. So take this for what it's worth.-10
noptimized has  game modes i can get in garrys mod all game modes require you to suck the admins male sexual organ just to get in and good luck if you can find your friends because this piece of  doesnt even tell you no it's not ing unrealistic to show you where your friends are and it doesnt make the game more realistic it makes it annoying and stupid. Overall im glad i didnt spend 30 or 60 bucks on this astraphy because this game sucks major monkey caca 2/10 id rather play duke nukem forever-10
 had really high hopes for this game when I was told about it. But I can officially warn you that this game is piece of sh*t. The only functional part of the game is the uninstall option. The physics are none existent and the animations are about as smooth as a man in a wheelchair trying to climb a spiral staircase. Not only that but the people who play the game are tight f*cks who couldn't make it in the army so they play .  There is one positive aspect to this game however and that is joining high pop servers and team killing all of unbelievably sweaty players who all seem to be consecutively on their periods. It makes DayZ look amazing. D*ckhead simulator 2015-11
what? how can I write a review? I don't even have this game... -_-
 really can't recommend this game in the state that its in. Bare bones content. Nowhere near the value for money or content that ARMA2:OA alone has. Stupid awkward release schedule and lifeless world and content. I wish I could get a refund.-10
his game is not realistic at all really. recoil is garbage the weapon sway is way to much the damage you do to enemies is way to low it shouldn't take more than 1 shot to the head to kill someone but in this game it does at times when you fire a weapon fire doesn't come out of the barrel like how it does in this game Also 90 percent of everything in this game is fake and the rest are prototypes/in use. the only things that i can think of in this game that are real are the 556 weapons which do barley any damage so you don't every use them anyways... this game would be better if it wasn't called  because it ruined the arma name...-10
UY Battlefield COD or anything else.  I saw this game on sale and watched the awesome videos. you will not be able to do any of the stuff in the videos. I read several of the reviews and saw people giving this game great rewiews with 100's if not 1000's of hours played so i got the game.  First off the single palyer is nice graphics are awesome ect but you will spend alot of time figuring out how to achually look through your scope and other anowing things like changing cramera view ect.  Once you have had enough of that you will try the multiplayer which is why you got the game and this is where your fun ends. You might think you can pick a server and go kill something wrong. First off most servers are locked. most of the ones that are not locked are doing RPG like this is the sims or something. A lot of them do not even give you a gun. Once you figure out to filter you search to team death match you will find 50% of them locked and 45% of them using some mod you dont have. this will leave you with about 5 people to play with. To fix this you might spend 2 or 3 hours trying to find what mod the other servers are using and what required mods the first one needs. Once you get done waitng to download all this you find out the mods you got will get some error trying to login to these servers. Even though you tried both the one off steam and other websites. finally you will have spent several hours and never experence anything like the videos.  P.S. this is the only game that has upset me enough to give a negative review. Its not worth the 50% sale price you might have more fun burning your money.-11
ot a bad game per-se but not worth the price tag either. Not by a long shot. Buy it when it's on sale or something.-10
eally fun game it's worth all your money :D10
I keep trying to play this game but I just can't enjoy it because I get 9-20 fps with a i5 cpu and gtx 970 gpu... The game is horrible because of this... When Arma fixes their fps issues then the game will be the best fps and 3rd person shooter ever to exist. I beg them to fix their game... I as well as many others desperately want to play this with a managable framerate.
s a previous ArmA player i couldn't wait to see the new technologies that were going to be used in . Then i played it. From a personal point of view this game is a complete let down to the ArmA series. Yes it is enjoyable in some aspects but it is nothing compared to ArmA 2 / OA. If you're looking for a more arcade type military game you've found it.-10
m gonna get slammed for this review but you know me:   was recommended to me by a mutual friend at the time so I looked into it as well as insisting to pay $60 'the price of a full game' for a shooter that was released over 2 years ago.   I thought I would be amazed with ... I wasn't.  First strike I was met with poor optimization and horrendous frame rate issues even with the terrible looking standard graphics the maximum frames I could only achieve 27. I can already hear everyone shouting 'You're PC is trash! Git gud Stealth...Poorass.' I will have you know that this is quite the machine I have with an AMD Radeon R7 370 Graphics.  's single player offering is a joke. It's worse than Star Wars Battlefront EA singleplayer. After the first mission I just stopped. But then I tried Arma's multiplayer what the game is praised for. Now I do respect that  is supposed to be one of the most realistic military shooters on the market. But perhaps its a bit... too realistic... You're going to spend more time walking with your squad from point A to point B getting lost and checking your map and compass often alot more than actually fighting in the game.- I've only been in 1 firefight. I would take Battlefield over Arma any day.   I was going to rate  a 5. But gets held back to a 4/10 due to it's poor optimization terrible AI and dull gameplay.  This was my first refund on Steam and I couldn't be happier to get my full $60 back.  That's gonna do it for  and I will see you on the next review. Let's form up! ~Stealth 1548-11
reat game But if you plan on playing multiplayer. Expect to get banned by Battleye. Played this franchise since Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis back in 2001 up to the split between Codemasters and Bohemia Interactive. Onto the ARMA franchise. Never cheated and now it's completely unplayable on multiplayer. Battleye has ruined this game for me. They even ban your steam account. Can't just rebuy the game...-10
I only enjoyed the campaign. It's a great realistic military simulation game but people in the multiplayers are not cooperative. Play it if you want to try campaign and co-op. I Do recommend this game.
 really want to love Arma but I just cant bring myself to. It's the most realistic game ever and it has probably a lifetimes worth of content. Beautiful graphics and the complexity of the gameplay isn't actually all that daunting once you get used to it. But thats not the problem. The problem is the dog-dirt AI. Its seriously the worst AI I have ever seen in a video game EVER. I actually cannot describe how awful it is.   Should you attempt to use AI to help you drive a vehicle God have mercy on your soul. Try and be the gunner? The driver is going to do his best to run into walls and flip the tank in a ditch. See an enemy? Well then he is going to turn the tank around expose the weak rear armor and stop in an open field. Tell him to move? Nope suddenly they forgot how to obey commands and do a weird back and forth jerking roll thing. Try and be the driver? The gunner in a tank with thermal optics will somehow miss a tank sitting 3 feet in front of him. Your infantry teammates will engage the enemy by breaking cover running into the middle of the street and spraying on full auto. Vehicles constantly get stuck on rocks lampposts trees ditches ect. Sometimes they won't spot an enemy in the open while they are being used as target practice and other times they pull of aimbot level first-shot headshots from 500m while standing upright. Helicopters and planes are more effective as kamikaze weapons and single enemies with rifles can easily take out a wing of attack helos.   I really really want to love this game but its virtually impossible to enjoy with AI teammates. I have every AI enhancement mod I can find nothing helps. Every time I come back to it I get so mad. Whether its my M1 driver stopping in an open field and then un-learning how to drive so we can be RPG fodder or my gunner in an apache refusing to engage enemy infantry in the open leading to an early demise the AI in this game is insanely poor. It makes the AI out of battlefield 2 look like rocket science. AI able to take the initiative and get in a technicals .50 without being specifically ordered to approach the vehicle and then you having to get in and switch spots for 10 minutes to finagle them out of a passenger seat into the obviously useful position is a pipe dream in this game. Its super enjoyable to walk around and play in Zeus mode but unless you have great internet you are going to get very very very upset.-11
?????
developers who add DLC into the game which you cant use untill you buy them. Such a foul move to get players to have to buy their dlcs..   Back in my days dlc were for free. :(-10
5/100  Pro's Very good scale and detail in the world allows you to see things miles away.  A large selection of well modeled weapons gear vehicles.  Multiplayer if done right can be epic and quite a bit of fun. These servers are extremely hard to find though.  Cons Very poor AI - I'm talking drop dead liberal half baked hippie 2nd grade education type of stupid.  NO CONTENT - took almost 2 months just to release a few single player missions No Multiplayer Support - no real official missions or servers to help keep the population high.  BUGS BUGS BUGS Performance issues Missing a lot of must have vehicles and aircraft that would really add to the simulation.  I would NOT recommend buying this game until about a year of patches and they complete the game. It is UNFINISHED as of right now.-10
his game crashes constantly. I have yet to play a full multiplayer match because it freezes within 10 minutes of playing every time. I have a high spec computer and play other games on highest settings. When I try to play  on lowest settings it crashes. This game is what we call a complete failure. Save your money for a game that actually works.-10
ome background: I first started playing Bohemia Interactive games in 2001 when I played the demo for Operation Flashpoint from a Computer Gaming World disk. I owned all of the Operation Flashpoint expansions as well as ARMA II and now ARMA III.  This game sucks sh*t. All of them have and all of them have depended on the addons to make the game playable. BI Has never made a decent game only a platform with promise that modders/mission makers polish up.  -I don't know why BI continues to make storylines they've always been awful at them. -AI sucks. I just fired up a mission and was told to plant explosives on some mobile artillery. The Platoon Leader said 'and everyone else take cover'.. apparently a couple AI thought it best to run towards the mobile artillery so I accidently killed them ---leading to a mission failure and them shooting at me.  -Before that two soldiers got killed running off on their own (funny never saw that in the Ranger Handbook) -Most multiplayer servers with a decent ping are either RPG or DM... I should not have to explain why this is stupid.  +Voice acting gets slightly less terrible each game. +Graphics are decent  I don't recommend getting this unless it's like 75% off and you understand what you're getting. -10
his is not a good game.   The engine is a mess. I don't think any computer on earth can run this game at 60FPS with a lot of scripts in the background or if there is a lot going on. Everybody knows this yet it seems to be shrugged off by the community or even laughed at. The game plays awfully as well it's very clunky and unresponsive. You have to play to understand of course. It all has to do with a broken and unoptimized engine. I question how they got away with it.  The multiplayer is awful as nobody plays it for the Arma experience. This game blew up and 'life'servers dominate the multiplayer. You'll either be playing king of the hill 'life'roleplays or zombie servers. You also can't forget the awful performance you'll get in multiplayer as there are usually scripts in the background. Enjoy playing at low FPS.   If you want a military simulator look elsewhere.-10
Trailer explain this is game actually is still under devellopment. They are basically looking for players to play this game to actually test the game and server stability and more. Buy game? Not yet.
waste of 40$  you.spend more time trying to play then actually playing
his game is so hard i can't even get in the car11
nless you plan to play offline prepare to buy this game a few more times.  Thanks Bohemia-11
ood game for patient players.  Giving it a thumb down for unbelievable DLC marketing.  I just payed 35 euro for this game and I am getting popups over the screen while in the action if I do not pay additional 30 euro for Apex DLC? Seriously? How is this not regulated by law? False marketing?  Also the community is horror. I am new to game and tried asking simple questions but received only mocking or nothing at all. E.g.   Q: 'are there a vehicles for travel in this mission?'  A: 'lol'  Seriously in over 30 hours of playing I haven't met a single player willing to help in any way.-11
Played A lot game broke contacted support they didnt help contacted google didnt help broken game waste of 60 dollars. *EDIT* The three hours in the last two weeks is literally me sitting on the launcher trying to fix the game.
That awkward moment when you get a more realalistic combat experence playing with little green army men on the living room floor than you do playing the 'most realalistic combat simulator ever'.
A very very good game. I love it! Its the best Simulator for military combat.
WHERE ARE THE JETS. I BOUGHT THIS SOLEY FOR THE JETS
irst off i have to say i HATE Multiplayer games. they are not fun for me in the slightest. just a bunch of idiots modding to win. so i never tried the multiplayer.  I got this for the Singleplayer and i have to say it sucks. its far too scripted. i cant do any thing my way i have to stand here.. stand there... listen to some idoit talk and curse for half a hour when he could just say it over the radio whilst i walk or drive so i am not so bored with the crappy dialogue but no... It's BORRING.  Even when i actually got to shoot half a hour later... the gun physics are so lame i laughed and shortley after quit and uninstalled it. If you shoot a rifle at 50 metres square at a target the size of a torso the bullet will hit it but in this so called SIM it won't most of the time. Guns just are not that unaccrate. shotguns have spread not rifles. a rifle at 50 metres will be 1 cm each way tops not 50 cm. that alone is enough for me to quit and uninstall it and NEVER play it again.-10
he engine looks nice but based on the older operation flashpoint engine still. Entering houses feels 'iffy' and like walking around on honey - god forbid going prone in one... it's like the house knows judo.-10
his isn't a bad game but it's not worth the price and it's mostly a template for mods and set in the future. If you want a true military experience i would strongly reccomend arma 2 co its worth the price not this template.-10
orst FPS ever if you have AMD. 15-22fps in most of the online modes. (AMD FX 6300 8GB RAM Radeon R9 270 etc.)-10
his game is probably the least fun game I've played in a long time. It tries to sell itself as a military sim but it's as much a military sim as minecraft. Wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. Also 60 dollar price tag? Games like Red Orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. You're money is better spent elsewhere.-10
ould be good but riddled with bugs and people that are elitist . I spent hours watching videos and reading web pages and as soon as I came across a problem that I could not find a solution for online all you get in any chat channel is a bunch of jerks that accuse you of not looking  up. WHAT A MASSIVE WASTE OF MY MONEY!! The technology is there the game is ok looking but all the time textures pop in and out and there is a lot of glitches and problems. I run this on a great machine that has never had a problem running anything but this game even after 3 years has a ton of visual issues. PASS!-10
Worst game ever i seen. You are just running. The game is about running. Don't buy !
orst controls in a game ever... Really want to like this game but it's hard to enjoy without spending hours learning their painfully unintuitive controls-10
his game looked promising in alpha but has been patched to a worse and worse state ever since. Don't let any of the pretty screenshots or clips fool you. It's practically still an alpha game and will probably never leave this state. If you're the type of person who finds fun in playing scenarios against extremely stupid bots this might serve. For anyone else don't waste your money. The netcode is absolutely horrible - the game is full of lagging rubberbanding and anything else you might expect from a game that hasn't been finished at all. No matter how fast of a hellmachine you have below your desk the game will almost always run at max. ~35fps in multiplayer a lot less if in action. So aiming and hitting someone is rather a game of luck than anything else. Further the gun and aiming mechanics are absolutely cumbersome and just annoy the crap out of you in combination with the weak engine. Right now you just aim at someone fire and very often absolutely nothing happens. No hit no blood nothing even after firing a whole magazine at the enemy while keeping the crosshairs exactly at him from a distance of say 50-100m. Does actually happen. In multiplayer the enemy you try to eliminate then starts running around like a rabbit (because they know exactly how it looks on your screen - it makes it even harder to hit him because he starts teleporting from one point to another) and tries to spot you while doing so. Yes that's right. In a 'military simulation' it has proven to be more effective to run around like a crazy ape right in the open field than to look for cover and continue from there. The structures look mostly the same and are full of bugs aswell. You can't go through a door without getting stuck in some way in like 50% of cases you get stuck right at the bottom of stairs and have to take a step back and try again (no need to mention how much it's going to trigger you if you get killed because of this stupid sh..). So stairs and doors are to be considered extremely risky to use - just like in real life right? Right it's a simulation it has to be realistic!  In spite of everything the developer of this game absolutely avoids improving the engine or the netcode since release in any way they rather design some new weapons they can wrap into a dlc and sell for 10 bucks. Since alpha the game has used cpu power in an absolutely unoptimized manner has therefore extremely poor performance on even newer machines and just makes it impossible to have a nearly fluid aiming experience. There is always some lag or stutter that often will decide about the outcome of a confrontation.  Like I said in the beginning there was a lot of hope and potential for this game when alpha released but this is now more than 3 years ago and not many of the relevant aspects and weaknesses of this game were actually improved. It might actually have gotten worse since then. I bought it for like 20€ back then and even for this price I would definitely not buy it again. Do not buy this crippled piece of software.-11
Terrible 2/10 such lag the lack of everything in this game gives it the 2/10 save you're 60$
f you came here because saw some youtube of great playz and got hyped on this game go and watch some longplay footage without editing or watch live-stream. Then you may change your mind. Because regular gameplay is way different from carefully edited best-ofs. This game has these nice moments separated by long periods of struggling with interface and trying not to die from glitches.  Is is not kind of game you can grab on sale and have fun with. You can't start playing this game without having someone to introduce you to it because singleplayer is really limited and multiplayer is quite inaccessible to uninitiated newbie. So if you wonder if you could just take it and play for some hours having fun then forget about it - you wont. And if some of your friends told you to play with them then sure by all means take it - even fighting with sticks with friends is fun so Arma3 can be too ;).  You can read negative reviews about game optimization. These are reviews from somebody who probably never played actual Arma3 - game runs great looks great works smooth with hi-rez and hi-fps. But then who buys Arma to play Arma? Not many. Obviously. People install Arma to play mods. But mods that are lifeblood of gaming and salvation of the industry [sarcasm!] are usually made by wannabe-pros-script-kids who plant hack over hack in mod in attempt to implement anything. Constant loops designed to eat cpu cycles photo-quality textures for sexy female models shiny new guns with more polygons than whole aircraft. Then couple of these are bunched together on one server with possible conflicts and no concern about limitations of average user's hardware. People cry that their powerful pcs can't handle it but it is terrible quality mods that kill it and slow your game to crawl. Game is optimized but mods are not curated so every piece of random hacks are allowed and people who run mods expect the game engine to somehow detect bad code and optimize it. Want high fps? Dont install poor mods. Refuse to play unoptimized mods and encourage others to stop playing them - maybe this way you will tell mod-devs to start thinking about their work [hint: they will just stop making mods].  The problem is that beside vehicle and bullet mechanics things go wrong in this production. Physics is bad - you will make backflips with your APC or die from touching dynamic object. Infantry controls are terrible - probably infantry unit is not required in simulator for army so what you receive here is human character that is controled like a tank. Nobody cared to plan and hone useful user interface to provide smooth control system for player character. You get avatar to control and whole keyboard of buttons to make him move. You can customize it to your will you can use all external devices you like - but it is up to you to make it work. And even when you make it work as you want you will still have game with unfinished mechanic for infantry:  - your gear doesn't limit your movement so you can carry kgs of equimpent and you will crawl crouch and stand up at the same speed.  - you cannot even cancel action - you started doing something you are sitting duck.  - missing animations and movement options you would expect from combat-sim. If you can think about doing something you can't do it. Numerous games accustomed us to make quick combat movements sliding under/over obstacles hiding behind cover or jumping over walls entering through the windows and so on so it is painful to be unable to do it here. You cannot even pull out weapon while walking or switch to binoculars while lying down.  - carrying heavier weapon in your hands feels like holding a handgun - you can run around with it feeling no inertia or being slowed down. Some arcade games feel more realistic than Arma.  Game wasn't built around infantry it is not FPS by heart this is vehicular combat sim with driver/pilot and gun operator. Infantry units are implemented as VR training for rookies - learning the bullet behavior for long distance shooting practicing mildot ranging operating launchers working with map and team communication.  You won't have smooth close-mid range combat with guns.  This part of the engine was hacked into the existing system and barely works.  Unfortunately.-10

O NOT BUY IF YOU PLAY ON YOUR OWN!!!  This is a fantstic game. Lots of things to try but it must be done with friends who can revive you. Otherwise you will fall victim to little boys with snipers overlooking helicopter shops gun shops etc taking either you out or the helicoper engine immediately as it spawns.  To summarise: Game = Great. Player Base = People who were bullied at school and / or got socks for christmas-11
lthough many fans of the ARMA series have been critical of certain aspects of this game(such as the choice to make it based in the future) I would still highly recommend this game to any fan of FPS RPG or Strategy game types. The base game is basically FPS but the modding community has expanded it's basic description to meet other gamers needs(Including my own). This game has a strong/loyal fan base and has for years. If you don't try this game at some point you honestly haven't lived!10
iterally the best military simulator on the market. Not the Vanilla content perhaps but it serves as the greatest platform for the mods that people create. Immersion factor is basically 11/10 stop reading this and buy the damned game.10
THIS GAME IS A ING PIECE OF A BUGGED !! NEVER BUY IT!! TOTALY FAKE-SCREENSHOTS BUGGED  JUNK...JUNK...JUNK....---- NEVER BUY IT!! NEVER.... U CANT PLAY THIS PIECE OF  CRAP...WORSE THAN EVERY GAMEE GO AND REPAIR THIS !!!  YOU BOHEMIAN-INTERASSDICKS ''DEINSTALLING'' !!
 fun arma game with better graphics but it dosent have as many vehicles at the moment as arma 210
If you read this buy me this game it taughts me about writing a review but i can't play if you buy me this i will give a blow job.
its not what i thought
Can't play with my brother if play in same network. Kuyyyyyyyy!!!.
ame is cancer devs are cancer  Heres why it sucks: DLC  Nothing but money dev's putting adware DLC ingame that breaks multiplayers for all those people who paid 30-60 ing dollars for ads ingame what a ing disgrace meanwhile the game is buggy and unoptimized as ing hell. I did not drop 60 dollars for this crap.  Nothing like being in multiplayer and finding a weapons and getting ' you buy apex'.-10
Rubbish game With great good graphics and an exciable ending to the story where meaty m8 blaze tryes to take over europe to save his family and enilate all minoritys. all in all i rate this 8/8 m8
They like to choke people down with there dlc and It's just become to much.
Game is pretty cool and detailed ... but its aparently going down the pay for any extra content road Im a cheapskate ... paying for extra model just make me sick ....  if they would come out with actual add-on Ie wait a year or two finish singling out every issue  with your engine then come out with a dlc adding a bit of everythng + some mission i m on thats fine by me i'd buy  But here the game does not feel finished to me maybe they need to come out with more DLC's .... Just my opinion
ear Arma   It's not you... It's me.  A popular positive review by [Fog]Snow elequiently said 'Kids play Call Of Duty Boys play Battlefield Men play Arma.'   I am a man all day doing manly things at my manly job and when I come home I just want to be a boy.   I have no problem getting killed with a single bullet dealing with bullet drop limited amo or stamina effects on aiming. I love all of those things and those are the reasons I started this relationship. But you're high maintinance I can't give you the time you require and I don't have a big enough friend group for you to like me.  Yesterday:  4hrs - Play singleplayer to learn controls loving the game so far.  0.5hrs - Jump into 'Quick Play' try to go into normal FPS game modes like catpure the flag. All but two game modes either told me it couldn't find a server or that I didn't have the DLC. Seems odd to me.  0.5hrs - Playing 'Caputre the Island' spawned in the middle of the ocean. WTF!!? Some guy on mic says you need to install something which will make a carrier ship appear so if you don't have that you just fall into the ocean and can't get to the helicopters. Hmm okay.  1hrs - Same game spawning at the points that are on land. Me and about 15 people are all waiting on a heli to pick us up. Sigh... Bored... Oh look a heli yay!  0.05hrs - Heli gets shot down in route to town I bail the heli like a Jason Bourne bad @ss and go to deploy my parachute to fly in like a tiger ninja raining down bullet hell that could make a grown man cry... but I don't have a parachute. Splat!   0.5hrs - Profanity inanimate objects accelerating accross the room at forces greater than or equal to gravity anger at game dissapointment in purchase hope of reimbursement worry about game time spent in single player sadness at time lost look at clock and it is past bed time tired work tomorrow.  I am a software engineer by day and spend a lot of time figuring out computer related things. Like a TV show watcher I too like to unwind at the end of the day but for me I get that in gaming.   No I'm not 60 I am in my 20's.  WORKING FOR FUN IS NOT FUN WHEN YOU JUST GOT DONE WORKING FOR 8 HOURS.  In conclusion Arma I'm sure there is someone perfect out there for you...but it's not me. I really wanted us to work out I truly did but it wasn't meant to be. I hope we can still be friends....  ps. yes I tried other game modes as you can see from my play time but I didn't have much success. One game I got in and 2 mins later got kicked I wasn't using a mic I was playing the objective so not sure what I did.  yes I know this is a strategic sim not a fly out of a heli 007 game I was really mad that I had to A) spawn and wait close to an hour for another heli or B) quit download software for the carrier and join back in  In that timespan I could have played 2 BF4 games and had loads of fun. I wish Battlefied was more tacticle but I'll take it over Arma because I have more fun overall.-11
roken from the start. Horrible gunplay often crashes laggy  multiplayer. The action menu alone is reason enough to not reccomend this game-10
quite meh to be brutally honest
game. They flood the loot tables with DLC weapons attachments ammo varients and clothing and expect you to purchase the DLC on the spot. Hell no. Not recommended unless you love having watermarks on your screen and a constant prompt to waste your money on DLC that in total adds up to the same cost of a triple A title.-10
It's trash but it's really good.
-Spends 40 bucks on  -Looks at server list -All servers require 100 dollar DLC -Finally finds DLC free server -Game does not launch -Refunded  For s Sake
This game is ing stupid.
 game don't buy lol
Constantly forcing DLC down my throat and its horribly optimized
Bad game unless you like getting 20 fps on any setting you put on horrible engine poorly optimized pls fix your garbage game.
 the worst game of the series.
MM..... I bought  Extended Edition about $34.99. First time I thought this game is ****ing bull . However i played multi player it has a lot of game mode and maps more than GTA 5. I think  is the best military game.  Children play Call Of Duty Teenagers play Battlefield Man play CS : GO Gentleman play ARMA.11
It has very poor optimization and since the release of Apex a big chunk of the community has been placed behind a paywall. Despite this the campaign is very enjoyable and does a great job immersing you in the game. The multiplayer can be fun depending on the servers you join and having the Steam workshop available allows you to join any server with mods easily as long it is on the workshop.
is quite easily the worst FPS in the past 5 years. It has a horrific community full of squeaky kids and MLG sounds over teamspeak. It's extremely difficult to have fun with often the main areas (or places of interest - certain villages) are camped by snipers. To get into any kind of combat is a task in itself and is disappointingly unrewarding and the available maps are always  far too big for the amount of players in each battle .  On top of all this the game is poorly optimised and needs a decent computer to run at a playable level on the lowest settings. It'ss unusual for me to write such a negative review but I feel I have to warn people that it's a hit or a miss. If you have a decent computer and like military simulation games then this may be perfect for you. In which case enjoy! But unfortunately most of us do not meet these qualities and will be disappointed with Arma.-11
nable to play on MP servers can't launch campaign battleye doesn't allow game to load in trys to launch game then log says 'Steam online Game ready' but never launches. I'm not to tech savy but I have read through evrything related to this event and no fixes. I enjoyed the startup screen lol.-11
Tried playing on win7 x64/Intel celeron 1037U/4GB ram/HD graphics - 20-30 fps@800x600(everything low/turned off) and pemanent problems with the game UI and mouse - it starts working only after I switch the ui scale. Multiplayer crashes (tried playing some RPG mode)
is this game fail or what?
e were a group of 3 soldiers stranded in a city in the middle of nowhere with only sidearms to protect ourselves. 9mm's in our hands which compared to the firepower of our enemy it would make them have good laughs.  Our top priority was scavanging for supplies and guns.  We found an old SUV parked in the middle of a town hall with apparent damaged transmission and busted wheel. I procede to repair the SUV while our squad's sniper and combat medic scout for any enemy infantry or vehicles. I was a professional engineer with 10 years of duty repairing stuff no one cares about until they are broken. After the repairing took place with no problems we look to the trunk of the SUV.  Boy it was like looking at the Lord. Two assault rifles accompanied by their respective ammo. Now we were loaded and looking at our next mission.  We saw a convoy 2 clicks away from our position. We took this as a chance to gear up and scavenge food and water while fighting the enemy at the same time. While en route to our ambush location we found a military truck with a big anti-tank weapon sitting of top of it. It was the perfect setting except the engine didn't work. We had to toe it to our SUV. Even with all my experience I couldn't put the engine up and running but the gun worked.  We set up at the ambush point waiting for the enemy.  But while waiting we saw a big white vehicle in the mountain north coming toward us which was being towed. 'Is that a god damn boat sailing on land on the back on a truck!?' - said our sniper. It had miniguns attached to it and the instance we saw them we proceded to open fire with our anti-tank weapon.  It was a tough fight.  They shot back as soon as they heard our shots and fought the best way they could. But our weaponry was too strong for them. The truck catched fire and exploded after a couple rounds into it killing all the enemies in the vicinity. It looked like a scene from a Michael Bay film.  After that we ambushed the convoy stole a couple of anti-tank RPG's and sold them into the black market to buy a tank.  10/10 It was good.11
he Game was absolutely beautiful to look at Graphics were on target 100% but if your a first time Arma player the user friendly version is not there. Leaves you completely disoreinted almost immediately. Camera views while inside the vehicle leave you going for the number pad's 0 key a lot. Once outside the vehicle your camera's axis is only in the up down view there is no 360 view here boys/ girls. It does however have the genuine military simulation feel. For the amount of times it use the F-Bomb you'd think you were on a military boat. Hence the term make a sailor blush. All in all I'd give it a 6 out 10.-10
an't just Can't  What can i say. Is it realistic?-yes! But with the laggy connections question graphics and did i mention the laggy connection??? gun fights at close range arent about anything other than whos got the better connection to the server.  Ive shot a guy 3 times at close range with a sniper rifle (point blank in chest). He killed me I asked him how he was still standing his responce? You shot me? ......   This is what you deal with you can shoot people but do to horrible server connections the game simply becomes who can get a bigger gun.... Not what i paid for.-11
 shit i just paid 60$ for this game and now its on sale. t. steam plz refund
worst game ive ever played how about you fix simple mechanics like walking and jumping before releasing this public MORONS........
dont buy this game its a great game besides the part of you cant use pretty much any weapon because of the 10$ expansions and the 30$ for a ing map and a few weapon... its a waste of money and time... theres no way to torrent the expansions (get them for free) only buy this game if your willing to spend another 60$ on some weapons cars heli's and other . and a ing map.. amra 2 was 1000x Better and less limited
f you like singleplayer this is the game for you. If you like playing multiplayer at 30fps with a high end pc. This is the game for you. Worst optimizated engine ever. Try sniping a guy at 1000 meters at 30 fps and with desync thats MP . Good game but just doesnt use the hardware correctly. My i7 4770k is only running at 20%. The community is not very nice. I wouldnt waste my time. There are alot better games out there.-10
i wish it was still free ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;'''''''''''''''''((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
Pros -lots of fun  -two well made maps  -good mod suport -good online play   Cons  - in the two big maps and the manny verations of it i serched and serched and could not find a TURBO MAN doll   final  although it was fun there was no turbo man dolls and for that im out
game is dog  needs optimization. 2/10
t sucks it has the worst campain it crashes all the time the phyics suck it has the worst A.I. and also if your playing on sever that does saves your progress then when you crash which happens all the damn time you have to ing start over-10
oo advanced and teamates will ditch you constantly. Also many framerate issues.-10
very bad optimization. i cant even play
orrible trying to get a refund... waste of money-10
do u want to get blown up by screaming arabics? no? DONT DOWNLOAD. do u want to get run over by some  wipe? no DONT DOWNLOAD.  is not a fun game. DONT DOWNLOAD
aste of money. Nobody in their right mind should purchase this game. When looking at the recommended settings to run the game disregard them. It is all lies and cannot run. Poor game choice for those who may find it fun. Rating: .5-10-10
I love arma 2 but  is one of the worst games i have ever played. one of the reason i like arma 2 is the warfare game mode but there isint a good warfare mode in .
Awsome Game! Worth buying! :D
y friend blew up a friendly helicopter after we told him it was friendly. He said he panicked There was one survivor* 10/10  Would play again I love this game XD  Seriously fun game though.  *out of 711
Just get Arma 2 Combined Operations.
This game has more bugs than a bug nest.
not recommended just buy a BF3 or BF4 you will enjoy for long long looong time.

t would be a good game if you knew how to work all of the installation of mods and  sync and ws launcher... But if you dont dont buy the game itll be a waste.-10
oring simulator 2014. Love feeling bored? Is your life not complete without pointless derision? Then  is the game for you! You can take long walks with friends and talk about everything from the weather the first time you got laid or how you miss mom's home cooking. If you join a full server and stay in it for 3 hours at a time...you do run the risk of eventually encountering enemy combatants. This occurence is rare but known to happen. Not to worry. You will die instantly and get to start the process all over again. So make sure that you read up on politics sports and current events so that you don't bore your online friends while on your long walks together.  And for those having trouble figuring out the controls...LShift + Tab + R + T will tie your right bootlace should it happen to come untied during one of your walks. Substitute R for L if its the left boot that comes untied first.  On a side note this game has a great online community. If you are new and need help...just ask. You will promptly be addressed and told to 'Go **** yourself.'-11
 played 600hrs of this playing: Altis life Dayz knock offs king of the hill  missions from the workshop that each require their own ing mods  10/10 wish i could refund this cancer  Large lack of content in comparison to their other games which they have tried to cover up with their grand 'Mod Support' and their  excuse for dlcs. I bought tanoa its basically is just another mod with dev support. The game has basically no Listening server support so be prepared to get hamachi to play with your friends. there are almost no missions that you can jump straight in and play plus they removed CTI (was in Arma 2 and was revamped in a large STANDALONE DLC; Arrowhead) which was probably the best way to showcase everything about the game. Games basically a kickstarter gone wrong.-10
f the engine wasn't so garbage that it vomited fatal errors every 8 seconds I'd reccomend it. The game itself is great but until something gets done about how poorly made the engine is don't get . It doesn't like to run on even the highest end systems. Whenever an update is pooped out onto the playerbase it kills dozens of modded servers with no fix. Do not buy this game at full price ever.-11
Core game is . Mods are great.
After putting around 60 hours into this game i can not recommend it in its current form. The multiplayer performace is horrible at best. (~17fps at 8320 and a gtx970). The game still crashes randomly which resultet in complete profile losses. (So if you game crashes and you play a multiplayer mod with progression like altis or koth everything will be gone)   Overall i would say do not buy into this game unless you are willing to deal with an incredile amoutn of bugs/glitches and a performance which is on the same level as the slaughtering grounds.   DO NOT BUY IT
ver since i played operation flashpoint and fell in love with the RTS  you could build a base and then send tanks to kill your opponents base or fly a jet or helicopter to do it personally the weapons were realistic damage wise which I never see the idea was amazing but it was buggy I couldnt wait for the sequel that would straighten them out op flash 2 was a dud. then I heard of the first arma and again my hopes were lifted. But again I was disappointed. then I bought arma 2 and again was disapointed mainly by empty servers for both 1 and 2. now I see good reviews on  and I cant imagine who is giving them since arma 1 and 2 had hardly a soul actually playing I refuse to be disappointed again.  Also the AA was so overpowered that there was no way you could destroy a base with a jet or helicopter youd be instantly shot down super bummer.-10
ike am relly a sowjer gunz an tankz anss then big asplowshunz10
AMD buyers beware. This game is horribly optimized for AMD CPU's. I've got an FX 8350 paired with a GTX 980 and I can barely run the game at 30 fps at high 1440p and no filters and for mulitplayer forget it you'll get FPS at single digits on low to standard settings. In fact its so badly opitmized for AMD cpu's I ended up uninstalling the game. Hopefully the devs patch in better opitmization for AMD CPU and make use of more cores then maybe I'll reinstall it.
reat game i totally recommend you.  If you are going to rate it negative because you have low fps kys.10
t's not very friendly to beginners. The steep learning curve takes away a lot of the fun. Especially because it's a multi player focused game and there are very few game types active at any given time and the ones that are active require paid DLC. So I paid 40 bucks and it's not very fun to play if you can even get into a game.-10
is suddenly marked as a complete game and they come out with a big DLC a week later? Better idea how about you suck my  Bohemia?-10
trash game u need to shoot some one about 4-6 times with 7.62 in the head to kill someone trash dont buy
constantly crashes and lags but that may be the type of laptop I have got I do not reccomend this game!
elt like it could have been a very good simulator but it turned out to be poor. Played through the first part of the campaign and it was laggy in parts (which I have researched is down to poor optimization of the game) and I managed to get the vehicle stuck in a barrier and had to reload from an autosave. Clearly not well made.  I also found the way markers really hard to see. Either don't bother with them or make them more vivid. I also found it hard to see the enemy but that's just something I would need to get used to.  To top it all off the landscape is so boring. Nothing but open areas and very little variation or cover.  Overall great potential and if you like spending hours learning to play a more difficult game than CoD/Battlefield then I've read that Arma 2 is a much better choice. With that being the case I cannot recommend this game to anyone.-10
When it can hold 60 fps like dayz can now ill make a positive review.  PC - intel i7 16 gb ram and a gtx 980 20-40 fps in not acceptable...
Lost of bugs. Crashes a lot and if you cant get it going soon (its a bit complicated and will take you a minute to figure it out) you end up playing 'past your refund time played'. I spent hours trying to research maps i can actually play. Thanks steam.
ame can't use more 1 core realy 1 core it's very important aspect. 42 fps in kavala by ultra settings on my i7 4770k 4.6 ghz gpu gtx titan use 70%... But now recolor kill the game! i can't to play  more my glass me important-10
he game is poorly optimized. I get around 45 fps on my potato pc in campaign but only 5 fps online for some reason. Moreover you can barely play this game online without buying all the DLCs. Not only do you have to buy a 55 dollar game but have to buy all the DLCs totalling to 77 bucks. That's 130 bucks for this  game where you get destroyed by 9 year olds who've all had sex with your mum. The community is fine actually but some servers are cancerous and I forgot to mention that the game is a bit buggy as well. I'm not made of money nor my parents are rich af so I didn't get all the DLCs and got this game on sale. Even with sale everything would've cost me about 90 bucks which is just way too expensive for this  game. This maybe a great game with strategic gameplay but not worth everything you're throwing into it. Also when I see games like these who divide all their necessary game componets into DLCs and charge you 45 bucks for one of them I feel ashamed to be a gamer.  is no different than those pay to win games you get on your phone and .-11
 tried playing it sometime ago not long though. Couldn't get a proper grasp on keyboard controls and found it to be difficult soley on that. Haven't put much effort into it since.-10
ts a simulator alright..... just not a war simulator. Its more of a walking around/ driving around simulator with occasional shooting. I am going to attack this game.... it won't be pretty.... so if you are faint of heart or have fan boyingitis you might want to not read. Ugh.... but where the  do I start? From the moment you start playing this game it will hit you with 1000s of extremely bizarre design decisions that defy all logic and reason. Like for instance there is THREE buttons for standing crouching and going prone( I may be thinking of dayz so forgive me if I am wrong because they both just kinda melded into a big  pile in my mind). I mean most games manage to only have one button for this WHY THE  WAS THAT SO HARD TO FIGURE OUT THAT THEY ENDED UP WITH THREE ING BUTTONS?!?!?! Just the excessive amount of buttons on your keyboard this game uses is unbearable and requires frequent control checks to even do basic things like ING CROUCHING. Then the game has a third person 'option' but anyone who is anyone knows that if there is an option for third person in a fps that you use it. It lets you ing see around corners so congratz on giving us that option..... Then there for some reason is TWO versions of zooming in one makes your person scope in PURELY WITH HIS OWN EYES LIKE HE IS SOME KIND OF SUPER HERO and the other uses your weapons scope. Then we got the insane fall damage. Do you remember playing on the jungle gym at school and jumping off that  like a boss without even a scratch? Well in arma if you jump from that height as a grown  army man you die. Yeah idk wtf............Its shameful..... truelly and I am only scratching the surface trust me its alot worse then I can put into print.  Alright so lets talk about game modes Its probably got more then I can imagine but lets talk about the three I experienced. First team death match sounds good right? WRONG! Actually it may have been king of the hill but  if I care it still sucked. Well your objective was to go into an area and control it which is perfectly fine untill you take into acount that you spawn LITERALLY 2 MILES away from the area EVERY ING TIME YOU DIE. This isn't like the bf version of spawning far away in there you always have a way to get to the battle faster like spawning on your team here you always spawn in the same stupid field with a couple transports. *Sigh* Ok so you get in the vehicle and start on your way to the hill....... thing... where the team death match happens and everything is going ok(slow and boring but ok). THEN SUDDENLY AN ATOMIC ING BOMB SHOOTS OUT FROM HELL WHEN YOUR ALMOST THERE AND INCINERATES YOUR WHOLE CREW! Then you respawn back in the field(more like purgatory) and wait for the transport to respawn so you can begin the EPIC ride back to the...place?   WAIT A MINUTES IS THAT A ING CHOPPER? OMG IT IS! You quickly run over to it and get in! AW YEAH THIS GAME IS GOING TO FINALLY GET FUN! NOPE! You couldn't have known but the chopper controls in this game UIBUASDHGIUADBGD!!!!!111! Sorry they are bad.....they touched me in my no no place and they were coded into the game by cthulu him self for ONLY HE FROM THE DEPTHS could possibly comprehend this madness! Even 'good pilots'(their words not mine) only manage to make it 10 ft before critcal engine failure occurs. Then the real PRO MLG ARMA pilots that actually can fly them by some miracle don't even try to land the damn things. They tell you to just jump out and parachute because they know damn well it will explode if they even barely tap the ground. The first time I ever even got to the holy hill was from parachuting and it worked suprisingly well so I guess they managed to do something good. I died almost immediately from someone camping in a window but I at least gazed for a brief moment on the promised land.  Then we got this strange free roam game type with factions. I don't have any clue what it was called because I imagine my brain deeply repressed it into my subconcious to be forgotten. It was the best by far of the arma game types I played which puts it at about free flash game levels of quality but at least it was tolerable. Kinda I guess..... Well anyways you spawn on an island and you fight with your other faction members for control of the map. Its got stores and stuff to buy vehicles and guns but mostly you will be getting SNOIPED by people hiding in houses like rabid neck beards. I can't imagine these people having any fun sitting In houses hills or trees all ing day for that ONE KILL but for some reason in every game that uses this  arma engine(such as dayz) these people are all over the place. WTF is it about these games that draw in these campers? Is it because they get kicked out of or mocked for being noobs in every other decent fps? Yeah probably.... Lets go with that.  Then the final game type I played if you can even call it that. RP or atlas life or something who cares. Yeah I tried out a roleplay server because I figured it would be maybe like gmod dark rp where fun is always the most important part. ROFL you bet it wasn't fun! You start out as just a civilian but you can mine and make money! It is literally even more boring and more work then real mining so I promptly gave up on rp. At that point I would just get a real job mining because at least then I would make real money for my hard work. Yeah I wouldn't suggest you ever play this game even if your real life is more boring then working. I would personally reccommend you stare at a concrete wall and try to see shapes before I would tell anyone to play this game.-11
Terrible game Purchased the game on my new comp loggen in said i was Global Ban or something tried contacting steam and bhio''
 have only played this on the Sp campaign so far so my thoughta are based on this as a solo experience. This is a flipping JANKY (holy mother it is sooo janky) game first of all. i have seen more bugs than a red roof inn it seriously kindof playes like an early access release. The AI is soooo bad. which wouldnt be that big of a deal except you have to constantly micro manage a group of  through an active war zone of aim botted one shot kills. This is made somewhat better through mods but not really. i can say for certain that the SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN is NOT a military sim in any sense. It is a bad COD level story supplemented by an amazingly obtuse control scheme that makes this feel more like a typing simulater than any kind of military game.(Honestly i know people are going to crucify me for this but MGSV in all its rediculous story glory is about 1000x a more competant 'sim' than this) It is probably better in Multiplayer when you dont have to deal with the shokingly bad AI but it basically puts you through a bunch of bad story beats on par with the worst military action game but with flight sim controls. I am very VERY suprised at my reaction to this game so far. im hoping the excellent MOD community and hopefully good multiplayer community will change my opinion moving foreword. i want a good milsim that encourages smart tactics and careful controlled action. I hope i find that game in here soon.-10
/10  Single player is fine. Mods can make SP a fun experience. But once you try MP that's a solid no unless you play wasteland or on a private server. The FPS on any server running a custom game mode is terrible. It is higly unlikely you will get above 30 FPS on a public server. I can't speak for private servers but if you want to play MP play wasteland or find a group that has their own not-bad private server.  Only recommended because of SP10
I love this game and i wish to have.
oor Optimization...for the graphics card...  I have a i7-6700k with a closed loop liquid cooler HyperX 8GB Ram and an AMD R9 380. Yet I can't play this game with decent fps on medium settings...going lower makes it about 15fps...which is still unplayable.  Please Bohemia Interactive you need to optimize this game somehow... :'(-10
ot good don't waste $40 on this game I can't get my money back because I afk'd for 2 hours because I didnt close the game. I regret this purchase.-10
If you plan on buying this game. Make sure you have a GPU better then an AMD Radeon 7750 1GBDDR5. Because thats what I have and I CANNOT go higher then standard settings. And on standard I'm getting 27-30 FPS. Kind of sad that this game alone cost gamers $8 Million in computer upgrades. THIS GAME ALONE.  PC SPECS  i7-2600 @3.40GHz AMD Radeon 7750 1GBDDR5 64 bit Windows 7 8GB DDR3 ram Quad Core
 payed 30 bucks for this game. The Apex DLC is $34. It isn't a new game and I refuse to pay again for a game I already own. Its made worse because many servers have switched to the new map which has carved the playerbase in half. The game is pretty poorly performing which is forgivable at 30 or 40 dollars but at full AAA game price I expect a stable platform and a more intuitive control set and UI. Bohemia seem to have ripped a page out of the EA handbook here only Battlefield Premium gives you 4 DLC with new maps vehicles and weapons. So until they axe the price to something respectable Bohemia can get ed ;)-11
efore we start I want to note that I did not have any optimization issues with this game. (GTX 750 I3 6100 8GB DDR4)  Arma is a game that tries very hard in some aspects It tries hard to be gritty and realistic It tries hard to push hardware to the limit It tries hard to make the player feel like what they have bought is worth it.    contains a simple campaign with an uninteresting story that is simply there for solo players who want to go through structured missions. A lot of people slate call of duty and battlefield for having bad campaigns but my God the  campaign is poor compared to any call of duty or bettlefield game I have played. The campaign is full of 2 Dimensional characters and it really takes some time to get going. I like the freedom the campaign gives but this brief freedom soon grows boring and stale.   Arma contains a variety of gamemodes on the multiplayer side Most just feel unstructured and boring. It is a very long and soul crushing task finding a decent server or let alone any server playing certain gamemodes like deathmach and it is an even longer task trying to force yourself to enjoy the game. The Role playing (Altis life ETC) servers in particular are extremely boring and you are SERIOUSLY better off playing garrys mod roleplay servers if you enjoy those gamemodes.   I GUARENTEE you will get more enjoyment on a darkRP server....    just feels like a waste of time I regret buying this game I wouldnt of bought it if I wasnt pushed into buying it by my friends who dont even play this anymore.   Play for 9 hours and then leave it alone. -11
it's allright
ice graphics good mechanics fun setting powerful real-time editor wide variety of things to do large modding community workshop support.  can't jump 1/10-11
How can a game of recent years have so bugs?

The performance of this game does not match the recommended specs. It simply performs horribly.
Kids play COD Boys play Battlefield MEN PLAY ARMA  10/10 would get 36 frames agen from this slightly unoptimized game
if you like a game full of bugs and major server lag then this game is for you! no matter how good your pc is do not expect anything above 30fps. This is another very poorly optimized pc game. Also its another one of those games that you HAVE to buy DLCs or you will not find anyone to play with.
This review is part of the non-owned Apex expansion. Please purchase it to read this review
rma is good ill give it that but thats all ill give. The game is good runs smoothly and for the most aprt without any hiccups. There is only one thing i see wrong Price of dlc i mean seriously 30 something dollars for a couple of helis the community can make in five minutes? they do really need to rethink this whole marketing thing not all gamers are rich people-11
very bad optimization not recommanded
f your looking for an review you wont find it here. BUT! I have a recipe for perfect Egg Salad.    INGREDIENTS 6 HARD-BOILED EGGS sliced 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice 1 tbsp. minced onion 1/4 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 1/2 cup finely chopped celery Lettuce leaves    INGREDIENTS 6 HARD-BOILED EGGS sliced 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice 1 tbsp. minced onion 1/4 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 1/2 cup finely chopped celery Lettuce leaves Yields: 4 servings NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTIONS  RESERVE and refrigerate 4 center egg slices for garnish if desired. CHOP remaining eggs.  MIX mayonnaise lemon juice onion salt and pepper in medium bowl. ADD chopped eggs and celery; mix well. REFRIGERATE covered to blend flavors.  SERVE on lettuce leaves garnished with reserved egg slices.  Easy 12-Minute Method for Hard-Boiled Eggs: Place eggs in a saucepan large enough to hold them in a single layer. Add cold water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Heat over high heat just to boiling. Remove from the burner. Cover pan. Let eggs stand in hot water for about 12 minutes for large eggs (9 minutes for medium eggs; 15 minutes for extra large eggs). Drain. Shock the eggs in a bowl of ice water to cool them immediately. Hard-boiled eggs are easiest to peel right after cooling.    Tips   This creamy egg salad can be layered with crunchy lettuce on whole wheat toast for a simple sandwich or stuffed into cherry tomatoes for an impressive appetizer.  Very fresh eggs can be difficult to peel. To ensure easily peeled eggs buy and refrigerate them a week to 10 days in advance of cooking. This brief “breather” allows the eggs time to take in air which helps separate the membranes from the shell.  Hard-boiled eggs are easiest to peel right after cooling. Cooling causes the egg to contract slightly in the shell.  To peel a hard-boiled egg: Gently tap egg on countertop until shell is finely crackled all over. Roll egg between hands to loosen shell. Starting peeling at large end holding egg under cold running water to help ease the shell off.  Hard-boiled egg storage time: In the shell hard-boiled eggs can be refrigerated safely up to one week. Refrigerate in their original carton to prevent odor absorption. Once peeled eggs should be eaten that day.  ENJOY!11
IT IS GOOD
Better than No Man's Sky
This game is lacking lots of features that other popular RTS games like Call of Duty have and it also has hours of extremely boring gameplay. The helicopters dont even land right either with the engines always exploding I honestly can't stand playing this game for more than 30 minutes especially with how the multiplayer community is filled with little kids who can't even shoot a gun properly.
its awsome
his game is a really clunky boring running simulator with a lot of pretentious self-important kids who wish they could've joined the army but had to settle for ordering people around in a video game for no reason. The controls are awful the graphics are mediocre and the gameplay is boring because there isn't any. It's mostly just a running sim.-10
top game
 bought this game when it was still in alpha and honestly I was pretty excited. It looked good and I was ready for more to come. Of course the only changes from alpha to release were very minor bug fixes. The rest of the game was released as ing DLC. Entire portions are currently locked away and sold as DLC this is entirely ing awful. The game even allows online interaction with people using DLC items that you cannot use because you do not have the DLC. Arma 2 was incredible and I have some amazing memories from that game but Bohemia has taken a HUGE step in the wrong direction and is turning into Ubisoft.  Don't waste a single ing penny on this piece of . Torrent it and the DLC so you can have the full product instead of a third for full price and then the rest for double.-10
f you can find a server that works the that is rare if you can find a server with decent human beings then you have found a pot of gold. Then the servers ping will kick you and the applacation will screw up your PC untill you have to  it down manually because you cannot alt+tab out.-10
is like a sandbox but instead of sand it's full of heavy rocks and sharp objects. The game runs poorly on most computers and is needlessly complex. Unless you want to read an encyclopedia's worth of information and install mods the online is dreadfully boring. However if you're willing to put anywhere between 2-10 hours learning how the game works and experimenting you can have a  of a fun. With the money you're spending there's no reason you should not give it that opportunity. Stop being lazy.10
waste of ing money
he Single Player is alright but multiplayer is the  in this game.   Life Mods/Battle Royale/Wasteland/King of the Hill are all incredibly fun.    Main issues: VERY high system requirements low frames in altis multiplayer on even the best PCs  6/10 Single Player 9/10 Multiplayer10
yeah she goes alright
his game is one of the greatest multiplayer experience i ever had in a video game. Except one thing:  Performance of the game in multiplayer. It is terrible no matter what your specs are prepare to face 25-40 fps all the time in multiplayer. I'm glad that developer supporting this game through patches dlc etc. But i simply cannot enjoy a game when framerate is all over the place. Low framerate=biger input lag in a game when every second matters it is unnaceptable.   Besides bad performance it's a great milsim with focus on teamwork tactics etc.-10
 great game from the start and later dying. The community is filled with quiet people with little to no communication.-10
o the majority of players populate RPG servers like Atlis Life instead of servers that host military maps such as CTi Warfare. That is proof enough that the game is a massive failure for what it is intended.   IMO the failure is down to lack of content first and foremost. Lack of guns lack of everything  not even a BRDM ATGM or 'futuristic' equivilent that I feel is essential for any battlefield.... just one example nevermind the rest of the stuff that is missing.   Oh and charging relativelty big money for two helicopters and a flight model that nobody even asked for... Ridiculous. Operation Arrowhead/Resistance etc... cost just a little more and had massive content.   People bleat on (especially the stepford wives on the BIS forums) about 'supporting the devs' and buy the overpriced DLC. I bought the game therefore I am supporting the devs. If you want more money from me then release an OA style addon and not low content DLC BS.   What in gods name have the devs been doing all this time if these simple DLC packs are all they have to release? Every game since CWC has a major addon released within a year give or take a few months..... except   And the weapon sway... By all means make the shooting mechanics unique and difficult to master (I dont want a COD clone here) But when I play I like to play CTI maps. That includes killing vast amounts of infantry. Before it was no problem. Now I have to play a stupid minigame everytime I want to line up my sights with a target meaning the game is impossibly long and infuriating. There is not even a server setting to customise the game for a particular game mode. WTF is that about? If you just put that in then that would make it a whole lot less tiresome for a lot of people.   I had high hopes for the game when I bought it but I just cannot recommend it. Buy Arma 2 and all the addons for very cheap and just play that. Arma 2 is a vastly superior game and that makes me very sad indeed.-10
 this game
do not buy it if you want to keep your sanity
If you dont plan on geting dlcs then you will play demo not a full game :)
It's a simulator on modern combat. You hardcore or not?
Great improvement on an already amazing series.
orst arma game in history. it feels more like COD or Battlefield due to when you run you can see your wepon on the screen. the graphics are amazing but the graphics dont make the game. the realism is there due to the new stamina system and in vehicles you need more than one person to make it effective but they really didn't do what they promised like putting the take on helicopters flight model in so the helis feel like VTOL planes when you fly really fast. i also dont like how it is set in the future because it cant be a simulation if it is in a era we have no clue about. and the weapons sound like your firing marsh mellows at people the 50. cal machine gun on the pickup trucks sound so quite when i fire a mounted gun i want to have the feeling that im shooting a 27mm gun with my hands not that im just firing another LMG. finally the NATO forces dont have any jets in the vanilla game but the OPFOR and indpendents do it should be the other way around and also the lack of planes helis and IFVs is terrible there should be more IFVs than tanks and thats not the case if i want to take a patrol out im not going to take 2 MBTs and a IFV im more likely to take a MBT and 2 IFVs im patroling not trying to take an airbase. those are the reasons you should not waste 60 dollers on .-10
Don't buy BI games. You will regret it.
is the definite game in the military simulation series from Bohemia Interactive. From massive and highly-detailed environments to expansive collections of weapons and vehicles  is a modern military sandbox for both players and modders. 's most exciting aspects are the built-in editor Steam Workshop support and near endless possibilities of community-created scenarios.  refines and masters the military simulation genre.10
his game is very poorly put together. Feels like the developers did a half-effort job putting it together and figured if a world existed well maybe mods can make it a playable game. 3 hours of playing it was enough for me. What a terrible 'game'.-10
3/5  I just don't have the stamina for this anymore.  Humble Time.
he worst game i played  On the highest settings 20FPS on the lowest 20FPS i dont know what i did wrong  i did FPS fix from youtube  it did something -10 FPS so from 20FPS i had 10FPS Bohemia interactive is good studio but they should finish their games  -10
this game is sick :))
The best sandboxes out there
his game is ambitious. Probably too ambitious. And very BROKEN.  On 5960x @ 4.4 ghz 32 gb ram Crossfire 390's  it still runs like crap. And it freezes way too often. And when it freezes it freezes hard. Can't Alt-Tab Alt-F4 or Ctrl-Alt-Dlt out of it have to hard reset my computer.   I mean I can get 90 fps on single player but barely reach 60 fps multiplayer even when turning down the graphics. But the most frustrating part is the constant fps drops.   If it wasn't for the performance issues I would give a great review here because the game itself is pretty spectacular. It looks incredible still after 3 years.   Don't buy this game thinking 'Oh I'll just turn down the settings and deal with it' or 'Oh my rig is powerful enough I'll be fine' Because this game is broken it will probably never be fixed the engine itself needs a total overhaul.-10
This game is fun to play.
rma isn't like codbf its more like gta but more realistic i mean you don't rly steel ppls cars you need a key/lockpick to the car and its not that easy to get money either. To get money u have to like pick apples or sell weed. It was boring when i started to play this game but it did become funnier and funnier every time. To play this game u need a lot of time i say.10
ould've been a much better game but the engine is way too bad. moving/shooting/aiming is delayed even on the client's computer and everything in it is just too laggy the same problems were in ArmA 2 and even though they saw everyone was complaining about ArmA 2's engine being bad.. they still made this game with the same engine but improved graphics.     worth trying yet not worth buying.-10
By far the best game I have played in my life!
Great successor for the ArmA series.  The game itself plus its modded game modes will never get old.
i liked it its just The FPS is so ed up though i have a Strong PC and a Strong Moniter that even supports G-Sync
This game is amazing. Its all you want from a game. want to kill people? DONE. want to fly? DONE. want to fly a goat? DONE
retty good. Graphics do cause a few glitches. Sadly I keep dying in the campaign as Kerry. But besides that its not bad. 10/10 would bang.10
ll around excellent game.   The campaign was very well put together the graphics are amazing the combat very realistic and the squad movements are very realistic. It does take some time to get used to all the various controls there are a lot of them but once you figure it out you can move your squad through any level with ease and destroy everyone along the way.  The mod content is getting better everyday! If you like quick PVP then wasteland and the battle royale mods are great for that. Currently they have a 'DAYZ' version of Arma3 called Breaking Point that is an independent spin-off that is also quite fun. I personally cannot wait for the Arma3 Epoch (DAYZ) to come out because I have played the Arma2 mods for a while now. There is also Altis Life and Lakeside if you're into the RP scene but that is all preference.  Overall it's a well put together simulator that ex-military which I am or civilian with no experience can learn to enjoy and appreciate.   --MB10
m not going to pay this money for this game' - Totally not you shouldn't. 1st you should get a better GPU and I mean a VERY GOOD GPU  still needs better optimization. 2nd wait for multiplayer fixes it still has some desync insues here and there multiplayer performance needs improvement. 3rd 'Why do i need ot wait for multiplayer fixes when i can play Singleplayer?' - Well ARMA is made for Coop action and by this I mean join a clan/ group/ unit that knows how to play the game correctly. 4th Buy it and you will see it will be worth it!10
If you like tactical realism! there's no other game better than this one 100% recomended
ood game fixed most of the arma 2 bugs has its own bugs but ehh :l something this big of a scale is going to be bound to have its bugs Lags on lower end users and gives advantage to users with better graphical settings. my opinion the game deserves a 7/10.10
Ai take forever to kill weapon sway is rediculous for player more so when shot and ai dont have reduced accuracy when u shoot them 5 times in the chest
this game is over a ing year old and still $60?!?!? ing jews
Wish I could tell you how this graphics looked at least. After almost 2 days downloading 13 gb's of files. I can't run this thing on a fresh install of Windows no matter what I set the parameters to. If you see my steam history I've run about 25 games on this computer with no issues. Here's the error I keep running into:  http://imgur.com/a/r3Hck
this sim is boring just like 90% of all simulators i played i played it only 42minutes and was bored already soo instant refund and deinstall over all 4/10 cuz graphics
ant a good war game? Look no further this is the game for you. It doesn't have as much action as COD or BF at first but if you find the right server and have the right friends this will be more fun by far.10
 isn't a game about Shootin. It's About The Life Of Your Character It's about How Long you Can strive And Live It's About Flyig It's about Driveing It's About Liveing! Forget About Shooting let Your Vehicles Do It For You....This Is what THIS GAME IS ABOUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
I ran over someone and they flew away.  10/10 game
h DLC meh not a big deal I can probably take the weapons off dead bodies or maybe use them for a while as a trial.'  *Gets in game*  'Sweet killed a guy better snatch his sniper rif-.'  *PURCHASE DLC NOW TO USE THIS WEAPON!*  *Uninstalls game*  This is what I get for supporting these guys for years. Way to go...-11
Awesome Game! You should Buy this game if your pc can run it otherwise you will get 20- Fps and thats not playable.
Tip of the week: try turning off arma to have fun.
This game has a massive emphasis on realism. That means the graphics are realistic. And everyone knows realistic graphics need a good graphics card for a computer. And everyone knows they need a good computer to have a good graphics card.
his game just makes me feel incredible it feels like your in the game going with it.  i love it its really nice textures nice detail and best thing of all its best game you cuold posibly buy in might cost alot but its worth it. its a simulationmilitarymultiplayeractiontacticalrealistic so many things you cuold think of.    ill give it 10/10 the best shooting action simulation tactical game i've ever played thx developers! :D10
ptimize your  game Bohemia Interactive there is no reason I can play BF4 completely maxed at an average 80 FPS yet have issues running this game smoothly at all.-10
n excellent soldier sim made for the grown ups no CoD kiddies here! The game is massive the multiplayer is extremely good has a great mod community thanks to the stellar Steam Workshop and the visuals are fantastic! Definately worth a buy!!10
his game is just a piece of crap it looks great but that's about it big multiplayer games over 80 player's lag's on nasa's super computer. This is one of the best combat shooter's on the market but this game need's a new engine as it run's off 32bit game engine this dramatically affect's multiplayer performance nothing in my knowledge can fix this.  This game is a piece of crap with more technical hours spent trying to adjust the settings or figuring out hey the server your trying to log out on is glitched that is why your gettng technical error's this game is crap.   Under no circumstance should you be trouble shooting a game more then you get to play it this is crazy stupid and I hate this game for being so techinically incapable of playing multiplayer game's which it was made to do is beyond my comprehension.  Why would bohemia release a multiplayer game that can accomidate 120 players so you can get 20 fps on Nasa's super computer in game is beyond my comprehension Bohemia is really out to lunch when they did this.  Let's be clear I can play this game in 4k ultra settings DSR with 60 fps in single player with an SSD hard drive. Soon as I hit the multiplayer with over 80 players to 120 kiss all that fps goodbuy.    It does have a lot of content but the game is poorly optimized hands down one of the worst optimized games in my life. Fps randomly drop's in the game for no reason at all no matter what settings you have it is server sided nothing you can do about this multiplayer game. The learning curve you need to play this game is astronimical becuase the bugs and glitch's are about 50 percent of your death. Falling off a stair case from 5 feet instant death unless you get revived.   Glitch's and mod's make this game the most technical to play I wouldn't even think of it as a competitive game for this reason.  The mod's in this game are extensive RPGSector controlking of the hill and many more.  RPG mod's are server sided and moderated by admin's you can banned from these mod's if you don't conform with each server's rule's and read them clearly this mod is filled with griefer's. Example your mining something for money you have ot mine it without getting shot then you have to proccess it without getting shot then you have to sell it without getting shot. Each of these distinations on the map are mile's away and if someone see's you mining they just camp the buyer untill you arrive then they engage in RPG but telling you to put your hands up while instantly shooting you.  King of the hill this is fun under 80 player's but over that lag lag lag. Also if you change your profile by 1 letter all your  get's deleted back to level one trying to get to level 60 against people with tanks and aircraft who have the xp to get the equipment. So griding if painful.  Wasteland on a populated server is a instant spawn kill but this can be fun if youu play on a low population server for your first time. This is like survial but guess what if someone doesn't kill you garunteed the glitch's will kill you.  DLC this game turned to  with the DLC you can't use the gun's on the DLC chopper's becuase you gotta pay say if you kill the last guy with you last clip in your gun making an epic run to him only to find you cant loot his gun because it's DLC so your hooped unless you pay.   The DLC's are in the game you cannot take them out this is forced payment to its costumer's who only wanna use what is in front of them.   This game pisses me off after all the hour's I put into it trying to figure out bug's and glitch's only to avoid them  Literally hundred's of anooying one's and guess what you think you learned them all  go play another game and see how much you remember.   Overall if the game kills you with bugs and glitch's 50 percent of the time or you find yourself being spawned killed in wasteland or banned off and RPG server after hundred's of hours of gameplay I would say stay away from this game if you hate technical problem's and techinical game's this is hand's down the worst game for it.   One good thing about this game it looks the best in 4k out of all the game's in the planet this game show's off 4k like no other enabling this give you a clearer shoot in the distance as it has more pixel's per square inch but only in monitors over 36 inche's.  DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME TO RUN SMOOTHLY AND PREPARE FOR THE GRIEF AND THE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AND THE  DLC.   I have not listed all of the problem's but I hope this help's with my honest opinion I love this game but the grief that comes with it is unberable at time's and the amount of money you need to build your computer to make it run at an ok level is nothing less then stupid and pointless.-10
 don't even own this game and I'm writing this review but I really wish I had this game. It's good.10
It's fun when you start playing for the first 10 to 15 hours but then it gets repetitive and if you don't play with friends it gets incredibly boring and its even worst if you dont fully know what you are doing.
16gb of RAM 1tb HDD gtx 970 msi  amd 8350 processor  playing this game is impossible. can't get more than 15fps online. STUPID
Do i recommend this game? Is the sky blue?
reat game 8/10!10
Best RPG game i've played yet.
Recomend playing. Driving Meh
 Great single-player missions. Realistic combat.  - No co-op in compaign in standard game.  Shame on DLC's price. Played random online game I respawn at a fence-captured area and wait for 15 mins but no  happend. Other players were moving around inside the area. Joined another match it was saying in programming language words way that something is missing.  Summary: Elementary level online military game with Dr. Degree single-player..  Advice: Buy it If you find it cheaper than 5 double size Mc burgers. Oh and stop laughing!-10
Runs like absolute garbage - seriously - look up benchmarks - everyone loves to say this game is cpu bound - look at benchmarks of server cpus - this game runs like hell  I have dual 970's and a i7 3770k clocked at 4.2 and can't get 60 fps
ealy good game who ever dosent have this game i recomend it to you  you will have so much fun10
its good
here's a famous World War I quote that says warfare is 'Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme terror.' Replace 'terror' with 'frustration' and this game does indeed give you the True Combat experience written on the tin.  From the description and tutorial missions I was expecting a military simulation with experiences like 'The commander ordered my squad over the radio to go to grid point 134-190 and hold the bridge so we mounted up in an APC and fought out way there to hold the line against the enemy advance.' Basically I expected a much deeper and more realistic version of Battlefield -- like the Falcon 3.0 and Gunship 2000 military sims I played when I was a teenager but with infantry and tanks and tactics and whatnot.  What I got is... nothing like that.  The single-player is more like what I would call a 'walking forward simulator.' Seriously my left middle finger started going numb from holding down W while following the squad leader character across a field for 15 minutes while only encountering two enemies. Of course when I DID encounter enemies I tended to get shot in the head pretty quickly because the AI can see right through the oh-so-realistic scrub brush that covers the landscape whereas all I could see was the tangle of bushes in front of my face with a big red 'TARGET' box floating in the middle of them. Then the squad leader guy stepped on a landmine (the only one in the world apparently -- of all the luck!) and I started following some other guys across another field for even longer only this time with an ambush of several lethal bushes a few minutes out from the save point.  After snoozing my way all across the field and then getting killed in the same spot about a dozen times I thought 'Okay maybe the real draw here is the realistic chain-of-command combined arms multiplayer scenarios let me try that.' So I popped into multiplayer... and didn't see any of that either.   There were scads of 'RPG' servers where I could play as a random villager AKA playing Walking Foward Simulator toward the corn field at the edge of town and trying to earn a bit of money to buy food at the market and not starve. True combat gameplay right?  There were 'Wasteland' servers where you spawn in the middle of the continent somewhere with nobody around and only a vague suggestion of what you'r supposed to be doing ('fortify a base gather supplies and hoard them') and of course a half-hour walk to the nearest point of interest. I wandered around the airport for 10 minutes looking for supplies or a vehicle found nothing shrugged and disconnected.  There were also 'King of the Hill' servers which at least featured combat. Well actually they mostly featured waiting for helicopters to respawn. The objective was to go from my team's base to occupy a town about 1.5 kilometers away which equated to a half-hour walk a ten-minute drive (assuming you didn't run over a bush which would pop your tire and then it's back to the half-hour walk) or a one-minute helicopter ride. So helicopter was the obvious choice but those only spawn every few minutes. Half the time some jerk would crash his truck into the helicopter and destroy it so we'd have to wait again. On the occasions I actually got to the airspace over the town I would jump out of the helicopter open my parachute and generally be shot to death while dangling in the air. The one time I parachuted out early and walked for a minute to get to the town I survived for a good while sneaking into the town but didn't run into any enemies to fight... eventually I got bored of that and ran to a tower to see if I could snipe people from the top but as soon as I peeked out over the railing I got shot in the head.  So was it realistic? You bet. Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme frustration. Was it fun? Not really. I had a lot more fun playing LUFTRAUSERS while waiting for it to download. Overall a colossal disappointment. I'm so glad it was a 'free trial weekend' -- I would have cried tears of rage if I had actually paid for this thing.-11
he DLC policy of todays game developers is the worst possible thing that might ever come.    has limited content but guess what? If you pay extra you get extra content. Why sell full game once when you can divide it into pieces and sell in parts?  I do not recommend.-10
Good Game. Game Good. Price-Not good. Dont buy it yet.
ver-priced Over-hyped Lacking in content - NOT WORTH IT. The developers re-use broken code from their earlier hits like Arma 2 Arma 1 Operation Flashpoint etc from 2001. The netcode is a DISASTER! Servers can barely handle more than 50 people and even then it's super laggy rubber-banding and warping all over the place. The developers are now beginning to start releasing over-priced DLCs - 1. because they were too lazy to release the same content WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE ANYWAY in the game initial release 2. without fixing the basic game typical money-grabbing tactic.-10
If your looking for a Good Mil Sim game then I suggest sticking with Arma2..Arma3 has seemed to have turned into a Role Playing game much like world of warcraft...mil sim servers are few and far between altis life dayz and the other role play aspects of arma3 have destroyed what the Arma series was meant to be..but I suppose BI needs to appeal to the masses. Its a well executed game..needs some tweaking but I am sure BI will update just as they did in Arma 2..just dont expect too much in the way of mil sim for what your going to pay for . Would I recommend this game? Depends..for someone who likes to role play like dayz and life games sure..but for anyone expecting what Arma 2 was..dont bother.
all of Duty for kids Battlefield for teenagers Arma for real men11
 I still need to learn how to fly a jet :(
this is a good game but it is so ing bad its just horrible falling out of buildings cant aim and walk out a door way sometimes you will just randomly died will just say you died its just a ing  take dont buy.
ts a simulation but the AI is trash so that leaves you playing with other players. Unfortunately people as a group are absurdly uncoordinated the only exception to this is when they have leadership. My generation the one after me and apparently the one before me (if voice-chat is any indicator) are the COD generations This means they do not respond to authority or leadership well. For the groups of friends who join a server squad up and play like a team I truly commend you. To the brainless swarms who waste days upon days of time accruing fake money on wasteland servers venturing out into competetive servers only to hop into and immediately crash the helicopter... **** you. If youre lucky enough to have a group of 20 or so friends to play a game of ZEUS with the game can really shine failing that.... Just download a wasteland mod and pretend to be a lone wolf internet badass because thats the future of this game.-10
GTX 970 OC + i7 4790K OC get no more than 40FPS on reccommended settings  this is enjoy
this game is cool! dont get me wrong but the fps are bad and the laggs are bad to and i got 90k ^^ if someone wants to play this game buy squad! more fps and u get more action   ps: altis life is total  only apex!
ou need all the DLCs or at least APEX DLC to be able to actually play  because the servers require the last DLC. You basically have to pay much more to be able to play. Hardly you'll find servers that dont require you to have APEX DLC. So instead of 35 Euros for the game you gotta pay 60Euros. Enjoy.  by the way they didnt fix their fps drops problems yet and they probably wont.-10
P or anything that isnt a mod is a no go wish i could have given my cash to a few mod devs instead! If you do have it you should definately get the Breaking Point mod plays better than the rest of the game.  *Update as of 1/13/15* Still a better flight sim than a tactical shooter by far...-10
 love this gameIt's make me feel like a solider in a big very big battlefield10
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. THIS GAME HAS BEEN GOING DOWNHILL EVER SINCE IT CAME OUT OF BETA AND IS STILL BARELY EVEN PLAYABLE.
 game that only exists because of a mod that hardly works for a game that also hardly works This game also hardly works. Overloads most routers-10
Not worth buying it. Runs like crap even with better Systems as Recommandet.   Sry. BI but u ed it up again and after 2 years now its still a bloody mess...
PLAY THIS GAME ONLY IF YOUR COMPUTER GOOD MY COMPUTER NOT GOOD
the multiplayer is awesome but laggy as hell. the Singleplayer is the worse ever...the NPC as dumb as  not helping at all and CSAT just got billions of soldiers. For me as a beginner it is just rubbish...they give you tasks and you have absolutlty NOW in idea what you have to do.
hard to start playing
O NOT BUY THIS ABISMAL ATTEMPT AT A GAME! It is by far the buggiest crappiest attempt at a game ive ever come across theres pre-release software on steam that works better you have been warned!-10
 have a great computer the FPS is a huge problem for this game. Your lucky to get it around 30-40. This game is a game you play with friends or not at all. This is just not for me.-10
Best Military game so far!
his game was nothing like I expected it to be. When I purchased this game I believed I was getting a military simulator that was nicely polished contained a good backstory a good multiplayer and a nicely explained tutorial considering the price of $69.99 I paid for it. I was completly wrong.  Backstory: One of the most ridiculous things about this game is that it claims to be a military simulator. I can tell you it's not even close. First off it takes place in the future not a couple years but far in the future. So far in the future where for some reason todays weapons no longer exsists. Yes that's right there are no M4's Scar's HKs Ak's ACR's etc in this game. Just this shows how this game fails. How can you claim to be a military simulator and not even include weapons that our forces use around the world to not be in this game. And even the weapons that they do include are very limited. I'm talking like maybe 20 weapons. That's just one example. I could go on about how just sticking a needle or wrapping a bandage on your teammate revives them or how the campaign doesn't make any sense but lets just move on.   Controls: The controls are the most confusing thing I've ever had to use. The placement of them are confusing and hard to remember. I tried changing them but instead of swapping them it just tells you that the key is already being used so then you have to figure what key is already using that. That wouldn't be so hard if it wasn't for the fact that there are like 100's of different key combinations.  Tutorial: Honestly why is it even here? It is so bad I can't understand it. It does nothing to explain the confusing controls as mentioned above. Instead the majority of it will have you run around to points yes run around. And I'm not over exaggerating that either. It's like the developers couldn't even start on how to explain everything so they decided to teach you common knowledge that you would already know from any other FPS like how to run walk move your screen etc. Even when it did get into something useful like using the map it still wasn't even properly explained.  Movement: I figured that movement and aiming would be different from other FPS games. But come on the movement is so sluggish on this game. Aiming is the same way. Everything feels so cumbersome especially with the funky key placement. Maybe eventually I would get used to it but it truely destroys any immersion that game could have.  Graphics/Optimization: First off graphics don't make a game but they certainly help with immersion. And the graphics were ok at first but then I realized that it was eating my computer resources that I had to scale everything back. Even at poor graphic setting I still had a low framerate issue. That is truely unbelievable considering the graphics are disgusting at this level yet at the same time I can manage high-ultra settings on Battlefield 4 at 60 FPS. So the game just fails so hard here and really this shows that no effort was put into optimization. I mean come on Rust has better optimization and that game is indie and still in early access.  Multiplayer: So this is supposed to be Arma's big thing. Yet I hated this more than anything else. I constantly had to look up servers to join. If I found a server it would launch the game load the server load everything in and then tell me that I was kicked and I need to reserve a spot at some stupid website. When I finally get into a server that you don't need to be whitelisted or reserve a spot I still had problems. There're no explainations on what to do and the community just expects you to know everything. I litterally kept getting 'hit Alt + F4' or 'call an admin' to my questions from other players. When I did figure things out on my own it seems like I can never do anything. On king of the hill gamemode I would have to travel miles to get into the battlefield. Sometimes I was luckily enough to get in a helicopter. Of course as soon as I got out I would get killed instantly by players who have a ton of money and can buy the best weapons. Then I tried alatis life and I would just keep spawning on a stupid small island with no way to get to the mainland with no explaintion on what to do. And Arma life you can't even join without paying a monthly payment. That's where I gave up on multiplayer litterally a true disappointment just alot of confusion and time wasted.  Overall from what I learned: It seems that these developers are those type of people that rush a unfinished game with loads of issues and expect the community to mod it to be playable. So if this game was $10 that might be acceptable depending on certain conditions. But I litterally paid $69.99 for this game and expect nothing less the AAA quality. I got none of that. I had to check and see if this game was still in early development but nope it was released OVER 3 YEARS AGO. Seriously I can't imagine what it was like when it came out. And I'm not a very critical person I usually enjoy most video games. And I really wanted to like this game but from the limited weapons confusing controls and a letdown of a multiplayer I just couldn't do it. I gave it two chances and if I played this game any longer then I couldn't get a refund. And I have NEVER made a refund for any of my games before. But this this is unacceptable and I am getting a refund for this game right away.  Edit: I forgot to add that the A.I. is incredibly stupid when it comes to custom missions released by the community. Another reason why this game was a big let down. Also if you think any of this review is just me ranting then you can buy the game and see for yourself. As long as you don't go over 2 hours or so of gameplay then you should be able to get a refund. Edit #2: Don't take my word of the refund though do it at your own risk because I don't know how steam desides whether or not you're eligible for a refund. In this case I was may not be the same for you.-10
i tink nåt buy tiss wone kus its nott good driving my computter
ery high quality. outranks CoD Battlefield and MoH in my book.10
ailed to start' (no license)  really??? I have 10 hours left to play this game for a test run and cant play it?!?!?-10
A multiplayer game where the more established players bully and and abuse new players even if in the same team. Maps are epic as well as the hacking is epic. Game with great potential ruined by community.
orrible worst 40$ i have ever spent in my life!! never getting my money back...smh. first of all the game itself didn't work when i went into campaign mode. it froze on basic training mode right at the beginning and game me a white screen with building like blocks And second when i tried downloading the ': exile mode' (that was supposed to be like DAYZ but better) didnt even load into a server. kept telling me that i need to delete or find the missing keys or some ! the whole reason i spent $40 was to play the ing exile mod! and that doesnt even work smh so now happy. if anyone can help me out and tell me what to do to play exile that would be greatly appreciated. thank you-10
 was half way into a mission. Driving a truck. I was told to stop at a check point. I don't know how to stop so I hit the 'S' key. Apparently that's reverse. I was still moving forward but the INSTANT I hit the S key the truck changed from going forward to going backwards about a foot which defies physics a bit and it said I failed the mission for failing to follow orders (I guess going backwards 1 foot instead of 'stopping' at checkpoint). Have to start the whole mission over. Not sure if I'll play the game anymore.-10
 realistic + loads of mods + great soundtrack + mission making + great replay value +good community  - DLCs seem kind of dull. (except for apex) - in a lot of multiplayer games FPS will drop.   Great game but the optimization may be a deal breaker for some.10
This game is hours of fun!
THE BEST ARMY SIMULATOR IN THE WORLD!
his game is cancer.  First off you have to buy additional DLC's to play it. Second off you have to download twice as much mods for the game to work properly. When you download the mods the game is heavy ~50gb After you install the mods its pain in the  to connect to the actual server After you connect you get a game crash/servers have bad connection/ no people playing When you actually connect to a game server the game lags as hell and with a new computer you have to play with a settings to actually have fps drops only to 60 fps.  If you dont mind any of these above the game is fun.-10
f you expect to run this game at good framerates on nvidia cards it is more than likely you will be tweaking the settings to almost nothing before getting at least 30FPS in campaign matches!-10
EVIEW FOR 'WIN' CAMPAIGN EPISODE  This Campaign Episode was unfortunatly shorter than the rest I finished it in 3 Hours and 24 Minutes. While throughout the short time you are presented with Interesting Scenarios and Action Sequences These are overshadowed by Short Length and a Lackluster Ending. I guess we're waiting for ArmA 4 to continue this story.  + Action Packed and Well Acted and Scripted + Update has Improved and Added Features - Unacceptably short length - Lackluster Ending-10
When Bohemia Interactive relise that their game is just one be mod and no one plays the main game xD
arma started off great but all these ing paid DLC's are AlDz as fawk....Legit reuined a great game...F*** U-10
 I played the free trial period for the weekend when the game was put on sale. I'm glad it was a free trial period. The first thing I personally didn't like was the time that this is supposed to be taking place. I'm sure that twenty years from now the weapons systems aircraft gear etc. will be more advanced than those portrayed in the game. The game's weapons systems gear etc. are obselete and are the currently utilitzed systems. Why not have the game take place in a more recent time?  Secondly I wasn't too impressed with the movement especially for vehicles. Seemed 'clunky' and a little old-school. I tried that mouse maneuvering of a vehicle which wasn't much better. I'm sure it would take practice but my initial impressions weren't what I expected from a game that seems to receive a good rating.  Lastly even though I palyed through the 'tutuorial' there was still way too much guessing involved as to what keys or combination of keys were required to do whatever it was that needed to get done. Many of which could have been easily implemented into the tutorial so you could start off playing the game and know what keys do what. Very frustrating to say the least.  However I like the idea of the game and the open environment. The graphics aren't the best but certainly acceptable. Sure I only played this game for a few hours but my first impressions didn't live up to the expectations I thought I would see with a game rated the way it is. This in my own opinion is a game that should be on the $10 clearance rack at Walmart. Thank you for the free trial but I'm going to pass on this one.-10
 this game  my life im killing myself! ps this game always freezes!  *died*
 tried to go down a slide.  Biggest mistake I ever made. Thankfully there was a kind doctor nearby who saved my life from the evil creature that was the slide. Notify the government slides are lethal. And to think we let children play on them. Science has gone too far I say!  10/10 for kind doctors who understand the dangers of slides.10
ame can be fun But after DLC still 20FPS online in the game sucks... The engine is too limited and relies heavy on CPU witch is ing stupid because people spend $1000 for GPUs Really hope they get their  together for Arma4 do not make it rely on a CPU. I feel like my 970 is a $350 paper weight playing this game.  Refined explanation: AMD 8320oc 4.1ghz with 16gb ram and GTX 970ftw+ EVGA Super Nova 750. Runs horrible online with  fps. On everything but breaking point and altis life. There is also a memory leak in the game that has not been fixed in over a year.-10
ONT BUY THIS GAME!  Now i have your attention.  Not optimized unless you have a really good pc at best i get 70 - 80 fps with my GTX 960 and I7 6700K at medium.  It is either this or Squad if you want a realistic shooter there differences in gameplay See more about that here:  {LINK REMOVED}  https://goo.gl/09Euwc  (NOT MY VIDEO)   And there are alot of other gamemodes. Fx: Altis Life Battle Royale Zeus Apex (DLC Bought) DayZ Mods and more.  Optimization is bad but gameplay is good and modding is good.  6/10-10
Game is Trash. Cant do something as simple as play a regular coop mission ever since update. 1 out 10
laying on gtx 970 and i7-4790k and this game always finds a way to crash or bug. (Also i am not playing at maxed out settings but on medium)-10
:)
eally wished i could recommend this but i can't. I've been on the ArmA train since Operation Flashpoints release and while ArmA II had a few things to wish for  feels like a neverending Open Beta. The AI is godawfully dumb unable to perform the simplest tasks without messing entirely up the map itself is about as bland and boring as it can get the 2035 theme is new but equally useless since most weapons and the entire scenario feel randomly thrown together with a few real life references.  Long story short awful optimization looks awful feels bad leaves a LOT to wish for and it feels like the Community that once made Flashpoint the amazing thing it was has grown tired. Modding teams vanished with noone to replace them most missions are coop with no care for atmospheric SP missions as it was with OFP... all in all it is far more of a techdemo than an actual game.-10
t's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need.  Over the next hour that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone I rush to the southernmost tip of the island where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point where the boat takes me home.  Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That  uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed taken as a whole  strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try.  While  was officially released back in September the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis waged between four different factions.  The first part Survive is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of 's two islands Stratis and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the 'follower' category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings.  It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here though Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan.  While it smoulders rather than sparks Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload you'll rush to locate a better vantage point order your men to 'find cover' (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body.  Tactics are vital in  but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly after Survive you will die many many times. That said it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.  Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in 's clumsy interface.  Alongside its story missions which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on 'Patrol' and complete multiple optional objectives from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex all while collecting weapons ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process.  After the meatiness of Adapt the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular displaying vast combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise it's also the most interesting segment making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating whichever direction you take.  's campaign is a big powerful deeply engrossing thing but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt there are no tank missions no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why to a point: Arma's vehicles especially its airborne offering take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue and it's frustrating that 13 years on Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.  8/1011
dont buy this game really if you dont have a awesome gaming computer i have  cpu: amd fx 6300 gpu: r9 270x ram: 2x4 1600 and i get in this game 30 fps at all low and 1600x900 in System Requirements recommened it reads  Processor: Intel Core i5-2300 or AMD Phenom II X4 940 or better  Memory: 4 GB RAM  Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 or AMD Radeon HD 7750 with 1 GB VRAM or better   if your specs are lower do not buy this  game you need in mulitiplayer  at least  intel core i7 4790k and gtx 970
layed this over a free access weekend I have a high-end gaming rig so no problems there - liked what I saw.  I really wanted this game but decided to do some research before I pulled the trigger.  I really wanted a game that would let me play with modern vehicles. I couldn't wait to jump in an Abrams or Apache or a Leopard 2 or a T-90... or jump in a Tunguska to try and shoot down a A-10.  I had visions of massive armored battles with supporting infantry artillery and drones oh my! All with badass graphics and realism only a simulator can give - beyond the laughable dumbed down versions found in the likes of Battlefield and CoD.  THEN I came across screenshots of what initally looked like a Russian Mi-28 Havoc (Sweet!) With... the dual contra-rotating main rotor blades of a Ka-50 Hokum?!  Apparently Arma III much vaunted 'hardcore military simulator' doesn't even have real-world vehicles in it.  Fantasy island nations with ficitious governments to battle in I can handle. Completely made-up armored vehicles tanks and helicopters in a supposed high-end military 'simulator'?  No Thanks.-10
The un-usual real Alpha!
his game is a waste of money.... It's the buggiest game I ever played sounds are late like Mexican movie... Player gets tired like he has a hangover and the AI its on speed its almost impossible to catch up... Man just don't buy this game I wasted 40 bucks on this terrible game....-10

Amazing game. possibly the best game i have ever owned.
Beautiful game nice game if you have 60usd buy this game im trust
D3D Error - DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED  Basically I cant play the game. Unfixable error since 2015.

1000000 / 1000000 GOTY BEST MIL SIM !!!!!!!!! TRADED IN MY SOUL FOR THIS GAME.
rilliant game can use some Help though some bugs are annoying..10
I can crash my computer by spawning 1000+ units fighting each other. 10/10
he Game does have some pretty minor glitches but other than that  is a great game for community development. Dev's out there create some pretty fantastic mods and addons for the games because of the huge open world maps and functions Bohemia Interactive provides in . Many people buy this game just for the AMAZING addons to the game which allow very unpredictable scenarios to happen. Arma is Intriguing to me because the game is UNPREDICTABLE. Games that are unpredictable are more of a way for players to choose how they play and gives a slight immersion. There can be scenarios where you see a heli crash onto a building which is 100 meters away and that building had one of your best soldiers now knocked out waiting to ambush the enemy who is surrounded with OPFOR. What do you do? Arma is fantastic because its your choice of how you want to play the game where other games have straight up orders to do stuff why would you want to do that? I would give this game a 9/1010
Amazing game the createors realy out did thereselfs this time. and there is something for evryone there is many many different type of gamemodes.
pretty gay.
I sucked a guys  10 out of 10 would  again

Omg ten outta ten so good lol hashtag yolo
reat Game 9/1110
Great memes and games and stuff like really good buy it thanks!
o Not Buy this game  If you're in to getting a half finished game of which half of the items require a second purchase of DLC then this game is perfect for you if not then you may want to avoid this game. It is inevitable that more and more of what should have been in the original game will be charged for.   Some basic visuals such as the way roads link together are still not fixed along with some vehicles having animations which result in a poorer gameplay experience. If you backed them during the Alpha you will have been completely ripped off by this company and even if you did not you will be in some form. The game is still playable without the DLC but guns and helicopters should have definitely been included in the price especially for the people who have backed the company from the start.   You will find that unlike arma 2 servers are already starting to die down with great numbers of servers being taken down due to insufficient funding. Arma 2 servers never had this issue due to the large number of players on servers and the replayability of the game yes I have a lot of hours on this game however it does not make up for the fact that it is meerely designed to squeeze money out of you. I refuse to pay for DLC which is not fairly priced for their supporters. Companies such as this one should re-evaluate their stance to the market before the PC Gaming community heavily turn against companies proposing to release large amounts of DLC. This has already been demonstrated by fans of the upcoming title 'Total War: Warhammer' where thousands disliked a video of a planned DLC in order to get their point across.   Companies will continue to take the P*ss until we take a stand against them.   -10
 this game unreal how you always die and there is nothing to do
I didn't know I even own this game
 hard game...
runs like a piece of  thats been dragged through the fattest mans 
3casual5me  The game isn't hard enough and way to unrealistic.
Boring... When will Arma 4 come?
on't be deceived by the trailers  gives you the impression its a more tactical Battlefield shooter. It is that by all means but it's centered around the tactical aspect. Missions can take up to 3 hours to complete and just the training is enough to throw a seasoned shooter off. Training will have you snipping targets with an assault riffle. I get that most ex soldiers in the US today enjoy this game because it's very similar to real life hostile engagements but I honestly felt like I was having to camp like I see bad players doing in Call of Duty. More power to you if that's what you like to do but I for one enjoy Halo Gears of War Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon. So I didn't get that close ranged tactical cover to cover neck snapping stealth urge I needed satisfied. I don't recommend this game quite simply because the type of game it is not so much it being bad because it's surely not a bad game. I play Warframe way too much so I wanted something a bit slower and more tactical. This game seems to be nothing but that. Too much so for me. Just download and try it. The first 40 minutes should give you enough to decide rather or not its for you.-10
I love how there is so many other gamemodes to play my favorite to play is Atlis life its just so much fun and i cant see any problem with this game
reat game will recommend it to friends if you buy this i highly recommend checking out altis life servers pretty good!  10/1010
Just get it and stop looking down here...
Its a very good game. Everyone should check it out and play Altis Life :P
Gud game 2 lern armee stoof

Like shooting people in a real-life combat situation but without the PTSD.  10/10
ood game i like it but there is bugs.11
9/10.
ad this game for quite a while - original review was actually made in oct 2014 - but didn't play it much due to gamebreaking bugs. But its Nov 2016 now and much changed.  I must say after these 2 years it matured damn well! See below for more information.  Conclusion: If you loved Arma 2 or if you love simulation/sandbox games military topics and a very customizable battle experience get this. It's worth it.  Some people may call the DLCs a bit overkill in terms of pricing I must say ~10€ for about 2 more helicopters is not quite nice.  BUT  theres the DLC Bundle! 17€ for all 3 DLCs that would else cost you 22€! I'm all for it the developers deserve it after working so hard and even including great new features for free in the main game instead of just in the DLCs.  Please note that APEX is  NOT  to be comparised to the other DLCs! See it as Operation Arrowhead of Arma 2. It adds so much content that - even though I currently can't afford it - it sure is worth the price.  Now theres still much to do to keep this title afloat and BI seems to have still quite some surprises in their roadmap for us as well. Even though my initial reaction was tending to negative on  back then I can only have good hopes now.10
its nice game .  its for a Long mind People !  you need +1week to know this game and know 10% about it .  i think ArmA 4 will be awsome
Wish I didn't get rid of this game
e 'if a game ever came out and had the destruction of battlefield bad company and the big map of a planetside 2 it would be the best game ever'   10
10/10 would shoot a police officer again
Best Game Love Th Realism Of It Must Buy!
Kids play Call of Duty  Boys play Battlefield  Men play Arma
is awesome! Especially BattleRoyale if you dont have this game you need it!11
his game is hard. You jump out of a building-splat-dead. You are walking aroung- bang-dead. You are in a tank-mine explodes-dead. Howeveronce you learn all of the tricks(about 75 hours for me) it starts to get really rewarding. This game is very immersive from the fact that you can shoot enemies from over 2 klicks you can fly helicopters fixed wing and drones. You can drive tons of vehicles or you can just walk around as a rifleman. Use the mission editor to create a mission to your liking download mods to (nearly) perfect your game. A.I. is kinda glitchy some textures aren't perfect but overall FANTASTIC GAME. Seriously one of my friends NEEDS to buy this so we can play together.10

Exile mod is the only good thing this game. And also wasteland mod! Don't bother with single player or the official servers.
Do not waste your money on this game. too many glitches and you need a super computer to run it. plus the controls are way to messed up this game is a BROKE game
est and addicting game really realistic and alot of fun!! Great game.11
Having fun playing CityLifeRPG look it up  http://community.cityliferpg.com/
f you enjoy walking this game is for you. If you feel like wasting time and effort this game is for you. By far the most unfriendly FPS game in the history of FPS. I have more fun spinning quarters than this game. This game is just too much going on for an fps game. For example it takes 3 or 4 commands to choose weapons change optics and its not very reposive. If you want an FPS game with the momentum of watching paint dry this game is it. Its not fast paced. I know its a simulation.   If they can make a simple FPS simulation game with the feel of battlefield or bad company 2 it would be so much easier. Honestly. Its just damn too slow. This game caters to smaller more simulated kind of community. Its not for gamers who play fast paced shooters. Its just ridiculous how slow things are.   Good luck finding an enemy. I only see team mates at spawn doing asbolutely nothing. And for the creators seriously don't mask the fact that this game is for EVERYONE. Its not. I was conned into thinking this game is relative to other shooters but on a big big scale.   I can't stand this 1999 interface. Too many clicks for radio commands too many clicks to change weapons. Hud sucks I want faster faster faster more reponsive interface. Its too much going on for such little thing. Just make things easier man. Single player is ehhh I wanted to play the multi. Looks good.   And anything you see on youtube those players they just are so involved the average gamer/player is not going to have that kind of game play. Too many options when all you have to do is make it simple.   JUST KEEP THE DAMN GAME SIMPLE MAN stop with the X CROUCH Z PRONE BS or if its the other way keep it one button for all and who the hell still uses the number pad enter button to change camera views. Your interface bindings should be universal.   Visualy this game is nice looking. But everything else just forget it. I love simulations games and it does not have to be so complex.-11
ist $60 game I ever wanted to undownload. It remined me of E.T. on the atari but E.T. was better. negative 1337/420 would uninstall again-11
terrible optimization
Its okay...... Campaign... its okay...... multiplayer....... well........ i guess its okay....... game in general........... let me think......... its okay........ I recommend Arma 2 and OA Thats a good game..... Thanks for reading.... bye i guess.......         I SAID BYE NOW LEAVE!
i don't really like this game
I can't picture my life without this game. *cries* This game does not get any better for a military simulation. So many hours never bored.  10/10
oftware is buggy I'll get stuck between water and land and have to restart the level. Also I can do 2 direct head shots and nothing happens but the character can take a single hit anywhere and die; this is on novice. If I take a differnt path the level gets hung and nothing will progress unless the level....again has to be restarted. My team members will have super human powers and they take off leaving me in the dust while my character never recovers from exhaustion. I understand they try to make this a realistic as possible to being a foot soldier but I spend most of the time 'walking' from one end of the map and back. I wish they did more R&amp;D before releasing this and spent more on combat; I wish I could have my $ back.-10
This game is a bit like the nintendo wii its old runs like  and the only reason anyone plays still is because of thier mates conning them into it. To be honest I'd be more delited to climb up my own  and out my own mouth it would be substantly more comfortable. 1st game looks goodruns like my grandmother it doesn't run at all. 2nd gameplay rather bland only redeeming quality is laughing at the plethra bugs. 3rd multiplayer is a one guy shooting another to be randomly killed by the guy that you killed 20 minutes ago because of poor networking and net-code. Saying that i doubt this game features such a thing as net-code infact I am lead to belive the game fears such a thing.  Finaly I'm Rating the game 4/10 just because of the sure enjoyment of watching the game bug out and other random BS.11
It's k.
ought the game ran it for about 15 minutes and then requested a refund. Why? Because even with me having the recommended specs (gtx 660 2gb i7 860 2.8ghz and 8gb ram) I got a annoying 20 fps on everything set on lowest (Reselution scale on 50%). Sure the game might be fun but I hate that they lie about that the RECOMMENDED specs are gtx 660 2gb 6gb ram and i5 4460 which I basically have! DO NOT BUY if you have about the same specs as me or even lower. Only buy if you have a gtx 900 series or amd r[-] 300 series graphics card or better and the recommended cpu and ram or better.-11
 really good realistic military shooter If you hate realism and military shooters do not be a  and buy this game and all you do is give it hate. If you love realism and military shooters GET THIS ////\\\\10
o let me tell you a story. There's little old me Just wondering through the amazing countryside as you do. The colours were amazing the lighting and sounds were great I just met up with my friend and we were having a great time. Then all of a suden out of ing no where i get headshoted from a thousand meters away! 10/10 would rage quit again :D11
Learning curve so steep it's undefined.   10/0
rma the only game where you can call people who don't camp noobs.11
his game is a waste of $60 Bad Graphics barely any multiplayer firefights (which is why i bought this game). I could relate this game to GTA 5 because a good percent of the players play RPG servers and you go around like feel life. I thought this game would be sorta like Battle Field 4 but nope it did not meet any of my expectaions. 2/10 stars-11
f you have a Extremely high end pc i advice you to get it But if your running a Gtx 970 or anything below it runs like . like seriously.-10
Arma 2 was amazing and  is amazing =)
 is the definitive warfare simulator.

Ground combat. Air combat. Underwater combat. Vehicular combat. THIS GAME HAS A LOT OF COMBATS!   And yeah.. It's not perfect but it's really fun if you find a unit.  11/10
Best game in terms of realism and simulation
is the most expensive game on steam. Only people who work at NASA can afford it this is because you require a degree in quantum physics to be able to remember the controls and move.11

TL;DR its a great tactical simulator very well pollished  This is a Mitlitary Silulator Not another C.O.D.   the level of detail is amazing the visuals are stunning.  FPS can be a problem as it is very CPU heavy ( 60fps is achievable but dont expect to be on ultra )  audio is stunning local voip is actually based on player location and rifle sounds effects are great  the workshop is a great aid for mods and extra content very easy to use
ndless hours of fun. So much funny and awesome  happens. However it is pretty commanding on your pc. But that's easily fixed. It only gets better the more friends you have playing with you. I would like more of mine to have it (ING BUY IT CASEY). Anyway great game! So many amazing memories and it hasn't even been that long. Highly recommend it.10
The base game I would give 80/100.....with all the great mods people put together for it I would give it a 90/100. This is due to the fact some of the mods are still.....meh....to say the least. Great game overall and highly suggested to realistic shooter enthusiasts.
f you're looking for a in-depth military simulator look no futher because this is the best you're going to get. Also look out for it's extensive catagory of mods such as Breaking Point.10
The best realistic simulation shooter
An excellent addition to the series. Some of the most fun I've had in any game would be in the Arma series. Of course you could play it as a sim but the most fun is not taking the game seriously and just having a good time. A+
ilitary 'Simulator' tons of community content flexible modding. Still some bugs that needs fixing though. 8.5/10 - highly recommended.10
his is a deep and engrossing Game. Really I'd say its less of a game and more of a simulation framework. You can tell it's grounded in real world military simulation by the lack of training wheels.  Good support from the developer and community there is some epic content here if you are willing to put in the time. New releases constantly improve the core and add additional content.  At first I was put off by the 'future world' setting coming from Arma 2 and expecting something more grounded in today's tech but this game is growing on me and seems like an improvement in every respect.  Have not had any performance issues as of yet but I went out and bought a new Graphics adapter solely for this.   I'm not disappointed.10
This game is ing awesome.
Fun game when you have a group going. I would definitely suggest checking out the workshop as there are some quality missions for team play.

ish I could get a refund it crashes everytime I try to play. Even after following guides to fix all the problems I even factory reset my computer twice and asked support for help. Yet nothing.  GG.  Maybe stop breaking the game with every update it'd be nice.-10
awesome game but.....dev are f'in idiots....how do I join on riends that are in the same clan????????????????? can not do it ..... after 2 games u 'smart people' cannot figure out how to get friends into the same game???????????????? Wiskey Tango Foxtrot????????????????????
uch a great military simulator you can't turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... A Z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be StarCraft. I don't play an FPS to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. Don't buy this game. For a strategy game there's only horribly-done strategy elements and for an FPS there's horribly done FPS elements in it. For squads and commanders buy Battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter this game is just bad.-10
very gewd much yes
YOU BATTLEYE I GOT GLOBAL BANNED FOR NO ING REASON? WELL  ME. I CANT ING PLAY ANYTHING THAT USES BATTLEYE THANKS TO THE HEAD THAT SET UP THE BAN SYSTEM YOU THINK YOU HAVE ALL THE KINKS WORKED OUT OF THE BATTLEYE THING WELL YOU ING DONT.  THIS  IM OUT.10
multiplayer is a broken mess!
its a great game if you like tactical gameplay
You can run this game with 20 fps in multiplayer on your GTX 970 and i7-4790k desktop.
retty good but very laggy for my pc ill buy the full version once i buy myself a super computer10
s an Operation Flashpoint ArmA 1 and ArmA 2 Veteran and having played  for 200 hours I can safely say that  is the best ArmA yet. It improves drastically on many of the previous games' flaws as well as adding some cool new things. And I will admit while there could be many more missions weapons and vehicles in the game (there's a lot less to do than in ArmA 2) it makes up for it by having steam workshop support as well as being extensively moddable. For me the campaign so far is the best campaign out of every ArmA game. Sure it's no where near AAA standards but it has more than kept my interest for far longer than ArmA 2/ArmA 1's campaigns. So all in All I would definitely reccomend  to anyone who likes Tactical Shooters/Strategy and Military Simulation games. 10
the game is supper glichy
ust buy. Great game gameplay is much more fluid than Arma 2 and mods and user created content provide endless gameplay. grab some buds make a squad and go kick some !10
0/10! Absolutely love this game. Almost so much I'm eventually going to upgrade my computer that means paying about 1000 Euro's or more just so I can get this game on highest specs looking AMAZING!  If you're an ArmA fan than you're going to love this.10
aste of freaking money. the game runs like crap the aiming freaking sucks and theres freaking invisible enemies that can kill you even though yoju cant see them. worst game ever i regret buying this piece of crap!-10
Where is the fire button?
I have always loved the Arma series and always will but here is my review.  Pros -great graphics -great story -workshop compatibility -easy to mod -great voice acting -great animations -great textures -visually pleasing gun models  Cons -poor optimization   100000000000000/10  would buy 5 more times
ery realistic but doesn't run multiplayer at high frames.-10
You can do stuff in this game
 hope most if not all of the bugs and issues there are fixed through beta and release. For an alpha it was very impressive but I feel there is still some work to do to make the game the best it can possibly be and with a price of £19.99 ($32.99 – € 24.99) is almost idiotic to pass up. I imagine on full release that price will go to the normal price for a new game on Steam either £29.99 or £39.99 so get it while it’s hot.10
reat gameplay great visuals sounds and the two new islands are frankly wonderful and huge. In my opinion the most noticeable improvement since Arma 2 is that we are now evolving into some realistic and visually credible open world as opposed to the narrow places kinda looking like more or less similar 'checkpoints' in previous games. The gameplay adjusts extremely well to the new terrains making  something closer to an actual simulation than 'just' an advanced FPS with 'milsim' elements into it. However it is impossible to talk honestly about  without telling what hurts most: the lack of vehicles (planes notably but not only) the lack of weapons and few annoying Ai pathfinding issues (sometimes even on places where all should normally go well).  That being said I personally can see an insanely great potential behind  and the way it will continue to evolve will in my opinion probably make it simply one of the best game ever created. All it needs is some more time to grow up.10
i7/16g memory everything on low or turned off - MAX 20fps. Nuff said.
f u gonna buy this  buy everything. All the DLC's etc. Because I bought the vanilla game and thought i was gonna play some multiplayer but u cant use the quick join function. Because the game searches for DLC servers.. WTF man.-10
Worth the money.
OW TO KILL TANKS THE SIMULATION WAY: Walk against them and they will flip.  The game where you can't even play the tutorial mission because of broken scripts (restarted 3 times the third time my character even had a different voice)  Want a game where you can survive more headshots than in Call of Duty? Then this game is for you. It's the future. Your helicopter can actually land on enemy soldiers without them seeing it! That's the stealth we need. Enemy AI only shoots you since it knows the game is won for them then.   What's the difference between glass windows and mountains? We will never know. AI will shoot right through it. Oh well you can't kill them trough glass windows! Just like in real life.   This is actually the least realistic game I have ever played in my whole life. But no one plays it for it's military aspects anyway -  Altis Life is where all the players sit. (because this military sim is oh-so-realistic.)  Fanbase in this game or should I say fanboys are incapable of understanding what this game is supposed to be anyway. Do you believe all the 12 year old veterans? Hell yeah.   I do like the fact that this game has an editor even if it's quite horrible compared to the other games featuring an editor.  The developer also doesn't care anything about this game. My tank literally explodes from driving against a fence at 5 kp/h. Just like in real life!   The other only positive aspect I can think of are the graphics which are very nice. And no my friends the graphics aren't badly optimized it's the scripts which basically are the only things that this game has.  1/10. Can't rate it better for what it's supposed to be especially not when compared to other games.-10
f you wanna play life RPG's this is the game. There are rarely servers for TDM LMS CTF or control. Its not even war. All of the servers are life RPG's. I was expecting way more out of this game. A WASTE OF $40..... Money back would be much appreciated... If this company has any heart..-10
Not worth the price. Not even close. Do not buy this game. Especially if you don't have an organized group to play with.
UGS BUGS AND MORE BUGS CANT EVEN LOAD THE CAMPAIGN WITHOUT IT CRASHING. Quite annoyed as i played about 7 hours before the bugs hit me and i cant get a refund.-10
Great game if youre in a team with friends that played before
Another Great game from Bohemia really liking the virtual reality missions they were amusing I quite enjoy the underwater missons a great addition to one of the best milatary simulations out there and the  Breaking point mod is always good fun
xtreme lag needs optimization would not recommend to anyone that can only run minecraft on their computer like me-10
 loved the game even tho i suck at it but its not optimized i see fish swimming on land water physics floating on land and the fact i payed 250$ CAD on my headset (7.1 suround sound) and i still cant tell where ppl are shooting from or where footsteps are coming from. AND the fact i have a grphix card thats in the recrierment(cant spell) i cant these damn memory log crashes where my momory cant read the info. i think i got a good modded computer where i can play Fallout 4 in ultra setting minus motion blur but still be able to tell where a bandit is shooting from other than that my settings are MAXED (solid 45fps) and no memory issues at all this game needs more updating i keep crashing cuz of these memory dumps that couldnt be read by my computer. it doesnt stop there it crashes in single player mode and online and the crash reports basiclly told me to update/downgrade my GPU...... OR go to another server. base line if ppl want my opinion if you got mid-line GPU its not worth the price tag these guy need to work on bug fixes big time.-10
this is a great game at its core but horrible optimization and bad players ruins it.
m going to be short on this one. The game is great not a little it is really great. But I am giving it a negative review for I cannot play it properly for a very simple reason: I cannot stand its gunshot sounds. I am not whining over this the thing is that I have an ear sensibility and I cannot stand high pitched sounds period. For me Arma 2 sounds are totally fine I know that people in general gave Arma 2 sounds a bad rating for me they are ok. There are other people over the internet who complain over this gunshot sound issue they are simply too loud. I know that in real life they sound exactly how they sound in  but in real life one also wears headphones to muffle the real gunshot sound so no I do not need real gunshot sound in a game (considering that I use headphones for playing) I care for my ear health. I sent a support ticket to Bohemia: maybe they can add a slider for gunshot sound maybe they can add an option to disable this very high sound dynamic range I don't know if they can/want to do this. I was on the verge of buying the Apex expansion but I stopped because of this issue. If they don't do anything then unfortunately I have to stay with Arma 2 or other arcade shooters what can I do. I am really looking forward for the devs to come up with a solution for this issue. If they do then I will change this review.-10
Great Combat simulator however realistic vehicle damage and pysics is highly lacking. Oh and make sure you have a good pc otherwise expect 15 frames.
 THis is a very nice game just wish I had more time because I love editing!! :D. But for now I have tot stick with arma 2 :(10
People's necks start glitching out in the back of helicopters. 10/10 would see a doctor again.
Banned For No Reason and wont respond to my unban notice 10/10 would buy on my other account
Very good game! And easy to play even for begingers! I totaly recommend this game!
uns like sh*t dont even try playing multiplayer it dosent work for shiz nig refresh is broken cant join a friends game through steam.-10
Best Simulator game I've ever played.
m not skilled at this game yet though I do find that this is definitely something that I would recommend. Here is what I find great about :   Absolutely amazing graphics and visual effects   The most realistic military simulator out there no doubt about it   The voice commands in the game are smooth and consistent   You want tanks? Boom have a tank. You want helicopters? Then have a helicopter! It's all in one great game!  There are many more things about  that make it awesome one list simply can't do  justice. I have no regrets for purchasing this game at full price. If I were to have but one complaint it's that it's hard to  git gud .10
ecent Game with lots of different game modes to choose from however it still has a few bugs here and there which needs fixing. I can then give the game 10/10 but now its 8/1010
his game was released as an incomplete game but content is added on a regular basis. In a couple of years it'll actually be worth the $30 price tags it'll be by then. I don't recommend it at its current price but overall it's a very solid military simulation game.10
he best Military simulator ever!!! Pros: Ballistics is realistic Alot of Multiplayer mods Awesome sound effects + graphics Gotta love the option to customize your gear Great Factions to play with You can play this game even if you don't or have friends (And..........Girlfriend :D ) Cons: Physics are off You would need a nice computer Vehicles when bumped backflips You can't destroy houses (So far in my experience when firing alot of rounds with a tank) Limited weapons to use (Preferablly to add some AK-47s AKM M4 etc.)  Overall rate this game 8/10 I hope this would help! See you in the Battlefield10
ell doneold campaign saves not workingthx .....not buying apex *thumbs up* in more than 20 years wall glitch still possiblewowwell done as wellsorry im done with you behomia! You are just ing kidding and mess around with players Hall had reasons to leave and im quiet confident why... Dayz was a ripp offlike the whole seriesim really sorry to say thatbut i was a big fan ....flashpoint(the raly first one) flashed me so hard and thats you behave over years of loyality.... im done.....im so mad-10
xtremely fun when it works.  Patches often break things to the point where it's unplayable. Buy only if you have a decent computer and have a lot of patience.   Also BattleEye is terrible.10
eally cool game nice graphics and fun gamemodes!10
ohemia Interactive jumping on the futuristic shooter ban wagon if they'd stuck to current millitary equipment this would probably be a well deserved chapter of the series but instead if you want that experience you have to mod it also who charges £10.99 for DLC that should have been in the original release as the base vehicles and weapons are shocking. Stick to Arma 2 if you wanna save money.-10
ll server with big ammount of players and good pings are locked. Every server is run by someone else so u have to register and ask for permision to play on 10 different forums. On KOTH I spend 20 minutes to get to the battle and then I die within few minutes Game graphics lacks of colour intensity Everything looks grey. Vehicle engine sound is incredibly bad.   The biggest problem are the servers. If u dont add some official servers in Arma 4 I will not be buying it.-10
eally poor feels like your constantly playing a beta game. Lags like crazy.-10
train simulator with tanks and youll be teamkilled more than you encounter an enemy.
AUTISM 3
ses OFP engine from 10 years ago. Recommends GTX 560 I have 580 and NEVER get more than 20 fps no matter what my settings are. This game was made by dirty slavaboo gopniks who have no ing clue what they're doing.-10
INVALED SCREEN HELP ME PLS.
o I bought this game on the summer sale it looks really hard in the trailers and in the gamplay reviews but the controles are really messed up and its hard to do anything in the game. I think that when they make arma 4 they should put in normal controles and less controles like E should do more then just one thing. I really think that arma 4 should be a little less hardcore and more user friendly.  thanks-10
Not Fun &amp; setting up controls was almost enough stopping playing instantaneously
Absolute garbage. Complete Alpha Crap. Buggy as all . 2/10
This game is totaly waste of money for amd owners.  Getting too low fps with poor cpu - gpu usage.   Fps around 15-30 with high settings and it's dramaticly same with low settings too.  Not optimized for amd cpu - apu.  Totaly unplayable for amd owners.  I opened a ticket on steam cs for refund my money.
i thought sunday was a weekend day.
so meny bugs around. that game.
How could this still be this bad.. still playing arma2 witch is much better
is easy to explain. Imagine arma 2. Now add proper stances to it ALOT better performance alot of fixed bugs (alot more introduced aswell) and on and on.  is a good game for what it is. The main problem is: the devs are ing lazy they didn't bother modelling lots of civillian cars like in arma 2 instead 4 or 5 that just have different skins. About 1 tank per faction. 3 or 4 Helicopters and  me only one ing jet. I mean thats ing lazy. The amount of content in  is ing embarrasing compared to the shear amount of content in arma 2. Bohemia Interactive have done a great job with all the new content etc. but this game should still either be in alpha or very early beta. NOT a finished game. Overall if your reading this to see weather you wanna get this game or not its down to you. If you want a game that runs and plays really well if you can look past the laziness of the devs and the lack of assets then get it. If you can't however just stick with arma 2 until the devs actually do something about the lack of assets etc. Again this game should be in late alpha - early beta. NOT a finished game.-10
ne of the best mil-sims / combat-sims ever made definatly worth the $6010
Great game. But is showing it's old age. Deleting from my games list for ever. Good riddance to bad rubbish.
This is my opinion! you can have your own! I don't care!] This game makes me want to give CoD: Ghosts a five star review why? ... Pros: - Good Graphics - Go-Karts - Day-Z Cons: - Jump? - Every player wants to kick you - There is a point when you stop making a game realilistic - Openworld is not good in a military simulator - Insurgency did this better - Menus are confusing af - Spawn menu?  End note! My first ten minutes was spent throwing a guy's Hunter into the ocean than being banned because of it... I have no regrets. and for the most part I had no idea Wat the  I was supposed to do  +Bonus Disclaimer! Despite my rating I might play it here and there just to get my $60 out of it.-10
tep 1: Buy the game after making sure I meet all requirements. Step 2: Install the game. Step 3: Click play. Step 4: Get 'ARMA III has stopped working' Error. Step 5: Try running as administrator. Step 6: Get 'This aplication has failed to start because d3d11.dll was not found' Error. Step 7: Look for DirectX Folder in the  folder as that is a file related to it. Step 8: Find there is no DirectX folder in the  local files. Step 9: Re-install. Step 10: Get same error.  0/10 - A salty person-10
oo expsensive pls make less exspensive thx game people.-10
o Just no....-10
If the apex update will be 5 euros instead of 30 sure. Till that no s given. Anyways. If you want to buy the game keep in mind that it has a  ton of bugs.
Its a very good game.
f you like never being able to leave spawn 12 year olds screaming in your ears and  hitler level admins banning you because you called them out for their own rules then buy this game other than that  this and  you arma i tried to love this game but nawh im done same t day in day out peace out and ill be back when you can make this an enjoyable game again.-10
ts a good game but they need to stop being such stingy jews and lower the damn price.10
Full of bugs that can be fixed but the company is too lazy to fix it.
ove this game the best game ever wayyy better then those cod games and yet when you get a 360 no scope in a tank then you know you are good in cod.10
DONT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE LAG! I have a very high end PC and this piece of trash struggles to get over 40fps in signle player mode.
Do you like headaches? this game is headache game
Hard to control!
ell... what to say about this game in two words. Its Bad.    is terribly optimized for PC. Mine isn't the greatest but I saw someone who had two 980s try running it didn't even get over 50 FPS. Never knew you needed a $4000 computer to even get over 60 FPS. The servers are terrible there are rarely any servers that are populated with a &lt;150 ping. Even if I try to connect to any of them it says connection failed. People may have thought I made a bad review because of how difficult and realistic it was. I like games like this. Too bad bohemia interactive didn't put enough effort into making this game run really well and to make the server connection good. Instead of fixing these problems and making announcements about them they decide to release DLC after DLC to add onto this broken game. If you are stupid enough to pay $15 for two helicopters you must not be too wise with your money. I should have mentioned when getting into a server you must either donate or go into ts to fly. Why can't they just use game chat? Guess I will never get my pilot license. They probably sould have fixed arma 2 as well before making this one. I refuse to run this on the LOWEST POSSIBLE settings because there is no reason I should. A game like this you need good view distance and things need to looks some what nice. You can't see an enemy a few thousand meters out but they sure can see you. Please DO NOT buy this game unless it goes on sale. This game is nowhere near worth $60. I would say its worth 20-30 range.-10
hile I love the Arma series this game was not was I was expecting. When you make a game you have a couple things that need to be set up to make it a game.   1. A setting - They created the island and it was good very large and open with a diverse landscape  2. The Engine - Everything works well even the physics which Arma 2 completely failed at. Movements are fluid you got way better animations so there aren't any complaints....until  3. Weapons and Vehicles - This is one of the most crucial points to add variety to a game and I am sad to say that BI failed miserably. They created virtually nothing for the game's release for what reason I don't know but it aggravates me to no end. You have all the things in place the tools for people to make their own missions but there is no variety same guns same ammo and a couple of vehicles. Look at Arma 2 even without the DLC there was TONS of content to work with and the DLC just added onto that.   My advice? Keep up to date on the status of the game and once the first DLC comes out THEN buy it-10
nce again the community doesn't do any justice. Almost all servers are hosted in Brazil mods are galore. Expect no vanilla game at all in the server browser. Expect no one to help you out or work tactically or be approachable at all. Aimbot is inevitable.  5/10-10
ontrols are clunky horribly optimized graphics suck AI sucks and in some missions actively tries to get you killed.   and yet i keep trying out of pure boredom.  -10
This is gonna be est game ever i see you dont make dayz mode for  But its not gonna happen u create new game for day z u published videos for u are working on  for dayz You guys said you are going to publish it soon u tricked people
3xt g3n load into a server nek m1nn1t crash-10
uggy as hell. They never fixed weird issues like being able to walk through walls.  Hard to tell when you've actually shot someone. No real visual indicator that you've shot someone so you end up shooting them 5 times out of confusion. Single player campaign seems badly thought out. I basically had to save scum to get off of the first island.  AI is awful. No armory mode or quick mission mode.  I regret buying this in alpha.-10
 will never ever buy another mistake (Bohemia Interactive game). I trusted this company and purchased this game in Alpha. Not only did they deliver a buggy failure. They have the nerve of releasing expensive DLCs that are meant to be included in the game. And announcing new games when they haven't even finished whats on their plate. This developer should be renamed as EA v2.1  Never again BI never again.-10
free weekend)   GTX 760 intelcore I5 windows 8.1 (64 bit) 8 gigs of ram directX 11 and the game still runs like crap on the lowest setting. do not recommend.-10
 played 11 hours on the free weekend and i use to enjoy the flashpoint series but found this game hard to get into and the missions seemed the same most of the time. Only the first episode was available for free but it seemed the same run through some trees shoot a few enemy then go to objective shoot a few more complete objective wait 2 minutes then mission ends.   Couldnt connect to any multiplayer servers so maybe this game is too old now and no one hosts severs for it in the Pacific region?  I might pick it up on the sale again if its 60-70% off but 50% off and I will still hold out on it for now.-10
hey should really fix this game performace wise performs like one of the first AAA games that were demanding on PC. Cant say i can recommend it due to all the performance issues and i run 2x 970 STRIX in SLI and got a high end Intel CPU and even with those startup commands it doesnt fix much.-10
Why play  when you could be putting your genitals into meat mincer which would be a lot more fun. I feel like Ive been robbed! Definitely not worth £35.99 -_-
so good to install and unninstal! plz try
 thought I would love this game but after dealing with sloppy menu systems unoptimized game settings and ridiculously varying quality in gameplay I just wish I never spent the money on this. All the online gameplay shown is under incredibly set terms that you'll almost never see without dedicating a ton of time to a community with a teamspeak.  -10
Awful. Way too complicated and clunky to be fun.
his game don't deserve much lovebad performancemouse bug at start can't click anythingcontrols are bit weird mostly when you try to aim it zoom...whateverordinary graphics (played Ultra 1080p) with 2009 polygon count.On foot graphics runs better with people shooting and all that good action than flying on helicopter that you only can see ugly ground texture with some trees with no action...weird. Grass looks to much like paper really ugly. Yeah you can make scenarios and yeah the map is huge yeah it's a sandbox but no it's not that great. To many people likes ittakes a hateri rarely hate games but ...i hate it.-10
reat game you will get your moneys worth10
ike skyrim with soldiers 10/10  well this game is unique and realistic  its not like COD or BF where you have to KIllKILL and KILL  this game will test how alert you are  so beware this is a game not for noobs or impatient people or kids10
reat war simulator. Way better than all these arcade shooters. In this game you have to think strategically and be careful because mechanics is demanding. It has developed multiplayer and many huge mods like Breaking Point Exile etc. Campaign is more difficult than other games' campaignes but multiplayer has many different kinds of servers. You will be satisfied. 9/1010
is the most recent edition to the series it is a greatly improved in almost every aspect.     Improvements  First of all this game is excellent it is a vast improvement from ArmA 2 and has less clunky controls runs better performance wise many new features such as scuba diving with underwater shooting (can't get to them all) steam workshop support and many active players at a time.  This game also requires a beast of a PC to run it is optimized very well though for the vast open world it is. My specificiations are an  i5 4690k 8gb of ram GTX 760 Superclocked  and I get on average 30 fps on Ultra 45 on High and 70 on lowest at 1920x1080 resolution.  (Bohemia based games also run better on Intel processors usually)     Hmm?  I really don't have much to say that is bad about this game. I do dislike the desync that happens in this game but they have managed to get rid of some of it in this game compared to ArmA 2 were it would happen alot more frequently. Also more content please Bohemia. :)    TLDR;  Good game buy it if you liked ArmA 2 or you want a realistic combat scenario. Worth it even at full price.10
Fun game. Really fun for mucking around or just surviving online. Huge map. Great with mods (zombie survival mods such as Zoombies). Must play shooter.
The battleye service is absolute ! i got banned for purchasing a vehicle on 'Altis Life' i do not recommend this game!
Game is only fun if you have a bunch of mods. And if you dont have apex then good luck trying to play the game
ro:  - Very Realistic Simulator - Large amount of User Created Content - Constant Updates and Development of the Game as such - Dedicated PC exclusive Game  Con: - Weak Optimization (AA-AAA CPU+GPU is a must if you dont like Cinematic 8-10 FPS at Mud-Graphics) - As of lately 'weak' Playerbase: Little Teamplay with Random Players Few Use Voice Chat) - Bad/Unresponsive AI to Squad Commands (eg. dont lie down/dismount when you command them and subsequently getting killed) - Rip Off DLC (eg. 2 Helicopters for 6-12 €/$) - AAA Pricetag only justifyable by being the sole decent Milsim-Series on PC - Multiplayer HEAVILY reliant on Mods/Addons (eg.Altis Life) Game would be already dead with Stock Gamemodes - Gameworld Interaction (eg.Opening Doors) very clunky at best - Short/Weak Campaign  6.5/10-10
ow the aiming control set up is clunky as heck. You have to toggle everything and that is a pain. You have to hold mouse 2 and tap L ctrl or L alt to change site views. That gets me killed every time. The only use for the AI team mates is picking through their dead bodies for supplies. Seems like a solid story and the game looks good though so there is that if I can get the controls figured better.-10
 definite upgrade from Arma II the controls act more like PC controls of the 21st century (not feeling like your wading through pudding when trying to look strafe etc.) and the graphics of course are much improved. There have been some issues with PhysX crashes but only from those with AMD cards in my experience.   Sa-Matra wasteland alone is reason enough to pick this up!  The only gripe I really have is that they still have not made the client/server multi-threaded. One of the most idiotic things to overlook when the AI calculations and such really make this game/engine heavily CPU-intensive. If you love realistic shooters without all the kill-streak B.S. and handicapping pick this game up.10
Very nice game i played arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead and they have step it up really nicely the multiplayer server engines could be a bit better but apart from that it's a masterpiece of Fps games.
ood  game.  Bunch of hours still lots to do.10
one of the Quad A games out there ( AAAA ) :D Best game ever in my opinion   i r8 8/8 m8 w8 88/8 m80
his game is an interesting concept but is NOT for everyone. It is a modern military 'simulator' and it does this pretty well. Tiny little nuances of the miliary experience show up: leaning around corners to aim having spotters for sniping and switching fire modes on a gun and healthy amounts of bullet drop are all things you will have to get used to. Those things aren't that bad and some can even be fun. ESPECIALLY the artillery targeting computer which has a maximum range well beyond the edge of the map has different types of shells and shows how long the bullets with take to get to their destination (and it will take time if you shoot from one end of the island to another. Sometimes however these nuances can just get annoying. The keyboard is cluttered with keys assigened to different things in places that don't make much sense (let's just say I wasn't expecting to have different buttons for my watch my compass and my very real map.) There is no typical first person shooter radar showing where enemies or self made waypoints are (although mission waypoints do show up.) Long story short this game is incredibely complicated to control and will not be controller friendly.  The big draw for me and for most people after seeing reviews from people like NerdCubed will be the map editor. Appearently this is what the game's developers were expecting as well because the game didn't even come with campaigns at launch (they are being added as DLC over the next few months.) The editor is incredibely detailed to the same extent if not more than the rest of the game. Unfortunately it is even more user-unfriendly. Particularly concerning non-physical items like spawnpoints and mission objectives. Some of these require you to CLOSE THE GAME ENTIRELY AND EDIT THE TEXT FILES FOR THE SCENARIO. Other things like controlling where you want units of the map to go and who they will attack is another mystery entirely. The learning curve is a monstrosity.  I'm not particulary concerned about graphics but this game is pretty underwhelming in that respect. It's textures are uninspiring and driving physics are woeful. Where the game makes up for this is in scale. The game is freaking HUGE. It will take and uncomfortable long time to cross even in a helicopter. I believe the estimates are something like 270 square kilometers of space. In other words very very large and possibly of the largest maps of any game. It is pretty empty but there are some small towns churches and all sorts of terrain to give a lot of creative leeway when designing a scenario. If you can figure out how.  If you know to/are willing to code and have a lot of free time on your hands Arma III could actually be a lot of fun. But for everyone else it's probably best that you don't fork over 60 dollars for something it takes dozens of hours to fully comprehend.-10
eels like I wasted my money. Game looks beautiful but it got too frustrating when it felt like everyone else was going on with the mission and combat and I was left looking around for the enemy.  Outisde of waiting for some tracers to show up and give the enemy away my efforts to eliminate my target were futile 99% of the time. I'd use up all my ammunition and they'd land in a perfect shot every single time. It got to the point that I would end up sitting back while the AI on my team took care of it- after all they knew exactly what to do while I'm just sitting there shrugging my shoulders.   This is not your typical combat FPS. The controle are wonky and I spent a hard-earned $60 on frustration.  I have a Titan video card. It runs all of my games on maximum settings flawlessly. With  it seems like all I do to ajust the graphics settings makes no difference as I'm hit with major framerate issues.   After a few days I reinstalled the game to give it another chance but I just couldn't get anything accomplished.  I personally don't recommend the game.-10
retty hot game. Played it for hours done everything you can really do and it's still fun. Ape/10.10
f you enjoyed Codemasters “Operation Flashpoint” in 2001 then you will absolutely love ARMA III. ARMA III takes place on two different islands: Altis &amp; Stratis. Stratis is 19 square kilometers (7.3 sq. km) with few roads and rugged forested terrian. Altis on the other hand is huge at 270 square kilometers (104.2 sq. mi.) with lots of roads and terrian of mostly rolling hills. However only ~5% of the roads on Altis are paved.  There is a lot of detail put in this game including some indigenous fauna such as snakes rabbits goats dogs insects and a wide variety of fish and other sea critters. They do not do anything but move around but it adds to the realism. Did I mention snakes? There are a huge number of snakes on Altis.  Movement is not restricted. Meaning you can move anywhere you like. Including using a re-breather to dive off the coast of either island to investigate ship wrecks just for kicks. There are lots of vehicles to choose from both civilian and military. Weapons ammunition and equipment can be taken from the dead. However only take what you can carry during the missions. If you put anything in vehicles they will disappear once you return from your required mission or scouting mission. You will only be allowed to keep the items you are actually carrying.  The game includes a single-player campaign broken into three episodes:  Survive = 8 required missions plus 6 optional scouting missions Adapt = 9 required missions plus 8 optional scouting missions. Win = 6 required missions no optional scouting missions.  When you complete the first required mission for each episode return to base and told to report in – don't. If you report in then you will be assigned the next required mission. Instead go to where a group of your fellow soldiers are standing/sitting and listen to what they have to say. This is how you get optional missions. Then go off on a scouting patrol to complete the mission if you so desire. When you have completed your scouting mission(s) then return to base and report in for your next required mission.  All the missions except for the last one are linear and static. Meaning nothing you do will change the course of events. Except for the last mission. In the last mission you have to make a decision and that decision will determine the outcome of the mission.  There is a steep learning curve and that can get a little frustrating at the beginning. If you are new to ARMA III then I recommend enabling the “Save Games” in the Game Options settings and save often to help alleviate that frustration. The Survive missions are all solo so you have time to adapt and learn the controls. The Adapt and Win missions team you up with a fireteam at your command. By the time you complete the campaign (~30 hours) you should be familiar with giving your fireteam commands both individually and as a group.  ARMA III is more than just a “First-Person-Shooter” it is a first-person combat simulator. The weight of your equipment is taken into consideration and will effect your movement and endurance. The three different stances (prone crouching and standing) will effect how much your weapon recoils which will effect how quickly you can target an enemy. Standing while trying to hit a moving target at 1000 meters is not recommended.  ARMA III allows user-developed mods and also includes DLCs. Once you have completed the campaign and want more single-player or multiplayer campaigns then I recommend subscribing to the “Dynamic Universal War System” in the Steam Workshop. The DUWS mod will randomly create new campaigns with as many missions as you desire. The goal of the campaign is always the same – control of the island.  There are still some minor bugs that need to be worked out but it is very playable as is. I definitely recommend ARMA III.10
 HATE THIS! every time I attempt to accses a server or game im always transfared back to the main title server screen due to 'unknown errors'/ error code : 0x0000DEAD- why to I have to deal with this every time I try to connect to a server... £14.99 wasted thanks....!!!!-10
Bad Optimization but I can't say whole is bad.
 bought this game. Hard to play. Stop playing. I just wish it was easiler no doubt it is a good game but i was just lost in what to do or how to do it.-10
ll be quick and clear.  I'm amazed how Bohemia Interactive has worked on this game and the best is the support it has performing the game every day.  One of the best things about Arma is the modding and people developing it for our delight.  I fully recommend this game.    btw for DayZ players  Breaking Point is great for now better than DayZ Standalone (EA) period  10
verything about this game improves on Arma II except for one key point. The game simply does not run. Not on high end machines not on anything it is so poorly optimised and coded that no system can run it smoothly (60 fps). Online games lag all the way down to 10-15 fps in cities just because the server code is poorly written and results in server side lag that effects frame rate as well as hit detection. If this game was actually able to run at a decent frame rate that stayed decent online it would be a wonderful game. Until that time i cannot recommend this game.-10
his game is  compared to ARMA2. Gear loadout saving process is  and not working optimization is  AI is . In other words it's a downgrade. Keep playing ARMA2 until this game is patched/fixed-10
The best MilSim out there by far.
Best Military Game 10/10.
Runnig into battle with no pants and a MG    10/10
game isnt realistic tbqh if i was really a solider i wouldbe owning n000bs and  womyn like are they mad?
The butt-crawling makes this game the most tactical game ever. 10/10 will crawl to victory.
 regret buying the DLC... The karts are ly stupid. The rifles are total BS garbage.... and the helicopters I can get from Armaholic or Play withSIX. Just get Play withSix and download weapons mods vehicles etc... If I could do it over again I wouldn't pay $1 for the DLC that should have been included wiith the game to begin with. The game  is awesome... The DLC is underhanded.-10
love the game would like a dynamic campaign to be included
ery realistic game. Spot on combat vehicular and weapon mechanics. My complaint only complaint can only be related to possible crappy servers I have got on or my own ADD...but either way sometimes it feels like gameplay can drag on without anything happening for an overwhelmingly extended period of time. Overall 8/10 in my mind. If you are super into realism in war games definite 10/10.10
fantastic shooter/milatary sim butstill need to fix mini bugs but they dont really matter :D
This game is not even good enough for a comment
 is The perfect game if you're looking for a military simulation.  -Good Points: There is a lot of multiplayer server. Some server can host until 200 people. The Eden Editor allows you to create your own misssion and to publish it in the Steam Workshop. You have a lot of military and civilian vehicle/weapon/stuff. The graphics are pretty good. There is tons of mods and content.  -Bad Points: Not very optimised. The AI could be better. Sadly you can find bug/glitches.
Its arma
poorly running multiplayer :/ my specs are higher than recommended and I still play on 20-30 fps (only in mp)
It would be a good game if it wasn't such a resource .
HE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE !!!  If you are looking for a realistic game with the best developers that listen to there community a community that is always active in any game mode you play a modding community that is always making and updating new content for the game and a game that will stay in your heart forever this is what you are looking for. YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH OUT OF THIS GAME and trust me I have over 1000 hours and looking forward to many more to enjoy.10
You just get blown up from a thousand meters away or sniped by people you can't see in single player. Multiplayer is the same just with a lot worse FPS.
Terrible performance I have a GTX 970 SSC w/ AMD 6 core @ 3.8Ghz  And I baily get 20 FPS
10/10 420
his is not a good game  It's still not optimized enough to run over 60fps on KoTH on my rig (8GB 1333mhz RAM GTX760 i5 3570k win10)  -10
i dont own it
Unfinished and lazy
ould probably be a good game but buggy as hell.crashes all the time.If im lucky i might get to play 10 minutes before it locks upbut most of the time its about 2 minutes. I have a quad core processorRadeon R9 200 HD4 gb ram so i know my cpu is well above requirments.So dont waste your money unless you like hours and and hours of trying to troublshoot the game just so you can play for 5 minutes.-10
If you like sub 20 fps first person shooters this is the game for you!
Unoptimized trash. It's not worth $60 and certainly not worth your time.
n my opinionthis game looks gorgeous. Everything feels realisticthe movement is also great. But I wouldn't recommend to play this game due to bugs that there are in-game. This game doesn't look fixed yet.   PROs: -Great gameplay (The moment when you are driving on A3L feels so good) -Realistic movement(crouchingsprintingand also walking around) -Well builded buildings (Such as cities on A3L or Army Camps) -Good graphics but I expected more coming from Bohemia Interactive. -Fun game to play with your friends.  CONs: -Game is not fixed yetneeds more work to fix the bugs. -Map is loading so hard sometimes -Loading screen makes you punch the keyboard it works so slow -Sometimesit is so hard to crouch and sprint because you are gonna get stuck into surfaces -It is impossible to drive in A3L without having a laughyour feets are visible everytime you are in the passager seat.     I do recommend this game if you wanna have fun some hoursbut I do not recommend to play this game everytime until they will fix the bugs that they have.-10
fix your ing game.... it's 2016. it's about time to get a new ing engine. clunky s
Nice game nice mods   SH+T ENGINE PLS CHANGE IT AND DONT USE THIS SH+T ENGINE
Price is to much from Alpha by 2x.
f you own an AMD bassed system do not purchase. My system exceeds the recomended specs to run the game but you end up with unplayable FPS. I have spent a few days trawling the internet trying to find fixes for the problem. They do not work one minute you think you have found the cure only for the frames to drop of either in game or when you restart it. When a game shows you recomended specs you expect it to work the problems have been around for years with no fixes from the Devs so I expect there to be no fixes. From what I could get from the game it is excellent game play and great graphics. But not for AMD systems you have been warned..........................-10
-.-
10/10 worst optimised franchise again
Really buggy and glitchy  10/10
ouldn't recommend it's a broken game with lots of bugs in it.   Need to mod it up to make it look half decent.   -10
rain damage isn't the word.. If you love walking about hill sides &amp; empty towns for hours on end then by all means knock your self clean out. Really good graphics Half decent engine but just awful gameplay. Trying to even see who is launching nades and rounds at you is a fecking personal nightmare. Could feel myself falling asleep in one game where a guy was flying for an hour with me in the back of a chopper.. and yes.. we met no enemy the entire time. 4/10 just for graphics-10
everyone need to try out this game
awesome game for anyone
 thought this game was AMAZIING at first since I has seen videos on Youtube but then when I got into the game I realized that it was a rip off for SIXTY DOLLARS! The game is very realistic but maybe a bit TOO realistic. You get tired like every five seconds in the game so you cant sprint for a very long time which makes the game boring because it takes forever to get anywhere. The game is also very hard to understand at first and the turorial is very confusing when you start. If you are buying this game for graphics or/and realism then its a yes but if you are buying this game for fun and lots of action you should pass on this one.-10
Its Fun especially Altis Life :D
All of a sudden I can't join any servers. All it says is 'you were kicked' no matter what server I try.
if you like games that crashes all the time and never works then you should get this 
Tried shooting the enginer so he would repair my helicopter and was killed by my squad. 10/10
my favrate game recomended at six stars
10/10 would get sniped again.
This game is awesome and really realistic with cool graphics! Good Job!
he game is awesome and i really love it. beware of the fact that its more sim than an fps it is hard and it will kick your  from time to time! if you like a change of combat style (mostly slow mid\long range) from your normal fps try this! you wil love it10
One of the most realistic military tactical shooters!
his game is the best armed forces simulator out there. It's customizability is it's strongest point allowing players to create missions and to run these on servers allowing a infinite amount of possible scenarios. If you liked ARMA II get this. If you played Battlefield 3 or 4 and thought 'I like this but I want more realism' get this. Cannot recommend enough.10
his combines the FPS that every serious FPS military gamer would want to play It has great customization for your apparel the guns are also easily customizable and it looks great on ultra high even better is the fact that it has a very active gaming community and workshop items are constantly being added. Also when you kill people you can rob their pants. 11/1010
ike ARMA 2 Got to be the best game around.....forget battlefield and CoD just buy this you won't be disappointed.10
You can kill goats 4.20/5
Game performs poorly.
What a ing dissapointment.
Literally NOT FUN!!!!!! 0/10
Accidentally got a RUS VPN version so I can't play the game D:
the gud guds
It's THE BEST.
Ran towards a tank butt naked firing a pistol. Got blown to hell.10/10.
 decided to try  as everyone was recommending online.I am going to start out with this game does need some work to be put in not worth to spend full price on this pick up when on a good sale other then that this game isn't for people who like fast paced action now performance issues I apperently run into with other complications. Firstly so I got 20 fps everything maxed to lowered it still some 20fps terrible port needs to be compressed properly controls are also clunky I would say the simulation at the start was 60fps but once it ended fps dropped drasticaly. Secondly I would recommend trying to run with a single GTX 980 &amp; 970 or AMD equevelent never crossfire or SLI not responsible if fps will stay the same usually I get over 60fps maxed out in games but this one you probably should use a controler since it's not K&amp;m friendly. Lastly lets not forget the story you run to point A to B. I know it's supposed to be realistic but we customers need playable material this rant is to prove that servers have connection problems sometimes you get kicked from online most of the time I get messages saying  stopped working as I play through don't get this garbage unless this is below $10/7.89 EU or $5/3.95 EU please Bohemia Interactive fix this trash and make it playable.People with 770s780sand 280sand 290s are really dissapointed that this game doesn't run well on their machines an utter dissapointment to people who dedicated their money on powerful pc hardware just to have 20 fps? In summary not worth buying this game since it isn't demanding but more unoptimized unfinished product this is a spit on PC Gamers and their rigs and before you say something to defend early access let me tell you something Valve needs to work on testing this games before letting them be published on steam conclusion don't buy it not worth your time unless you like capped down ports then support the video game monkeys who make video games this bad and horrible.   Final rating 5.5/10 for Walking Simulator-10
o you like wandering around in the middle of no where for 2hrs just to get killed one min into combat? do you love admin abuse? well boy do i have a game for you! its called   if you like a whole lot of walking around and doing nothing  your gonna love this  -10
 rarely play online and don't do much single player. I have no idea how i have 100 hours it must be good.10
ealistic beautiful and good gameplay experience. There are bugs here and there but they usually get fixed the game in my opinion is a bit boring due to it being in the future with non-existing weapons. It is too bad there aren't any popular PvP servers though. the game looks and feels much better with loads of good mods to it and is extremely fun to play with others.10
ts like Arma 2 exept this one has graphics.10
dumb game got take out of my account.
es yes yes....... Great game to play with your friends. It has a lot of variation.10
orst experiance I ever had. I constantly get kicked from servers for having a high ping but in reallity my ping is always 80 or below. The game seems fun but i'll never get to find out.-10
hen it comes to writing a review for this game I really don't even know what to say. This series has always been a go to for me basically since the beginning of my PC gaming days I was playing OFP in 2001. Over the years this series has entertained me longer than any other i've ever played. There is absolutely no competition to ArmA no game/simulator comes even close to what arma has to offer or even comes close to the gameplay experience ArmA has. As any ArmA veteran knows there is some humps you need to tackle to get use to the game. It's not a game a where you can just join a server and play like battlefield or red orchestra. That's not how the game is structured. It's not a game where you can play it natively it is not designed in a structured gameplay style what-so-ever. This isn't a game where you can play by yourself( Well you could...). It's hard to explain to the average-gamer what this game is about. It's a platform and if you're playing it without utilizing the very nature of the game is not going to result in the ideal experience you have heard about. You need to have a community of players small or large and 3rd party content to form the game into the GAME you want this PLATFORM to be. The average content pack is at least 10gb but you should expect 20+gb of content. The game is designed to be modified.  has no asset content and ArmA 2 is merely a skeleton of a game body. Explaining to the average player that they need to download a special program and install 10s of gigabytes of content is difficult it sounds like hard work. Your average player doesn't want to 'work' to get the game into a playable state. That's understandable but that's not what this game is about. It's so versatile for a reason so groups of people can make the game exactly how they want it. It's really almost too much to explain all I can say is that if you give this game a chance and you put in the work for the first time around to set it up it's amazing. It is absolutely unmatched. Almost every issue you are going to hear about this game comes down to user error. If people are complaining about the AI and the futuristic content( or the lack of content) that is entirely because they are not using the game to it's potential. If you don't alter the game meant to be altered you're going to have a bad experience. The same concept can be applied to performance. I'm sure if you've looked up ArmA you're probably wondering if you can run it. It is true that arma is a heavy game to run but that usually is not the source of the problem. 90% of the people complaining about lag are running the game on weak computers that just cannot run arma. The game is not considerably unoptimized it does have some networking issues but they are hardly the cause of any major performance problem. This is an intensive game 5 years ago you could not even dream to see what arma is providing. In a couple years it will be much more easy to run given the bound-to-happen advancements in hardware. It also comes down to the mission maker and the server hoster if you don't run your servers right you are going to give your players bad performance. This game does not babysit you and you should not expect it to. If you know what you are doing and you have a decent computer you will run this game with no problem at all. I hope you take the time to try it and don't blame everything you are uncapable to do on Bohemia. There is very few things I can say that have made an impact on my life that aren't real maybe 1 other game out of the hundreds that i've played. ArmA is one of those there is some great hilarious experiences in ArmA that I think I will remember the rest of my real life. Not many games can do that.10
Basically Arma 2 with less everything but nicer graphics and less bugs.
reat game The campaign is supprisingly epic ( i don't like campaigns that much ) Battle Royale mod is just amazing to play :310
Quit looking at the negitive reviews and buy this game.
Love this game. Altis Life is my favorite gamemode so far. I highly recommend this game.
ave passed 480+ hours on this steam account and still enjoy it! You should check out the modding community love all the mods including Altis Life Exile Epoch and  Project Life. You should atleast give the community a try since its the community what makes this game so great!10
.5/10  When People Finaly Realise That CallOfDuty Is Not A Real War Game I Think They Sould Play This Or Battlefield But Enyways. This Game Is A Great Way To Either Play Sirius Or Not Its Fun Either Way I Highly Sugest It I Personaly Love Atlis LifeWastelands Abd Patrol Ops So If You Want A Realy Great Multiplayer Game Buy This.Or If Your Want A Great War Experience Play The Singleplayer Its Probably The Best SinglePlayer Ive Ever Played On PCI Hope This Helped You Dicide If You'l Be Geting It So Thanks For Reading :D10
ood game can flip cars with go-karts10

Any one selling  cheap as a gift? add me i have paypal and ROK willing to trade
This game is amazing!!!
slow clap* nice way to go all EA on us and wait to release half the end game content in dlc get aggressive cancer bohemia devs.-10
n my opinion the second game is much more fun. I don't really like the setting and the game is just not Arma. This game is more like 'Arma: Tactical Roleplay Altis Life'.-10
My most played game on steam ever.
he amount of possibilities in this game is very cool the updates destroying your saves however are not.-10
Brilliant game... lol. Be good if it would run decent on MP
So many cool gamemodes to try out and have fun with your friends with!
o be honest I was very disapointed in this game theres no single player which I expected there to be. No I didnt read all the info on the game first and that was my error. It popped up on the steam recommend window that opens and I in a fluster of idiocy bought it while it was slightly discounted but I regret it.  Online the problems are if you are not on an optical internet cable or if you live a 200 ping or more away from server your going to get owned by people with fast connections and wikid video cards. In an online firefight with guns throwing bullets all over the place 100 thou matters and then the you die with no sound or seeing what happened happens.  Games pretty enough nothing wrong with its graphics but online only just means when there finished making there 800000 bucks they turn the servers off and we all now have a game that can never be played again.  Making games multiplayer online only is basically CHEAP.  There is no real backbone to this game and there are alot of ''online multiplayer only'' games already so I cant recommend this game and I very rarely do reviews on games I dont like they usualy have annoyed me to do so.  I think the last bad review I gave was for that cheap and nasty walking dead production.  Anyway thumbs down on this one.-10
 is really injoyable it gives me freedom
 hit a jump and randomly catapulted 1km in the sky then got taken out by an anti air missile.  ing 10/1010
here to begin? I've been a longtime user and fan of Bohemia Interactive's Arma and Operation Flashpoint series since the original Operation Flashpoint. While I have always enjoyed the series there was always something.........missing. Some intangible thing that I could't quite put my finger on but left my experience not entirely fulfilled. Because of this I wasn't even going to bother with . However with Steam's promotion allowing play for free this weekend I thought I'd try it out. I installed it played the tutorial and played some of the showcase missions and campaign missions. What do I think? Well THE DEVS FINALLY GET IT! They finally finally made the game I always wanted since the first Operation Flashpoint! No more herky-jerky animations no more bad bad dialogue. They've overhauled the graphics engine got what sound like to me professional voice actors and they really turned out a top-notch product! This is a serious military sim that is unforgiving and pulls no punches. You aren't some rapidly healing super soldier. You get hit you'll probably die. Even if you patch yourself up with a medkit you are still in pain and that is reflected in the gameplay. This is a thinking man's military sim this isn't a 'Call of Duty' or 'Battlefield' game. This is to first person shooters as Microsoft's Flight Simulator is to flying games. Its amazing. On a rig that can run it the graphics are absolutely amazing. The weather effects are top notch. And its all on a huge huge map! And an insanely detailed one at that. So far the campaign is quite entertaining if not a little unforgiving. My only quibble with  is that the A.I. is a little wacky. Either you find yourself up against eagle eyed super snipers that can see in the dark or complete morons who will stand stock still and fire at you. Often the A.I. is fairly good but man once in a while....... I haven't tried multiplayer yet but I cannot wait to give it a shot. I would give this game 4 and a half stars out of 5. A nearly perfect military simulation. Well done Bohemia Interactive well done!10
-Awesome Graphic -Great Military simulation -Have many mode  worth to buy 10/10
It's fun with friends and without them.... I had some really fun times in this game
Horrendously buggy...
bsolutely love this game so far! Spent hours and hours only on A3Wasteland and I have yet to try other mods with friends! Optimizing the game for good FPS is a little tricky (considering I'm running 2x 970s in SLI and a 4790k...) but once you hit the sweet-spot in the settings menu you are ready to go. Like any other games by Bohemia Interactive it takes a while to grasp the controls and over-all feel of the game. Having previously played over 400 hours of Standalone I thoroughly enjoy the vehicle and base-building aspects of game modes like A3Wasteland (Atha &amp; DADDY) which is a hell of an experience when playing in a small or even large group.  I recommend the [AMG] A3Wasteland Par Antha &amp; DADDY server as I have enjoyed every second on that server.  Overall: 9/10.10

one of the best games i have ever played defently worth buying :D
ice work dreamworks studios expensive and fun shooter.11
mazingly fun endless possibilities in this game.11
Great game! needs more weapons that are not included in DLC's however.
is a Side-Scrolling 2D Platformer developed by EA. In the games' main mode (competitve) you play as one of two factions; the Terrorists crazed madmen who seek to destroy the world by unleashing ravenous chickens infected with the Ebola virus and the Counter Terrorists who desire to stop the fowl plague. Armed with $800 and their wits players seek out the various chicken sites and fight over control of the worlds destiny.11
O NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you select a piece of gear that is part of DLC first of all it doesn't tell you what is DLC and isn't it will let you use it... except it then pastes watermarks all over your screen so you BUY THE DLC which it conveniently guides you to when you exit the battle. Nothing more than a great title taken and abused for every dollar they can squeeze out of it. Don't waste your money unless you are prepared to buy ALL DLC along with the game which is still chock full of performance issues and bugs. No thanks!-11
spent 2 hours finding my objective  10/10
This game has some twitchy movement and bad controls. The frame rates are buggy and graphics are just 'meh'. Reminds me of a lackluster CounterStrike. Not worth the money in the least.
Altis Life is the best mod on this game!
Why no Gore Mod? :-----( Arma is a nais walking thru Forest Game.
o have any type of enjoyment within this game you first must buy a computer that requires a Nuculer Power Plant to power it.... Then buy this.11
This game is garbage. Most of the time I spent was me looking up controls on how to drive the car I bought. Did that for however long and then I bought the exact same car and pushed the drive button and bam I could actually drive so I mean like driving? It's basicallly copying CoD right there. And then because I'm a stupid teenager I recklessly drove down the mountain or something and then instantly crashed into a tree and broke my vehicle. Again straight from CoD so I'm getting frustrated now. I then walked for however long and finally got to a town (I'd like to point out CoD has towns) where I got sniped from God knows where. I don't even own  (basically CoD). 48/8000

reat Game but the thing i really dont like is that you need a good graphic card to play it! but overall great game10
Great game. Great graphics. You actually have to use cover instead of running around and shooting stuff.
Just no! This game is not even worth the time just to get 10FPS online! Stay away...
 have fallin in love with this game. Altis Life is the best mod on this game. The roleplay and every situation is diffrent every time I long on. The flying Driving Diving Selling drugs taking kindnies robbing  minning and much more. The single player is alright but all the mods and the community make up for it.10
I Really enjoyed this game but i mostly enjoyed the multiplayer! Everything about this game is just great but i would say its a bit overpriced! The community is amazing not like Gmod which is filled with kids! 9/10
Amazing... No other words for it
reat Game Great modding community and plenty of options for basically all types of players10
ar sandbox time and effort will net you a good time.10
OMG BBQ PWN need I say more?10
ool gamequite realistic when i destroy the tank the explosion is very beautiful10
 cant recommend this game to anybody. this expensive crap of a game is only giving me 18 fps no matter what i set my settings on. gta gives me 80fps on max settings and the graphics are 10.000 times better.  the only thing that's great with this game is the war atmosphere and the weapons.-10
his is a great strategical military sandbox game its such a cool but ? dont like the mod types like survive so we also need a zombie sandbox gamemod like DAYZ EPOCHwe dont even have a mod like that that game is great for the altis life players so the only great thing of this game is altis life its the best RP mod ? have ever seen so PPLLZZZ bohemia interactive add thing like dayz standalone or just add a expansion like the Arma 2 Operation arrowhead.10
mazing game does need good computer to run but that not a prob for me ;D minor bugs very funny when playing with different stances. campaign is well written and well created i give this game 8 tacos out of 10 babes.10
Its good!
atch the showcases (they're old but you should be able to find them) they're about 14 minutes long and show off lots of cool features including disguises and much more. This game is NOT finished and needs to be updated still.  Edit: It's been some time since the release of this game and I have to say... It has improved A LOT. There are loads of new features now they re-did the sounds textures even the colours. The Nexus update improved loads of stuff and with the upcoming APEX DLC the game is just going to be amazing. 10/10 would play again... (I probably will another 200 times at least.)10
h yes i recommend this game very much it has about 10+ very good games for multiplayer like some of them are ExileAltis LifeArma Lifeetc there is alot of games or mods that people that have made that make the game amazing if you dont already have this game this is a game you should get it is well worth your money any of my friends that have this game would say the exact same thing. Also PS when you buy the game try to get the DLC with the game its like 25$ and its worth every penny of the DLC Thx10
Very enjoyable to say the least.
Love it. Hate it.
If you enjoy getting spawn killed then this is the game for you
rash You need to spend 10k $$ for new PC unless you want to play with 10 fps. Totally unrealistic  you basically need to hit someone like 20 times to kill him.-10
Worst game i ever bought! My Little Pony is even better!
eah this game is a waste of money if you only plan on buying the game without any DLC. Very few servers for people who own only the base game. Wish I could trade it in even for only $10. Disappointing.-10
ou buying tons of bugs with your money... have fun crouch bug door pass bug jump bug fps bug optimization 0 3 years past still tons of bug and 0 fixes do not buy thats all-10
ros: A best war simulation game (huge arsenal and vehicules) with a fun multiplayer (a lot of different mods and scenarios) watch a 33 things about  video. cons: the movements  healing animations is still sucks and sound of weapons still not sounds realistic.  recommend it to play.10
Not what i expected. What a waste of money.
he controls are very bad in this game the stamina has to be the worst a gun and a few mags after walking 20ft i have to stop because the guy is tired he's a soldier not a 90 year old man. Not realistic or game realistic tbh....-10
&lt;O_&lt;O get it or ill eat your puppy....
Best Game Ever Played!
this is a ing  game breaking point does not working for me gayness and you cant alt tab out cuz its ing  gaame.
This is the best millitary simulator since operation flashpoin. Game play takes in account many aspect of real world millitary scenario. Complex operations or just a simple single missions with tons of inventory and vehicles.
layed the first two missions; Super real and crazy fun it definitely caught me off guard. Gameplay time: 2 hrs.  Played Altis Life online; Got hacked and nuked wonder if I still have the 24M he gave me. Gameplay time: 42 mins.10
f you liked arma 2 you will like this game. If you havnt played an arma game i would definatly recomend watching a few videos to see what its like. Personally I would give it a 9/10.10
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE DEAD MAN. WE WERE IN THE HUMVEE AND OH GOD An APACHE CAME DOWN AND SHOT US ALL MAN. 'NAM WAS A CRAZY IN' PLACE MAN.
ery good FPS  Very teamwork orientated10
Not Call of Duty - Did a 720 quick-scope blaze it across Altis on the first try - 10/10
A2 OA is better than A3 but it isnt that bad at all.
o have fun in this game you MUST work with your teammates. Communication makes this game fun (or funny you'll meet great guys on this game). Going somewhere alone if the most boring expierence you'll have. Get to that city with all your teammates and find a town to take over plan your assault then execute. You might be able to get some good mods on this game too (Battle Royale Breaking point) that will only expand your game expierence. When you first start off your frames will be absolute crap google stuff to find fixes you just have to change some stuff in your game files. Stick to certain servers too. They may be the only ones with good frames/those cool guys you were playing with earlier.   All in all you gotta trust my review because i only write long reviews for games im passionate about.   Single Player: Creates that epic feel that multiplayer has with a story. 8/10 a little clunky  Multi-Player: Epic stuff. Great community. You can let that tactical guy out of you that says 'Tango' or 'Hostile' instead of enemy. 10/10  Mod support in-depth video settings.   Overall: 9/10 game. Does not deserve to sit in your library and rot.10
It is too lagy
one of the best pc games ever if people say there good at cod tell them to go die in a pit  is the best game ever its a must own the mod are good unsung is amasing it fu**ing nam opration trenchbucket is a halo mod its also very fun i would give this game a meme/10 (aka 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10)
 ?? ???????? ???? ?? ???????? ???? ?? ??????!10
his game is terrible you should totally play it!11
verview: Arma III such a beatiful game and it's also really fun!  Enjoy Arma as it is or try out one of it's many fantastic mods. Arma is known for modding in the community along with countless other addons to the game for free. The DLC for this game is fantastic and should really be considered when buying the game.  Overall I think Arma is a game that needs more contrIbuters and with that we could see many new exciting mods and gameplay that you can't find anywhere else. It's worth every dollar and even more worth it for the communiy gameplay that can come from it.  REVIEW: Arma is a beatiful game the graphics are fantastic and all. Although for $60 price tag you will need alot more than that if you are looking at running the game at a reasonable framerate and trying to insure that the game can look at its finest. Another fault of this game is the campaign boring and preety much a waste of time and resources by the developers. I believe the resources put into the campaign would have helped the multiplayer much more. Multiplayer what we are all here for right? The multiplayer aspect of this game is just briliant!  Is roleplay your thing running away from the cops or getting into high speed pursuits - growing cannabis or mining salt the roleplay game mods have it all. Or do you think you would enjoy king of the hill on a massive server and trying to control a centre objective with 3 small army's fighting to the last man to take control. I do think if you don't already own this game just get it!  8/1011
he good: 1. The foliage is fantastic. I swear my nose wrinkled and I almost had asthma from all the realistic grass and brush. 2. Uh... did I mention the foliage? If this was 'Foliage Simulator 2013' it would win awards.  If this was made into the next Fallout game and they let Bethesda fix everything I might be interested. I'd perhaps pay $5 to get through the campaign now that I've started it in the free weekend.  The Bad: Too many things to list. Far too many. Many great ideas almost none of them work out for the player. The inventory system is a nightmare. I wouldn't pay the -50% off price of $30 + DLC much less the full price of $60 + DLC.-11
bsolutely I recommend this game after you get passed the dlcs and the vanilla version of the game and you get into the mods on it. Because the vanilla version is kind of boring after a bit of time it’s not till you take the time to learn to use mods it then becomes a fun coop pvp pve or rpg (depending on the server you’re on and the mods you are using) game I personally have played in a long time. mods make the game 10x more entertaining and realistic if you use the right ones for example RHS which add a large variety of new guns and cars tanks helicopters. And if you do that the other dlcs are not as important I recommend getting them because there are cool and add some very nice gear and cars.10
he scale of this game is absolutely EPIC! And like nothing else I’ve played. The game engine is a great improvement over Arma 2 and looks every bit as good as Battlefield 3 &amp; 4 graphics but where this game really shines is its Modding support! Online mods like the day z and wasteland mods are such great fun and there are moments where you’re creeping through the woods or in valleys in the dark at night and you just feel this uneasy tension that you never know whose sights you could be in. I was a long-time fan of the Battelfield series but the DLC whoring has completely disenfranchised me from the series it came to a point where any time I just wanted a quick game with friends I was forced to download stealth DLC that I was never going to purchase and it stealing valuable HDD space therefore preventing me from playing at all even when 3 of us did have the latest patch 3 of us couldn’t play anything but vanilla due to the fact we all had different DLC.  ARMA3 has been a breath of fresh air to me with loads of content available from the modding community I may even start modding this game myself because they have provided modding tools and actually support the modding community and listen to their concerns and address things that need fixing Unlike other (we know better and are not interested game companies )  I can’t wait to see what awesome mods will come in the next few months.  10
team already askign for an  review.. well it's still downloading so I'd say it's going pretty good so far!10
is an amazing game with sprawling maps and enough content by default to provide hours of gameplay. But like every game in the ArmA series  really shines in the dedication of the developers and the unrelentless modding by the community. With thousands of mods to choose from and hundreds of different groups ranging from Realism to Island Roleplay  really has something to provide to everyone.  I rate this game a 9/10 Now my opinon is a bit biased due to my love of Military Sims but I think this is a fair rating due to the slight lack of content on release.10
Very good yesh
If you like Shooter games with diffrent game modes and the army theme then this is the game for you
Best game in the series. By far.
Needs about $30 worth of DLC to even play
ucks my out of shape soldier can only run like 50m before running out of energy starts crying and huffs and puffs. apparently he needs his 1sg to put a boot in his  during PT.-10
Just spent $4000 on a computer for this. It looks  amazing.
Best out of breath simulator ever!!!!
 really really wanted to like this game. It has a lot going for it but unlike the previous games they changed the damage model so that enemies take 4 body shots by an assult rifle to die and can take multiple shots to the head. You cannot change this in the options and I couldnt find a good mod to change it. Basically it went from a very realistic FPS to Call of Duty. What a bizzare decision for the devs to make.-10
 lot of potential for a good game but alas it is . Terrible campaign Horrible AI More bugs than there are types of insects. Clunky slow interface. Would not recommend getting this game to my worse enemy-10
The One and Only i can be a soldier without training feel the battlefield keep this game alive
ore than a game it's a platform! Lots of mods and addons. An amazin editor so you basically get infinite possibilities made by you or any of the talented people working on it.  If you like tactical shooters you'll like  just be patient let it sink into you try different modes and I'm sure you'll find something you like.  Make sure your computer can handle it (maybe check forums or ask around for other peoples computer specs).  10
This game is good but still buggy. It has  ton of good modes and things to do in this game but without mods this game would be aweful like with every arma game.
ne of the worst games I played evar. Buggy as  online full of  and poorly optimized-10
he game is really great for simulation in warfare A must buy!10
ood for Altis life little else to say thats good.-10
 have played over 1000 hours on arma and seen alot of thing but the ai never dull me its a really good game with some Glitchs but most you can live with i will really recommend this game to my friends and everyone interested in Shooter games10
very time me and my friends play something different happens we love it and i recommend you folks to get it too. :)10
Best war game of all time!!!! There is no better war simulator out there
 is the improved version of Arma 2. Even the fps is better than Arma 2. Rating 9/10 or 7/10 if you don't have a beastly PC.
mods make this game so difficult for any casual gamer to play multiplayer. if you dont want to spend 8 hours figuring out mods and launchers and servers and loading please avoid
dvantages: Great graphics nice gameplay well designed scenes replay value. Disadvantages: Unfriendly to newcomers difficult management.10
Best game ever on steam

this game is amazing. just buy it.
is the best game I have ever played. Probably because I was also playing Operation Flashpoint in 2001 and I have played all the new iterations of  since then.  What can I say about this game that already hasnt been said?  Well first and foremost join a community if you want to play the game with teamwork and a certain amount of realism.  Shameless plug here:  http://thetourforums.proboards.com/   The community I am in is called The Tour of Teamrespawn above is the link to our forums. We open the server to the public on a Friday and Saturday night usually around 19:00hrs ZULU.  By all means pop along and see what we are about but if you are a  be prepared to get banned :)  Just follow the rules of the server and ask questions players on the server will always help.  Anyway back to the game!  With the APEX expansion things have got really really tense. Patrolling through that jungle takes nerves of steel sometimes you cant see 5 yards in front of you and the enemy will pop out at any time and try to ruin your day. But with your team mates help we usually get through. The ambient sound also freaks you out as you think there is a wild animal coming towards you....  Just some things about Tanoa that I love!  Guys if you like military shooters and you dont like COD / Battlefield etc give this game a chance. It is usually lurking near or in the top 10 Steam charts so it's got to be good!  Buy it now dont wait for a sale this is the only game where I would say that!  Cheers for reading.  Dale10
Good range of game modes and it's always fun to play with mates. 8/10
he best military roleplay/action game that has ever been made if you are into military shooters or just fps in general you will love this game.10
oined a wasteland server met a guy screaming allah ak bar Kamakazied into blufor's base. 10/10 would jihad again.11
I played this game a little.. I think I like it.
Best Shooter EVER!!!!
F YOU DONT SEE WHY ARMA IS AWESOME STOP PLAYING COD10
for those people that are to fat to join the army and want to 'pretend' they are part of the army
My name is Melly from Melfarm
his game is a fine example of why you don't give me access to helicopters and big guns.  is a tactical FPS/TPS in which you shoot people with big helmets on. 11/10 go buy11
Like Skyrim with Iranian soldiers that 420 noscope you from a 1KM with a 9mm pistol they used their  to shoot with.
fter 2400 hours i can say: it's ok.10
It's going to be great game.
I love 12 fps.
has quickly become one of my favorite games ever with the massive selection of gamemodes to play it will keep you busy for a long time I am really glad I returned after upgrading because the frames are amazing now and it just makes the game so much more enjoyable but even back when I had 15-20 fps I still found it extremely addictive.   Leaving Arma 2 sucked but I have to say.. I don't really miss it this game is everything and better than Arma 2 was just make sure have a good PC before you buy this game.  9/10 - This game is really damn good and well worth the money.10
aving spend many hours in the buggy but innovative (at the time) Operation Flashpoint I took the opportunity to try  weekend deal for free. While being 2 minutes in the tutorial I somehow got my camera stuck I can only walk back and forward and turn my head. How to undo this: no fraking clue! Rage quit uninstalled and never ever going to install another Bohemia product on my PC.-10
 really like  and i think it has potential and it is such a great game!  However...  Pretty none of the servers aren't modded which is such a shame. The servers that aren't that modded require the dlcs...  5/10 Good potential and good base game but the servers are garbage-10
I get shot a lot. Brilliant game. 10/10
his game is sex 39.99 worth of hooker thar does not just last 1 hour.    I came multiple time...   DOWNLOAD EXILE MOD.10
When the  apex protocol came out my game started crashing
un in the forest for 3 hours get sniped simulator-10
est most realistic army game I have ever played. I strongly recommend this game to anybody who has a computer.10
This game is for people who has a lot of free time. Only training process takes hours and hours. Without training it's very difficult to play. I just start my training and understood that it will take a lot of time.  Not easy. Not so beautiful like on videos and photos.  Will deinstall without playing.
 did not have fun playing this game. I gave it a fair chance but the gameplay is just so mundane and mediocre that it was an effort to have fun even in the first few hours. There are better games out there to spend $60 on. If you are totally bored and you kind of like shooters or can get this game on sale ($10-$20) then buy it. In any other circumstance just pass it by.-10
This is the most bugged  i ever played. I absolutely don't recommend it.
reat game!  PROS:  - Great visuals - Very advanced tactical shooter - Many ways to play the game - Steam workshop gives this game unique content - Many great mods out there that will change your gameplay - Funn with friends in COOP missions  CONS:  - Buggy at sometimes - Low fps - APEX (apex added only TANOA everything else was added by modders a long time ago they just remade that in  quality)   Totally recommend this game!10
its nice
f your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place. It truly is amazing as I made it yesterday...  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter white sugar brown sugar water cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the crust is golden brown the caramel on the top crust is set and the apple filling is bubbling 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Oh And Acutally do buy this game.11
ery very very very very very very very very good game with nearly 700 hours on the game. I can recommend it to anyone who likes fun and non-optimized games. xd10
So much of my life wasted on this game... A must buy ..
Buy if u wanna play at that cinematic 24 fps and get DLC ads every two secs.  8/8 m8 would play again.
Great game !!!!!!!!
rma3 is typically a hardcore battle simulator.This is neither the game for COD players nor BF players.You experience battlefield of tensionyou go thru realistic military operationsbullets just graze thru your ears and irritating you just don know where it comes from.A lotta fun in coop missionsjust imagine you complete your work and pack up for next task point with your troops on humming bird see how cool is thator you can just walk alone to the task point like a sniper deep behind enemy lines.I love this game(simulator)but still need time to get the hang of it.10
ood game i recommend king of the hill game mode10
My Opinion
irst day on  Banned from 2 servers First one: Teamkilled 9 year old admin Second one: Going out on a mission to check and clear certain areas Gets in civilian truck and squad leader yells at me After that we go and shoot at some enemies I stay back so that i can drive a car I am blown up Respawn back at base while squad is landing in a chopper I get in a jeep and drive into the landing chopper also running over 3 people Admin curses at me and bans me forever  Best game 10/1010
Best game on steam.
*gets on hands and knees and begs* Play through the simulation training before trying to fly in multiplayer!  10/10 - Would die in a helicopter crash again.
ids who are pansies and would rather fire virtual guns than real ones - this is the game for you.-11
L;DR: Great game poor dlc model with intimidating features   Alright so this is a revision of my review about 5 or 6 months later Thus i will be resetting the votes to make this review more relevent and more truthful  So lets kick it off with the pros and cons  heres the pros  Dynamic and realistic gameplay Ok so heres some examples. realistic bullet physics. Fully funcional star map. Sound travelling  (If your 300 meters from an explosion you will only hear it when its too late). and fully funcional vehicles  Next pro is the arsenal. you have around 50 weapons at your disposal which are fully customizeable with attachments. and thats not even counting mounted options like HMGs and Mortars.  Lots of control. If you can do it in real life theres probably a button for it in arma. theres even a salute button  Pleanty of vehicles. theres Tanks IFVs Helicopters Jets Submarines Cars APCs Drones and more to play around with in arma   Now lets go over some cons  Its Really intimidating. this tacks onto one of the pros. theres lots of buttons to memorize and keep handy because you are going to need them ready for combat  Its expensive. Arma is an expensive game to buy but is also time expensive as you will need about a week or so to learn what everything does all of the buttons ECT  And finally we touch base on the DLC and the rather poor way it is presented. The DLC is not presented well. for instance. if your playing on a wasteland server and see a go kart but dont own the Karts DLC. well  you because you cant drive it. or if you try to spawn in a helicopter in editor from helicopters and you dont own it. same issue. cant ing drive it   Final verdict is Nutrel (Leaning a bit twards positive)  The game is amazing but the poor DLC model drags it down for me even though i own the dlc.  If your willing to give it some time to learn and make the investment you will love it10
y far my favorite Multiplayer game someone should make a 'Saving private Ryan' mission! :D10
i love it bay it its not mutch mony
is a good war 'simulator' A lot of people think 'Its just a Game' NO! It's different  a lot of people dont like it Cause is realistic the fact that is simulating perfectly the 'WAR' You cant Defeat a Tank alone... Like could be in Battlefield series. You cant Flame on Camping snipers Because is 'War' in the War all is permitted. The map locationAmbientBuildingetc. The ambient is really good and Make become all Tactic and Difficult. You can also use tactical Movement Like: crawlCrouchSideCrawletc. There are a lot of Modes: King of the Hill ExileAltis Life and more modesmissionetc. in the Workshop. just go checkout.  Vote 10/10 .10
ote that I'm a person who is tactical with shooters. I don't play COD because you run around like a chicken with it's head cut off with no regard to getting killed. with that noted please read on.  Yeah I can't say I really enjoy this game. I know I know but seriously. I dumbed down the AI to the lowest possible and they still kill me at a good distance. I don't expect to get close to them like COD (Note I don't play COD much) but this is just Overkill. They can spot you even when your in hiding behind VERY thick shrubs where even YOU can't see them. I'm more of a tactical guy and I enjoy taking my time but this.......I shoot their head flinch. they shoot my head RIP. Simulation my . If I hit your neck or the head or even the face for that matter you are ing DOWN. I've made it pretty far in this game and my patients has just run dry. Even your character is grunting all the damn time as if he was beating off in the battlefield. Even I know that if your in the battlefield by yourself knowing that your pretty much surrounded by enemies you don't grunt even when your laying down. I understand the breathing yes but grunting no.  Guns push back yeah? I fired a rifle before while hunting. It kicked back. note that the recoil for you is kind of understandable. You shoot it recoils adjust etc. The AI don't have a ing recoil. Note that I'm at a good distance. I don't do meters or anything but the Bot I was shooting was at rather a good distance. You aim down sights zoom a bit and you can make out a head. small but visibly noticable. As we engage each other I'd like to point out I have single fire shots. I like to conserve bullets and I need to ajdust a little (very little) for every shot (Full-Auto recoil is rather intense) but nothing to complain about. Why is it that every shot and mind you that the percision for these ers are down to a flat 0 along with skill being at a flat 0 that I still get hit way more often. I shoot the bot three in the head (face) gave up on face and five times in the chest which is where a lot of pading is so I understand a bit more bullets are needed but instead of him dieing and simply flinching I keel over.  Heres my recent situation that I had that made me say  it. I'm crawling in to a camp yeah. Nice slowly not to alarm anyone. Of course no one is in sight I say again NO ONE WAS IN SIGHT. So I decide to lay down and catch some breath so my stamina bar fills so I can run if need be. Theres a large vehicle transport and under it I see a Bot FACING AWAY and the only thing noticable are the legs no waist line. I move back a bit to get some distance but in that moment the bot immediatly faces me no turning is noticable and I'm running at 60frames per second shoots twice and I'm dead. How in the hell do you shoot through a vehicle!? How did the bot hear me laying down that instance and not when I'm sneaking. The bot was close enough to hear anyone walk. How does it not need to kneel down in order to shoot me and HOW DOES IT KNOW MY EXACT LOCATION!!???   This isn't limited to the vehicle people no matter where you hide they see you and will shoot and kill you with persicion. even if their percision is dead smack ing ZERO!!!! none of this  simulates real combat. You aren't required to have experienced field combat to know how  this is. shooting through a vehicle. spotting you even though you can't even ing see them not to mention they don't have recoil.  I have spent the past 4 damn hours trying to complete a single damn side quest. once again I'm a person who is tactical with shooters. I don't play COD because you run around like a chicken with it's head cut off with no regard to getting killed. I always lose in pvp due to the fact that I'm cautious. I'm sure as hell a lot better with Rainbow Six Siege and battlefield I have some moments but not like Rainbow Six. I don't usually complain about shooters and I'm quite competent at shooters I may not a pro or like someone who invests hours upon hours of their life into the game but that doesn't mean I don't know how to play a shooter game. I love how deep this game gets but the level of how unfair and the kind of bugs this game has does NOT make it enjoyable.   Maybe the multiplayer is great but thats something I don't really buy the games for. I don't have time to go against people who are able to spend hours on this game being much more competent at this game than me. So if your looking for a Multiplayer review Your not gonna get it here. If your looking at the game for campaign experience just move on or wait till it gets cheaper Unless you like spending countless hours on a single mission and rarely advance.-10
he game is great.  Realism clans are terrible unless you find the perfect one.  In my case i joined a clan everything was going smooth for 2 weeks then out of nowhere i was banned from the clan website all tags and statuses removed from their teamspeak servers and wasnt allowed to appeal my ban (which i still have no idea why I was banned)  TLDR: Great game  community.-10
The best war simulator
ou might get some hours out of this game not too sure yet though. I'll get back to you.11
f you like try hard games please by this game you'll be so happy and excited through every playing moment If you're not a try hard avoid this games campaign its anoying and filled with  moment after  moment where you get dropped in the mosted screwed up moment with no help no idea what your doing(If you've never played this series before) and no notice that you are in a silently dangerous area. I understand the issues of not being able to see your enemies or whose shooting at you and even the fact that 1 bullet to the head is insta kill. Things I don't understand...WHY THE HELL CAN I ONLY SAVE ONCE PER MISSION? it makes no sence I'd like to beat the game not get screwed 1000 times before doing so. Yes I understand there are multiple missions where this stuff doesn't happen but no I don't think saving should be restricted.-10
is a military sandbox with some realistic elements.  Pros: -Unique gameplay -Large maps -Mods (recommend CUP and NIArms) -Scenario editor and 'VR' room  Cons: -Laggy/unoptimized engine most severe issue -Buggy -General lack of content and quality compared to Arma 2 not considering mods11
ood game that i do not own buy me it ;)11
ood game but you'll need to buy 2-3 dlc to play online. &amp; it puts alot of stress on laptop (js)10
as okay. Since update it won't load. Can't be bothered. It's too slow to get into the game when it does work. Uninstalled. Maybe they will fix it one day.-11
Arma otherwise known as asthmatic jogging simulator. Is a very good bad game 7/9 would maybe install again
 honestly feel kind of ashamed that I have played over 1600 hours in this game and have yet to review it. I was a major fan of Arma 2 and while my steam profile doesn't show it I logged thousands of hours into it and it's expansions. Needless to say when  was announced and eventually given an Alpha release I was day one. Even with the performance problems I was experiencing I was having a blast. Once I upgraded (CPU only) my performance increase by more than I could think to measure. That's not to say everything with the game is perfect.  I'll start with the guns. They're not terrible but I'm not a huge fan of the models (Katiba or the MX). The only one I KINDA liked was the MX SW. The Abr is really nice but I was missing my favorite 5.56 models. Like the M4. Or the 416. However with the recent Apex expansion they've added weapons in called the Spar-16 which basically looks just like a 416.   Speaking of Apex I gotta mention that a lot of people have stated they could not play multiplayer with servers running Apex. This is plain false. Bohemia has had a long standing policy of not separating the population with DLC. The only part of Apex that would keep anyone from playing on a server is the map. Considering how many maps exist for  you would be hard pressed NOT to find a server running a different map. To an extent you can even use the weapons or attachments from the DLC but this is primarily meant for people to check them out. After a few moments an advert for the DLC will come across the screen.   Now to performance. People do still suffer with frame rate issues and it can be frustrating believe me. There are a lot of guides out there on how to increase it. Those guides have helped a lot of people and there still exists a lot of people it does nothing for. Single player generally runs great for people but on multiplayer it rears its ugly head. The problem being here that performance isn't solely placed on your rig. The servers rig needs to be able to push what it's trying to do while Arma juggles all the things that it does on such large maps. Some game modes will be worse than others and this isn't to say the problems with performance rest solely on the server or your PC. But it's something to take into account as well.  From my own personal experience I was originally running an AMD 8 core processor at like 2.5 ghz I think it was. 8gb of standard ram and a Nvidia 660ti. Regular 3tb hdd. I bought a new motherboard and case with the i7 4770 3.4 ghz. With the AMD I had MAYBE 10-15 fps on Stratis alone or with a handful of people practically doing nothing. The i7 alone I saw an increased gain. On stratis full server at the heart of a battle I was maintaining 30fps on ultra. Lot of people might think that's nothing great but from just upgrading my CPU it was quite an increase. Since then I've moved up to 16gb of Ripjaw (I think that's the name) ram and in November I'm finally upgrading from my 660ti to the 1080. What I currently have I never dip below 30 fps on a full server and often times I see it get up to 40-50.   All that said everyone is going to have a different experience in this game. It's not easy and there's a good learning curve. Tons of keys to remember. Even coming from Battlefield it might be hard for new players to understand just how big Altis is. Hell even Stratis. I've played everything from coop missions on to king of the hill altis life wasteland breaking point epoch Exile and much more. I've spent so much time doing all these different things I still haven't beaten single player yet.  The last thing I gotta mention is the workshop or even armaholic. At either place you can find missions new units weapon packs of all kinds gear packs and the list goes on. There is so much here. I wish I could begin to describe just how much is available from people who poured their time and passions into. Even if you don't own the game you could go look at the workshop just to get an idea of what all is there.   TL;DR This game is fun and frustrating at differing times. If you want something new and challenging I can't recommend this more.10
 dont know where to start with  really. Amazeing GraphicsweaponryMilitary Simulation in future I highly reccomend you getting  if your looking for Strategic fun.3PSFPS and best yet is the Atmosphere and Land Scape. Only downside to this game i find heartbreaking(figurtivly) is the matter of fps issues but when it works properly it is a very fun and awesome experiance to encounter in Arma series. I would defeinetly recommend .10
Loveing the time ive put into it so far. The air vehicles are the best so far.
A must have for pc owners
Just finished bootcamp.. meh.
reat game 10/10 recomend this to everyone after about 1200 hours on the game i can definatly say its worth the money10
est milsim outthere until squad gets it's  togetherother than that devs should really focus on making the vanilla game really good on (arma 4) because you can't play  vanilla cause all there is to play is mods .10
o not buy this game there are hackers everywhere and the developers will eat your children and they support ISIS. They also don't care about black people.-11
its what you would expect from any military simulator game
retty fun playing this on my laptop from 1996 and it runs at 4k 60fps easy.10
ery difficult to learn if you just want something like cod or battlefield dont get. 8.3/1010
this game sucks
Playing missons with my friends in this game were some of the funnest experiences ever. Punishing but fun as can be 10/10
uy game get spammed with messages to buy DLC.11
ame that will make you spend houndreds of hours trying to get Air cav on horn or emergency evac chopper to come to rescue you  or even arty barrage to support your full - scale advance into enemy territory.But dont be like me.This game is awsome but its NOT OPTIMAZED AT ALL!!! Engine is just builled in that way and fixing that would take a lot of time.I have crappy PC so I have 15-20 FPS bec I was fool and bought it.BUT if you have strong beast you will have no problem and you will enjoy this game in its full beauty.10
Very well worth the price!
un game when played however in the few weeks i owned it due to the largeness of the game its prone to errors. after a bit of delving into the first error i managed to fix it however the second error is inrepairable meaning i have lost 30pounds plus 20 pounds dlc all due to the insecurity of the files. therfore would not reckomend.-10
 have only payed for ARMA games since 2001 'operation flash point'  was and will be the last I will ever pay for! All my custom missions' work' for all the other games!   Since  since the updates all older missions I made no longer work in   so the 8- 12 hours spent making every mission I made = a waste of time!  I find this appalling I will never PAY for this gama again!!-10
f you have the computer to run it prepare to have the best time of your life. I have played Arma 2 since 1 year ago dayz mod and other server just make me smile. Memories of executing Russians with Norwegian guys. Running over people with cars and dying from hilarious bugs. Arma 2 was amazing. Later on I got  every penny of the 60 bucks it cost this game was worth it. It is so far my favorite game and when you play with others you will create memories that you will never forget. Lets just say  is the best game I have ever played and I've played a lot of games.11
he Game has come a very long way since early access and it's now nicely optimized. At least they learned and listend to the actual community unlike some early access games that are in early access limbo ughuh (DayZ)10
Very hard but fun
 is harder than life.
ver wanted to experience modern combat with 100 people with tanks helicopters and jets? Well you can experience what it feels like to experience it through a slide show.   is a game definitely worth playing if you love first person shooters but you will need a good rig to get the most out of it. Its game engine is based on mainly cpu power so an i7 or a high i5 is essential. Previously with an i5 4679k and a gtx 970 I was getting 30 fps on a server and if I was lucky 35 fps. When I upgraded to an i7 6700k this became much better it may not sound like much but I had a 20-30 fps increase and was getting closer to 60 fps which improved gameplay dramatically.  Pros: -Unlimited content with a vast modding community and dlcs  -Unlimited player content on the workshop with scenarios -Many gamemodes and servers such as King of the Hill and Altis Life -Vast range of weapons gear and vehicles which can be increased through mods -Constant updates and patches are released  Cons: -Poor engine so performance will be horrific on most systems -Steep learning curve on certain mechanics -If your expecting constant fast pace action like in COD or battlefield you will have to learn what patience is10
10/10 would murder spouse again
not as good as 
Game is not what i expected. Total waste of money.
one of the best fps games out there
I really don't like this game. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a successful life.
ot only did i play single player modes and scenarios for countless hours while only getting more excited about this game literly plays how you want it. If you want it to be the single handed most realistic military sim it will be that for you. If you wanna get creative and have a hellish zombie horde goin down it will achieve your satisfaction... AND THEN you finaly play online and meet some cool dudeS who wanna role play this mil sim and you play your first scenario lets say a sniper recon mission for 5 hours callin out cordinates and speaking mil chatter through your mic you will find out that playing games for hundreds of hours does in fact not get old but yet more tastful.10
This is a great game you can not go wrong.
ON'T BUY THAT GAME !! Battleye will global ban you for nothing and you will be banned from all server for nothing and you will have to create another account to buy it with 60$ again  only if you throw money from the windows because its the same thing  its disgusting to do that  the game telling us to leave our account and buy the game 2 time  good job Bohemia you introduce this  (Battleye) to your game to ban all player of your game for no reason and win 2x of money for telling to player to buy it again and again ...-10
Dis be aight
It was a bad investment you ask why? well the frames per second were below average even when set at low settings maybe they need to optimize the game a little more i don't know. My recommendation is if you don't have a up to par gaming PC don't buy it.
Well good... Recommended
ive been playing arma 2 for about 6 years and this game killed the fun for me. great visual and weapon modifications. however its unplayable in this state and has be for some time.
ery nice very good very fun very cool10
yes its good but for some reson my pc does not want to run t over 10 fps no clue
f you live simulator games like GTA and DayZ and stuff of that sort you will love this game. I have clocked almost 1000 hours into it and I don't regret it. Its got endless things to do with mods Altis Life Battle Royale Breaking Point and tons more. 10/10 BUY THIS GAME WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY.10
really good game lots of cool fetures i think that if i play this to mutch it will get to a point to where i wont stop  i recemend you buy it   i like it
just purchased this game on Dec 26 2014   - Digital Deluxe Edition does not work on my I7 PC and the game keeps crashing I would like my funds returned to my account on steam.
You can race go-karts. 10/10
his game is aiming to be as realistic as possible with everything about war. It tries to concurent Battlefield (which concurents Call of Duty). That's a huge +  What counter's my positive review is the fact that on either default or lowest settings my FPS cannot exceed 20!  You probably should not buy this game unless you have the highest level of the high-end gaming monsters.-10
ITS SO LAGGY!!!! i even have a really good gaming pc and its still laggy i only get like 4 or 5 fps
f you like milsim style games then this one is for you.  To start off let's talk about the graphics. This game has incredible graphics yet still is able to run well on lower end systems. It is obvious they spent alot of time optimizing this game compared to the earlier game in the series Arma 2. I find that you can play with almost any video settings and this game will look amazing either way. They even put SMAA in the game which is the 'upgraded' version of FXAA. Some say that SMAA is beter but it is all just personal preference.   Next let's talk about gameplay. The gameplay is very fun and addicting in this game. The animations are stellar the gunplay is very fun (and alot better than Arma 2s gunplay) combat flows very well. The damage weapons deal seems to be pretty accurate just like the earlier Armas with most of the guns taking 1-3 shots to kill. The maps and AI are incredibly well designed.   Finally mods. The mods in this game like Arma 2 are still amazing. Breaking Point Epoch King of the Hill and Battle Royale are all amazing mods to play with friends or by yourself. Although they still have to better optimize multiplayer as ping and fps are suprisingly low in multiplayer the flow of battle and co-op capabilities are endless.     Overall this game is so worh $40. Bohemia did an amazing job on this one and it is surely gonna get better!10
ealistic hardcore battle simulator. Not for the easily bored. A+10
Can't play multiplayer. Many people has the same problem. I just bought this and it doesn't work.. Just freezes when you try to look for servers.. Money WELL SPENT !
BEST GAME IN THE WORLD and i dont own it :[
is definitely one of the best shooters out there. Such a step up from ARMA 2. It still has bugs and content is still being rolled out but it's a beautiful looking game and plays smoothly. Negative reviews being posted about the game 'running like ' are just people's poor computers. Definitely recommended. 9.5/1010
 personally think  is a terrible game and a waste of my money. The campaign is dreadful and the multiplayer is worse.  You can never seem to get a game on multiplayer and when you do you're usally kicked from the server. Campaign... you constantly die and the AI do nothing but also die so you're usaally on your own against an enitre army. This game is not what i expected and no where near what i wanted i wasted £25 on this game.-10
his is the gripping story of a boy and his beloved dog 'Dog'. The story takes place in medival US when President Nixon was a stablehand in the Angarville Castle. We get an unparralelled experience of frienship and eventually love that transcend boundaries as species and gender. Truly heartwarming!10
t game. It takes a whole mag to kill someone and it takes on bullet to the knee for you to get instantly killed. And evey Altis life server is t.
this game is so laggy when i played this game i thought  life was in the game already  but this game is ed up lol jks peace :P
reat game lots of fun with all the different game types! 8/10 would recommend10
 really hate this game because minecraft is better.-10
MAKE THE GAME ING STABLE.
Its a very realistic Simulator one of the best and with pretty grapics but with its price i would only recommend this game to people who will play it often
such a great game it's online gameplay can really take skill every time you play it's a different experience i love it!!!
lenty of fun mods and gameplay I would enjoy playing this with anyone.10
I have just bought the game installed it opened the game and was global banned for no reason terribal game
Game of the year 2013-2014 imo
h Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead  Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter plus more as needed  Now to make it 1. In a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit or chocolate chips nuts etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more being careful not to burn toppings.10
this game is op plox nerf
Waste of money too complicated for how much it costs.
good game! graphs astounding and gameplay quite good;) much better than any battlefield series!!!  bom jogo!! graficos fora de serie e jogabilidade bastante boa ;) muito melhor do que qualquer battlefield series!!!
Awsome game full of action and fun.
wesome gameplay awesome maps!10
This Game Is Mint! Tactical gameplay...
irst off there is not at all as much content as there was in arma 2. Now that that's out of the way  sports amazing graphical settings beautiful terrain and well modelled vehicles weapons and everything else. If you want to mess around in the editor and do god knows what else Arma 2 is where you want to go. If you want to make good missions taking minimal time and effort while still making an experience that sets itself apart from others  is the game for you.   Reccomending this game really dependson how you want to play this game: A pro or a playful guy who likes to crash a helicopter into his friends. If you're the playful guy go to arma 2.10
best game in the world extremely tactical and sometimes more ummm... different but all over it is just an amazing ngame to play wth freinds my strong recomendations for !!
 was running this game at like 2 fps but wait i forgot i have a  computer. So i ran it at low graphics and i got 10 fps then i wasted my whole night getting fps boosters so i got like 12 fps. 0/10 - Need Minecraft Graphics - Ign10
This games interface is horrible it is not intuitive or natural by any means. Would have loved it if the interface was more like Battle Field 4. Also the game feels very choppy and I am not referring to frame rate. I guess you either love this or hate it do not think this is anything like any other shooter game. I am sure the game will appeal to fans of the previous releases but at this stage I feel like I wasted my money
I got global banned from both  and DayZ SA because I piked up hacked money in an Altis life server. Complete 
 did enjoy the gameplay and story of the game and i'd definetly play another sequel. It was worth the purchase.10
reat fun some good mods10
t's overall not a bad game but for the price I wouldn't recommend it.  Pros:  * Beautifully detailed world spaces teeming with wildlife * Extremely large maps make for fun and challenging combat as well as virtual site seeing * A nice assortment of weapons and equipment to choose from   Cons:  * Poor help system and no tutorial for new players - One was later added but it was not super useful * Overly complicated and over numbered controls with a large portion of the keyboard being used as well as the mouse * Poor sound effects; especially for guns * For as detailed as the world and NPCs are the guns seem to overall be lacking in both function and appearance * Although certainly more realistic than most FPS games the fatigue system is a little troublesome considering how large the world is and how far you often need to travel from objective to objective without a vehicle. Even walking with an average amount of gear can almost completely stop your progress fairly fast forcing you to stop and rest   Overall score from 0 to 10 10 being the best: 5-6-10
is truly the next Gen in war simulation the community for it is large with many mods to choose from why wouldnt you play arma?10
top fun game to play coop on
eally great game! better than the last and really worth the money!10
 play this game more for the mods than anything else really. Mod-wise it's cool. BREAKING POINT!!!10
It's better than Bad Rats. You know you want it.
reat game even better that daniel doesn't have it!10
great game if you like simulated army games
ESYESYES - I NEED THIS! Tried it for the free part and it was AWESOME! Tons of things to do and the showcases were cool just watch out because it's very CPU intensive and is more single-threaded. Sorry AMD FX Cpus10
Brilliant Military Sandbox. Don't let the crappy trailer fool you. this game kicks .
THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EIPC MAKE MORE UPDATE BEST GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Buy this game or die trying!
utstanding game with open environment and wide option of completing the mission.10
his is the perfect game for people who have always taken themselves to seriously when playing shooters and casuals alike. It's hard to pick up but once you get the hang of the shootsing mechanic and slight lag issues kills become very satisfying10
ook a while to get used to but then really got fun many different game modes and lots of experiences to be had!10
Peach farming and hiking simulator 2015.
cant play free weekend cause a bug .... if i open the game it just open an emty steam window-.-
un to play (with friends) even if you're new to these militairy simulation games. Editor is so fun to mess around with and the community is one of the best!10
ell what can i say massive mp game this is what u are looking for alot of actioncarstankhelis all that u need10
awsome ame
Great game! Probably the closest you will get to a Military Simulator.
eli if u are reading this  you and this game is great
one of the best games i have played
It was` Free Week-end` when i fall in love with this game. But i can`t aford it !
! ! !
 is a good game for everyone who likes the feeling of beeing in a warzone or just a solider driving cars and flying planes all around the map makes it a fun game that is hard to get sick of
I have never played this game but Steam still wanted me to write a review. I give this game a 0\0
Great Game...
antastic but unfortunatly you need to find a good group to play with but worth it all the same.10
Cool Cool 10/10
the war game of my dreams.
 little fusterating at first but once you get the hang of its alot of fun i had to re-bind some of the keys to make me more comfortable but other then that i love this game!!!!10
fter getting towed by a heli and dropped from 300m in a armored vehicle to then bounce off the surface of the ocean and hit the heli descending to see what happend to me i can recommend this game.  11/10 would get towed again10
Got in a truck. Didn't have a wheel. 10/10 game.
1/10 would play arma 2 again.
I love the realism and the many game modes! And there are so many awesome workshop scenarios.
ery fun but you ned a CRAZY computer to play also not a wide selection of cars wich is why alot of people deciced to play A3L so that they got a better RP emperience 10
put this game on sale again do it NOW please now DO it ple
Why can't  be simble to play with friends or remotely. This rarely works. I followed step by step with the ports and ip address. The firewall has been turned off.  any advice?
I want my money back !
nly played this a couple of hours. I'd say it's all right. Yeah probably recommend it.10
This is a great game and i think that you should play this game. This game has fun multiplayer and has mods like battle royel and atlis life.
If only this was set in an uncivilised country like Canada or Sesame Street and I could slay the queers and hang them from the back of my pickup and drive down a road in Pakistan.
 cannot recommend this game for it is virtually unplayable. That is multi player is very much broken. It is so badly optimized you only get maybe 20-30 fps playing it even with new nVidia GTX-980 you get low fps. And it doesn't matter if you lower the graphics has no affect. Which is sad 'cause this game has good potentials. I really wish it was playable but it just isn't. Maybe if you have 10 GTX titan cards...-10
an play as goat 11 out of 10 would reccomend to local radiator10
I've only played this in wasteland but i would say it is amazing.
 didn't know what to write about in my review so here's a recipe for pancakes instead:  1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon white sugar 1 1/4 cups milk 1 egg 3 tablespoons butter melted  1. In a large bowl sift together the flour baking powder salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.  2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.10
ecent game but rather shabby compared to arma 2 devlopers cud of done much better stuf but decided not to i cud of done much better job-10
 will review this in the form of a story and let you decide for yourself whether this seems like the kind of game for you.  I was playing the Dynamic Universal War System a scenario that puts you into either a random spawn zone or a zone you have chosen and then spawns bases for you to assault. (It's installed using the workshop.)  I had a fairly large group of allied soldiers a 'super squad' if you will consisting of me a medic an autorifleman and a sniper. (All units listed in here are AI.) This was a nighttime operation the first assault on a major enemy base I had ever done. We had a task force consisting of about 6-7 soldiers following behind us moving to back us up but they were about a kilometer away (and running) when we reached the hostile zone and disembarked from our truck.  We disembarked and began moving into the zone on foot and before long ran into our first enemy patrol heading in our direction. We saw them before they saw us and I had the idea to ambush them. There was a small shack to our right so I began positioning my troops around one side putting the sniper on the left side of the road so that we would be firing from two different directions and catch the enemy troops in between us.  I had just moved my last soldier into position when I heard the loud  bang  of a sniper round being fired. There went my perfect plan. I had forgotten to tell my troops to hold their fire so now the enemy knew exactly where we were. I took cover behind the shack as my troops continued to lay down fire desperately trying to take out the enemy now that our only advantage the element of surprise was lost. The enemy soldiers outnumbered us by a large amount; there was at least 8 possibly more and I was still new at the game so I was worth about 1/2 of a regular soldier especially since my computer was fairly laggy back then (this game is NOT a game for low end computers.)  My sniper got taken out first. I heard my character call for a sitrep from the sniper which in this game means your AI allies are as good as dead your character just can't see them. The patrol was steadily advancing toward us still fairly numerous and still extremely dangerous. My autorifleman got tagged next and then it was just me and the medic crouching behind a tiny shack. I used one of my supports that I had purchased earlier in the campaign to call in a helicopter but it would still take some time for it to appear and land we just had to hold out until it did.  The patrol was at the other side of the building by the time the medic got taken out. They had been advancing fairly quickly as they fired moving around us encircling us. Once the medic went down it was just me. I heard the helicopter's blades chopping the air in the distance but knew it wouldn't land in time. Many of them were coming around the corner so I sprayed desperately taking two of them down the others being more careful and staying further back. The medic had been guarding the other side of the building and I realized that it was completely unprotected moments before I got a bullet to the back of the head managing to take down one more attacker.  I heard the sound of the helicopter's side door gunners firing and looked up to see the tracer rounds disappearing over the roof of my tiny shack. The helicopter landed almost daintily and I made a mad dash for the open door hoping to get inside tell them where to go and gtfo. During the dash I took a bullet to the leg and became unable to run. So there I was walking towards the helicopter being EXTREMELY lucky that no bullets were hitting me. By some miracle I managed to get to it climb aboard.... and then the world went black as an explosion deafened me.  In a last ditch effort to take me out one of the hostiles had thrown a grenade. The helicopter was unharmed but I was toast. But that didn't matter to me. All of this happened in like ten minutes if that but it felt like longer. I may be playing it up a tad (this happened a while ago and the mind has a tendancy to make things seem more awesome than they actually are) but I do remember the feeling of 'holy hell.... that actually just happened.... That was freaking awesome.' that hit me as I watched the death information appear on screen. It's a feeling I'm not sure I'll ever forget.  This game has its issues like any other but I personally believe it's a good buy. You may not have my exact experience but you'll make your own and they may be twenty times as epic as mine. You may end up clearing a city using just your teeth and a dead rabbit or maybe an A-164 Wipeout jet dispensing freedom down on those evil village dwellers. It's up to you.  Disclaimer: Game does not include using teeth and dead rabbits to kill enemies. Game does however include using A-164 Wipeout jets the most beautiful of the weapons to dispense freedom and democracy upon those (probably) communist pigs. I mean just look at this: (Note: These guys ARE using weapon and armor mods as well as a map mod but the A-164 is pretty much the same)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5d5qAiU1Ww 10
kay I honestly love this game it runs grate grahpics are nice and game play is the same  cons: Altis is a little to big and all but its still works.  Physics engine CAN make MRAP's go into the air. DLC's that you haft to pay for to use (honestly doesn't mader the choppers and guns are nice... karts tho are fun to uses) Pros:  Massive amount of things to do. lots of hours of play time with or without friends Lots of servers that may or maynot fit your style of play Over all fun game  Not much of Pros and cons but to wrap it up. There are a LOT of good game modes to play altis life city life wasteland KOTH and even get wrecked (not many people play it would recomend having friends to play with). So over all score? 9.5/10. Some things can be changed around a little does need more ground transport and logistics. But thats mainly it guns are fully customisible don't even need the marksmen DLC to use the bipods so win win?  Would I recommend this game hell yes.10
reat tactical game to play with buds singleplayer was even hard for me -- but it makes up with great downloadble gamemodes Breaking Point Epoch Altis :D10
Best game i have played for a long time!!!
........
 massive upgrade over Arma 2 in the technical department although the 'near future' setting does feel somewhat out of place for a game series beloved for its realism. Regardless Moding community+steam workshop means that with only a few clicks you can make sure that you can use every 20th century firearm and vehical rendered in loving detail without ever having to use the near future stuff. Also Bohemia has awesomely made all arma and arma 2 content open source with the release of  so basically the entire arma series is now available to play through in the  engine.10
Do you like hiding in bushes for very long hours... Because i sure do.
hen Battlefield gets realistic and Call of duty loses it competitveness you get  the loss in potential in the multiplayer make me want to cry unfair severs hosted by randomers; each with its ridulous rank system. Okay the graphics look amazing but not all of us have a intel i10 processor with 10 GB nvidia graphics card.  The controls are over the top and abnoxious; I dont want to remember what every keyboard does I want to play! So the campain nice but not all that enjoyable when its just go from A to B then trying to shoot some guy while your having hyperventilating.  Overall I think this game is over the top and too focus on realism to the point were gameplay sucks.-10
It's a great game. With all of the different gamemodes you will not go bored.
buying this game for $59.99 is literally my biggest regret on a steam purchase to date.    What a complete mess.
f you are looking for an accurate and realistic millitary simulatorthis game is for you! The campaign is exelently executedleaving you on edge at every moment.The multiplayer is where this game really shinesas it offers various tactical game modesin whitch you work together or against players from all around the world! 9.5/1010
reat Game 10/10 would buy again10
really good lots of fun.
Perfect for realistic warfare
goodgame when they finish it
Has Mods. Thank God.
 this expensive
I want this
 is a very buggy game but overall it is the best FPS shooter there plus there is free mods released nearly every week for the game and they cost nothing
this game is  waste of space
This game can get very repetitive at times and is still needs alot of patches but i would like it more if it had s big updste
  a lot of walking tactical etc. fun.  but the ridiculously mind blowingly stupid AI is so stupid that u wont believe it. do i also need to wipe their rear after they take a dump? it's stupid like hell.  when in danger they cant even run they'll just act smart (even though they're stupid as hell) and walk 'tactically' even though they'll be cut down in no time. these stupid crap cant even take cover properly and stand in the middle of the street. never mind about the cover they cant even follow the player properly.  bloody disgustingly stupid. stupid. stupid. stupid. stupid.  as it stands the AI are just virtual meat shields. i have never completed a mission without all of the STUPID AI dead. and they deserve it for being so mindblowingly and disgustingly stupid.  i only wish that the body parts are detachable in  so that i can view their stupid dismembered corpses because they're so bloody disgustingly stupid that make u go WTF all the time. whenever the AI i lead dies i say 'yeah f u u deserve it. i hope u burn in virtual hell and i hope it also hurts like hell.'  leading the AI is worse than babysitting where the player being the babysitter has to resist the temptation of emptying the entire magazine into their stupid faces every single second of the game.  i hope somebody makes a mod to turn all the AI on the player's side into clowns. because that is exactly wat they are.   ---  now that i got that off my chest time for the actual review. as the story goes the year is 2035... but the NATO forces still wear the old school camouflage. damn stupid decision not to give everyone pixelated uniforms.  also year 2035 where's the TALOS suit? where're the high tech gadgetry that u'd expect? FLIR goggles? NOPE. everything's the same as the 80s or 90s except now u have rifles with different names that's all.  the explosives in the game are totally useless against infantry because there's no chance in hell u'll kill the AI with it. the splash damage is too small damage is too little and this is totally stupid because  claims to be a military simulator. i've been to grenade ranges and let me say that the ballistic glass more than 100 metres away is full of marks from the fragmentation of the grenades. wat do u think that'd do to weak flesh and bones? according to ARMA nothing or nothing a simple first aid cant fix.  oh and lets not forget that every injury can be patched up and the character returned to normal function after some first aid. HA. and u call this a military simulator? total nonsense. this is also why i want to be able to blow limbs off in ARMA. the injury system is STUPID just like the AI. well beside the cool factor of seeing somebody cut into half after getting hit or become a red smear on the floor after getting run over by a tank or have his arm hanging by the skin after getting hit etc. u may say that im being graphic but let me just say that this is supposed to be a military simulator and therefore there is absolutely no need for any type of sanitisation. if anything these are features that were overlooked by developers and needlessly accepted by the ARMA community.  and how come the 'war' is fought by so few soldiers? doesnt make any bloody sense... and where the hell are the civilians again? empty template buildings everywhere. wtf. they could at least spawn some civilians dynamically to keep up the pretenses. and the level designer should go and figure out how many soldiers fght in wars coz the numbers are definitely not so damn low.  anyway   if u want to have fun play multiplayer (but then there're concerns with cheating).  if u want future soldier combat stuff as u'd expect in the year 2035 stay the hell away.  if u want to play single player only forget it. it'll only make your blood boil.  if u r into heavy breathing buy it now. u'll love it because the player character runs out of breath quickly.-10
ove the game graphics top notchplay style very stealth likebullet drop is perferctits by far more than likely the best game for pcs being an xbox player for so long then converting to pc just to play games like this i definitely think yall should broaden yalls ideas maybe a console game similiar to the size and play style as to arma because console is BEGGING for something like this and they have nothing..thank you 10
laims to be realistic very far from it. Your guy wields his weapon like he's never used it before he can't seem to control recoil AT ALL. I can understand recoil being in a game and YOU have to control it but after firing your guy doesn't seem to put his crosshairs back to where it was after shooting but instead leaves it up where it left off AFTER the recoil leading your guy to slowly start aiming towards the sky. Even when you tap fire your gun you are lucky to even hit the enemy but apparenlty the enemy has no trouble at all shooting back at you. You will be lucky to land a bullet or two on them but they are capable of shooting you dead on with out much trouble. Difficult to see any enemies at all but of course the enemy can you see with ease regardless of any cover or anything you use. This game claims to be 'realistic' but to me it seems far from that its almost like it tries too hard to be realistic and instead leads to a harder game and does everything harder than it would be in real life. Not saying that I could wield any AR and fire away with 100% accuracy but if I were in a real shoot-out I doubt the enemy will just do a 180 and look straight at me and shoot instantly with high accuracy. I tried to enjoy the game but it has just too many issues with it imo to make it feel like it truly is realistic but instead a game that is just ment to  you off. Too many moments that just don't make sense like I stated before such as enemies noticing you instantly their accuracy vs yours I even fired my gun and saw the bullet hit a boulder near me.....-10
Game is good!!! just spend money on this game and dont think!!! &lt;3
where do i start   Is awesome want to ride go karts  fly in planes through stunning landscapes or be bomb by epic unseen artilery in a small village all this is posible with 
Its a pritty decent game but t its current stages its not well optimized and quite a challange to run.
ts a game that I can imagine where if I knew the 1000000 controls that are available it would interest me. Menues are too complicated and not all servers work. Find a good server and know how to play the game is worth playing.10
omplex Toxic Community IDK-10
The Zeus dlc was apparently installed on 12/31/1969.........
n the tutorial I couldn't open my compass. And in the first level I died like 3 times at the same spot. It wouldn't let me save my progress.   The graphics really aren't that great and it's a simplistic game very slow paced.   I guess if you want a really realistic experience then yes but you could always just join the military. If you're looking for a FUN game this is not it.-10
Very Boring IMO
ostly broken clunky and fully dependent on the modding community.-10
rma 2 is still better even this far after 's release.-10
Simulator of a future war.
personly it was a waste of money. i did not like it what so ever
Was hiding in a house from the gunfire. Someone blew up the house with an RPG. I survived. I laughed.  I cried. The Feels bro. Feels/10. Must Feel Again.
ever played it I guess it's good?10
o this game runs fine but seriously with the 80% off deal a week after I bought it? What's up with these stupid scams? Steam &amp; these games need to schedule upcoming deals &amp; offers. I've wasted 100$+ on scammed deals.-10
raphically this game is amazing.10
nly get if your crazy about first-person and third-person simulators. But bottomline this game has tons of guns and as I say 'Still better than CoD!'10
ant play itgame execution not found-10
very nice game got a bunch of options for game mods
ad game first impression in the multiplayer i got into heli with random player so alot lags! the heli fly forward suddenly It flew backwards and it repeats itself after 5 minute pilot committed suicide with me -_- So I decided to play the gameplay story mode... i got i died so many times i could not progress in the game there are moments I could Save and a lot more moments i could not Save the game running 300 m in the forest really?! and die in the process and do it again more 100 m!?!!!! so I quit  I think I'm going back to play Battlefield 4-10
 is really fun glad i bought it
killing people in real life almost seems mundane when you compare it to killing people whilst playing 
Great game it is addictive and there are lots of great community made mods to play with when you and they range from the interesting to the rididulous.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
really good game and very enojyable!
F*cking best game ever and lots of diffrent game modes
this game is odly boring and the games are always never enough
Worth the buy
gt Jackson  31.05.15 Final Entry  Stranded we have been caught in a bitter fire fight lasting over 2 days. Ambushed as we attempted to flee from the island by an elite infantry unit  we sort refuge in an old farm house. My men and I fought bravely holding back the enemy. Contact to HQ has proved fruitless they have abandoned the island and the few soldiers that remain.  My thoughts in this quiet period turn to family and friends back home my lovely wife and two twin boys. If they somehow get this journal I want them to know I love them dearly...  I cannot dwell too long I can hear the enemy.  I hold back the tears to keep face in front of my men.  We have seen that the enemy do not take prisoners of war in fact they make an example of captured soldiers in a truly horrific manner.   When captured you are stripped of your items and forced into a vehicle drove by the AI the driver is given a way point from one end of Altis to the other. you are not allowed to leave the vehicle or drive the vehicle yourself.  They are barbarians.  My men and I are down to our last rounds of ammunition I myself only have my side arm. We know we will not survive the next assault. I have thought about saving one round for myself. but I don't want those s out there to have that kind of satisfaction.  My engineer Kevin a brave man with a mustache worthy of a medal on its own merit he approached me and told me he has one explosive charge left...  We discuss our options.  Knowing full well our situation Kevin Johnson Taylor and I have decided the last man standing will detonate the charge we will go down fighting to the last.  The charge is set. I'm not a religious man but if there is a God may he have mercy on our souls.  I hear the enemies battle cry.  Farewell   Despite the occasional clumsy AI This game is that realistic. Just fantastic BUY IT NOW. 10
Not as realistic as Carl on Duty: Black Cops 2  ascii / unicode  #noonegetsit
Literally worse than Hitler.   niqqers and Obama!  !
Great game and fun gamemodes
et this game you won't regret it. Enough said.10
nly played a few hours but I'd buy it again if I could.10
ve only played a little I like it alright I guess.10
his is a great game with huge map and its very realistic. There are already zombie mods what makes this game even better so for 45€ you actually get more than one game. One of the best FPS's currently on market.10
nyone who is looking for a realistic military experience unlike call of duty and stunning graphics this is the game for you because this game is warit is hard to play without exitment when the health in this game is realistic meaning one stray bullet can mean deathso yes i recomend this game it has alot of content and even more with the steam workshopit is a very good game with a great communityand it is probably one of the best games i have played on steam.10
I am not have any Hack tool in my computer But this gmae have banned me. I can't play Arma3 Mods Altis Life now.
equires DLC to use some of the guns booo 4.4/10-10
This is a funny war game.
nsanely boring. After the first few days of playing I finished the campaign and went into multiplayer. Once you finish the campaign there is absolutely nothing to do because nearly every server on the multiplayer is either broken or the same thing as the last one.-10
This is the best game i've evere had and recommend if you like millitary games!! The only thing with I'm disappointed is that the campain has some really annoying bugs....but is ok!
This game is so amazing in grahics and gamplay you can use the editor to create cool missions and senarios theres TONS of mods and missions to download as well as an ok and very hard story. its also AMAZING when it comes to multiplayer. 100/10
ersonaly i envy this freaking game. i love it! the great graphics combat and i love how immersive the game is. its easily one of my favorites on steam i played for a bout a week and never wanted to stop. if only i didnt get so many lag spikes and if my PC were better. but regardless of the problems my PC has i would play every day if i could. i highly recommend this game to any experienced PC gamer.10
ell What can i say..  is a one of a kind game. Its a twist on the average fast paced FPS. Don't get it if you think you'll survive a bombardment of bullets and walk away perfectly fine one bullet to the chest and you're done. This game is a slow paced shooter Its takes patience to play. You can't fight two soldiers at once. But what the game does offer is some of the best graphics. And stellar gunplay.This game needs a lot to run. The only cons are the team mates. Most are there to play and help you. Some asshats are straight from COD. And will shoot you and not help the team. Two tips you need to know This  is tough your K/D doesn't mean jack  to you. Its about the team winning. Second its about team work Telling people where tanks and soldiers are location is a must. Team work people is the key to victory.10
ood game recomend it to people like my self and others who like virtul reality gamefightingaction and rpg love it great job bohemiea thanks again good job10
fter the very high paywall for the initial game they try and charge you 16 dollars just for a weapon pack of 7 guns which effectively doubles the amount of the vanilla weapons. This game seems like a cash-in like most triple-A titles.-10
et again another epic shooter this game is fun and a big improvement with dlc and online content10
reat stragistic shooter and really realistic10
un game It's very boring if you have about a handful of players like 5 or 6 at least on the server I played on first but then I joined a server with 112 player max that had about 97 people already. Total chaos very exciting altho I eventually got booted from the sarver for side channel spam as it so named it they were kinda dickish with thier rules on that server for some reason. Still it has great potential :) 8.2/1010
his game is one of the more realistic games in my library..(probably the only one). While not one of my personal favorites if a semi-realistic military combat simulator is what your after then it is a must have. If you arent looking for something too realistic there are many public servers that take the game and make it into a new game such as Altis life which basically transforms it into a criminal simulator. Overall it is a fun game if you are looking for what it is designed to be.10
i feel this game should heve included some form of a gta like free roam cause I was kinda expecting to have the oportunity to explore the world I'm aware that there were mods that could make this happen but I dont realy like having mods take up more memory space of a game that is already about ten gigabites
irst i want to say that this game is amazing and i loved playing during the free weekend. however i have a major issue. i came onto steam to purchase the game thinking it was still 50% off but when i checked it was full price again! after rereading the declaration of the sale and free weekend i realized that it said that the sale ended on Monday yet there were people saying they bought it on Sunday. this is where i got confused: the free weekend trial for  ended on sunday at 10pm. the sale itself ended on monday. i thought that meant i could purchase it half price on monday but i see that it is full price right now. does this mean that in order to actually buy the game (because you cant do so while it is in your library during ther free weekend) i had to buy it between 10pm and 12pm at night before monday? tell me if im right or i misread the article. PS: sorry if this has to go into a special help section or somethign because i just couldn't find one. EDIT: of course i found the help section AFTER i posted the question. sorry about that.10
excellent game. Its much more slow paced than a BF game but its very fun. Nice and strategical like.
ery very very Beautiful and Awesome game! The graphics are absolutely amazing the gameplay is realistic and awesome. Overall rating for Graphics and all 100/10! Definitely recommended! If you like realistic military combat simulators this game is strictly for you!10
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE A MOD TO FIX CONTROLLS SO THAT ITS SIMILAR TO COD OR BATTLEFIELD WHEN USING A CONTROL;ER
This is the best sandbox shooter i played in my life you definitely have to try this one with a mod like wasteland
I have no words.....What can i say?? 11/10!!!! Nice gameplay rly fun nice graphics and its so good! + some great dlcs [dlc]
t's ayt just need an enough beefy computer 10
Do you like ingame ads that make the game unplayable for a few seconds at random? Do you want to explore large environments and find guns you might not be able to use simply because you haven't paid for that particular one yet? I found a ghillie suit! is it the DLC one?! that ones extra!! Fly in helicopters that spam you with ads for DLC and since every server is running it now you'll have no choice but to buy that too to get rid of them.   Effectively the popular mod community servers have been ruined for anyone that does not own the DLC. So count on paying 92 dollars for this game to actually enjoy those and thats really the only reason to play it.
his game is fun but you need a wikipedia to play it I mean all the ing buttons. I mean seriously it has soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo many keys. I learntish because I have an RGB Keyboard which helps but meh. Artillery is fun aswell.  For me the best game mode is Invade and Annex from AhoyWorld.    10/10 wikia again10
mazing game. As a huge fan of the Arma series I have to say this is a great addition. I can't wate until they add more content.10
rilliant game i give it a 10/10 because i look past the nitty gritty that people are always on about when it comes to this game and i fully believe that the creaters and the company do not get the credit they deserve...... think about it its a game which the map is near enough the same geographical size of an actual island which exists and it holds so much detail and it has so much to offer... if you think differently i'm sorry but your life must be one of the most negative people to walk this earth lol..... i have heard people complain about the graphics for this game and to be honest i find them very good what more can you expect from a game with a map that size were every thing has to have detail. another thing the singleplayer in this game is absolutly genius (to me anyway).... all in i would fully recommend this game to anyone. its definitly worth the money.... i cant believe people would pay like £50 for games like call of duty and then complain about the price of this one if anything it should be the other way round.... anyways i hope that if you get this game you will get the same enjoyment as i did and still do. :)10
f you grew up playing call of duty kind of games this isn't for you. I can safely say that because I did grow up on playing fps like call of duty and this game is a little too real. Could never get the aiming right I must have shot at a guy 100000 times and never killed anyone huge map so it takes awhile to even see anyone. But if you want super realisitc this is for you!-10
RMA is still clunky frustrating innaccurate Garbage I like the scale bullet drop and the selection of weapons/vehicles that's it but interface and interaction is recycled Junk the immersion is ruined by the inaccuracies of the game 'cant Jump cant climb fences cant run more than 4 feet without dying of exhaustion etc:' can't effectively interact with your environment AI is the worst i have ever seen in any game since Goldeneye for N64 engine is horribly inefficient and clunky (I can run it at Maximum Settings With 60 FPS No Problem but it dose not look as good as it should for the load it puts on ones pc and it dose not even use all of my cpu/gpu to do it...... it is not a simulator it is a frustrating exercise in lazy coding and very poor interaction the 'Inventory System' is Garbage and ruins immersion. all they did was add new models and up the poly count compared to ARMA 2 they need a smoother feel of interaction in their games and no 3rd person view whats the point in making a game 'realistic' when you can switch to this magical 3D Camera and you spend a lot of time digging through menus rather than playing a game. BF4 with More animations/Timers for actions would be more realistic. and a basic inventory system would smoke ARMAs broken  if EA where ever to make a game world in the Frostbyte engine that is that large. ARMA is a slow clunky bore fest that kills any allure of a tactile feel with the hobbled game play and clunky unrealistic mechanics this game should only be played with a group of friends and w/mods that fix some of this is the only way to go. even still it is pretty bad that the modders and gaming community have to be relied apron to make the game better because obviously Bohimian don't know how to innovate. and the ridiculous aiming sway is beyond the most  and the most inaccurate thing i have ever seen because when i was 13 years old i could reliably hit targets out 150m out with iron sights on a 15 year old 308 and the characters in ARMA have a furious shootout @ 50-100M without hitting  or the sway going crazy! and this is with Bleading edge Tech in both their weapons and sighting systems and a soldier with years of training and experiance..... and I am no expert marksman don't believe me take a trip to the range it isn't that hard to prove me right here.-10
Great game. the life servers are amazing!
 thought this game was very well designed. The levels were structured very well but the graphics were kind of weak.10
 wish i could like this game i really do. but after about three days of trying to get microsoft .net frameworks to install for the game trying over 28 differnet solutions found on the internet and trying to get help on the phone from microsoft them selves i at last wiped my entire computer to factory settings.... finally was this my moment of truth was i gonna be able to play this game? i was sadly wrong after udating windows and my drivers restarting my computer twice i downloaded steam and installed  took about a half hour total download and install including the first time start up finally i see the arma start up menu.... im excited at this point 3 days of constant strugle to get this one game working i click campaign and it asks me about the bootcamp tutorial thing i go yah why not ill do it to get used to controls it loads up to something that can be described as an open plane with cubes here and there with a blue soldier with camo gear on it says  bootcamp i sit there waiting for something to tell me what to do few minutes go by im getting bored of waiting so i start pressing every button trying to move look around some thing anything.... i found only ne button that did anything it was the ESC button. so after about 15 minutes of that non sense i decide to just jump inot the campaign hoping that it will teach me the ropes along the way.... i load up the game it tells me to walk about twenty feet to a heli and hop in so i do. after what seems like a 5 minute heli ride we land and it tells me to go report in after figuring out i had to just walk up to one soldier and have him salute me i wonderd what i did wrong because when i walked up to him it said check point complete and that was it for about 8 minutes where i wonderd around went back to him pressed a bunch of buttons cause no one said anything no text popped up nothing finnaly after those 8 minutes it gave me three objectives right in a row get in a truck drive to outpost/road block and then drive some where else..... i got into the truck drove to the check point/road block and....... i waited and i waited some more and more turned the truck off backed up pulled forward almost hit the guy turned of the truck waited said well maybe im supposed to jusat run the guy over and break through the barricade. nope dont do that you fail and have to restart the whole objective over again from the heli after you all ready waited 20 minutes at the road block..... i tried again three more times i now have 5 hours on record and i have not even started the game yet im gonna give this game a 1/10 because of graphics only cause all i saw was a good looking game that i couldnt do anything in.... 1/10 probably gonna refund waiting simulator 2015-10
 had the lucky chance of playing  last weekend - which i had to compromise and complete my godlike mission of downloading it. Got on a server  got shot in the head in wasteland for missteping into a 'territory' which was 1 meter and 'amazingly there' shot two ppl got ultimate loot and died. 10/10 would fap again.10
a fun game to play
BUy it Gibe moneyzz to arma
I would have recomended this game but now it doesn't really work anymore and like 2 months ago it worked on my computer bu now its well 
it's like dayz but you're already looted
Unoptimized garbage
ery good war simulator game no easy peasy BF/CoD stuff. Good graphics good sounds large map alot of game modes and mods the realism on the bullets etc. Absolutely awesome on Invade gamemode as being dropped on 2-5km away and after that have to silently get on the objective the communication of the team and CAS. Only thing that is bad is the performance on Multiplayer some bugs on the doors and inside the buildings and stairs.10
9/10 IGN WOULD PLAY AGAIN
400 hours played.  Game has really high learning curve but after player gets hang of it there is alot to enjoy.  Tons of mods for more hardcore players and others for more casual players.  Best played with group of friends but alot of social players who want to team work out there too!
his game ruined my life. 10/10 would enroll in virtual military school and finally enlist after 3 months of boot camp again.  But for real. This game is the ultimate military sandbox. The modding community and player interaction really make this game. Imagine every scripted epic combat scene and now imagine that actually happening non-scripted and with all real players. Just buy this  trust me.10
Great mod support love it but lacking content. will eventually ge there
this game is super fun... if u really wanna have fun join the unitedatlis:altis life server. staff is really nice and they have a great team!
hey I have been playing this game for a while so plaese can I get this game for free
Pretty much the number one game if you're going for realism and large scale tactical gameplay.
Very Good Game-
i hated this it was boring and my multiplayer and campaign do not work five minutes into playing
he models are simply awesome the sounds are reused on some guns and you need a motherf*cking warmachine to run it with only 30 fps in medium resolution.10
Ctrl+S. Do it and you will be happy. =)
but how do u wite list
his Game.......Its a large map sandbox designed game.It takes a beastly pc to run it however it will freeze alot over the time that you get it.The trick to learning how to be good at it is teamworkstrategytactics and common sense.You don't need to be the best sniper in the game to have fun and be good at it.Every person counts in combined operations since every person is a part.It has a good modding community and in general a great game.10
LOVE IT !!!!!
great game good graphics if u like shooters get this
he DLCs are disrespectful towards the players.  ArmA mostly deserves a very good reputation due to it's fanbase and community modding content. By adding content you have to pay for they are not only screwing with their loyal customers but spamming you with advertisement if you do not own the DLC for the VEHICLE / whatever you want to use. It's a shame because  is such a great game. Just like ArmA 2. But because of this I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Milking the cow is one thing but forcing you to drink out of it's udder is udderly nauseating.-10
: The only Military FPS you Need Along with Arma 2. Lots of Mods Via Steam Work Shop and a Ever vast developement Team Updating and improving it. With Games like Altis Life which you can be a Criminal or Cop depending on what Server. Ride Go karts 'DLC needed' Lots to do.
FFS! Video games are hard.
 love the Multiplayer But when i play campaign the enemy's shoot me threw the wall-10
is an amazing tactical shooter with huge maps and a whole list of game modes. But After the big patch the game crashes every 10-20 minutes. This has gotten me banned from servers for 'combat Logging' even though it isnt my fault.-10
his is the most bugged game you will find on Steam. Believe me the amount of frustration it will bring you is so high that you will leave bad feedback on it even if you do not leave feedback for games ever. This game has very nice idea and would be one of the best shooting/simulation games if it was done by any other developer.  Don't buy it if you don't want to suffer constant frustration because of bugs. And obviously buy it if you like to be constantly stuck/crashed/etc.-10
my honest opinion its good it really is but for it price No its not its bugy lagy broken at times with really bad frame issues (ONLINE) campain runs smoth 60+ frames ect but Online dosen't mods are prety awesome and It dosent matter how powerful your computer is your frames will drop but if you can icnore that and tweek your settings just right this game is posibley worth buying and only if you can pick it up for like £10 £15 IS acceptable one the sales so at this price and state hell no it not worth buying
eatures one of the worst aiming systems ever made in a video game (if you manage to kill someone it will be by sheer luck). Combine that with  poor ai an unnecessarily complicated inventory system random deaths to invisible landmines and voice acting which is at the level of X-Rebirth and you get . One of the single most unfun experiences of my life and Ive seen Razorlight live.-11
okart go under car and car fly into building and explosion get ban for explosion. decent game.10
Po_Tato: Lo $ Chang : Pete THE BANGER : Sayeed Black Hammer Black : Thank you guys for all the fun stuff.
awesome game...if it was optimised smh.
its okey
Massive leap forward.
I absolutelyt love this game. Very realistic and not many kids which is a triple bonus for anyone above the age of 18.
I really need help here! When i startup the game it freezes when i load the bohemia interactive logo and i tried all the standard methods of fixing the issue yet nothing worked. Does anyone else have the same issue and/or know how to fix the issue?
ot sniped with a 45. acp pistol from 1000 meters away would play pistol sniping sim again 11/10  approves.10
its the best game ever :D
 Loot of days spend money on a Hunter. Die to a scrub and loose it all
 Buys   Plays DayZ-esque mod  Gears up and walks for 2 hours to city  Gets killed by Bambi  11/10
..Don't do it. I would absolutely not recommend that anyone purchase this title especially from Steam. I had so much trouble getting a new button mapping to save properly that by the time I decided to attempt to get a refund from Steam they told me I had exceeded their 6 hour requirement (I hadn’t even completed the tutorial section of the game). As for the game itself it feels incredibly clunky and cumbersome and just overly complicated. Graphically its just so so even on the highest settings. I cant speak as to whether or not the core gameplay is decent since I didn't get that far but what I did see just seemed very disappointing.  Lesion I learned from this title is 1) do more research before purchasing a questionable title and 2) think twice about giving Steam my money in the future. -10
My bro told me to get this game itsawsome i think its just a steming pile of Arma wish i could get my money back o well 20/20 hindsite
f you want a good realistic game with awesome community and tons of mods you have come to the right game.  Simply  is a good game with a good story campaigns and a lot of stuff vehicles and weapons already in it. But if you want to create from this a awesome game use the power of the mods and you will have a really good time playing this game.10
After 14 hours of play I have succesfully learned how to fire a gun that i find on the floor. Buy this game.
ust bought Arma III cause my other Arma's failed with the battleye thing and I cant find any solution. Good thing Arma III has the same problem for me Money well wasted.10
To awesome 11/10
ad things:  - Very poorly optimized. Unless you can afford a 2000 dollar gaming PC you will play this with constant 15 FPS no matter if you set graphics to High or Low no matter how good your PC is. This game is like pre-alpha it's like it can't detect your system and it will go full r*tard with 15 FPS no matter what you do.  - You must spend hours googling for complicated scripts in order to enjoy Editor mode. You actually can't dress up your soldier and give the items you want. It's like: you want to have 2 medkits on your soldier instead of one? Maybe put your magazines in a different slot on start-up? Too bad. Feel free to browse thousands of forum topics to find the very script you actually need to do these kind of things.  Good things:  - It is actually possible to press Escape Leave game confirm by clicking Yes and enjoy a well-optimized fun game.-10
 is bae.
great game and mods
launches arma. gets in helicopter. fps is 0. loves game
Pleas give me  i want to play whit me friend and i now dont have money becouse i more smoke weed.
i really want this game
I need money for my PTSD plz . Game brings Syria to your desktop and forces you to choose between your friend or the misson  11/10 Would scream Allahu Akhbar while naked again
Such fun. Many recommend. Much wow.
rape Soda / 10 Could have more features like shotguns.  Bought game for 15$.  With 20 FPS in multiplayer on my potato.  Was forced to buy 30$ of DLC to make game fair.  Still play even though I don't want to.  This game brainwashed me.10
This game blows.. period.
10/10 would recommend. Great game with beautiful visuals and great realistic-ish combat.
love it great game play altis life 10/10
where should I start. I started playing just after the game was released The game was good with afew major bugs. But now the game has come along way. I have recently setup a regiement called the 408th. We focus on the mil-sim side of ArmA. How the game is meant to be played. The game is great it has a great campaign and good multiplayer but where the game shines is its modding community. Mods are really easy to install and get working once you know how. (Which is not hard at all). Defienetely worth picking up if you are an old ArmA veteran or new to the scene! If you need any help in game send me a message I am glad to help10
It is good
Perfect
ne of the best games ive ever played in my life! So many mods Better than Dayz Standalone + Mod Together! Epoch mod is to replace them both! Get this game Theres so much to do Because of mods this game is amazing! Get it!!!10
This game is completely a waste of my money... I have all of the minimum and also recommended requirments its says but the game still runs on 20fps-30fps on the lowest settings possible. Dont buy this game unless you are fine with 30fps and lower lol.
I got to say this is the best game out of all the games i played id give up all my games but warhammer just t keep this
Man this game is so awesome!
Ecstra monee to plaiy maro kart. -10/10
Top game! If you have time worth it a try!
hat happens in  when you a lvl 1:  Get in helicopter dont know how to eject die from AA tank  Respawn get in heli figure out how to eject you eject but get killed from AA tank   Respawn again hop in heli dont get shot by an AA tank land on ground het shot by sniper from 1000km away  Respawn buy Marksman DLC and hope you get the guns in it (you dont) try to see if you can get the Ghillie from it  (also you dont)  Cry then write a review on game ~   ---------- \    / \    / \    / \    / \    \     Would Play Again
completely worth getting. Requires strong team work and precision in battle.
i love the mulitplayer you will have a blast trust me Bros..
i reccomend it yes. its really fun playing with friends on wasteland servers but i dont think its that realistic. theres still so many bugs. you might as well go play dayz sa in alpha
this is a good game if you have friends to play it with otherwise prepare to get demolished constantly if your a casual player like myself !! this game needs a lot of work it just feels empty however i do love it ! it runs better on a mid range laptop then arma 2 does and i appreciat that. if your into a tactical army sim like arma them go nuts i just think you need a friend or two to play with any way have fun !!!!!!!
I love this game 100% better then GTA N any BLACK OPS a bit laggy but I don't blame it n don't get mad because ur rubbish.
pic game with lots of weapons vehicles drones epic islands(alits-400 km^2 of hell)10
Is a great Shooter And just buying one of these games is like getting 6 There so many mods and cool game modes like Epoch Wasteland Altis Life And king of the hill these r my favourite gamemodes but there are lots more it combinds elements of RPG FPS Survival and even racing.  50/10 Would agian Recomend 100x Over10
his game is the best FPS featuring a near real simulation of a medium scale war.  What's in ? Soldiers ( CQB weapons pistols rifles snipers launchers mines and more) Civil cars Military cars Trucks Armored cars Tanks Rebel cars  Airs (Heli jet) More in mods  Features : Squad System VOIP Real map Some simple building system (move/buy/destroy object) Realistic bullet system (without wind) Realistic sound spreading (interresting gameplay here long distance shots can not be localized easily)  Pros : Multiplayer diversity -CQB -Capture the island -King of the hill -Sandbox ( wasteland epochmod) -RPG life This is no COD or CS or BF   Cons : Physics can be buggy (but there is clearly worse out there) AI cheated (sort of) DLC (weapon) a bit pricy for the content but you need it because in multiplayer you will face players with 'better' weapon. This game is hard an unforgiving (I like that)10
makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give  its long lifespan. Unfortunately  is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here until Bohemia's support starts paying off.10
Overated; enough said. Only buy if you have a $1200+ rig and like boring long games.
good but i wish this game had a type of battle royale game mode to it like what h1z1 has as that will make this game a lot better
nce you get friends on and get your first kill you will be hooked. Most realistic shooter I have ever played. I would recommend to anyone who likes shooters.10
 great First Person Shooter.. Tons of Mods available and a large active community. I bought  Apex roughly 2 months ago and have already put over 120hrs into it. Maps are large Multiplayer is a blast and there is a game mode for everyone. From Invade &amp; Annex (Players v AI) Team Deathmatch Player vs Everyone King of the Hill 4 player Co-Op etc.. Singleplayer is fun as well if that is your thing The official singleplayer campaign is a blast to play to get the hang of all the controls/keybinds since there are a TON and you can then get community made Campaigns Scenarios and Missions from the Steam Workshop to keep your singleplayer interesting.  There are thousands of community mods as stated earlier there are Missions Full campaigns scenarios other complete Maps as well as Vehicles Planes Helicopters UAVs Boats Submersibles Uniforms/Outfits Guns and a ton of other Equipment such as radios that integrate with Teamspeak the ACE (Advanced Combat Enviroment) is a mod that brings a whole new experience to Arma it introduces a bunch of dynamics to make Arma more realistic such as Bullet Spin Wind Drift Bullet Drop etc.. as well as Hand Signals and a countless number of there realism features.  Bottom line If you want a FPS Military Sim that will never get old. Get .10
is an unforgiving military simulator.   People dont really buy this for the story mode.   Its revered as a fantastic modding platform for both SP and MP modes.   If you pick this up be sure to try wasteland and king of the hill game modes online both fantastic MP modes.   For the zombie fans Try Epoch and Breaking point.   For those who like to play solo download the altis sandbox and the dynamic war simulator.  The first one gives you a great platform to get a feel for the vehicles and guns. The second is a dynamic random gen senario for you to do battle in.   The game thrives in on MP with friends and no 2 sessions will be the same.10
10/10 would buy again
ood game must download mods and find a community. Try the 173rd for a milsim group.10
erfect Game for Military Fan Boys out there (Loads of gamemodesMore ZombiesMore Shooting this is not a zombie type of game u have to subscribe to the workshop the addon or whatever but this is an awesome game right here you guys should totally buy this.10
This game is the . Despite the bugs..
I MUST HAVE THIS GAME!
Buy this. Buy it now. It's worth all the monies.
this game is the best game you will ever play
I rate this game a solid 5/7
This game has 5 more controls than you have buttons on your keyboard.
LOVE IT GRAPHICS AMAZING REQUIRES BEEFY COMPUTER
reat game love the realizim &amp; multiplayer!10
wesome game such diveristy such wow10
reat game to really benefit from it you need to have a solid group of friends.  Playing solo is worthless.10
retty realistic pretty complex controls and as realistic it can be.  (Arma II) stepped on rubble and broke my legs  10/10 would break my legs again.10
you have lots of things to do in this game but it can be quite boring if you are by yourself. I reccomend playing a few friends
Great game but my 'King of the hill' charater levels were reset... anyway to fix and return my levels? :/
Amazing Game That Every One Should Have
biggest waste of money or i mean i cant even play onine so i dont really know the ing battle eye bull  is stupid it wont launch and i have tried everything so fed up and a waste of my money and hours of trying to fix something that is should not even have to worry about it and i know im not the only one im just done
REAT GAME You wont regret buying it10
very good but bad optimisation lag much
10/10 IGN - Learnt How To Bunny Hop (PSI)
Great game! as long as you ahve a group to join
amazing game 11/10 would get rekt by AI sniper again
This game has redefined the way I look at every military related game forever! I've been with Bohemia Interactive's Arma series since the release of Arma 2 and A3 has definitely outdone itself. Unlike most other games this is a one stop shop for play and customizability. I save money playing this game compared to others due to their 100% free development framework. All you have to do is buy the game and your in. The community is by far the best I have ever seen in a game. I currently own my own group that I definitely want to see rise to the top and I will be playing the Arma series till my paycheck says I cant anymore!  Definitely a 20 of 10 stars!
i cant stop this  never dowload
 have deciced to change my review. This is based on me seeing the community of Arma.  It's one of the worst bunch of people you can find. Guys that enjoy harassing others in the games because they can't do it in real life. A bunch of squeekers saying 'hands up' and shooting you in the face after they rob you. Basically a heaven for bullies.  A game where you can rarely find some teamwork unless you join a gang. Then it's way more fun but even when that happens you can't really feel like you can enjoy the game to the fullest if you are not a psychopath that can't stop killing every person in town he/ sees.   I think these people should be hospitalized most of the time. So no if you feel like you like to earn some money be a HELPFUL guy to others do not even bother buying this crap.  I only got one thing from being helpful - bullets. This isn't an army simulator this is a nerve wrecking piece of crap of a game. And not because the game is  but because people are .-10
n absolutely beautiful looking game. If you like military combat that's about decision making more than how good you are with a gun then this is a game for you. the simulatory aspect with a huge arsenal of vehicles and weapons. with amazing steam workshop support and game mods all coupled into a new engine with ragdoll physics smoother frame rate on an absolutely massive real world island makes this game a fantastic realistic and fun playing experience.10
best game especially for realistic combat :)
what can i say this game is amazing but after one of updates i lose voice and i don't know howto fix this and here my sory with that game ends
This game is . I only have like 12 hours on it. Ight?
Do not reccomend this game unless you have a good pc. my pc is twice as good as it needs to be but i get 30FPS SINGELPLAYER... dont even talk about multiplayer...
idn't work well with amd fx 8320 amd r9 270x 16GB ram. Only got 15-25fps...-10
It good But mods are hard to work with and took me over 12 hours to get in server
he controls on this game are ing  you spend 50% of in game time trying to make them less -10
asn't a fan personally. The graphics are phenomenal the single player is cool as  but I got it wayyyyyy too late in the game to get involved in multiplayer and for that I cannot reccommend this game to new people. Its a tough community to join.-10
Porn of Gaming!!! XXOO
OMFG i am totally getting ths game soon
My experiences so far:  -Played campaign -Got to the second level of campaign -Broke mouse because of second level -Downloaded more campaigns off of workshop -More broken mice -Downloaded open world scenerio -Drove for about 2 hours finding intel -Died about 9000 times  Good game rate it 10/10 Altis Driving/Walking/Dying simulator
what a load of 
I'll sum up this game with an  life experience  Friend buys a car I steal the car I drive the car into the ocean Friend gets  off Friend will never play   11/10- ing would never play again over *walkie talkie sound*
 is love  is life
Great Game for more people who play this game join this uprising group.   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OfficalArmAIIIFanGroup    http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OfficalArmAIIIFanGroup    http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OfficalArmAIIIFanGroup    http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OfficalArmAIIIFanGroup    http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OfficalArmAIIIFanGroup    http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OfficalArmAIIIFanGroup    http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OfficalArmAIIIFanGroup    http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OfficalArmAIIIFanGroup    http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OfficalArmAIIIFanGroup    http://steamcommunity.com/groups/OfficalArmAIIIFanGroup
i don't know if this is the free weekend flood or just the norm but i can not find a server that is actully good but the grathics are good and he game play runs smothly so i will give it a thumbs up (for now)
ever fails to make me laugh one way or another. Great and quirky game engine which also sums up the community pretty well. Looks amazing plenty of different mods and game modes to keep people occupied.. well worth the money.10
I went on a rp server and found a copter 9/11 -IGN
IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND LIKE ARMY TYPES OF GAMES AND YOU LIKE TALKING TO PEOPLE AND BEING INTERACTIVE THEN ID SAY THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. I GET MORE ENJOYMENT OUT OF TRYING TO TAKE BASES WITH OTHER RANDOMERS AND FRIENDS TO BE FAIR. I WOULD SAY GIVE THIS A TRY IF YOU LIKE WORKING AS A TEAM AND LIKE BEING INTERACTIVE  TAKES ABIT TO GET USED TO IF YOU ARE NOT ALL TO FAMILIAR BUT BELIEVE ME STICK AT IT IT WILL COME   1ST ONE KILL   THEN TWO  THEN THREE AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT YOU WILL BE LOVING IT
You can play it
ont waste your money aiming with the crosshair jumping up and down if there right on ur LOS.. Ingame controls are just rubish. Wanna swap Guns ? press ur jump key (space bar) roll mouse wheel select gun... Couldnt just have the guns on 1234567.... rather they have radio comms on 12345... tons of silly stuff like this.  Good engine just poorly thrown together.-10
est game ever but somehow I love playing it
Pain in the  to get the multiplayer to work it keeps kicking me.
f&lt;3king buggy game. Can't walk down stairs without glitching through the world and die. HYou just give this game on more chance and crap like this happens after 2 mins ingame
i cant run it so i dont really know
 crashes on 20 min dont buy this piece of crap guys.-10
as so happy when i buyed the game! ended up with getting so frustrated on the developers or whoever made this game.. and here is why: cant play multiplayer because name is invalid. tryes to change name: you cannot change name tryes to leave the name changing in  Invalid name.. please change your name.(and then please go read this again and you will see how iritating it is to force shutdown just to get unstuck from changing name) does it on steam:  still wont change. tryes other ways. still dosnt work! fix this and il make another review that is actualy posetive. ( sry that im not juging by the things i can do in single player but i only buyed the game cause of playing online... sooo....  happens... )-10
same reason as payday 2  too much DLCs
layed Arma 2 that was a good game. Started playing  tried to look at my gear by pressing 'G'  10/10 For explosion sounds10
this game is very addicting in a way!!!! i have played for 3 full days and i love it!!!!!!  TIPS-start in tdm and if you want and batle royale match go to the website Battleroyalegames and download the mod  If you like shooting games espiecaly realistic one this game is meant for you!!!!!!
Too many sweaty american ex-veterans. Too little kids to annoy.
ROS  Massive open world map/massive playable game world Huge modding community and lots of fun custom game modes and mods One of the most realistic and hardcore shooters available Map editor and mission creator for those willing to learn the engine Fully functional coop and multiplayer Great AI Literally a tonne of weapons tanks choppers and military content  CONS  Needs a strong powerful cpu lots of ram and gpu to run on medium or high settings Controls and engine clunky and annoying unlike other shooters Loads of paid DLC and addons costing a tonne of cash Online performance can suffer a lot on crowded servers on older hardware  Arma III is for people who like hardcore difficult shooters that require reading a map advanced tactics and quick thinking strategy! If you want a quick fire Team Fortress 2 Call of Duty or a Planetside 2 type shooter this is not for you. You'll need a good spec PC to run this and I recommend a six core or eight core PC because playing on medium or high graphics is a much different experience than low. Arma III is fine on a low spec PC for single player but multiplayer will be spoilt. It's a much different experience on high if you have the cpu gpu and memory to do it. You'll appreciate how good this game is when it's played on a PC where it looks nice and is smooth. This game is as close to a shooter or military simulation as you'll get on a computer. Be warned it's a very hard game but rewarding.   The single player campaign is hard but it's very indepth and unlike any other shooter you have played. It will give you a good 20-30 hours as I keep saying it's fun has a nice story and will make you realise this is how shooters should be. One negative for new players though is there are lots of key bindings options and things to learn and think about so don't expect a one hour learning curve. This game has all the normal stuff like tanks cars planes and running around on foot but in various weathers and at day and night with an actual need to use night vision scopes and military equipment to survive... There's a massive load of weapons all with different modes of fire and mastering them at long range and learning how they work is where Arma III gets it's difficulty and realism.  Arma games have a great modding and multiplayer community and one of the reasons I bought Arma III is my past experience of this from the older games in the series. Not only do you get Arma III you'll get a wealth of community made games with months and months of re playability. I actually think the online content is better than the base game. Wastelands is an amazing open world survival mod you can play in a group with friends that involves PvP PvE and base building.  My only real complaint and something I moan about occasionally is the game engine is a little clunky and not your typical Unreal or Frostbite stay game play with lots of things to master. Typically getting in and out of a tank isn't as simple as pressing a key you have to mouse wheel a menu. Sometimes a glitch or abnormal action can frustrate or get you killed when you are still learning how the engine works and reacts.   The sheer scale and size of the game world mean that no game of Arma III is ever same even against the AI in campaign or against real people online with it's many mods.  THIS IS A HARDCORE SHOOTER NOT AN ARCADEY ONE BUT IT HAS SO MUCH EXTRA CONTENT FAN MADE IT WILL GIVE YOU MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS OF GAMEPLAY.10
Very good game worth buying
losest thing you can get to being in the military without being there irl needs more polish though.10
Hours of endless fun!
I reccomend this game for the mods as I've never played vanilla.
Yes. That is all.
if you have a GTX 980 the firmware is incompatibale with this game... meaning you can not play it... FPS is insanly low...  and befor anyone yells at me i would like to state  my AVG FPS with my gtx 980 is about 16-20 fps  my AVG FPS with my GTX580... 40-60 FPS...   what i am trying to say is that if you have the newest gen gards they preform worse on this game then older gen cards because both card companys and this dev team just dont give a crap about this game...   with that said the game is ALOT of fun IF you can get over the fact that even with either of thoughs 2 cards and frame rates.... its hard to play because the game engine itself chokes your computer hard
The best military simulator (not FPS) outhere.
This game is seriously amazing. Astonishing graphics. Fantastic atmosphere. Good gameplay which is relatively hard.
OR THE CONDENSED VERSION SEE THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW   is an immersive challenging and fun mil-sim in which players can do pretty much whatever they want. There are 2 maps (not counting virtual reality world). These maps are not the tiny arena fps style maps. They are sandbox environments that include multiple towns and cities. First is Stratis a medium sized island that includes 1 main airfield several military camps and towns and 1 medium-large city. Secondly is Altis a HUGE and open yet annoyingly desolate and deserted island. Altis has 4 airfields (if you count the dry lakebed runway) several cities and numerous towns. Altis can be a little boring with less than 50 players on a server as the map is too large for low-population servers. Altis can also seem very empty and frustrating without vehicles which brings me to the next topic. There are less vehicles and weapons available in  than there were in arma 2 even if you purchased helis karts and marksmen dlc. There is a huge gap in the weapon diversity so far as there being NO shotguns in the game at all (mods can fix this). Speaking of mods Bohemia has done a great job with mod support. There are only 2 problems with modding . 1: Good luck trying to find a server with all of the mods you want to play with. 2: Some mods a lot of the time not even graphics mods can significantly hurt the already poor performance of the game. Thankfully  has an awesome editor that you can use to make any kind of mission you want. Bohemia also made a set of tools for modders to use. Bohemia added weapon attachments a huge step forward for infantry but unfortunately the awful fatigue system will often cause you to not be able to run when running is a huge part of the game especially on altis. The game itself plays much much smoother than arma 2 did. Obviously it being the newer arma game it has much better graphics animations and physics. For performance Inte/Nvidia users should get decent framerates (assuming you aren't running a 480 and an I3) but AMD users particularly those using AMD CPU's/APU's tend to be stuck below 40fps. My GPU is an R9 285 and my CPU/APU is an A-10 7850k and I get 70fps in singleplayer but 40 fps in multiplayer (My internet connection is fine I don't have problems with it in other games or applications). Hopefully Dx12 will help with this but for now AMD users are having trouble getting decent framerates.   Condensed Version  Pros: Satisfying gunplay Open world Amazing editor Good graphics Weapon Attachments  Cons: Terrible optimization expecially for AMD users Not a lot of weapons and vehicles Annoying fatigue system Altis is SO empty and way too large for most servers  Conclusion   is great game and you should try it. However it does have problems that you must know before buying it. FOR AMD 8-CORE FX USERS: I've heard that disabling 4 of the 8 cores seems to help but try it at your own risk.10
 have played a thousand+ hours of this game and it never gets old.10
Awesome game. Beautiful enviorments. Ultra realistic. Incredible mod community. HIghly recommend this game.
Ran a uber service in KOTH to bring people that were landed into the AO safely. Best game 10/10
Love this game you can do deathmaches with huge open mapes zombie apoclypse games or do altis life in all of these diffrent game modes there aare thousands of possibilitys and situations that you can try to eather talk your way out of or shoot your way out of wich ever way makes you and your freinds have the best multiplayer or singleplayer expeirence.
 fantastic realistic Military simulator game. Notice I sai Mili sim and not FPS. If you approach this game like COD or BF then you will not have a great time. 1-2 bullets are enough to kill you and there is no automatic health refill. Also you will be engaging from a distance and not right on top of a enemy.  PRO's; Very realistic game Graphics still hold up today ( just look at a night battle in this game) Community is active and dedicated Requires teamwork and organization to be successful A wide variety of guns and vehicles to use.   CONS:  Very realistic ( no rambo action here) Campaign is just so-so; not good not bad it's just there Advanced controls ( this game uses a large number og keys to do different actions; contray to most FPS) Tutorial is lax ( The tutorial for this game is horrible You will have to go to youtube or forms to get a idea of how to play this game effectively.  10
too difficult omg
t be 10/10 would r8 again10
This game reminds me of Call of Duty
Sexy Game 5 Star
I apparently own this game.
layed it for a bit it's okay I guess.11
ove it   fps10
This game is sex
94% Of playtime sitting on hills 5% Of playtime glitching through walls 1% Of playtime actually fighting
here is a really good engine at work here that (assuming you have the specs for it) can really show off what newer graphics features have to offer the world of sims. That said for what is still essentially at its core an fps shooter the base user interface is ridiculously over complicated. Granted I'm writing this with only a couple of hours of play it feels really bulky right now.   That said it has all the basic features of the newer battlefield games laid out on much larger maps. The mission types have a good amount of variation to them and when cranked up all the way the graphics look good considering the game engine is more sim oriented than your typical fps game.   The strange part is at this moment I still couldn't tell you if this was a good review or a bad review for this game. I'm really just trying to relay initial impressions here.   I see a lot of potential here with workshop content and the like. My major complaint is that the UI is just so dense and (for me at least) counter intuitive in many ways.   Of course this is probably something workshop content will solve over time taking away my largest complaint. Right now something about feels slow to me and it's the the user interface it feels almost like a 'X' series game where so much is controlled through menu after menu after menu. While just running and gunning is still possible it just feels like you are missing out on what this game is really about doing so.   TL;DR - Overall a good game but the user interface is a bit overly complex for a shooters hope steam workshop content will help solve this problem over time. 3/5 would give 4/5 easily if the UI problem was solved.10
shitfps in wasteland is amazing
Best sequal to minecraft since call of duty.
This game is EPIC. The mods are amazing for this game.  Tons of servers to play on.  My favorite gamemode is King of the Hill!!  I highly recommend this game! 10/10
Very good game but  FPS
great game provides countless hours of game play would recommed 10/10 IGN
Top game in te world!
Best game in the word!
y game crashed Sombra.10
Arma3 one of the best game :)  9/10  Would recommend.
ery realistic game really serious! Kudos to the devs with the sound effects they're really awesome and work very well you can locate enemies based on the sound alone and they help create a very tense atmosphere. Graphics wise it's nice basically what you'd expect. A lot of customization which again is really nice.  However there are some issues the menu is a bit glitchy and creating multiplayer games to play CO-OP can be quite a hassle given how glitchy it is. Also it's got quite a steep learning curve for beginners and be prepared to sit playing for quite a few hours at a time.10
 Very good game but have a lot of bugs10
Such a great game
Its OK.
?????????????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ??????????????
It's like Battlefield but--  not .
rma3 is a strange game. Sometimes you walk half an hour to die. But when you finally learn of your mistakes it rewards you with a good feeling. Best played in Jolly Cooperation. Really dont play it alone.  Dont waste your time in King of the Hill. Play Wasteland or Capture the Island to learn the Game.10
t's not a perfect game but it is the most detailed and aspirational game/project on the PC to date. Star Citizen is one of the only other titles that comes close.   If you have never played an ARMA game before both this and 2 are still pretty solid games but most people play this solely now. And it's not hard to see why; there's so much to experience.   You're going to need a beefy processor to play this game somewhat smoothly.10
he game tutorial I had ever played: 1. I can't find the target at first though my team master gave me the position and degree. 2. I just drive the jeep and drive across mountains instead of road and then I got lost fail. 3. Just killed by the enemy. .........................................................................................  However this is a perfect game. The graphy is very fantastic and also very realility.(also too reality) Recommand Chinese to add a mod to translate it to Chinese otherwise you may even don't understand why you are here.10
would be great game (seen my cousin and some streamers play it) looks awesome and stuff completed training too but when I try to play multiplayer cant connect to servers.. every server I try I can't even get to the lobby. Tried everything but nothing. Thanks alot for nothing-11
Do not buy this game untill developers fix this problem! you will be sad a lot... (explaining the reason in following)  shortly demostration whom needs visual proof:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMdzwanxnY   for those whom just wants to read: This game's engine is not using your graphics card &amp; cpu properly to give you a good gameplay. even if you have 3000$ gaming rig the best you can get is 20-40fps.   If i put every single graphics to very low or disabled(shadow etc.) ... i get 22 fps... If i put everything to ultra settings including AA &amp; renders guess how much i get... ... ... 21FPS! ... ... this game is veeeery badly optimized and engine is failing hard on hardware usage. Developers are not caring about the issue since arma 2 its same problem all around!
WHY IS YOUR ING GAME BROKEN??!! I TRY TO INSTALL AND IT JUST DELETES ITSELF..
i really need to know how to get my money back
Might be my favorite game.
this game is so cool
 Is a nice tactic/fps game. My personal favorite gamemodes are 'RolePlay' 'Wasteland' And 'King Of The Hill'
GREAT GAME BUY IT
he latest addition; still endless fun. Personally I would have liked to see the real names of weapons and vehicles as shown in Arma 2 and maybe a few maps carried over from Arma 2 but the engine is well built. Still a bit CPU intensive as inherited from Arma 2 but some after-market solutions can help a bit (though this shouldn't really be needed.)   Extensive modding for gamemodes such as King of the Hill Breaking Point and Private Group servers are still hugely supported and there are plenty of mods in the Steam Workshop for custom missions guns and vehicles for your enjoyment.10
much guns such war
asically feels like a Battlefield game. I wouldn't normally say this for an Arma game but with the armor and player damages in this game it doesn't feel as realistic as Arma2.  Pros: + Great Graphics + Flying Mechanics / Vehicle Selection + Leveling System / Perks / Customization + Fluent Controls / Immersive Movement &amp; Control  Negatives: - AI isn't very well done - Twitching when shot isn't realistic - Explosive damage is not well done - Land vehicle physics is terrible at times (cars doing back-flips from bushes) - Single-player wasn't done very well in respects to AI and missions  Overall the game is good but not worth 60$. Buy it on sale and you'll be happy like I did.10
Was playin the campain car got stuck in wall and there was no option to get out
Really good game and would recommend buying it.
A Great War simulator for being in the future with fictional wars/battles
Not the most optimized game but if you get bad fps look up an tutorial on how to increase fps on youtube.It has some nice comunity made gamemodes and a good comunity. (not a 10/10 cause of the bad optimization)  8/10
ove arma series but FML they need to start firing some of the developers   10
9/10 IGN  Great game
Crashing helicopters has never been better since Vietnam  10/10 would crash my helicopter full of people again
 Going out for a trip in 4K game crash.  100% Reccommended.10
most definitely a coot game
its great
rma has a story?' ive heard people say that few times.  Arma III is a first person milsim. The (nonexistant/important) strory focuses on the conflict between the AAF a force belonging to the government of the Agean islands of stratis and altis and the CSAT. CSAT (Canton-Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty) forces are primarily formed by middle easter and asian nations. You are an American soldier named Ben Kerry a corporal in the NATO forces sent to aid in the resolution of the conflict. Though the story has little to no significance it provides as a good intro and tutorial to the play style and mechanics of the arma series. Arma is focused mostly on its multiplayer a vast map giving plenty of room for ammersion and operations with AI or with real people. The main map Altis is peppered with small towns and several large cities covering 270 square kilometers with varying landscares from wide open salt flats and Rolling hills to the large uran ares such as kavala the capitol. The multiplayer is pretty basic until you iintroduce mods then things can get pretty intense. Game modes like king of the hill city life breaking point and other mods/game modes keep the 'basic' basic being a loose term tactical gameplay of the vanilla game from becoming stale and repetitive. There is also a large aray of vehicles and weapons at your disposal such as helicopters jets tanks mortar trucks and even GO KARTS! Though videos of this game may leave you in awe of their beauty such looks do not come without a price. The only thing truly holding this amazing game back is its poor use of resources resulting in poor performance on all systems regardless of hardware. I've even heard some peope say 'Oh arma that game where your specs dont matter.' which isnt very far from the truth. You could say every encounter is a 'flip of the coin' and a nything can happen. Over all it is a very enjoyable and challenging game with plenty of choices for gameplay.  Pros:  Immersive Challenging Expansive Fantastic gunplay  Cons:  Very difficult to run on any computer Confusing 10
OTE: my play HRS for DayZ Arma and a few other games was reset. Spending 8hrs in  MP today (10/24/2016) didnt register at all. So the 122hrs of play time isnt even close to what Ive really had)  You will never play anything like ARMA...period.  I bought this along with ARMA 2 Combined Operations. I did so only to play various multiplayer mods (DAYZ Wasteland etc) and then just figured since everyone seemed to love the series that I should have the most recent version as well. It's safe to say that I have barely played the multiplayer mods and have spent most of the time playing user created scenarios and the standard campaign. I am thoroughly impressed with how involved this game is in every possible category. Furthermore I fully understand now how people become addicted to this game. The modding community is the most impressive thing I have ever seen and unlike any other that I have encountered in the PC gaming world.  There are some things that any newcomer like myself should know before buyiong this. First off this game is difficult. It is difficult because it is exactly what it says it is a tactical military simulator with focus on infantry. Do not expect any aspect of casual FPS. Sure you may find that in a user created scenario (add-on free missions from the Steam Workshop) but most likely not as most fans who create those also focus on the true-to-life simulation potential.  Coming from Battlefield I figured that this was probably just like BF with a little more tactical realism. Boy was I wrong. But it was a mistake that became welcomed and well received. There is so much to learn in this game that it is almost mind-blowing...it actually only ends up being 'mind-bending'.  The Add-Ons/Mods seem to be endless. Since I am still learning how to properly use them I cant speak on the topic with any authority but only know that they are impressive. Check out the PlaywithSix launcher/mod browser/installer for the Arma series along with  armaholic.com  and get ready for a new never ending obsession.10
ood Game with Great Graphics! If you're into war sims this is the game for you! 10/1011
Great mil sim. Hours of enjoyment.
10/10 bst dong simulater out ther
n a trial of  I managed to buy and sell drugs and play passenger with a buddy. I also went alone and found food all over the land and got free badass weapons. A great game for DayZ and ARMA fans!11
This is a 10/10 game would recommened again- IGN approved TANOA update looks sick 420 mlg balze it GET  NOW BEST GAME IVE PLAYED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The most opimitsed game that I played in a long time.
Doesn't get much better then a incredibly hard and difficult game to control and play. With some performance boosting configuration most systems can play this. Join me on the DayZ type mod called Breaking Point for .
10/10 great game
 is very fun and it give highly experience from this game. The models and everything had changes and the development coding on  is very clear and better than an old verison of Arma 2 or more etc..   I highly recommanded this game than any other Arma.
ice dynamico-tactical shooter ya really must try it personally. But when cars blows up u may be blind cause its ing bad i mean cars in da gta sa blows better than there i mean it s . Don't try 2 chekc it u must vomit 2 ur keyboard. But its very bueatyful to play.11
Crap performance on perfectly capable AMD system 6core 4Ghz + R9 290.  5 cores sitting idle and the GPU at 70% of clock frequency and half the time idle.
his is touching story: *On day 2 playing  everything is fine being a Miner. *Hours-Hours later came a 3 bandit using Heavy weapons and helicopter. *Me trying fight but failthen kidnapped by bandits screaming like a  ask help for someone. *Kidnapped by bandits 1 days. *The bandits ask cops for money to set me free. *Me flying again by helicopter with bandits *landed for dealing. *came a cops bring money for bandit *Me free and a good cops give me $10K  *Me back to work again.11
un game feels really realistic doesn't require the tankiest of PC's to play however that doesn't mean you can run it on a potato.11
Absolute Quality  9/10 only because nothing is perfect  and Arma will only get better
Best helicopter crashing simulator ever.
I go into populated servers king of the hill mode. Go into objective zone and hide in a hotdog stand yelling 'FRUIT SALAD' in DIRECT communication channel. make people laugh so hard they get mad when I actually kill them. 420weedfadevapenation/10 would fruit salad again.
Incredible.
Pretty good but brutal to people who dont know what there at.
Driving around in mini cart what could be better
 bout as good as it gets even though the game engine runs at 15 fps on super computers.11
This i a good game but ive just got it so im kind of a noob so yeah
 is the  Mcgee.
ood game but not optimised11
Can someone buy me  please? thanks
BattleEye is ing aids and banned me for no reason.
Very good game. Makes a lot of fun
ING  MAKING THE GAME 54 DOLLARS AND I HAD TO PAY ALMOST 70 FOR IT  U U  
 bout the game cause it was on sale for 50% off the orignal price every server i tried to join had DLC included so i could not enjoy the game as it was for almost1 hour i tried to understand why my screen was black after i joined a game and all kinds of weird stuff was happening i could not even join server at first cause of missing DLC it was like 99% of the servers. to even play on DLC server you have to pay like $50 for all the DLC so its 1/2 the game you buying. dudes and gals this game is not worth on its own.-11
Hard yes.. great... absoutly
 was there and so was he. I saw him through my scope. He wasn't aware of my presence. He turned around still not seeing me. His eyes were beautiful. I was aware of my orders. I didn't want to. He probably had family a wife loving kids...   I pressed the trigger. I missed.    For the 27'th time.   11/10 best game i played this month.11
This game is amazing
Well where to start.... well first off you're gonna need a great or good-ish computer to run this heheh my computer cant even run this it just crashes sadly ahaha but also be prepared for alot of rage quits from snipers and  and yeah i would recommend this game because i rate 9/11 m8
his game runs like .   I have a good Pc.   8350 black edition 16gb ram windforce 280x.   I spend hours tweaking settings unparking my cpu cores and im lucky to get 30FPS.   Multiplayer is like 15 fps and unplayable.   Skip this game if you don't want to tweak your PC hardcore and still get .   Also apparently this game works much better with intel chips.-11
eau·ti·ful ?byo?od?f?l/ adjective pleasing the senses or mind aesthetically. 'beautiful poetry' synonyms: attractive pretty handsome good-looking alluring prepossessing; More of a very high standard; excellent. 'the house had been left in beautiful order'11
is a game for elite gamers and people that are into military games experienc eor very much traing is needed... this game has a skillgrade of 4/5. it is boring you get easily tired of it and its difficult to get in the community.-11
f you have anything less than a stelar computer expect 10 fps while doing almost anything.   -firefights -entering cities/towns -walking -running -picking up items -breathing  10/10 would break my keyboard because of lag again11
Good game. Gave me PTSD.
If you love ripping your hair out mid fire fight because you've been sucked in a wall and killed this is the game for you
good game with cool baler mods recomended by john cokean him self.....   nothing better then getting killed in wastland by a guy screaming like a teridactel   good game
 don't have this game but i can review it okay so lets start Pros - I don't have an idea Cons - I don't have an idea Thx 4 your time  Edit: Somehow i have 0.3 hrs when i didnt even downlaoded it but okay11
NOTE  is a god awful shooter. (i said shooter not game) this game is a sandbox create your own experience type deal. people say the shooting and the gun sway and all that stuff is realistic. if this is realistic then all of the u.s. millitary have no clue on how to hold a gun. it feels like the soldiers you play as just dont give a  and act like they dont want to either. (uuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhh i dont wana do thiiiis im tiiirrrred my arrrrms hurrrt. that gun sway/recoil is in . i geuss it would make sense if we had lazy  lemmings in place of our actual millitary troops but we dont. and since you apparently cant shoot right 90% of the time in this game you have to hide and camp to clear out an area. and to add insult to injury the ai have ing out of this world aimbot. you could take ALL your in cloths off drop all your items to maximise your sprint speed and run across a field 300 yards away from the enemy and they would still hit you with no problem. this game gets a 4/10 in the catagory of a shooter. i had never made a bigger waste of my money than when i purchased . this game is good for people who like making their own experience and having other people try their creations out. in that catagory it probably gets a 8 or 9 out of 10. but for a shooter i do not recomend it at all. if you want a good shooter get bf4. one more thing  is ing huge i mean like HUGE!!! and thats a nice thing to see in video games but. the lack of things to do in this game make the map size irelevent. its like some one made a nice little cake then a dump truck full of frosting came up to the cake and  all over it smuthering and drowning the poor cake.
 very fun and skillful game. Worth all the money DLC's are great. Would recommend 10/10!11
ery addicting and great game many mods and not so much DLCs. Bit buggy as all bohemia interactive games but still great fun11
he main reason i had to buy a new screen. Luckily the game has come a far way instead how dying when i fall of a 50cm ledge i now just get wounded and then die. 10/1011
I don't even know where people are shooting at me from. 10/10
ne of the best games in the tactical and simulation titles. i would recommend mods to make gameplay better but the game itself has many many things to do ensuring hundreds of hours of gameplay11
ag even on my dual titan x's-11
gt; Joined in a breaking point server as a hunter  Found a sword  Walked into town  Saw another player  Went over and sliced him to death while he was looting  Took his weapons  Went further into town  Found a group of 3 other hunters  Got recruited into the group  Started to walk to airfield  Found two other players and recruited them we had a team of 6  Found a dog on the way to the airfield we tamed him. His name was bub.  Got to airfield  Tried climing under the fence  Got shot by a bandit  Never heard from teammates again.   10/10 would loose friends again.11
Managed to get 4.1 hours on my potato at 0.666 fps. 10/10 Best 4.1 hours of my life at under 1 fps
its to glitchy
gt;friend buys me game we play the  out of exile with 2 other friends find much loot finds humvee humvee has glitched clothes inside and dupes other items duped a lot sold those items get banned next day  11/10 best duping session ever11
Got this game while it was free and it was awesome. Now it says I have to pay for it?!?
 Thing about its awesome11
Best military sim game you can find and play.
It would be great if I wasn't locked under 25 fps. Don't buy if you have AMD FX 8350/8320! You get terrible performance no matter what settings you put it on.
John Cena aprroves. 10/10 would attitude adjustment again.
Its really ing  because no inspect weapon nor knife
?
This was my first experience in  Spawned in altis life find two guys they shout at me to get on the ground I got on the ground they got my clothes off they  me they put me in their car they made me get out in the forest naked they ran me over 1000000 times   11-10 would get  again
great game
nemy reinforcements came in by heli team was pinned down CO calmly said that 'we're gonna be okay' right before a sniper blew his brains out. Then for the next 15 minutes we retreated to our Humvees and drove away fast from the AO while the medic frantically tried his best to treat the wounded (ACE users will understand).    ....Then our driver got shot the car flipped and blew up  10/10 Only in ArmA11

Piece of crap game
y first day in   -joins altis life server 2 minutes after buying -not knowing any controls -2 minutes into joining running away from armed people who were shooting at me -takes shelter in small house -turns around finds two people aiming guns at me -two people say 'SING KATY PERRY AND WE'LL LET YOU GO' -no mic -starts running -dies  -joins sandbox server -not knowing any controls -spends 3 minutes trying to find out how to jump -sees red suv -starts offroading -hits a tiny rock -5 meters in the air -car upside down -gets out of car to find quad beside it. my lucky day! -drives quad downhill -hits rock again sh*t -front flips 5 times no damage taken -finds helicopter -not knowing controls -finds out am professional at flying -sees a crane 5 feet away. sh*t -respawns -sees people racing in tanks -disconnects  -joins co-op server -everyone team killing at spawn -only one not team killing -kicked for not teamkilling  10/1011
his is the greatest military shooter / simulator you will ever play it has very realistic gameplay and functions and a plausable storyline but just calling things like cas and artillery and being able to do heli insertions and halo jump make this game amazing. 100000/1011
You might be able to maintain a stable 30fps in  with a Titan X.
Falls 3 feet Dead.   12/9 would fall again
My story- I was a young lad with a dream to play  i had a laptop at the time i got the game and all was fine until&lt; i played multiplayer i got 5 fps So i WASTED 1200 dollars to run it(it was well spent) and played it and it looks buetiful u have no idea what its like until u play it with max settings 60 fps on a server with 120 people on so overall get this game so u can waste all your money to play it and be proud :)
My friend just refunded  for buying farming simulator 15.
My brother doesnt talk to me because he is always playing with his friend andy.
e took a truck played I-Spy sang 'Wheels on the Bus' then got ambushed by a ing tank. I never laughed so ing hard at a game in my entire life. 10/1011
 have not played enough to judgeSo I guess ill have to play more to write a detailed review.11
This game is amazing you can never get bored because there is so much to do!!!!!! If your not into the mil sim try out Altis life or any other mods and there are so many servers with different stuff to play it's incredible. The community by the way is outstanding too! They are always coming out with new stuff! From the intense firefights in all their hundreds of game modes online and in campaign to the heart pounding drug runs in Altis life and other life mods this game is by far the best game I have played and will continue to keep playing throughout its series because this is seriously one of the best master pieces Ives ever seen! :)
hen I was in the third grade I thought that I was gay 'Cause I could draw my uncle was and I kept my room straight. I told my mom tears rushing down my face She's like 'Ben you've loved girls since before pre-k trippin'.' Yeah I guess she had a point didn't she? Bunch of stereotypes all in my head. I remember doing the math like 'Yeah I'm good at little league.' A preconceived idea of what it all meant For those that liked the same sex Had the characteristics The right wing conservatives think it's a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Man-made rewiring of a predisposition Playing God aw nah here we go America the brave still fears what we don't know And 'God loves all his children' is somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five-hundred years ago I don't know 11
asily the Garry's Mod of the simulation genre. Driven by community content and supported greatly by the developers via generous platform updates  is a game that is very difficult to get bored with as almost every game you'll play will be uniquely designed by players with the use of the game's powerful and easy to use scenario editor. The base game is less content rich than prior installments in the series but of a much higher quality enhanced through new post-launch features such as weapon resting and sling loading.  is an absolute must for anyone with even a passing interest in open world multiplayer; you don't need to love hyper realistic military combat to enjoy the wide selection of content on offer here.11
-Playing Wasteland -Buys a hellcat heli -Not the best pilot in the group of three -Has derp friend fly -Decide to do a mission -Starts flying -Few minutes in I see a little window that i can see the pilot through -Tells pilot -Pilot turns around and Lols -Sees ground getting closer through the window -Tells pilot we are about to crash -Pilot pulls up -Almost die 10/10 would look through window again
Shot a rabbit and it died. 10/10
The Game Is Amazing 10/10 Altis Life Is the Best Part Of It Though
Is toefte 11/10
Downloaded it when it was free for three days. Can't get rid of it now. Thank you Bohemia.
Do you like shooting brown people? Do you like planting IEDs? Do you like being shot out of absolutely nowhere while choking on 12 fps? Then I guess  is a good milsim. brown shooting simulator 2015
Altis Life: - Become a police officer - Arrest black people for no reason - Help drug dealers - Get your cut - Fired Wastelands: - Buy an RPG - Earn easy 72 virgins - Quit Takistan Life: - Talk in arabic - Guantanamo Bay next morning - Start Terrorist Organisation -  Nato
There is a lot of bullet shooters. Then there is a boom boom device. The best part all of the 43 year old virgins living in their mothers basements just trying as hard as they possibly can. I don't not reccomend
way this game has a F** 90% review ?!  i do not understand because this is most lovely game i ever played so i recommended it for u my friends this game has so many good thing buy this game guyes u gonna love this game  i already played 543 hour and I'll resume to play
Went on Atlis Life and it started to play Green Day! great start....Till some guy tells me hes Hijacking my Cat. 10/10 IGN would get told some guy is Hijacking my cat.
 neat game Ben Shaw approves.11
kay I have a lot to say about this game.  I LOVE the game - Well In theory. I run the game at medium settings at 1080p and i rarely get above 33FPS on by Radeon R9 280X OC Edition. THIS MUST BE SAID AND HEARD: -THE GAME RUNS LIKE **** Arma devs need to get their poop in the group an dfix this game optomization is Terrible. There are a lot of bugs and glitches. They seem to be adding more features like guns and vehicles but they need to focus on the ISSUES AT HAND.  The only reason i'm giving this 'thumbs down' is becasue it just has too many issues and that's a major problem. The game itself i really love.-11
I was ban in the first week of the game for no reason then the tards at battleye respond to my message with an automated bot!
DO NOT GET THIS GAME you will be able to play it for a couple days then battleye will read a false positive and global ban you without a refund or lifting the ban DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
IS has pretty much ruined the game now. Most servers relied on donator perks to get people to donate so they could keep up the good servers they were running. BIS has sent them all nice emails telling them that they would take legal action against them all if they did not stop. So now all the good server have gone to crap as they cannot afford to keep them up. Stay away from this game. Don't give evil companies like this any more cash to fund their greed. Shame on you BIS. What a shame it was a pretty good game despite your lack of any ambition to fix very well known bugs.-11
Tons of stuff for fans of all types of combat. It is a little glitchy and sometimes that guy JUST WON'T DIE!... but when you get in a nice firefight and win you will actually feel like you accomplished something unlike most 'war' games.
Great game but I think its too expensive
 played  it was good i enjoyed it11
some money i will always regret.
i dont even i have this game lol but any one can gift me it ;)
reat game. Knowledge of basic military strategy weapon systems and map reading are a plus if you are going to dive into this game.11
10/10 would waste 910 hours again
o I played Wasteland bought gun got killed respawned bought gun and yet again got pwned 1337/420 would blaze-uhm I mean play again!!!!!11
 haven't spent a LOT of time playing but so far I'm really impressed. Highly recommended :)11
n the last 15 years i played a lot of games from every kind of Genre. This game is so far one of the worst games i have ever played. Simply to say it is unfinished. Even when the Game Design is not bad this Shooter is an Bug &amp; Glitch Massacre.  Most of my time playing in Multiplayer i had to relog or to respawn cause of an Bug or Glitch. For an Studio which say that they have hundreds of workers this is a joke. The Map which i played on was mostly Altis and the enviroment was horrible. It Felt like they had a total amount of 100 enviroment assets for the whole map. The Ground you are walking on is painted in green or brown. Even when the Game got a lot of Mods which are repeating with small changes the Game is not worth buying it. This is my first Review because i normally dont have the desire to tell others my opinion but this time i had the intense feeling to warn you guys.   Total Rating: 2/10  Purchase not recommended     it is the Assassins Creed Unity of the Shooters.-11
Can fly helicopters better in this than project reality  10/10 reality
Really good. My favourites FPS/Shooter.
The game is really fun if you know how to play.
reat Very Simulation Must-Have.10
Nice Game.
his used to run like a hog on my laptop constant 5 FPS as it was bottlenecked by something I just couldn't figure out what it was. today I found out ARMA used my integrated Intel graphics and not my 960GTX. I changed to the 960GTX in the Nvidia control panel messed around with some settings and now I'm running the game at 45-70FPS.   My first 12 hours playtime is pretty much no playtimeI was trying to fix the FPS the whole time; and also tried to refund the game since I felt I bought a broken game.  I recommend this game on the sole purpuse that it now works.  100 hous later: it's really good and I love the huge mod scene great bang for the bucks.10
A game that combines the intensity of a combat situation with the fun an joy from and RPG. 10/10 would buy again.
 have played ARMA1 and ARMA2 both are excellent games with endless possibilities now with ARMA3 they just get better and better. If you like games that you can immerse yourself in and enjoy with friends then you will love ARMA3 just make sure you always watch your six cause the enemy is always closer than you think.10
Best game ever lots of game modes and server to play :D
his game is excellent and brings in a new view of realism. Through their growing development  has become a popular 1st person and 3rd person millitary simulation game across the planet.11
If you showed me a hillside I would probably know where it is.
Harm Ma D  just play king of the hill
Absolutely wonderful don't know what i'm doing half the time and its one of the most complex simulators i've ever played but still a deeply enjoyable and rewarding game to jump into i would recoemend the ARMA series to anyone but  is the pinacle and theres no need to play the previous games to play this one.
Possibly my favorite game to ever play!!! 10/10 would recommend to anyone!!!
great game really fun military game.
Only played with mods so far. Mostly CityLife RPG.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1_zH_CLmkY
Infinite possibilities:a mission goes wrong?An ennemi patrol on the way back?Do what you can't do in COD:change your plan...The game is always different
its ing sick
his game is worth way to much for how lazy the Devs Are. This is the Last game I am getting from this Dev Team. Jets are OP in the sense that they can spam explosive Cannons before you can even Render them in. And when you are in the jet it seems like the flares are usless. It seems like I have to pump a full mag into someone sitting still before they die Dsync plays a huge role. Mortors are to damn OP. You can spam the rounds from thousands of meters away and with little sound to find out where they are coming from. This is a Review based without the MODs SO take it as you will.-10
antastic game good pace tactical movement and clever AI. Impossible to play without a team working well together. Wish I picked this game up sooner!10
Wow.. dat graphics..
Amazing game had it for like 2 weeks and have 100+ hours
and the rest of the Arma series is best enjoyed with either a good organized and not so serious group or friends. Since this game lives by it's user created content there is an editor included that let's you create you own missions. Let those be small or large easy or tough you are the creator. Not to forget the steadily growing amount of user created mods. This game is a simulator (sometimes for walking long distances) so do not expect any arcadey gameplay you get shot you may live and treat your wounds or you may die instantly. Tactical thinking is the key here and running head on is mostly the wrong thing to do.11
this game adds up in money after you buy the game but it i more than worth it for the amount of mods they are out for this game
abies play call of duty kids play battlefield men play arma.11
The BEST military sim out there.  I will recommend this game to everyone that wants a military game. I have had this game for a year now and having played 2119H of its that just shows how good this game is.  is endless you have hundreds of games in one. The amount of mods out there is mind blowing.  You can not go wrong buying this game.    But there are some cons   1. Game engine sucks 2. FPS bug (takes you down to 1 to 2 fps and keeps you there) 3. The amount of time you are going to spend playing this game. 4. The price  If i list the pros STEAM will crash. GET IT YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY
Very Cool game but i believe it is over priced for what you get!
ried dropping down the ladder ended up 1km above ground parachuting. 10/10 would climb ladder down again.11
great game and great graphics would reccommend to anybody that likes war games but dont expect a call of duty easy to play game this is a co-op role play style of game you get your mission but you have to talk to each other to understand what you need to do
 have played well over 500 hours on  so believe me when I say that  is nothing like any 'war game' you've ever played. It takes a special love for games like this to enjoy it to it's fullest. In  YOU are it all. Transport helo pilot CAS pilot HMG Gunner Driver Grunt Commander. There is literally NOTHING stopping you from doing what you want You wanna make 30 planes battle it out as you watch? Do that . You wanna command an army bigger than any you can think of? in' do that . You wanna race around a track in a go kart? ING DO THAT  MAN!! With the freedom  gives you. It's damn near impossible to get bored and if somehow you do. You'll be back.11
gt;Plays  with mods Flies the Hind over Afghanistan Takes out 2 convoys a chopper and brings soldiers back to base Goes back to base to rearm and refuel Back into action and instantly gets shot down by anti-air Manages to land the craft safely Stranded with Ivan in the middle of hell with only a pistol Calls for evac Chopper arrives starts hearing shots Once in and flying back to base chopper narrowly evades a missile which explodes further Didn't expect that and nearly falls off my chair 10/10 would fly with Ivan again11
HEY!!! BOHEMIA!!!!!!! UPDATE DAYZ!!!!! Or els i will turn this into a thumbs down....
est times I have ever had have been in this game. Thank you 11
 dont like the way that that tank is looking at us' me and all of my friends lived that day.11
i really liked this game and the graphic really i love this game ??
hat can I say - MAXIMUM REALISM pretty much. Constant updating ability to mods and other great things makes it one of the must-plays if you play FPS games.10
mazing game always something to do. Graphics are fantastic but you need a good PC to get good frames with the amazing graphics.10
y experience in  so far:  Found 15.000 grant died came back to take my loot died again for the same guy. Respawn died a friend revived me revenge my death a jet killed both of us.  Conclusion: Abou the game all i have to say it's awesome. About me in war don't go!10
You will die from anything. Cars have no physics. They make no sense. Best sandbox game of 2013. 8/10
If you have a REALLY good Pc and can go on mods then it's great.  8/10 - Would get ambushed by IEDS and watch my friends legs blow off again.
This game is amazing unlimited possibilities and you can play for hours on any modded or un-modded servers the fun is endless because you could spend countless of hours playing single-player or multiplayer with the Ebola on the servers meeting new people.
reat game challenging yet can teach you a lot about teamwork and you can still have fun playing a game.11
Playing this on ultra=5-10 fps Playing this on high=10-15 fps Playing this on medium=15-20 fps Playing this on low=20-40 fps  IGN= 1000000000000000000/10
I spawned in 3 enemy squads then spawned myself on the other side of the huge island. Got sniped by a pistol right away. 10/10 would get shot again
After 7000 hours across the ArmA series I can officialy say.  its good man
i love this game but i was not abel to buy it because i do not have enought to afford it now and then but i got to play this game and it was the best game i had ever played i got to play it because it was free to play for the weekend one time and i played it non stop because it is just a great game and yes i would recommend this game to anyone who has free time on there hands and how like to kill people in games AND HOW HAVE A GREAT PC!! or els it will run that good.  12/10
Its ARMA
Wars can be won with no clothing
llow me to sum up this game for you:  HQ Command: 'Alright gentle men heres the plan Alpha team is taking the GhostHawk to the LZ from there they'll tr-'  Casual Player: 'sir uh-'  HQ Command: 'shut the  up it can wait till im done TREK in from the LZ to the target zone and lay down suppressive fire.

HQ Command: 'ING WHAT'  Casual Player: 'Daddy_Meme_420 hoped in the wipeout and eliminated both objectives..'  HQ Command: '...'  [Daddy_Meme_420 was kicked from server]11
Played this once.
I guess I got a few hours out of it.
This Game is good Never get tired of it GG 
one of the greatest games ive ever played. i love it
It's fantastic!
A must buy. 1.) the game is only $40 and comes with enough content to make up three games. 2.) The modding community is great and expands the game so much more. 3.) The game makes you feel as though you were in a real military situation and feels very fluid while doing so. Would recomend it to any who enjoys military themed games.
Swerved off a road by accident so the cops came and arrested me for transporting drugs  10/10 would swerve off the road again
I just love it! The perfect mil-sim if you ever want one!
Very polished gameplay mechanics and gunplay and also very detailed sound design like no other game.
Best game of millitary simulation it's really realistic
great game :)
Why are you reading this? Get it now.
Best shooter ever made...
erver browser is literally useless and the game runs like crap. The game basicly requires 3rd party software just to play LAN because the built in system doesn't work. I did some googling and I'm not the only one with this problem but they don't even acknowledge the fact that setting up a LAN party without downloading a bunch of malware ridden 3rd party apps is impossible.-11
This is an amazing game and recomend it to anyone that likes army simulation!
reat game reccommend buying it. Especially when you when you get it when its on sale. King of the Hill is a great game mode to play and the Battle Royale mod is also very fun.11
 killed around 60 people on a server before dying. I found myself often staring off into the distance for no reason. I found out this was called the thousand yard stare a symptom of PTSD. My doctor perscribed my some drugs.  Drugs are good so 10/10.11
It's a good games
i can write a review when i dont even have the game wtf
bsolutely amazing game played 919 hours of it and could not get bored!  10/10 (Even the DLC)11
Just Yes.
m extremely frustrated but at the same time extremely entertained. Cool cool.11
his is an amazing game WAY better than Battlefield!!! But kind of like it...  Pros: If you have Ultra on it looks like REAL LIFE  Vehicles  All kinds of Weapons  SO MANY MODS  Open world sandbox  Cons: Very hard to get on servers without wifi crashing or there being a problem  If you have an installed mod and the server doesnt have it you can't get on that server  56/60 Pretty damn good       11
I wish this game was a real life woman so that I could stick my  inside of her all day long I love you Bohemia Interactive I want to be the father of your children
Great Game. Played it for 4 hours straight in 1 sitting. Time flies so fast when playing this game. 11/10 IGN!
The best game ever I've played on steam
his is an awesome realistic game. The graphics are very good and game play is smooth with only a few lag spikes. As a server owner you have so many options to set missions and just how serious you want it. I would recommend this game very much...11
ve had nothing but problems and errors when trying to play this game and it's gotten to the point that I had to come here and rave about it because nobody online has a solution. I can't play the game for more than 10 minutes before my fps suddenly drops to 5 and stays that way until I restart my game or it crashes. I've tried everything I can to fix this and I cannot. Fix your damn game.-11
Over 1k hours and it's still a good game. Still bugs and glitches here and there butI guess it will be fixed soon.
t take some time to learn the basics but once you do.... FUN GAME! I personally recommend Wasteland servers.11
rilliant game not without its glitches huge mod base exile epoch etc etc. Really love the game.11
My favourite game of all time! This is true inspiration for a military simulator. Specially with zoombie added :p hehehe keep up the good work!
It's pretty good.
Like it worth it Buy it PLay it for a hole year Buy the DLC's play more Dowload mods play with friends have fun.
Great gam loads of fun
Really enjoying ! Would highly recommend this game. Tonnes of great mods in the workshop. Battle Royale is freaking amazing!
xcellent Game!! 10/10!!!  Escape from Altis on Elite difficulty with a friend or two is awesome!11
ealistic sounds and graphics with a touch of robot like radio chatter little bit buggy at sometimes but I recommend it to the people that like simulation games10
It's ok I guess? I have just finished the campaing.  Time to try online!
Anyone wanna join me on SimplicityGaming 1mil starting cash
 A good game whit altis life its PERFECT!11
hat do I need to say? Open World Sandbox Milsim... there is no Game like . Endless fun! But it's still a milsim do don't expect to do rocket jumps or such.11
Great Game! 10/10 Tottaly worth the price! played the game for nearly 1000hours now and its still great! i'd recommend it to anybody that wants to play a Roleplay and action packed game.
Very realistic! I love it!
Really good war simulator. It's realistic too :D
his game is so cool I really recommend it don't expect to get more than 60fps you will need a really beefy computer for this game11
his game is awesome definitely recommend11
0/10 Would learn 20000 Eden Editor Scripts again.11
ogs into Altis Life. Hears pew pew pew runs for life. When he thinks hes safe he gets robbed. Respawns and tries different controls out. Buys license for both car and gun. Buys gun and walks around decides to kill this man looking at him wrong. Shoots cop in the back and gets killed in 2 seconds. Gets gun again and runs around and kills 2 in a group before getting sniped. After 2 hours of grinding he gets 30k lockpicks and zipties. Walks into a drug deal unknowingly. Gets shot in the  and pays 10k for medic to revive. Gets a ride back to the city only to get shot again for trying to help someone out of their cuffs. Finds the gunstore after losing 2 hours of work prepared to rob people. Meets the guy who he was trying to help guy explains he had nothing to do with it. Gets shot in the head and is broke. By the same people. Destroys monitors and pc.  On a serious note: Its a game where you grind for hours. Pros: Realistic Beautiful Graphics Nice Player Base Nice Community Cons: You die from ONE bullet from a gun in the right place. I wish you would at least die from 2 to the head? 1 injuring you. Also its hard as  to find people shooting at you. As they blend in like a chameleon. So overall fun but know you will rage at one point.11
This the Best Game of all time.
ow I'm telling these son-of-a-es that we respect the Japanese of this country who are honest businessmen. And yeah this is the land of opportunity for legitimate business not for death merchants who distribute drugs to our children through schools and on the streets. Now I'm telling these s that if they continue killing our children to make their precious millions that they deposit in their secret Swiss bank accounts counselor before your last suit even gets off the court clerk's desk I'll have their stinking bodies in garbage bags and ship them back to Japan for fertilizer. Got it? And that was my experience in .11
f I had to delete my entire steam library and only have one game this would be the game.11
his game runs like 'RICHARD' on just about everything but it will be the funnest 'RICHARD you ever play with.11
attlefield: *Hit by missle only half kills me jump off skyscraper land on tank plant c4 run blow it sky high shot at by helicopter die.*   Arma: *Walking through a forest shot in the foot die.*   10/1011
the most realistic game ever created period   campaign - 8/10  modding community 10/10  general community 9/10   multiplayer 9.5/10  9.3/10    side note please check out stalker online  mod... i really need this.
If you like military soldiers and explosions with tactical movement this game is for you. it ahd action grerat mods and great multiplayer. teh campaign is awesome you get free soundtracks from  they are awesome!
Playing Exile Mod with Ryan Zombies  Spawn in meet up with friends Gear Up fufill mission. New mission find a Safe one friend dies forgets to eat other friend grabs their gear for them to spawn back in I push on. Get to mission site can't find safe someone gets it before me see fresh spawn in area try to talk to him sees fresh spawn die looks around find the murderers takes them out gets called a F***ing Hacker search their bodies they didn't find the safe either stay alert decide to headback to regroup. Find guy on the way to safe zone he is armed take him out just incase make it back to safe zone friends got off find sit down to log off 2 guys walk up and  on me.  10/10 R.Kelly Simulator
THE BEST military sim.  THE WORST game for people expecting a typical shooter.  MY FAVOURITE screw around simulator.  Seriously. Buy this game.
Very Fun game! Lots of things to do in this.
Yes  pros: ton better than arma 2 looks better ZEUS drones are cool tutorials actually help LITTLE BIRD  cons: you have to actually get your pilots license and serve 2-3 years in the air force to correctly fly any air vehicles and know what you're doing thats it
his game is very frustrating and satisfying at the same time. The main reason why I cannot recommend this game is that it is very buggy and full of glitches. The developers have not worked out many issues that are very big game changers that can really ruin the game for you. As a military sim it is pretty accurate and action packed but not very realistic at all. The physics in this game is really garbage. The singleplayer is more aggravating than fun no one really plays it. The vanilla  is unplayable the real fun is in the mods. With the amount of hours I have on this game I know much of the ins and outs of this game and I am appalled that it still isn't in alpha/beta with the amount of stuff wrong with it. The developers need to get back on this game and fix all the stuff thats wrong with it instead of coming out with DLCs that ruin the game even more.-11
1000 Played MEH!
ar war never change... except in the future.11
AI either misses every shot or noscope you across the map. -Changes your keyboard language to English (American) over all a kek/kek11
un game but not worth more than $20. Many bugs desync etc. Issues that were prevalent in Arma 2 but were never fixed.11
BANDON ALL HOPE!!!!   THE CHILDREN SAVE YOURSELVES!!!!!!!!!!!!  THE KEBABS ARE ALL AROUND US!!!!!!!!! 11

uy it JUST DO IT!  Have you ever had a dream but you couldn't never make it true? Don't give up just do it While other people fail you will be there trying hard to reach your dreams. Don't let your dreams be dreams JUST DO IT! BUY !11
Edit Graphic Settings Simulator 2015. 9.9/10 would edit settings again
Killed by 4 vehicles in 10 minutes 10/10
Wow Altis life &lt;3
NO faze clan  NO moms with camera   4.5/10 IGN needs MLG
eally good game very realistic and very fun. Great to play with a couple of friends or alone.11
 One of the few games that by the time you learn the controls you'll have Alzheimer's.  : One of the f11
as banned from dayz since they had battle eye cant play arma because ban was carried over from another game. Dont buy if you were banned on any battle eye server-11
Very complicated game. No one helps you in game they just kill you and tell you to learn to play... how can i learn to play when you keep killing me?  Don't buy this game.
played 250 hours before knowing you could rest your rifle
This is by the far my favorite game of all time. I love everything about it. From tactical online play to surviving the zombie apocalypse to creating your own base in editor and helping your AI companions defend it from an enemy onslaught. Its a bit of a steep learning curve and its very demanding on your PC but this game is the military game to end all military games.
bsolutely best game out to this day the modding is unbelievable community is great and long time player of bohemia titles!!11
11/10 would rdm again
Very fun.Can see myself playing hours on hours of this game
f you love shooting realistic modern wars this game is for you!11
it is so hard to find exile zombies
i am looking to be in the australian special forces so it is very very good
Great game with plenty of mods to keep things interesting
ith 965 hours of gameplay time i can honestly saythat this is 1 of the best games i ever got..... ive seen a lot of bad reports about people not knowing how to play it no tutorial graphics issues and all such things and to be honest it makes me laugh cos im playing it on a HP Pavillion desktop which is an office computer so it can be done  just need to go to settings and change a few bits also check the virtual Training its on the menu lmao..... if your into tactical realism BUY THIS GAME !!!!! if you like Call Of Duty then DONT BUY THE GAME!!! as this is not a lone wolf run around like an idiot a certain amount of ineligence is needed to play it if you buy it i hope you enjoy it as much as me11
ery fun game but hard to get use to when coming from a more basic type of FPS (Battlefield 4 CSGO Cod)11
I have one word for this game: Realistic.
Its just the best in the 'Military Simulation' genre. Even the vanilla only game is so much worth playing and the workshop is also very impressiv! Just awesome game and aawesome experience!
AWWWWWWWWWWWW YESSSSS BABY!!! GIMME DAT 2KM RUN SO I CAN GET SHOT HALF WAY THERE! Very nice! 10/10 would bang again.
Joined Exile sever. Found a 8 year old kid. Kid says 'Im looking for a good teammate that is not a 3 year old' I call him a hypocrite. He asked what a hypocrite was. I told him to google it. I left the server Came back next day. Says 'banned for being rude to an admin'  10/10 -Would be rude again.
reat military sim probably the best one I've played runs well. Few bugs here and there but overall 9/10  PS this game is bad if you are in a loving relationship.11
is best game for shoot
o I truly love this game its a boots on the ground super realistic Military simulater. I put about 80 hours into it in about 6 dayhs which is a decent ammount even w/ school but there is one flaw... I CANT RUN THIS GAME FOR . Even the the LOWEST setting possible the resolution on 1280 by 720 and 4:3 normal I still can barley clinch 20 fps on a 80 player King Of The HIll server........ AT SPAWN... dont even get me started about the actuall battle. Now part of that problem is the host just being lazy and getting the server files from someone else and not taking the time to optomize the game for everyone not just me. The other half the beefy  engine that the game is on which my make the game stunning yet it nearly crashed my pc. I tried playing single player and it make about a 10fps difference... I just wish Bohemia could make some optimize changes thats all. to back up my claim here is a really good video that goes into alot od depth of my topic.    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cYNcnJvWH4)  THANK YOU TO THE MAKER I DIDNT MAKE THE VIDEO!!!! -10
Love it.
AWESOME GAME! Played 60 hours in less than 2 weeks just on one Tanoa Exile server!
Most realistic military online multiplayer game !
...
its a great game i love altis life and life its one of the best games that i have ever played
reat game not only a military sim but can also be modded to a life server etc the results are endless fun game countless hours played11
Really great
 is a nice military simulator and is very realistic.
Best Military game out by far.
ittle laggy but over all a great war simulator.11
Good game just need the DLC in order to play anything
The Best.
 buys    joins altis life server   nerd tries to rob me   shot the mother er right between the eyes   cops see me   gets arrested for defending myself   sent to jail for 30 seconds  10/10 would defend myself again
TOP QUALITY!  SO MANY MODS TO USE FOR THIS GAME IT'S WORTH THE BUY.
very cool very nice very fantastic i like it
Buy respectable PC Play medium settings at 28 FPS  get used to it play altis life make friends die rage 420/69 would restart process
is a love hate relationship: best mil-sim ever and one of the worst engines ever brought into creation.    is the most versatile military simulation available and the multiplayer modes are endless. This is the true PC experience when it comes to sheer scope and magnitude. I have put the most hours into this game when it comes to FPS games in the last decade and will continue to play it until the next ARMA comes out.   On the other side of the matter ARMA is the WORST optimized game I have ever played. It barely makes use of more than one core which effectively makes all GPUs moot and runs at a terrible framerate for everyone. It is beyond ridiculous that any developer would be ok with the absolutely horrible optimization that this engine has. It is really so bad I am having a hard time putting it into words. ARMA has bad optimization for the days of dual cores never mind for today's standards. It is completely embarrassing for the developers to have this shoddy excuse for an engine in 2016. With that being said I love this game and I hate the engine with a burning passion.11
Best military simulation game on the market.
Excellent game! Would recommend to all serious-approach gamers who seek real-life adventures.
his game might not scale well with high end hardware but if installed on an ssd and view/object distance is set right everything else can be cranked right up to the max and it runs very smooth(usually 60+) unless playing on certain multiplayer servers.  Arma III is worth every penny even at full price.11
Recently got this game first game nightime match learning the game could not see a thing went to the combat zone trying to move useing stealth thinking there has to be a way to see try pressing N (guessing n for nightvison) worked and there was a guy infront about to shoot me I panicked somehow I managed to kill him guessing from a headshoot. 10/10 would press n agian.
HELP! I THINK MY GAME IS BROKEN I CAN\'T HEAL AUTOMATTICLY BEHIND A TREE!!!!
HOW TO PLAY ------------------------------ -join the altis life server  -go an atm and withdraw 5000 $ -buy some clotes and an atv -go and cross the line between securet area and pvp area - you see road blocked  -yu understand nothing -suddenly some guys make circle around yu -they take everythink on yu and put yu in a car -yu arriveed to the mountain at nowhere -they  yu hard  -take your two kidney  - again  -leave yu middle of the nowhere without food and water... -die  -repeat it  true story.....  15/10
ltra Settings FPS 40-50(like 4 years ago need pc upgrade)  This game is really fun many mods worth the pre-purchase - 2016 3 Oct You will get frusterated thoe if you play hostiletakeover lots of campers and noobs yes its a realistic game but red team does every game is camp in the middle tower or underneath around it. Really fun thoe11

i worked on my mac
ok so im new and hav no idead what the  to do
so realilistic unlike cod hehe
Too Bad I Can't Run It 8000/10 IGN
ought this game for $40USD spent 12 hours installing mods so i could play dayz and king of the hill only to find out that i have been battle eye banned on arma 2 for installing some  hack tried to refund the game NOPE because i had spent 12 hours installing mods tried to put the game on another steam account NOPE got the same message no matter what i did i got THE SAME ING MESSAGE its like steam support are a bunch of bots! do i recomend the game? well i don't know i haven't been able to play.11
eh it's cool but not thaaaaat cool..   haven't spent much time on it11
its good
~King of the Hill Step by Step~~   step 1: Find a server you and your friends want to join. If you don't have friends......

Bought it. Liked it. Addicted to it. I have a problem now.
One of the most realistic military actions games I've ever played. Never ever will your aim will be perfectly steady like CoD. Strongly recommend this game.   Oh yeah and you can kill rabbits. Got my money's worth
reat game hard to resist11
Best realisitic military simulator out on the market in my opinion
Once an Arma fan. Always an Arma fan. No matter how many times I get Arma'd.
this is a great game but very unoptimized and to cpu dependant

UI covered with Must-Buy-Apex. No option to remove Apex DLC. /Uninstall
10/10 Would get blown up online again.
pretty good game but the game engine is  :)
o personally my favourite game of all time.I love the emersionlove the gunslove the vechiles and the beutiful campaign.By now I have played +1000 hours of .Since 2014 I have played it.BUT I would love an AAF or CSAT campaign.If you don't know there's three faction NATOCSATAAF and FIA and civialians.Every faction has a specific gun and vehicles and unlike Battlefied which I have aslo loved dearly.Now go buy it.Frame rate might be terrible or good or bad but it's a   15/10  11
I tried this game for a free weekend It was good :) Pros Co-operative Multiplayer Open World No Exo Suits Cons FPS (around 20-30)
Amazing war simulator! Lov it! :*
einstalled my entire Steam which uninstalled ALL off my games and their deep-in saves.  Still having a staling que download glitch when trying to install   10/10 would waste money again.  - - - -  EDIT: i swiggity swoodied for that apex booty all gud k?11
No game like it a must for your library
only men can play arma
ey that's pretty good. 11
his game is a beautiful PC exclusive experience which boasts itself to be a openworld sandbox type which it true. But that does not matter if the game can't give me above 25FPS on a modded server with 30 players. Dont get me wrong I was exited about this game and its single player performance is awesome but the mutiplayers preformance is sub par. If you are buying this game for the mutiplayer don't. Its not worth it.  Modable and customizable to the extent that you can turn this game into a dating sim: YES  Get above 30 FPS while doing that: NO  P.S: I have a GTX 970 and a i5-4690 and I played this game on high (25 FPS) then standard (34 FPS but looks very bad) and lowest settings (57 FPS looks like a 2006 game) settings in mutiplayer mode on a  UN MODDED  server with 50 players. -11
shoots dude in the collar-bone twice doesnt die  gets shot in the leg once dies  10/10.1 for realism
i dont actually have this game
Not worth the money. -_-
The best military sim I've ever played.
hat i said below is useful for the single player and MP has playable framesbipodsthough some rock formations arent deployable that look like they should and i should be able to deploy a bipod when leaning on a door or a hallway(dev buildthis could change) in the way you would want.Even on TDM no killing desync but i cant join %90 of the servers and its because i have a later version of this game on accidentit may be battleye client thinking if im afk on multiplayer for too long.In Arma 2 OAi would be just fine after disabling mods though i can join a server in Arma 2 OA and i guesstemp download the mods or maybe permantely though if bohemia is too lazythey can renable if i have them in folder and im joining a server that requires 3rd party mods.Plusabout  it dosent matter which profile i use or if its new though if im rightthen bohemia should fix it or scrap it for user punishments (WHEN A ADMIN ISNT AVAILBLE THOUGH THERE CAN BE A VOTE FOR HIM though i think this is in arma 2 OA) were theres a admin chat everyone can use if theres no admin to state why they are voting to ban/kick someone.For the noclippers have beacons with usernames near them that any player can choose who plusbe able to spectate them butsince that can reveal a FOB or a couple of snipersmaybe not.For tkershave auto-slays that end in a day ban if you tk 5 times.Same for spammingsame text 3 times and a day ban.This last one may be a strech because i think cheaters broke this butif a shot hits from 1.5 clicksthat should be a auto MP ban for 2 months or if possiblehave a software search thats connected by playwithsix so theres no false positives say you need to remove from  folder.Or they can do what the battlefield series does but have you stats stored on your hard drive and use the BIS forums or valves servers and salvage thier stats or auto-ban(obvious) especially when the game can keep track of stats which should be easy to find and have users decide if they feel the need to ban or kick based on ip or key ban which battleye already uses or VAC ban but with the famliy sharing exploit which could likely be solved by using steam id and having games or linking to anti-cheatsgo through and check for kicks/bansuse ip bans for now and if no one comesa admin will get a alertand do the job and last but not leasthave a you were killed by and be able to copy/paste his name on notepad or chat and username automatically get sent to BIS valveoryour MP files called supicious players but then againpeople have to type -nologs to make multiplayer playable.  now lets talk about content.Yes it is a shame bohemia didnt just port thier arma 2 units to A3 standards but the real outrage IMO is no base Shotguns(pump action manual reloadthink over and under) knives and sniper rifles that actually have the model turning the bolt because wef shows it dosent have to eat away at performance and Armor interiors butother dev teams shy away from the idea but againtheres mods for it.    MOD SORTING SOLVED BY LAUNCHER.But still not a script saver to copy and paste to but on to the launcher yesthere are mods even for this but i shouldnt have to use this and  sync says there are no 'Bursts'IMPORTANT:DONT INSTALL THE ARMA 2 HARRIER PORT i googled Cha_FFAR_Smallpod IF YOUR CURIOUS  go to the launcher or steam properties and the set launch options and copy/paste this '-nosplash -cpuCount=8 -exThreads=7 -maxMem=8192 -MaxVRAM=2047 -nopause -nologs -world=empty -skipintro' and inyou will find something similar in the launchergo to  documents and  config and gpu max frames ahead and detected frames=1 triple buffering=1 the last thing that will help os the Day0forum post though make malloc-system and make a system restore point or see if not installing git hub works because i think it froze the account i put it on if you are doing the give me moar frames trick and google  -tbbmalloc for other ram utilization scripts or  the script i gave you or part of it(or maybe use  mod present launcher). I also found getting rid of ambient occlusion and bloom helped me(gtx 750) or you could try the launcher.for additional help  http://steamcommunity.com/app//discussions/14/810939351076832527/    In team deathmatchwith 100-120 playersnever drops below 20 and can get to 30 or 40 fps which is smoother than it sounds because desync is gone except if in choppers and theres a ground war but your not getting killed over it though watch youtube to judge. (Gtx750latest driversrefer to day0forum postyoutube and arma launcher options) (this dosent work as well on AMD chipswtf bohemia)  The ai has had a improvement from my last statement by not shooting through the smokesometimes branching off and flanking more but they are still hit or miss on taking good cover(they do so about %60 of the time and thier skill is all the way up and persion is self-explaintory) and even shoot out in the open without running to flank(in squads) or in short bursts only.In the woods(dev buildthis could change)they dont or barely take cover behind rocks but reliably on trees.In urban enviromentsthey dont go up another story unless you tell them to and they need to not see ahead of them and then lean . Previously they did and did not take cover and seems to react to you faster than arma 2 meaning they arent on a slow swivel chair they dont to flank you unless there are more of them or there are many objects in the waythough dead accurate past normal but you can make custom ai settings and there GL5(Group Link 5) which is a arma ai mod that the team has been making since operation flashpoit check armed assualt info and armaholic for mods and check  then islands and you'll see porting tools and if you dont like altis and stratis there will be maps for itit usualyl takes modders 2-3 years to make a good map though i see 20-30 on armaholic.   last thing about single playerif you like ithate the campaign and zeuseither download the dyamic universal war system which dosent try to build a situation at buildings or thick woods so its as random as can be so it could be plainsor literally 1000+ senarios to be surprised mutiplayer has enough people playing on zeus servers or sector control  and domination though admittedly its mostly altis life and team deathmatch and battle royale(taking weapons on the ground and killing contestants with zones you will be auto killed in). SOME OTHER ISSUES:3rd person retical is not %100 precisemore like %70 and the new sounds are almost the same error log of mods'IMPORTANT:DONT INSTALL THE ARMA 2 HARRIER PORT i googled Cha_FFAR_Smallpod IF YOUR CURIOUS and dont install anything CHA related including mi24 use this video to respawn ai and zeus handles mp respawning if  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bpX-s7rPII  and for ai  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha0wPNZF1GI -11
i love this game but i hate how i buy the dlc bundle and i dont get apex its stupid i already payed money for the dlcs but i dont get apex other than that this is a great game
his is probaly my favorite game now as much as i love it you basicly need i5 6600k And up to run it good But besides the terrible Optimization its the best game ever! i love it so much cant wait to get my new pc so i can play more :)10
it's got nowhere near as much content as arma 2 but with an engine that's leagues beyond arma 2's operate hard 
 have been playing Arma since the days of Arma 1 and I must say  is a must for people looking for a intense open world military simulation. This milsim has and will keep getting better for many people of many ages due to mod support. Mod support is a huge part of the Arma series. These mods can include maps airplanes helicopters and so much more. Also there are full mods that change the experience for players like ACE3. The multiplayer community is huge. With many different game modes like  'life' mods which is like a RPG. There is so many things to do.  Players looking to create there own missions there is a mission editor that is both simple and complex for people who want to make detailed missions. Eden Editor makes the editor ever more amazing with a visual of the land to place items where you exactly want it.   The game already has enough content by it self but adding mods of your choice from Steam Workshop and other sites makes this game a must buy for milsim players.10
Yes. Just yes!
Not Bad
Its the third best game to buy if you have a pc ever. Army simulator with an amazing multiplayer
SO many mods to little time!
ealistic military sandbox with a decent campaign and excellent mod support from Steam Workshop and third-party sites. Multiplayer is even better with popular mods such as Exile Altis Life Battle Royale and much more.10
Best game ever its very realistic but I have one down side not very good graphics but i still recommend it
It's fun and good but trust me you need some mods to have extreme fun
This mess of DLC ads gave me PTSD!
f your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if your looking for an outstanding lemon bars recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1) 2 cups Flour 2) 1/2 cup Sugar 3) 1/4 teaspoon Salt 4) 2 sticks (1 Cup) Salted Butter Cut Into Small Cubes 5) Filling 6) 1-1/2 cup Sugar 7) 1/4 cup Flour 8) 4 whole Large Eggs 9) Zest And Juice Of 4 Medium-sized Lemons 10) Powdered Sugar For Sifting  Directions:  1. For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch pan with butter.  2. Stir together the flour sugar and salt. Add the butter to the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut it all together until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press into the prepared pan and bake until golden around the edges about 20 minutes.  3. For the filling: Stir together the sugar and flour. Crack in the eggs and whisk to combine. Add the lemon zest and juice and mix until combined. Pour over the crust and bake about 20 minutes.  4. Allow to cool in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours then sift powdered sugar over the top before cutting into squares.  (Use an 8 x 10 pan if you'd like the layers to be a little thicker.)11
his game is probably the most realistic war simulator in which you play as an individual I've ever played with. If you want a war simulation exxperience with an endless number of possibilities then this game is for you. Howewer the game is not for everyone. IT IS NOT a 'run-and-gun' kinda game never was never will be. For me it's fun exciting entertaining as well as performance friendly. I've a middle-high end PC and I can run the game on tweaked ultra with no problem at all. Nice one ;)11
its good.
Arma 4 will be most realstic game ever for years
This game is the true PvE!!! You have more chance of getting kill by going againts a bush than by another player!!  10/10 would recomend to true PvE masters!!
You haven't experienced true warfare until you see an M4 Schorcher get launched half a click in to the air and land on an entire squad of friendlies all because the barrel clipped a stop sign.
lays Battle Royale mod: Ears get  as I'm getting shot going down a staircase. Plays Life mods: Either getting kidnapped or trying to create chaos.  Would get kidnapped have ears  or be Joker of Altis again!  10/1011
 found this game very fun n' stuff life now worth living people worth killing es worth looting. I'm gonna kill everything I see unless its a bunny rabbit.11
PVP - Easy Mechanics - Easy Walking up stairs - WTFSDJSKALDJSLAK IS THIS DIFFIULTY  10/10 would play again
eriously one of the best military shooter games ever. There is so much you can do on this game there are plenty of mods for it a great community super realistic just overall a great experience. There are a lot of controls but google can help you out if you are in the middle of a fight and want to figure out how to do something. I seriously keep learning something new every time i play this game. Best investment i have ever made. Battlefield COD none compare to this game.11
Great game! Truly amazing.   (Plays very poorly with an AMD X4 750k) (Plays Very well with an Intel i5 4690)
I can't play multiplayer it just sits there on the browse server screen without any servers!!!
Great military sandbox or 'tactical shooter' or whatever you want to call it. Dumped 900hrs in KOTH (King of the Hill) alone and will certainly dump another 900 in it. Great modding and multiplayer comunity.
he best military sim sandbox highly recommended after over 1000 hours enjoyed.11
Yes yes very good
his is the best Milsim game out there very emersive and detailed. Alot of polish and beatiful game mechanics. Endless comunity content. One of very few games that are worth this price tag.11
The new apec map is awesome! They really did a good job with this one. Its big. Its jungle. Its everything! Dayz overpoch mod on this map would be awesome!!
If you want a good buy this.
450hrs .... not alot by some standards but too many according to my missus... lol love this game ... in a class of its own thanks to modding community.. A++++++++
irst before i got my pc i ranted to my friend why he was always playing arma3 and it can't be that good.  I was wrong11
It's a battlefield like game! On a huge map. And with RPG games! Awesome
 purchased  following on from the amazing arma 2: OA. Its a better solid game but it lacks in some ways.     Good Features11
This game is amazing! highly reccomend getting battle royale for it
i couldnt select yasuo 10/10 worst ing game deleted
this game is sow cool
Have sunk almost 800 hours into this game. Love everything about it.
This game is brilliant in almost every respect except for the price of the Apex map expansion.  Too damn expensive.
Good game when I first brought it. Spent soo many hours on it but lately it has been really dead tbh.
is a very tactical 1st person and 3rd person shooter and has quite beautiful graphics (if you have the right graphics card. One of the aspects of this game that I like is not just being able to rush into battle guns blazing. You have to think about where to attack when to attack ect. Anyway I can't express how much I love this game. GET IT!10
The best game out of the Arma Series so Far! I have played around 106 hours of  So far so you could say Im a beginner. I was not a big fan of Arma 2 But this one is Phenomenal. Graphics are Amazing. This game will give you with an adrenaline rush every time you play! Worth Every Penny.  If you dont have it BUY IT NOW!
This is onw of the greatest Games i ve Played.. Period So immersive
Love this game. Would recommend to anyone who has played the ArmA series.
really really really boring when boring really good when good.   9/11 - IGN too much millitary
amzing worth evrey pound payd
amazing game if you like tacticle very very realistic shooters this is perfect very impressed I love it.10
fter optimalizing patch for arma its really playable and nice game. Mods and community making this game great is huge! Recommended for anyone who wants to try something different from any other shooters simulators. 10/10 would buy again.10
0/10 would bomb a friend who then said 'mum?' again.  In all serious this is one of the very select few games i would give a 10/10. cant find much thats bad about it other than optimization and occasional buggyness.10
ne of the best PC games for hardcore military sim gamers. The editor it comes with is a brilliant idea with endless possibilities. You will never get bored.   Couple of things I don't like about .. one is the AI I don't play online so my opponent is the AI. It's dump! Like really dump. Yes they go and get a cover when you shoot at them but you can hit and kill one of them and the next guy close wouldn't notice!!   It's not a show stopper but I wish the focus more on the AI ad get it to a level where it can behave like Metal gear solid for example.   If you like military sim then this is a bench mark for such games. It does require heavy PC though.10
Arma III is a great game that can be played intill you die. Arma has seemingly limitless game modes which has made the game imposibble to be bored of.
is a great game tons of community content as well as multiplayer servers that will keep you playing forever.10
This is by far one of the best games i have ever played with friends.
I really enjoy this game. The multipayer is fun to play with friends. I recomend this to anyone that likes fps.
I say my self that its real good for being in realistc combat if you dont like games where you cant run forever or cant slide on walls than you shouldn't by this buy i say that if you are into military simulators that you should and its fun with roleplays
rilliant game love it!!!10
Great game thats all to it
This Game is a great its open and non stop gaming
reat game great physics great controls love flying Can't fly for 10
eally great game they're working on better optimization for enhanced multiplayer gameplay.11
best game and for all the mods ever !
ne of the best games i've ever played Very fun with friends and mods.11
Best military simulation game ever saw in my life
  RATING 8/10  Why 8? Brilliant fun game with a variety of mods and gamemods providing alot of fun alone or with friends. However downside is FPS is  and has a big learning gap if you have never played Arma 2 or Dayz SA  Gamemods: The game has a brilliant single player and loads of gamemodes from KOTH Battle ROyale. DayZ Exile and wasteland also altis life. There is no chance of being bored!!!!!  DOWNSIDES: 1.)FPS 2.) Desync 3.)MODS are hard to download i recomend A3 Launcher to make your life easier  I Recomend you Should Play.... 1.)KOTH 2.)EXILE 3.)ALTIS  I ONLY RECOMEND THIS GAME TO PEOPLE WITH GOOD GAMING PC'S AS ITS A STRUGGLE TO RUN11
ll i want is a good Zombie base building Exile modded server...11
New update destroys my internet when i quit out of  now. but still a good game
THIS GAME ROCKS!! IM NEVER GET MY GRADES UP!! Maybe Ranked up :D The Best Game i ever had!!
t's good it's fun11
If anyone can get me a free copy of this game that would be AWESOME and much appreciated and Ill give you something in return.
awesome game! if you play vanilla you are missing out tho! its like BF4 hardcore on steroids
he combat is intense and fun. Pretty much everything that drives flies or floats you around is awesome. The landscape is really great I just love it (it was made in 2013 but still). I would buy it again for the mods alone.  I'm also the worst person on earth to write reviews so f*** it. I'm out.11
Can somebody message me and give me a key for this game?
f you are looking for one of THE most realistic WAR games this it.  It's got everything up to flying a plane and being dirty on the field.  All up to teamwork with 20 players or just being alone with your Sniper rifle at 2.5km Shooting people in the face.  You should deff. get this game. GET IT. NOW.11
 is one of the best open world games i have ever played. It has a wide variety of gamemodes and mods for everyone. unlike Arma 2 its graphics have hade a massive step up and the first person is a whole lot smoother not like arma 2 choppy first person.
 masterpiece. With the infinite amount of content amazing textures and deteals huge map fun DLCs and amazing controls this game is one of the if not the best games on the market to this date. I've put 72 hours roughly into this game and it still keeps bringing me back for more. Between Altis Life Wasteland amazing workshop content and DLCs/Campaign there is no stop to the endless things this game has to offer. The team based strategies of Wasteland Multiplayer are amazing. You find awesome people in team speak and after the server I always find myself adding more and more people to my friends list. With the excitement of finding enemy weapon crate stashes abandoned helicopters and tanks a huge fight between Opfor and Blufor teams and if your lucky a jet is something that always makes me want to play Wasteland 24/7. if you are reading this review and are deciding on wether to buy this game or not there are many things to take into acount. This game will not be very much fun with a bad/mediocre computer. Although the computing power demands of this game are high please buy this game and you will find how fun and exciting everything about this game is. Thanks for reading.11
ames way 2 hard 2 play u need to get a college degree in arma just to be ight in this game.-11
f you want to feel paranoid go buy this game. Even rocks scare the living  out of me! D: PS SEA Servers are mostly Thai Pinoys Indo and Vietnam people.... I learnt new languages everyday.... I R8 8/8 M8 GR811
Walked for 5 hours  Get killed by a wall  10/10 would walk again
God is real
RAPHICS 10/10 GAMEPLAY CONCEPT ATMOSPHERE 0/10 ... Piece o' sh*t waste of money.. ARMA2 was way better!-10
 spent four hours today blowing myself up running at people with the starter pistol you get and driving some guy around that I didn't know whatsoever for approximately 1 hour of that time. I don't think he knew where we were going I don't think he cared he just didn't want to be alone. I repaired that Offroader more times than I could count and I finally wanted to talk to him to break the 60 minutes of silence we had together. Turns out you can't talk in game more than 3 times on a server because if you do you get kicked. I got kicked. 10/10 would drive around for an hour with a guy I don't know and get kicked the moment I say something again.11
I really like this game because ITS like real life
Get this game if you are straight!
reat game filled with different aspects that always keep you entertained. Their are many different gamemodes to suit the needs and taste of everyone.The military simulator touch that Arma 2 used to have is a bit gone in  since the newer game is a bit more arcade shooter style than a strict simulation. Althought it lost it's little simulator touch it is still really realistic and this is what defines Arma. Every little detail of zeroing gun ballistic and new weight system vehicle damage and way more makes it the great game it is without forgetting about the nice community it has. By putting multiple bricks together you can make a solid house and this is what  is. Sure every house has their downsides but overall they remain well built.10
est warfare sim ever! Loved everything about it! The gameplay the AI the mechanics the spec ops who will put one through your eyes before you get a chance to reject... So after 3 times trying you just get your bazooka of your back and put a rocket between there teeth... Realy good times! I really recommend this game!10
iest game ever when i try to go multiplayer it gives me the ing option for   bootcamp and i can select yes or no and when i select no it doesn't do a singel  and when i select yes it pus me in this mothering bootcamp
ot only is it possibly the best Arma game due to its incredible editor but also one of the best looking games with big open areas.  Though if your going to try to play with complete strangers in modes like king of the hill and wasteland its a bit hard as almost 80% to 90% of the servers are dominated by passwords ( they are passworded because clans don't seem to trust anyone outside of their nerd realm)  and the ones that aren't are still a bit fun but can get INCREDIBLY laggy and are usually packed ( probably due to all the password locked servers :P). And if you try to use the quick join tactic it only tells you that your preferences or filter needs to be changed or something like that and possibly the most useless DLC since Horse armor ( like markesmen DLC which gives you more sniper rifles the Kart DLC which lets you play Mario Kart if Mario Kart had death at every corner the heli DLC wich obviously gives you more helis and last but NOT least is Apex which in this case is worth getting but its about $34.99 at the moment it gives you a new map new story a bunch of guns and a big and beatiful map called Tanoa with jungles and cool looking places all on a groupe of islands).   Though besides the DLC the game is still fun to play especially with friends and the Mods oh man the mods :D are so good like C.U.P's mod World War II units  Esseker (though it only looks really good at higher settings and even at High its a bit laggy though im pretty sure the creator made it to be played on Ultra anyway) and possibly the best Iron Front which is like World War II units but it gives you all the stuff of World War II like the tanks planes ships etc.  Anyway if you have a ton of friends who like realistic games as much as you do and also like fighting eachother with armies of A.I in a pretty good looking game with epic mods and one epic but arguably outrageously priced DLC and with a cool 3D editor than this is the game for you.   P.S please make more servers for the none clans people.10
Great game overall! It depends on what you play though. I personally love Wasteland but other gamemodes are great.     Best aspect is the military simulation
Very good game 10/10
tf it still says im 1.58 when all the servers are 1.64 how do i make it update ;(-11
This game is by far one of the best simulation games I have ever played.  can bring a fun experience that most games can't even compare with.  My Rating: 9/10
8.5/10
Just....this video should explain it all:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B0lwO8rpXc
Best Military Shooter there is
This game is absolutly amazing. Would recommend this to anyone!!!!!
One of the best combat sims out there! Worth any penny....
Although the game in multiplayer isnt the best considering optimisation it is a perfect game for a group of people that want to play a variaty of different MODs around life and army
this is the best war simulation
ou gotta have a pretty good computer but worth it either way10
It is so fun!!!!!!
 Love this game it is absolutely fantastic. There are some servers that are HC realistic some that aren't then you even have servers that are completely custom. One minute you can be playing a zombie survival next minute it's a huge FFA (even duo s) RPG/Life servers. It's got it all not to mention the amazing graphics and sound realism.   I would say it's best played with friends but plenty of people around to make friends and enemies with. Would recommend the game 100% huge step up from Arma 2.10
on't waste your money. The game has been out for 2 years and there are still bugs and glitches with even the smallest of things in this game. Especially with collision detection. Knowing most will buy this game to play Altis Life the only time you will have good FPS when playing online is if you have a fast connection and a fast PC. Avoid if possible. Would be a good game if it wasn't so broken and badly optimized.-11
o realistic that I think real life is fake.11
10/10 would rate 10/10 again
Really good lots of fun and plenty of servers for everyone
just like dayz cant build a game for there life lagg clunk clunk awfull game down to 14 fps at times on any setting and dont give any crap about your pc int up to it  bad port crap
Exellent multiplayer and a lot of mods to play.If you have someone to play this game like a friend its 10 times better than normal.But it has some bugs and some problems. 8/10
game is ok and all but if you expect it to be realistic then you are wrong have fun emptying more than half of your mag into a guy 50m away and he lives
The game is realy good. Play only with Friends
i want the badge
mazing game alot of realism in that.10
ArmA is life
ery realistic military game easy to mod most fun with friends10
ne of the best games that I have ever played with endless replayability thanks to the modding community.10
 is good. Buy and you will not get dissipointed.
10/10 in terms of MilSim
reatest game of all times lots of fun and great times with mates.10
This game is as awesome as it's performance isnt. But I still recommend it to all my friends
really sick game 10 out of 10 memes here
the possibilities in this game have no limitation
great game 5/5
1000+ hours  pretty good game if you ask me
y favorite game overall mainly because of the people that play it but also how versitile it is. You want to role play? You want to do MilSim? You want to wreck some noobs in Wasteland/KOTH? This is the game for you then. And the developers are awesome aswell10
I suck major balls at this game but its really fun with friends even if you get dicked every time you make progress in Wasteland.  I recommend you have a beefy as  PC unless you want 3 fps every time you take fire.

uper fun game to play with friends! If you can handle the graphics they look amazing and the first person view experience can get rough at times!10
Great game. I only have played really Battle Royale and it's been way worth the price. I picked it up on sale for $20 and have over 100 hours now. The game is getting a bit dated and with the release of newer Battle Royale type games there aren't that many people playing as before but it's still really fun. I look forward to more games like this or trying out the new 'Exile' mod or something like that.
Wanna be immersed? Wanna play a phenomenal realistic military sim? Wanna blow up your friends with meteors in a DM/GM type setting? Then this game is for you!
awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Looked into it. Seems nice.
can you play this on mac
Is an ok game to be perfectly honest with you :)
is a game with endless possiblities and new adventures  its constantly updated and 2017 to 2018 roadmap looks amazing . Saying that its constantly modded by the huge community that plays the game. That was the pros  their are some cons though. Like if you are not willing to pay for dlc's this game is not for you . Most the large updates include / mainly are dlc based and struggle to play the game without them  i dont know how i feel about them because Bohmia interactive puts a lot of work into the dlcs however at points it does seem and feel a bit EA (money hoeing). The  community is massive and VERY competative this leads to a harsh community and as a server owner i can vouche for the fact that people will take you down a peg for their own good . In addition its playable with lower power rigs however the experiance wont be as pleasurable . To conclude  i recommend Arma3 for its wide pros however warn people with a small wallet lots of dlcs to catch up on :) Charlie bravo cheese cake out10
reat graphics Great Inmersion Great Game. although a little difficult at the beginning and hard to master but a great game either way10
 love  so much! I think all the addons/mods you can get are amazing such a current big fan of King of the Hill and  Life!10
3/10 Needs more realism - IGN
layed it a few quite nice overall.10
L;DR: Bad optimization but amazing graphics Fantastic versatility though lacking in total content a bit lacking on equipment but overall enjoyable 9/10   Lets start with the infantry combat 9.5/10  I LOVE the infantry combat in A3 it is incredibly immersive and intense. One of my biggest issues in shooters is movement it always feels too restrictive in this case the different ways in which I can move and lean in order to stay in cover or provide a good shooting position are fantastic. The recoil and the fatiuge although irritating are very well done the infantry wheight system as a whole is enjoyable and just adds to the experience. The only bad thing I have to say about infantry is the weapons the variety is somewhat lacking. Yes the attatchment system is fantastic and at first it seems like you have alot of guns to choose from but even with apex the majority are just copies of a base gun with different barrell lengths and stocks.  Next Vehicles. 9/10 Driving in  is an enjoyable experience the helicopter flight models are great as are the vehciles no real complaints here. My problem is with jets. The flight models feel clunky and are overall just not fitting with the rest of the vehicle models. Another problem with the jets is that each faction only has one NATO: A futuristic A-10 CSAT: An arma version of the Yak - 130 which is a light attack aircraft and AAF: the Buzzard which we all remember as the Albatross from A2. The problem with this is that all of these are mainly ground attack aircraft the buzzard is the only one with an AA configuration and it still sucks you may find yourself wishing for a bit more variety here. Now onto the good things.  Barring jets the vehciles feel solid and are really fun to drive and fly [even the jets with their clunky flight models]. Vehicle mounted guns are just really fun to use the heavier things like tanks especially so with their auto ranging and lock functions.  Finally the engine and game content These are really my biggest problems with : AI and Content. Lets start with content. Take away all the DLC that costs money [everything save for zeus] and you are left with some pretty restrictive choice there is almost no variety. Even with all the pricey DLC after a while equipment still feels lacking regardless if its Guns Cars Helicopters or Jets everything is a bit too small of a category.  Next we have AI. The. God. Damn. Proximity. Detection. This AI detection is some of the most irritating stuff ive ever seen especially for ZEUS missions. it makes stealth near impossible sometimes.   Finally I want to talk about versatility This review is recommending you buy  I've pointed out the flaws but how I still love most of the systems. Even AI which ive complained about being a pain in the  for ZEUS im still a Zeus fanatic. The biggest selling point to me for A3 is the sheer versatility of the game. You can do things ranging from the most extreme milsim missions to extreme life roleplay to dicking around with zombies. The game is incredibly versetaile in the different ways you can use it and I love this and the sheer beauty of the graphics only adds to this. Yes its lacking in content and optimization and even though I want these fixed they dont stop me from enjoying the hell out of this.  Again overall 9/10 I highly reccomend you buy this if you like simulation regardless if its life or military. It may have a steep learning curve but its worth the time 10
reat military simulation for people who enjoy realistic gameplay. Took a little fiddling with settings to get the balance on graphics vs. performance but once that is done it looks and plays great. For anyone who played and loved ARMA 2 or even Operation Flashpoint you won't be disappointed.10
Really fun game to play and would recommend :)
Pretty good.
If you like shooting games and or simulator games you will love .    is an amazing military simulator which will provide you with hundreds of hours of gameplay. The game offers many different modes where it is possible to play alone or with friends but is best in large groups.
reat game amazingly optimized so many mods including OPTRE RHS JSRS 3 and so many more. It's amazing how much you can really mod this game. Includes to vanilla islands Altis and Stratis. But you need to have a good cpu this game depends on it.10
Best combat Sim ever ...
his game has a mature and cool community and the game is beautiful and amazing10
t is really good war simulator - bit pricy with all the DLCs  but totally worth it! I recommend it! I mainly play Coop multiplayer.10
One of the best games I have ever played. I can't wait to see more update/content coming! Best military simulator I've ever seen! 10/10

layed it a bit  meh.10
0/10  Very good graphics and runs well always wanted it and I am not dissapointed in it at all 10
This game is fun and entertainable. But I'm quite unsure on how to join online servers and how to get correct mods.
ust wow this is the game i have dreamed of. Large scale sandbox multiplayer military and simulation.   Wonderful combination! :D 9/10 (lil laggy but not much :D)   !EDIT! I've played it a lot more now learned the mechanics and such great game. APEX DLC costs more then the actual game so if you have 100 euros to spare. go on!10
Good Graphics Nice Gameplay Good Community Servers 10/10
t's a great game but it's not for anyone. If you are not an enthusiast of this type of games you might just leave the game and never play it. But if you like it you will find great fun playing expecially with friends.  Overall great game. Except the untimely updates that  up my team's plans.10
I think I know the hotkeys.
extremely optemised i can run it with a celeron and a gtx 750 1gb with 8gb ram at 40-50 fps in high settings at 1440X900 no v sync just wish the DLC. Was free
Optimisation master race since 2013 is good gaem
Ridiculous amount of mods. Nuff said.
Best Game I have ever played.
the  devs made this game run off 2 cores. IF YOU HAVE A AMD PROCESSOR DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. csgo=300fps overwatch= 100+fps gta v= 60-90fps  =25-35 fps mostly around 30 unplayable.

it is a fun war sim and you can do a lot of crap that is vary fun
I played the ARMA series crazy! hours after hours..  But since ARMA III i don't have the feeling to play it more then 1 hour..  Armed assault and Arma II are the best out of the series   I hope ARMA IIII is not ''futuristic'' but just back to how it is right now.
Worst update ever
Kids play COD Boys play Battlefield Men play ArmA... And Russians play CS:GO x)
gnoring all the performance and optimization issues I can't really recommend . It seems so good on paper but there are just too many issues. Most recent example... progress in the single player campaign is not saved reliably. Even if you remember to manually save your progress you are quite likely to start two or three missions back when you resume. My game is stuck in an unexplained death after a long 'free look cutscene'. Too irritating to deal with right now... Developers may have overshot there ability.-10
 really tried to give this game the benefit of the doubt  and as you can tell i did buy it '' but majority of you would like to know  is this game worth it '' Well to answer that question  first you must know that this is a Military Simulation type game  and second is about team work and comunication  just like in real life combat situations.I have to give my Kudos to developers at bohemia studios  for embarking into a such ambitious sandbox open world combat game  however the amount of bugs that represents  from graphical bugs  frame studders  and don't even get me started with Online Multiplayers  the servers are so laggy  that is simply unplayable .I understand that guys at Bohemia Studios are working hard to fix all these issues  but at the moment  this game is only 50% finished  there is still a lot of work to do in order for this game to run smooth .I hope this gives you at least an idea  on what you gonna expect when you buy this game  and 59.99 is a bit too much to swallow for a game with so many bugs issues  Relax ..BF4 is on that list too  so far the TITANFALL has the smoothest experience on PC   I have high hopes and will support 'Bohemia Interactive ' Studios  cause i like their ideas and they are not afraid to take the risks . So is this game for you? Well that will depends on what sort of player you are ? if you are someone like me  who adores and loves simulations  then yes go ahead get the game  but be prepared for bugs for time being  I think down the road '' they will improve the experience but we as community need to help them by reporting bugs and giving them support .  I hope this opinion of mine  made you realize my take on this game .10
dont buy if u dont owna $500 to 600 gpu or it in sucks
ucks big time!!! I have a i5 @ 3.0Ghz 250Gb ssd R7 260 ati with 2Gb 4Gb ram 600W power Windows 7 home premium 32bit and the damn thing says that my adapter does not support Direct X 10... It took me 3 days to download from server. I have 50Mbps internet connection and when finaly it was complete it didn't even start!!!  Sucks big time!!!-10
bsolutltely NO  big No do not buy this game.  This game is super worked is for geeks that like details to te point that is no fun. To many keys to hard to figure stuff and when you figure it you need to many keys to make it happen. I buy it if i could have the chance again to not bui it i would not buy this game. Grafics = awsome hard worked like i said a game for perfectionists but a common folk will HAVE NO FUN.  NOT RECOMENDED-10
yes awesome
Easily the best game ive ever played :D
It always glitches out and messes up.
optimisation. Similar to ARMA II. Really poor on Bohemia's part after having generated so much revenue from the Day-Z mod you would htink they could afford to spend some of the money working on proper optimisation for AMD builds. However this runs nearly as badly as the standalone. If you have an AMD 8 or 6 Core CPU DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. You will be hoping for 20 fps max. Thats what I get with 2 7770s in crossfire.   In terms of the game itself it takes itself too seriously resulting in boring missions and overly difficult controls and playing style. It wouldn't be a bad thing for ultra realism but the game struggles with basic manouverability moving your character feels clunky and jerky not fluid as it should. The control layout is very strange and adopts a unique style which personally I am not a fan of however the control re-mapping system is solid. Visually the game looks great however it feels more like a ing slideshow with the FPS you recieve on AMD machines. Gameplay wise you find yourself far to often with your nose touchign the screen squinting to see hostile NPCs that are supposed to be kilometres away from you that you are expeced to hit with a seemingly hugely innacurate red dot sight. Perhaps the game is so realistic that as a solidier you aren't given the correct equipmnet for the situation but truthfully it just feels lazily done and not thought out.    6.5/10 Would not reccomend. Pick up Battlefield 3 you will enjoy it more and if you can put up with EAs t servers get battlefield 4 it is visually slightly better. (BF3 servers are still kinda )-10
I is deadly accurate no matter what obstacle trees bushes walls it doesn't matter every helicopter gunner as aim like a crack sniper and with one hit kills. Friendly AI is dumb as a sack of door-knobs controls are VERY complex combine this with poor auto save implementation and this quickly becomes a no-win nightmare which will force you to reload an entire mission most of which take an hour or more to complete.   Unless you have 30 or so buddies to play multi with I recommend you pass.-10
has definitely improved on ArmA 2. The gameplay the engine visuals animations and gunplay are much better. However the resources required to pull this off are extremely high end and despite the ground work being layed. The game offers little single player experience and is still in developement. And to show much content they delivered themselves they just added planes this weekend while being released since 12 sep 2013.   Despite this a man like me could enjoy this game if it didn't carry all the inconsistency problems the other game did. PVP wise the lobbies are really outdated no auto number ballance no skill ballance and all pvp maps can be fully customised. This means the one day there is arty the next time there is not. Then you can't take towns because you need to take the camps first while another map you need to take a flag. There are no hud indications for this to show newer players what to do.  The problem with the game is if you do finally get some guys that know how to play the game they are often on 1 team. While the other team is disorganised so all of a sudden you go from dying by stuff you can't see to slicing through the enemy team like butter. It will take another 2-3 years before players will get a hang on what to do. And by this time ArmA 4 will be released and the shabang restarts.   For coop the game is a lot better. But this is also dependant on how many friends you got playing with you. And since 90% of my steam friends cant run the game and the other 10% got bored because of limited content the coop experience is completely dependant on random people. From which the better players are hard to find through sometimes 50 player rubble of guys that just lay down on a far hill taking popshots.   All in all can I recommend this game to a random player? No unless you are into coop and like large operations and know some people to play with it becomes questionable. There are better games out there though not as unique as .  For PVP players I can only say get out of here while you stil can ;)-10
wait a while before buying. its still pretty much in alpha. so many bugs. bad game play. and hackers galore! good luck &amp; have fun... lol
Very boring game!!! The campaign suck!
This is one of the Best Games That i got and i got a Lot !!!
Bath was a spa town
oncept and everything else about the game is pretty awesome. Only downside is getting 5-15 fps no matter what your setup is.  If you don't mind playing a game with 5-15 fps then GO FOR IT. Otherwise it's definately not worth the 60 dollars more like 20-30-10
his is a great game that really simulates what it is like to be in a real war. It's single player is ok but playing multiplayer in a group is what makes this game great.10
he previous title Arma 2 in my opinion is in ways better than the third installment.10
game is sh!t
on't buy this if you plan to play with friends. Couldn't join public servers that my friends joined and they couldn't join public servers that I joined. Sad.-10
f your into a militarty realism/simulator and have a passion for the balisitcs system play this ing game please. You will love it!10
So much to do. Just tons of fun to be had.
Absalutly brilliant il give it ***** stars hope i get the full game soon i would sugest more classes it is fun with them but mabe something like a spy with a knife amd suppresd pistol (any just if it can have a suppresor ) and maby a juggernaught with duble health and a lmg brilliant if u can get this on the fulll game
his is a great military simulator. The community is a great one and talented therefore giving you great mods to enhance the game.10
This game is tight.
One of the best game ever &lt;3 !
This is a funny game but its small bugs in it :( But i recommend this game if you like war simulation games.
Runs sooo bad! 24 hours and deleted...:(
Hey i was randomly global banned :( can anyone help???
Very good game: by far the best military simulator game that there is. Is much more fun than arma2
pdate: March 2014 - This game has become one of my most fav FPS/TPS games for US$20 (CJS) or US$35 to US$40 this game is so enjoyable with clan/mates via coop  it has free dedicated servers server browser  ping displayed music can turn off  graphics are so better then BF4 and COD GHOST TONES OF free maps and mods. I now play this on a haswell with great frame rate. Also has multiple FREE DLC's. Worth the investment. Dont get COD GHOST buy this instead  Recent game play footage I recorded -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSOfOGoGACw     looks like it could be a really good game of 2013 to replace GRFS and BF3. My guess is once they optmise it for Duel and Single core CPU's  fix multiplayer fix textures and Release Standalone Dedicated Servers without needing Steam for Linux and Windos People are going to play this in droves. Flying is an art so dont assume you can jump in and fly straight away. My Duel Core 2Ghz Socket 775/560ti/8gig ram system gets 19FPS out of this game which was the same FPS I got from GR Online Open Beta and Crysis 3 MP Open Beta. WARNING LITE FREE GIFT COPY IS SINGLE PLAYER ONLY. Big let down on that10
Its pretty intense on the right moments. If you want intense firefights you should play domination.l But if you like to play strategic. You should also play that lol. Wasteland on the other hand. Is boring as .  Lots of vehicles planes and helis. You can bomb  and there LOTS of weapons. 8.2/10 Best war simulator of the year -PC Gamer
an Aquired taste. I have this aquired taste.
The editor is powerful and impressive. I made a scenario where we played as Blackwater and wasted a bunch of civillians while speeding through the streets. 10/10 would commit war crimes again
a good improvement more so than the previous ones but the game still suffers from minor faults. Arma so far is on top of my favorites list.10
ne of the best games i have played to date AltisLife.co.uk with this game is perfect10
300 game crashes per second when trying to join every server.
Realy good
this is the best milsim up to date
rma to others but it is not a game for everyone and even inside the game there will be aspects of the game you like such as [Military reinactments] and dislike such as [ Battleroyal call of duty deathmatch] so everyone will want to play the game differently but remember its game where no one has to tell you how to play it.  Overall 7/10  The game has problems in its polish but when you look past it you get a gaming experience like no other.  NOTE: This review has alot of spelling mistakes and missing subjects as I came up with this in 30 mins future reviews will be written on proper writting software and also days in advance. I hope this review has helped you!  NOTE2: 743 CHARACTERS TOO LONG!!!??? sorry I couldnt provide enough info but steam has a character limit so in the immortal words of awsome people I say 'Test review please ignore'. 10
his game has great potential but is killed by engine issues in multiplayer.10
f you have ever played any of the Arma series this is by far the best one yet has a decently good campaign with a decent storyline and multiplayer is pretty sweet even though most multiplayer servers are custom missions I have yet to find a server that runs stock  multiplayer but even the custom missions are pretty cool. Would definitely recommend this game to anyone especially with Epoch coming out for it soon. So those of you that play DayZ: Epoch don't waste time get this play it enjoy it then enjoy it even more when : Epoch is released.10
Something that's good
 liked this game until they added the APEX DLC. Basically they split the game into two. The people with the DLC and the people without. It is absolutly outrageous to charge 35 dollars for 1 new map when you can play breaking point and they have several free maps FREE. Now when you want to connect to a server the community has been so spread out between servers that you can never find a full one anymore. The people who bought APEX connect to nearly empty servers because the majority of people arent going to pay for that. And the people who don't have APEX connect to the old map (Altis) and theyre are so few servers and most of them are empty. How to ruin a good game? Add a map DLC for 35 dollars. They would have made more money over time if they simply did nothing than add this DLC. I would no longer reccomend this game to anyone as I expect most of the community would do the same. RIP .-10
Game not playable Without some Raynzombie Mods And Apex Expansion
 love this game and if you want the intenceness of a real battle but dont want to die  heres your solution10
Really fun! Super tactical! Awesome when planning pays off :)
ne of the most beautiful games I've EVER played and one of the most challenging. Arma III is an essential game for any would-be FPS player as it exclusively immerses the player and requires co ordination and immense teamwork. I recommend it simply because it is a beautiful game.10
Huge improvement on Arma2.
ood step in quality for the arma series however the content is lacking at the moment for the hardcore community. Im sure things will grow soon though.10
antastic game anyone with a brain can look at this and realize its a game to buy!10
A beauty of a game if your computer can run it. It has lots of strategic possibilites and can be played for hours with the addition of the steam workshop.
worth every peny! this is pure awesomeness!
Pure badassery exspecialy when playing waistland!
ots of buttons to learn other than that its a awesome game and has tons of replayability 8/10 for me!! worth it too..10
ame has great potential but it lacks easy interface for multiplayer aspect of it just seems too messy complicated and difficult to find reasonable server to play on make it more user friendly perhaps look how BF4 multiplayer search works and then this game would be top notch!10
his game rocks if u have not got it yetyour a fool10
ts pretty realistic you could turn on and off the igniton anytime.10
Everybody should buy it! You can do almost everything in this game and its really cool as an army simulator...
his game is absolutely your game if you want to shoot civilians the US army greeks or even space iranians!10
hen i played only servers with people had dlcs and when i tried to join it wouldnt let me I hope you have better luck-10
unning running running following orders more running.... Explosion dead......   10/10  It's as real as it gets.10
A rough diamond needing to be polished
wesome game good graphics made the radio comms sound a ing shitboat and a half better then arma 2 (I cannot stress how much Arma 2s radio comms sounded like diseases) has that same ultra-realistic combat type deal going on takes place in the future land air sea what more could you want? This is without a doubt the best military simulation game that has been produced to date.10
Yebogogo!. This is a must have!
i dont even have the game and i can write a review lol! THIS GAME IN SUCKS RUSSIA IS THE WORST COUNTRY IN THIS GAME EVERYONW KNOWS RUSSIA IS THE STRONKEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAIL STALIN VODKA VODKA PUTIN PUTIN
mazingand so beautiful.10
he game is great and can be played for hours without a break the action is smooth and unforgiving one mistake can lead to half your team being slaughtered in a matter of seconds and a swarm of enemy combatants suppressing your position. The epic landscapes that the series is know for is best represented in  with Altis and Stratis two mediterranean paradises that have become the setting for a full scale conflict. My only qualms with the game is the lack of playable content thus far. Though the game features three conventional factions and a guerilla faction only two of the factions have full ground capibilities (NATO and CSAT) leaving the other two at a disadvantage. Compared with Arma 2 combined operations it holds up pretty well. Another problem that doesnt bother a lot of players but bothers me personally is the lack of a full campaign. The only Issues that came to mind for me have been noted by bohemia and they are adding the campaign and more content for FREE. I would totally recommend this game if you have any interest in strategic shooters if you liked rainbow six battlefield or even the less popular reboot of operation flashpoint youll find a warm home in the  community.10
his game is awesomeballs. It's so pretty and the guns work well too. On top of that the landscapes are huge and pretty.  The vehicles are probably its only issue since they sometimes feel like jelly.10
Very nice game :D
rom boy to man  Before I played: ?? ? ?? ?( ?° ?? ?°)  ??? &lt;???  ???/ ? ??  ?? /??/???  ?? ????? ?_?  ??/?/  ? /?/  ?(?(?  ???? ? ? ? ?) ? ??) / `? )??L? After I played: ??? ?????? ????  / ?);???  / ???( ?° ?? ?°?????._;?  /???7????? ???  ?? ? ??? ????/  ?? `? `?-'_?`??  ??? ? ? _?'?)
ohemias third Arma! More polished and a lot of things improved from the previous Arma 2!  + Sandbox + A lot of Weapons vehicles and modifications + Big and Massive maps + Loads of hours to spend + Good community + A lot of good and fun player created content  If you haven't played an 'Arma' game before and looking for a more realistic/strategic military war game buy it! Totally worth it! 10
If you can get into a god server and have friends that will play with you Arma III is worth the buy!
A great game. addictiing sometimes as well
It is a great game well the editor is anyway but the fact they didnt have missions from day one was annoying but still its great to see the missions now! but overall i think this is a great and fun game!! :)
Very versatile. Mods and a great campaign make this one of the best PC actions games out now.
awsome game buy it now and play some wasteland and life i realy recomend this game its very big maps and realistic
ought it for 30 nigs good deal great game.10
his PC Game is a must have for All High/medium end PC owners! ThIs game is what i consider next gen gaming!10
I need a better GPU!!!!
easily the worst game I've ever played.   TLDR: Waste of money.
very realistic game
You have to be literally  to not give BIS all of your money.
his game is brilliant but has decent system requirements. I cannot play the game on high settings however I can still enjoy it regardless. If you are the kind of person that wants to have the capacity to create an infinite variety of scenarios for yourself as I am this is a great game to play. The game is difficult and brutal you can freely make your characters look like a civilian or a hardcore military operative. You have a staggering amount of freedom in this game and lots of strategic options involving vehicles including ATVs helicopters tanks and even UAVs. The maps are extremely large and the game does not fail to deliver on any point.10
If I wanted to play a game where I can spend 30 minutes and never see an enemy I would play a hunting sim.
hat is this  after update all kinds of errors game james did you fix sniper mag going from 8 aclip to 1 a clip i guess not you broke the game id say wait 1 but i yell you now you twits10
Would be better if i could actually play the game for more than 20 minutes.... but no.
 know this is still in development however the game mechanics were not smooth enough to enjoy the gameplay.. 3/10-10
on't let the screenshots fool you. You have to have an amazing computer in order to play like that. For most people trying to play the game on the higher settings will result in more lag than game. Unfortunately on the lower settings the game looks 7 years old. Graphics aside the gameplay is excellent and realistic like it should be. The episodic campaign is the biggest downside. It shows quite a bit of laziness on Bohemia Interactive's part. It's been almost 6 months since the full release and we still don't have the end of the campaign Also the campaign isn't very good but multiplayer makes up for it. I personally love Wasteland and Altis Life. I would recommend purchasing this game primarily for its multiplayer.10
90/89 I only got this for the Dew and Doritios package.
arbra Tree is the greatest Wii U Racing Sim I've ever played. The amount of content and side missions is about 5 times as much as every GTA combined and the RPG elements really added a whole new level of depth to the game that really made the game stand apart from the other Wolfenstein games.  100/1 Piece of crap game. I would buy a four pack.10
 great simulator game after ArmA 2 I think it's very realistic. I recommend this game for someone that love real war simulator games :D (Y) Keep it up Bohemia!!10
the best multiplayer ever huge maps lots exploration beautifal graphics especialy for the size great single player a few bugs but nothing that stops it from being fun u can play silly and mess about or play serious choice is urs
his is the most realistic war game in existence at the moment. DO NOT buy this game if you enjoy Call of Duty or other similar shooting galleries. This game is hardcore with its precise controls realistic damage model and complicated battles. The singleplayer campaign is something to be marveled. It blends realistic war with an intriguing story. This game is for those who want more from the everyday shooter. You must be dedicated if you want to play this game. I will easily reccomend this game but only if you know what you are getting into.10
 love this game. There is so much you can do with it considering how flexible the simulation is. Bullet physics are realistic and it is really satisfying when you get that kill. I highly reccomend it if you have friends to play with or are looking for a large amount of teamwork because this game is great for that.  Now I just need someone to play with..10
awesome game and a great step forward. how ever all the nato guns suck dowload a U.S weapons mod and it makes everthing better.
its such a great game! just omfg GET IT NOW GET IT NOW GETTTT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Call of duty is better than this
After the update with the launcher ARMA and Bisudio can GO TO IN HELL i uninstalled the game and hope they burn up in hell
when do u get rid of your global ban i did have it over 1 years and 4 months
Absolute crap in recent updates have always been a loyal ARMA player but Optimization in the last few updates have made the game unplayable on mid-high range systems you need a BEAST of a rig to run this game now i stronlgy reccommend for the averge player dont waste your money on this anymore
ingle player 0/10 Very difficult. Lots of useless running. No real intro to gameplay. Boring.   Multiplayer 10/10 Lots of fun to do game has unlimited potential and great RP servers.  Graphics 8/10 Although stunning they tried to go realistic and I do not understand this approach. We know we are in a chair dazzle us wow us.  Cost to Value Rating 10/10 The idea behind arma 2 and 3 is really lost on me; I find all the good content to be from multiplayer servers that build thier own content. And it is great! And fun.  Its 10/10 because the game will last more than a few hundred hours and a few years. It is not your average CoD and I am currently aware of large number of players still supporting Arma 2. I would consider it an investment like Counter Strike. It is the kind of game that will update (mostly) for free and the content and player base will stay fun for many years. The community on some online RP servers are very mature gamer oriented; when you die you lose everything so people respect yours/thier investment into the character and having meaningful interactions.  There is a considerable amount of dlc to be bought. I currently own NONE of it. And NEVER intend to buy any. I am having a blast playing online without it. (There is about 75$ worth of dlc I do not have.)  Why if this game so great don't you buy the dlc? Bohemia as a company is the worst. Ask any DayZ standalone player who has had it since the beggining; they do not give a single care about anything but money. I said to my self I would NEVER purchase a game after DayZ being the overpriced peice of garbage it is but... The game play is so fun. And my friends wanted me to play and I played with them and it made it worth it.  It is like buying gas. We hate the oil companies and all the bad they do (BP and thier oil spill) but we love gas. For many reasons.  TL;DR Game is superfun through multiplayer DON'T buy dlc.10
Great all around game!! Many game types that will keep even the most ADD gamer entertained.
it was fun willl it llasted
good the game
Another great addition to the arma series
This is a very good game I recommend it to every1 the mods are awesome like DayZ and stuff :)   11/10 - IGN
Gotta pay the cost to be the boss
I bought the game and what happened next will blow your mind
his game is actually pretty good i like the fact thats its an open world FPS Maximum graphics are nice the game isnt laggy or freezes or anything sounds are nice physics are nice vehicles and weapons are nice it's an in the middel game its average. I like it10
his game is great. There is a lot of intensew firefights that go on in the main game like the campaign or some multiplayer modes like King of the Hill or Wasteland but where the real fun comes from is altis life. Altis life is a RPG multiplayer game mode. You are a civilian and u can become a cop or be a rebel and sell drugs. Very Very Very fun.  11/1011
 u
10/10 Invincible fences ftw
i buy the game and when i start it it says game lauch error and nothing works to fix it
as 8/10 without DLC weapons (Because of optimization issues) but since marksman DLC with DLC weapons hitting 1 hit kills made the game easier for casuals. Which made Wasteland (Excluding Sa-Matra) King of the Hill and some Altis Life servers lame.  It is currently 6/10 above average because multiplayer is ruined and isn't really fun anymore. But I still recommend the game. Campaign is great physics is great.  :) 10
-Spent hours in campaign doing scouting missions of no importance. -Carefully select a loadout in cooperative and get heli ride to objective only to get shot down by a bad pilot flying too high. -Used real life tactics with a handful of good players to take out objectives -Spent half an hour crawling around with a Lynx in Wasteland mode to snipe a single guy 900m away and then spent another hour waiting to ambush a group of players with claymores and take all their money.   It has plenty of issues and is a niche game but if you like the idea of getting some friends together to conduct ambushes on poor unsuspecting people with half an hour of no combat then you'll like this game. Slow is good in this game.   10/10 would assault a church again.
if you love milsim this is the Alpha Male of that category!!! enjoy and check out my youtube  channelhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPba9cjYd5eTkESQGSOB5qg
 used to like Arma quite a bit number two and three. I was one of those players that would hop servers looking for a good time try and do something sort of coherent get my  annoyed in by a certain portion of the player base that should not be mentioned *Cough* Ginsberg *Cough*. I had my fun with the game and that was about it. But then I hit the REAL MEAT of the game community. Being able to play with a group of buddies is the peak of enjoyment from atleast vanilla Arma. You toss Arma's beautiful modding community into the mix and this becomes a very different ballgame on the same field.  When I happened upon a small friendly community that I would soon dub 'a bunch of jolly s' I fell in love with Arma on a completely new and fantastic level. About 600-650 of my hours logged where in the span of a year playing with these guys and it was a fantastic time. The more you have available to you like a personal server the mod base ability to use the editor the more depth the game has. That all compound on the imagination of you and your buddies. Wanna screw around? Go ahead and run across Altis with your  hanging out thumb up your  barfing rainbows on those who stand in your way. I'm not saying your can do this Because you may be able to put that together IF your determined enough or IF someone else is. Want to do something Para-seriously with proper radios that can be really crappy because who the hell put that mountain there call signs etc. go ahead!  This game can be a pretty cool thing to hop on and kill  on and it could also be a real ing hoot of a time wrecking  with your own band of Jolly s. If you can handle the realistic Mechanics and enjoy this style of FPS I say this game is a MUST HAVE. If you struggle with the games that aspire to be highly realistic this probably wont be for you. Some other very useful traits of character to have going into this game is the maturity to play cooperatively with atleast a neutral disposition when playing with others and patience to sit through some long chopper or car rides which can hand in hand with maturity and being able to contain yourself.10
is a major improvement over Arma 2 even if you think it lacks content is wich you got to remember Arma 2 on launch in 2009 had lack of content but bohemia interactive has always done this they always add more content in updates and even after release just look at Arma Cold war assault.  This game is clearly a big improvement over it's predacessors even is faithful to it's roots even though most do not like the futerstic setting of  it was something different to try but the campaigns it self was fun to play through i enjoyed the different styles of the campaign of the situations i won't go into spoilers but the way the campaigns are played is good example of giving a 'live' world it does lack co-op but with good reasons it was good playthrough i had i do like the story it was way better than Arma2 it was what Arma2 tried to acheive but they really improved it on .  Thanks to this studio we have a great game and still gets support and added content through updates and the gameplay might change slightly from time to time and if you have performance issues just head to bohemia interactive forums they will get in touch asap and let you know if they working on a solution for you.   Great support and great game and as stated earlier a major improvement over it's predacessor i have no issues with the game it self because my faith in this studio is very strong and secure because i been playing Arma series for a long time and all i can say is they are dedicated to the fans.   Now for the serious notes This is a simulator with great dynamics and ballistics and a whole real life of islands to explore even go under water in the sea it's not a gimmick it's how you use your tactics that counts it's really good way of sneaking and inflitration the game is still being improved yes things will change over time give it time and you have more than what you payed for because you supported a studio as stated before Dedicated to their fans and they are interacting with the community. 10
F YOU HAVE DIRECTX 11 HAVE FUN TRYING TO GET IT TO RUN. IF ANYONE HAD ANY TIPS ON HOW TO RUN THIS GAME LMK. IT WONT START AT ALLLLLLLLL-10
the best war simulation game ever
The menu screen was nice.
This game is totally worth the money. I play this game everyday. The most fun game you will ever play on the computer.
ultiplayer is laggy as . Single player is just ing stupid spend most of your time out of breath in a bush waiting to recover or being shot by the AI who take 5 bullets then still manages to kill you with one bullet. Then just when you think you completed the mission you step on a land mine and die. you then have to restart from an auto save point which is another 500m walk away from where you last was.-10
No question this is a great GAME
wish i can have it i need a better pc cant wait till birthday
probably the most fun i had in a while playing a video game
is great but expencive
My friends and I spent 5 minutes in a tank shooting at a bush on the road thinking it was a person. Best game ever 15/10
Best game You got to play this game really fun.
mazing game would recommend to anyone with a pc good enough to run it!10
Got shot. Dead. Load save. Got shot. Dead. Load save. Rinse and repease. 11/10 would recommend
 went into this game knowing that the game company Bohemia were and are idiots. I know this by looking at reviews for DayZ and seeing people talk about how they use the same engine over and over and it causes problems. They think that they always know best and that their games are flawless...even though it's clear to millions it isn't and they refuse to listen to their customers. With that in mind I downloaded and played. Compared to what I've played of Arma II (the demo which was bugged) Arma III is a lot more polished. Graphics are great the sounds of guns firing is crisp on both firing and the receiving fire end and the open map is massive. Getting items and interacting with vehicles/items is unlike anything I've played in any game.   Unfortunately the learning curve is REALLY steep. You go in basically clueless and have to figure out a lot yourself. They have tutorial pop ups for the campaign (and part of the reason why I say these guys aren't smart is they originally released it without any singleplayer) except that it pops up IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING. They could save a lot of time just giving a regular laid back tutorial mission like virtually every other game does. And they did do this in the Arma II demo. Your team's AI is bad. They love to run out alone and get shot to death leaving you to fend for yourself. And enemies are very smart. They stick together they're patient and man are they deadly accurate. Nice challenge for sure but I wish they were realistically accurate. Even from a huge distance they rarely miss; and most carry assault rifles with dot sights.  Multiplayer is much much worse if you haven't done the campaign first; but it's still as equally confusing as going into the campaign. I must've pressed about every button to try and chat with people with no success. I tried to configure it in....also no success. And the loading time getting into any server is quite long. Understandably long though since it's a huge map and there's an objective. I think for this portion playing a previous Arma game would be best since they expect you to have played them apparently.  There are definitely a lot of problems with this game. AI should be fixed more evenly for a smoother experience (no I am not saying make the game easier. I love the challenge and the adrenaline. But I'd love to know I can count on my fellow soldiers.) and a set tutorial should be in place. Assuming people know everything regardless of playing every Arma game or not is always a bad idea.  There is one thing no one could deny. The Arma games are one of a kind. No one has come closer than this franchise to having the most realistic war experience. But please Bohemia....stop being self centered  and listen to your customers and take their ideas and complaints into consideration. Other than the problems I had fun playing. But I wouldn't recommend it unless you know Arma and how it all works. At the same time though I do recommend this game. It is not a casual shooter in any way. All it takes is a couple of bullets and your team could and can be wiped out. Flanking is truly your best friend and your worst enemy. And communication is just as vital in singleplayer as multiplayer. The experience can't be matched.  EDIT: I've finished some singleplayer and had much better experiences with multiplayer. It's a must buy in my opinion by this point. I don't revoke anything that I've said before but once you know how to do things it's fun.   To save newbies time: Left Ctrl + G allow you to switch grenades and Left Ctrl + Right mouse button allow you to switch scopes (when you have two). You'll pretty much need a GPS in order to know where you are and where everyone else is (usually). And '/' is how you type chat in the servers. Cheers!10
this is really bugy
xtremely fun game to play best to be played with your mates and there are some great communities out there best value for money you can get and a brillaint but tough campaign. However this game does require a decent PC to be able to run it above 30 fps i have played over 1000 hours and still not bored and still not explored and used everything this game has to offer would also recommed getting mods for this game but non the less a great game and enjoy!10
AIs to op and people frendly killing me. logic sucks shot a guy 4 times to die and you get hit 1s and you die what is this bs the guns are horse  players are horse  and when you get a jet and fly over an AI light armor car with a turret on it and you miss chances to kill it then you use some sec to turn aroud to kill it but the problem is the AI is hitting you even do you are traveling 400 km/h and killes you to OP and battle eye sucks to see who is hacking/cheating battle eye is just banning random people for fun
Best fps military game so far. Great tactics and action. Also a more mature community. Love the CO-OP missions.  7 of 10
They shot me in the head and stole my peaches  10/10
his game is pretty fun. need airsupport airsupport unavailable. accidentally calls in artillery on own coordinates kills entire team  10/10 would kill teamates again10
his game is awesome In my own opinion.10
i'm too dumb to play this game. no .
good game needs more interactive modes for most fun as there is a lot of traveling and not mutch shooting but is still great
ick  game worth the buy; been a fan since Arma 2. Realism to its fullest and requires skill. You should not find too many young call of duty players playing this.10
ultiplayer is crap unoptimized. SP is very very fast and fun to play. Campaigns are very well made too.10
Battle eye for arma is not good a hacker join the game and got all the player and me banned for life on DJG the server had to shut down to the lake of admins and moderators its a waste of money getting banned for no reason
ME WANT BAD
Just real enough. Be sure to have a nice Graphics card if you want to play 1080 with high details.
I approve this message!
Beautiful and stunning game. I would recommend it for any fan of Arma 2 or anyone who likes the military genre.
I enjoy this game alot and its very fun to play with friends.
I thing i am MLG   10/10 Would MLG again
reat game! It is worth the price. There is so many different mods servers and gametypes that you will easily spend 500 hours in it having fun. You get your moneys worth. Trust me!10
almost as good as cod
the greatest vehicle simulator
It was feckin' amazing. I recommend it to everyone but the only downside is you need a good ammount of cpu's otherwise you will struggle to get even 10 fps
Seems like a good game only did the training part but seemed good
i rilly likke the game i want to buy it its so cool thif all off the severs
I want this . NO . I NEED THIS .
his is my first dive into military games but so far so good. Would like a little better controller support otherwise enjoyable game. It doesn't have the polish that BF or COD has but the open world aspect is pretty cool.10
If you like Realism and low fps like real life you'll like this game.
ing awesome love playing wasteland
orth every penny but theres still alot of improvement to be done like fixing the eject from moving vechile and stuff like that there just quite alot of little stupid bugs like that. But would recommend.10
ays its running till the 27th my free weekend no longer works on the 26th bit upset about it.10
mean as
was great but cost to much
 got the weekend deal and wow... Its messed up that I have ti oay 25$ to get the rest of it and I can't play it ever again until I pay... this is BS I love the game but what the hell?!?!?!?! I'm not paying that -10
his game is awesomly fun when you are completly aware of the situation and focused in on the game. I noticed that as soon as I lost that immersion factor I got sloppy with my movements and that often resulted in my demise. It can be very frustrating at times especially if you have no idea what you are doing and cant remember many of the controls but once it clicks it gets a little easier. Definatly do the bootcamp training!10
hat exactly improved from Arma II graphics &amp; thats it! Seame exact t get carried over with some bonusses.    Graphic glitches    Invisible walls (geometry glitch)    AI is     AI sees trough foliage u can't even turn it off anymore    Body armor system makes a feel u fight ING T-600s    AI aim iscompletely random it can miss whole clip point blank or insta-kill u from 300m. I can't remember when i managed to insta-kill AI.     optimisation     sounds     scripted events     controlls  It has mod support tough but should the mods be needed to fix basic game mechanics one would expect from a simulator? It's not a simulator it is sanbox game u can mod to make a simulaor.-10
 really hate it. the campain sucksthe mutiplayer is unplayable and i didnt even want to try the rest of the features because of how stupid the things i had played-10
errible game unless you plan on playing it on single player only MAJOR fps lag on multiplayer you will get 3 fps for ever even lowering all settings to low or disabled.-10
t doesn't work. You have enormous lag on PC's with quad-PC's. The engine uses only 1 core -_- So if you somehow still use a dual-core PC you can play this game. If you have a really new quad-core processor you can play this game too. That aside the game feels like it's unfinished and just a money grab. They didn't invest in a new engine that actually works you have no story and it totally depends on mods which still doesn't make it any good. You are thrown on an island with a pistol and there are some vehicles on the island. That's pretty much  in a nutshell.-10
Super Realistic War Simulator  had me hooked 5 minutes in. With all the mods and differnet game modes you could play for days.
I WISH I REALLY HAD THIS GAME
awesome just awesme if you liked arma 2 you will love 
i only have $0.2 and i want this
Best game ever :) but i cant buy it :'(
uch a joy to look at and play especially if you are a fan of the ARMA series.  I would also like to point out the BREAKING POINT absolutley pisses over DayZ Standalone Breaking Point being the ARMA3 mod that used to be called DayZ Breaking Point on ARMA2.   this is due to having vehicles craftable storage and a  ton of weapons.   grab it !10
Simple best game on the market
 buy  'on sale' and after the weekend sale they bring out the Helicopter DLC for $15.99. Ok I got bit but remember when things like helicopters in a game were part of the game not a 'here are 2 helicopter for $15.99' DLC money grab?  I didn't know this was a pay for DLCs that really should already be part of the game.  I would not recommend this game to anyboy.-10
0? WAY TOO buggy for a game to be 60 bugs this is insane10
The worst game I've ever bought.
Truly  game.
this game has to mainy glitsjes that the have to pay the players!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Campaign is cool until you have to control your AI team... then it becomes kind of boring since the AI doesn't do quite what you asks of them and they end up dying pretty easily.. Mods seems to be ok although if you are an  rookie it's a little hard to play at first.  Cool game but wouldn't recommend it if it's not on sale though.
I do not recommend this game unless you have dedicated friends to play with. I would wait for GTA5
9/11 would bang
What a  pile.
this is a great game hours of fun i played the altis life mod great will recommended to anyone
reat game a must have for fans of fps games. There are so many different things you can do with this game.10
mazing game! has many things to do and have never been bored playing. full of cheap dlc's you can easly spend 50+ hours on this game for what it costs its worth it!10
Clunky and boring as ever.
his is definatley the best sandbox game out there it has a great and creative community which have created amazing variants such as Wasteland or King of the Hill. It is always action packed online and it runs smoothly on most PC's. There is so much to learn and do which is why I find it so addictive and would recommend it to anyone I know.10
One of the best games ever. This game has been made better with modding community adding various gamemodes and other fun things. BUY IT!!
. I just don't like it. It feels incomplete. it's a great military simulation but eh. feels empty and very pointless.-10
great game better than dayz
 is a great game but still has quite a few bugs and framerate issues.
 absolutely love this game. There is so much to do and explore the sky is the limit! I wish my computer ran the game enough but I definately got my use out of it. It is very easy to set up scenarios with friends such as rading a town or completeing a close air support mission. All in all an absolutely AMAZING game.10
Yeah  this game. Buggy as  and increasingly so with every god damn update they release.
16.00 US for 2 bad helicopters or to even be able to sit in the back seat of one No content No shotguns Buggy like every other arma game Realistic military/war simulation helicopters and planes explode when they touch water. Impossible to try and survive a crash landing even if you are hovering and descending 2 mph Most  admins on any server It's fun I guess.10
lpha is T. The terrain detai is seriously lacking. Shadow and lightening effects seem not to be working properly. And the most important thing is the performance is HORRIBLE! With 660ti I am only getting 35+ fps putting on 'medium' quality. Definitely looking forward to Beta and full game. But ALPHA IS JUST T.10
f you liked Arma 2 you will love this even more.10
i havent played  for a long time but now wen i want to play i start the update and when its done it only says update paused and i have tryed to update it like 10 times but its the same every time.......  game
It was very fun while I could play it whilst I had for free but now its been removed but overall this game is very fun and the multiplayer is very entertaining I highly recommend this game 9/10
Best military simulation on the market!! Definitely worth your money!
ost realistic actionshooterstrategy game of all times10
Bootylecious
This game is ing amazing but the only thing is i got ing banned for having loads of money on altis life :'( now i have to pay £35 to get it back
10/10 would die from random cars that explode for no reason again!
Graphics are very good and the open world is amazing. Make sure you have a godly computer if you want to run 60 fps though!
he most fun you will get from  is when you play with friends even if non of your friends play  just go out there and make some friends.10
game realistic and is stradegy if you like a fun challenge you should get the game
ost realistic entertaining military gameplay i've ever experienced. I love how you can make your own senerios and play them. It makes the game have infinite sinerios.10
One of the best games you can buy.
till buggy as previous arma's. A lot of frustrating desync. Not much main content but big mod support. Not worth it.-10
cool game :)
Is good for shooting people with your gun.
uggy as hell Dlc is basically updates that should have been included in the game for free ? What the hell bohemia I was excited for  to be released as i thoroughly enjoyed arma 2 Oa When  was relelase i was very disapointed I don't think i'll be buying another bohemia game due to the amount you ed your customers around.-10
his game is very difficult but still awesome different from any other fps/tps. Get it.10
mazing War Simulator beautiful with Mods and all-in-all a brilliant game. Many 'o hours really show peoples effort they put into the game and every minute (even in the load up) is worth it. A must buy.   Add-on: The games a heavy load. Really CPU heavy. If you have a good Graphics Card and a bad CPU (which YES I have) run the game on MAXED settings - the FPS boosts a heck of a ton. IT transfers the load onto the card.  Happy hunting.10
One of the most realstic game i have ever played everything about it works for example: +graphics are amazing +Eventually 3rd and 1st person decent shooter +Nice storyline +Fun multiplayer Somthing however wasnt so great was: -Bit glitch (at times not alot) -Missions last forever I would rate it 9 out of 10 and i reccomend getting it!!!!!!!!!
 realistc Game with a few bugs but aweson to play in a team of tactical players!10
i have a problam with battleye and i need help and i cant figure it out nothing helps i do not recommend the game
It is an ok game but i would spend 60$ on this buy fallout 4 instead
is the biggest pile of  I have ever played. It is the worst game engine on the planet and is not optimized at all. It makes gaming pc explode. Its terrible like its gameplay! Do not buy this game at all for your own safety!-10
orst game ever i played  whats this  graphics and  graphics engine ?????!!!! it eats graphics card without give u at least good graphics  note : card is gtx 660 ti sc  ram 16 gb ram and p is core i7 3770 k   laggy graphics low fps high ping and high bandwith u need a super computer and 10 mb connection to play this at high graphics and u will still laggy   go and see battlefield graphics or games which depend on havok engine how graphics is awesome at long range without any lagg att good pcs  -10
Sometimes better than CS:GO
the best arma
Very Smexy :)
Awesome game from and awesome company. This game has given me hours of fun and with the DLC and free platform updates its juts keeps getting better and better. Highly recommend but you would need a good PC to run.
Beatifull game had a lot of fun banging people.
Ever wanted to join the army but wanted to respawn after you died well  is for you .
Easy to get lost in this world.... love the game and fantastic missions/ mods available
great game but not good for Amd sadly
It's Arma. What else can you say?
hectic game
Prefer buy the game again than buy the dlc's
 is life. Life is ....... imo no other game comes close
his game runs awful at times. Lag and desync during firefights or rubberbanding while operating a vehicle detract from the experience. The UI and general movement of your character is clunky and not well designed.  This game is lacking in content. It's almost as if BI gave players a map and expected the community to 'finish' it. The DLCs what little they do offer should have been included with the original game.  The graphics are nice however.  I would not recommend unless you're able to deal with the above. Hopefully they'll design a new capable engine instead of rehashing the same old stuff for Arma 4.-10
Great game Great Graphics Good Combat System and stances  Horrible Multiplayer setup. can't play with friends Can't play 90% of the servers online  6/10 would not buy it again.
Has tons of mods! Had a lot of fun! Definitely worth 55€
 have changed this to a positive review as originally i was very dissapointed with the vanilla of this only with weapon mods and a3L will you have a fun experiance witht his game10
reat addition to the franchise.  Graphics like usual look amazing. Draw distance goes forever. Falling 4 feet still kills you. The clouds are pretty. Jumping is still impossible.10
mazing game. Yeah sure there are some bugs but that is like any other game. Amazing MP and SP scenarios and Editors. I would highly recommend getting this!10
 have 500+ hrs on this game as much as the idea is good; the visuals are bad game performance affects how good you are in the game significantly in other words game is biast to better H/W. example: units and objects draw distance; if you dont have a high end PC you will be shot by a ghost that you cannot see; as well sudden events like explosions will result in frame drops.  Servers have bad connections even when u have 100-120 ping; which is not terrible but you should expect a lot of Desync to the point of being kicked off the server.  After the most recent update which was 26 Aug 2015 or so; game performance deteriorated as well as connectivity. I keep getting kiced by battle eye saying that client is not responding. wikis online say its my internet connection and i should simply get a better one; funny coz i never faced this issue before in my life on any multi player game ^^ did i say EVER ;)  2 years after launch and after countless patches the game still struggles to run smoothly....and here i though Rome II had a bad release...  the mods in this game are plenty and all their game play is very similar which can be summerized in spawn gear up shoot die respawn repeat...  RPG mods (altis life): go gather and sell drugs save money; and after your 1st 500k-1mil or so (depending on server) congrats you can buy a rebel license to get weapons. each weapon is for 200k to 600k and when u die you loose it. so more gathering and selling drugs +  loads of driving. Probably the most boring experience i've ever endured. Servers are up to 120 users but with such a mediocre net code performance drops (by up to 15 FPS) the more the server is full of ppl. In All servers you can actually pay (donate) to get startup cash a base for your team/friends special merchents in game reserved spots on the server etc.. but if you are trying to enjoy the mod expecting a role playing mod your out of luck; the way this mod works is unless you are with your firneds and hapen to be a ''donator' you are actually food and you will have the worst gaming experience ever.  Sector Control Mods: 3 teams or 30-40 (total 90-120) king of the hill style while it is a pretty good idea; the amount of units players armored vehicles helicopters and planes is huge to be cramped in such a small area; which drains the server's resources and you will get 50% of the frames you usually get on other mods/servers. Really 50% i get 45-50 FPS on most servers for king of the hill servers i get 20-25 fps no kidding; a horrid gameplay experience. As well; the lack of coordination between the players makes the game try to be like COD but it cant since its a strategic shooter simulation; a hybrid effort gone terribly wrong.  Sand Box mods: such as wasteland probably the most entertaining mod; again u spawn survive look for gear kill and respawn. depending on the server; you get a variety of side missions vs AI which is fun to do (especially when the AI is so DUMB basically bullet spunges + aim bot) however it creates a good way for players to face each other off with ambushing overpowering etc.. This mod however should be played with something like 4-5 firends for it to make any sense or be any fun. anything less dont bother; you'll get stomped and squashed like a fly.  Battleroalye Mods: which is the reason i baught the game; by far teh best performance out of any other mod simply coz the number of players is capped at 48. again spawn survive gear up kill till you are the last man standing to win or die and you are kicked out of the server and have to go wait for another 10-15 mins in the lobby to get into another game. While the idea is brilliant if you play for battle royale for 4 hours you are likely to get an actual gaming time of 1.30-2 hrs. all the other time is waiting for the lobby to fill up and go again or running like forest around the map looking for a gun for the 1st 10 minutes of teh round. Be mindful that this mod is extreemly difficult and frustrating; you can die in the 1st minute of the game or be able to look for gear for abt 15 mins and get sniped while you are unsuspecting you also randomly run into players which comes down to who has the better scope and assult rifle little skill is required if you are familiar with the bullet drop effect in Arma3. In this mod i found that the less bullets i fired and encounters i get a better rank among the lobby; basically you are more likely to reach the top 5 if you know your hiding spots.  there are other mods like epoch which is like DayZ if you know it; while it might be fun for 20 hrs of gameplay its gets extreemly repetetive and boring to the point that you might vomit if you play another hour ;)  They are also plenty of user made servers to play vs AI (like 8 or 10 players); which is a walk in the park if you talk with your team mates and move tactfully to your objective. Again since the AI is basically two things bullet sponge and an aim bot. no work has been done on the enemy AI at all; they dont try to flank they dont push your line they do nothing but stand where they are and keep firing at you with a no scope weapons landing 600m shots... quite broken to overcompensate on such things to cover for the poorly designed AI if any ;)  Really dont buy this game....not worth the money or your time.... unless you get it for 20% of its price then it would make sense to give it a try.-10
This is a game where you can do what ever you want. Make it a FPS by playing TDM or make it a Role playing game by playing mods or 'life' no matter what age you are you will enjoy . The best one out of the series and I would buy this game for my friends! (Just make sure your rig can run it though otherwise it gets a little less fun!)
ve been playing this game since alpha and while it is really good it is definitely not without its flaws. TLDR at the end.  pros: -about as realistic as you can get without actually being in combat -new engine is awesome a lot less 'clunky' than Arma 2 -command systems are much more streamlined and easier to use than Arma 2 -inventory system makes managing your equipment a whole lot smoother -weapon customization -mission editor -it's cool to see current prototype and futuristic versions of weapons and vehicles in the 'near future' setting -modding support  cons: -graphics are good but not nearly good enough to justify the poor performance this game has. 40-50fps at mid settings when my comp can handle 60fps on metro last light just under max settings (GTX 760) -most of the few weapons in the game do not make any sense being used by certain factions (Isreali negev and american mk14 ebr being used by Iran???) -story sucks (poorly written trying to be hollywood war conspiracy film felt like I was playing a CoD campaign) -the map is huge but its all flat and boring brown farmland with about 4 different house types... all enterable though :) -no women character models at all you're telling me theres an island where the entire population is 100% male? how realistic... also the fact that today we have more and more women in roles where they will see combat and this is 30 years in the future. also there were some women civilians in Arma 2. -noticable lack of content when it comes to weapons and vehicles when compared to Arma 2 with all dlc but for a sequel to a game that came out about 5 years before I don't think its too unreasonable to expect more content than vanilla Arma 2 especially when Arma 2 vehicles and weapons can be ported into  by moving some files but with a few bugs they could have easily just fixed the bugs and added the Arma 2 weapons and vehicles offically and that would have been fine imo. but instead we get the content and features that should have been in the game cut out and sold to us as dlc. modders have done far more for this game for free than the devs have.  TLDR: if you liked Arma 2 and you can tolerate the terrible performance you will like this but the lack of content makes it feel less like a game and more of a template for modders. get it on sale.10
est game NA. Like get this game it will change your life it has an awesome military simulation. :D10
he game is worth it if heavily modded.  But as vanilla its just complete trash. So make sure to get mods for every aspect or the game will be broken and glitchy.  Common issues include:  Parachute bug where you will hit the ground at literally 400-500 km/h which naturally results in instant death and inability to spawn in wasteland. This happens regardless of how you use the parachute and regardless of what height you open it at.  Vehicles hitting invisisible obstacles and being sent flying even heavy tanks.  Persistence only working half the time.  NPC headshots from several hundred meters out of their weapons maximum range.  The list of bugs regarding watercraft are too numerous... just don't do boats guys.  Final rating... 5/10 which in my book means worth playing but could be so much better.  The arma community puts more effort into the game than bohemia ever will as bohemia doesnt even bother to finish half-done features the game is completely reliant on mods.10
Its Good.Thats all taht needs to be said~Kinglos
its a 10/10 game when it is moded
meh. Controls are extremely clunky. I only played Altis life though
reat game for the person that is looking for a more realistic game setting just beware of the hackers.10
Best Game ever in my opinion fun moltiplayer game recomend role play servers as altis life or mod serveres lik arama 3 life and breaking pont a easy 10/10
I recoommend this game if you have a super computer that you built. If you do not have a super computer that you built it will be hard to play this game without a huge amount of lag.
It's fun... when it works. The mods make this a versatile and fun title. Just don't be surprised when you crash randomly in the middle of a game or even when you're loading into a server.
this game is just great. nuff said. get the game.
othing like getting straight 25 FPS in a next gen game thanks to my   computer. But a great game none the less but some notes: Have a good GPU very intense and also have a good CPU otherwise you will be set10
O much fun to play with friends. If you like milsim or tactical or just hunting people with so many different game types you will deffinitly find something to suit you10
rilliant game.  Between Hostile Takeover (King of the Hill) and Exile mod this game is hours of fun.  Those who love DayZ and Arma 2 this is a must have!10
Best war game ever!
ch. ARMA 2 delivers a richer experience with more variety. I mean come on two maps with similar names and aesthetics? At least ARMA 2 had a variety of differently styled maps.  Although the good things about  are it's realism and.... nope i'm out of ideas.  I waited months and months for this to go on sale and I finally built up my PC so it could run the graphic settings on High. I still think ARMA 2 looks and plays better.  2.5/5-10
I just wanted to say. BUY IT !
This is a vary good game  I do recomand it
its not enough like cod 0/10 good try though
I loved this game when it was f2p weekend but now that it's been over i hae one question.... Can someone gift this to me? pls i give you happy ending
ove this game so realistic so many different game modes. I dont think i'll ever 'Finish' the game.10
Very good Army symulator. Very realistic and awesome :)
took a stab at improving upon what Arma 2 had acomplished but they failed heavily  Pros: -Graphics look nice if you have a beefy computer -Zues is a nice addition to play around with -Tactical gameplay is improved over Arma 2 (somewhat) -The attachments are a great addition to save having to sort through 10 different M4A1 varients  Cons: -The main islands that come with the stock game are bland and boring and Altis the larger one isn't optimized well enough so you'll probably rolling around 30-45 FPS -There isn't a lot when it comes to guns. Some of the updates help but having to pay for a few guns and mechanics is pretty  of them -The bipod system is pretty lackluster. You put a bipod on your gun and it hardly helps your aim and doesn't any animation when deploying it -The vehicals leave you wanting more variety -The drones are too inconvenient  - $18 (CAD) dollars for some helicopters and another for some guns? I bought the extreme support version before it came out so I don't have to buy the DLC (because I had hope) but that is rediculous for people to have to pay that  Overall: Unless Bohemia gets their heads out of their asses and makes some content and fixes the damn game don't buy it. Do a lot of research into this before even thinking of buying it. If you plan on pumping it full of mods and fixes then you might be fine. Be warned.-10
I love the lack of animations.  10/10
his is the story of Kerry Kerry is a soldier. He is Corporal ranked. Kerry doin very good in staying alive. Kerry keep alert and swipe his surrounding like a soldier should. Kerry fall in position and find nice cover time to time. Kerry obey chain of command. OMG Kerry can do everythingwhat would the army do without him. Kerry this Kerry that and Kerry whatsoever....  Kerry do as he commanded and Kerry doing good in the field. That's how Kerry stay in one pieces and able to keep alive from operation to operation. Kerry use a MX Assault Rifle for field operation. Kerry can aim fine and doin good gettin into stance position. Once he started to shoot. Oh My Sweet Mother Jesus of God..... Jesus have a biggest facepalm of all time.  Kerry shoot bird ! Seriously !! Kerry !! Seriously !!! No kidding Kerry??!! but...seriously !! Kerry can't shoot sh!t in the field ! I bet Kerry's Grandma can shot better than him !!!! Kerry run out of breath fast;he get tired from walkin;he get tired from running;12
he most realistic simulator I can think of  with such a vast amount of things to do I couldnt think of something better to play and pass the time with 8/10.10
ell what can i say this game is awesome! I have 489hours at the time of this review so that says alot i'd think it's worth the buy and the DLC's just put the cherry on top for awesome gameplay.  Likes: Gameplay Action Mod support  Stock modes such as King of the hill Wasteland  DisLikes: None...... 10
o all and any who are interested in Arma3 I seriously recomend what you play this game. I have spent thousands of hours on it and am still being amazed on new things that I didnt know before.10
mazing Game VERY recommended!10
This game is absolutly brilliant. It was meant for a birthday gift from my Dad but he got it us both (Me&amp;Him) and it's just been brilliant! Loved every second of it! 10/10 no word of a lie.  The only downfall of it is the ummm... ummmm....   NOTHING ATALL IS WRONG WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
fter many years this game still lags too much Badly designed game engine if the devs havent worked it out after 5 years then they never will.  Trust me.. dont buy this game. devs lack the real telent required to make AAA games.-10
Put on another SALLEEEEE
ood game i like arma 2 better though don't know why maybe it's just not time to let go yet also this is too expensive should be around 30€ or 25€ instead of 45€10
Great and realistic war game/simulator!
This game is wonderful for peapol who like a free and large world to pvp in in my opinion this game is worth the money its worth it is hard to get used to the controls but when u do u wont have problems whit getting along i recomend it for peabol who like a large and dangerous map to KOS  -Gun4Hire
his game will frustrate the living hell out of you at first maybe even to the point where you'll wanna refund it.  Please heed my word and give it a proper chance. It takes time to find good servers and learn the mechanics of the game and the multitudes of other modded gamemodes.  But my god.  Is it worth it once you do learn. The small five hours I've experience has given me some insanely fun experiences some of the most fun I've had in gaming for a long time. Even if the first two hours left me frustrated and confused but once I got my bearings and found some good servers that all changed.   Plus I got it for like $8 on sale after selling a bunch of crappy Tf2 items so woop!10
this is a really good game!
oined a squad going into the AO by scuba diving. While swimming squadmate plays 'Under The Sea' through his mic. We died 10sec later but went back and did it again.  10/10 would die again.10
Ive got to admit its a gr8 game m8. But the controls r too s4lty 4 me.
is a unique military game with an infantry focus. Built upon appropriate useful and engaging elements of simulation it's an accessible platform for a variety of official and community playable / sandbox content based on the principles of authenticity diversity and opportunity.   includes but is not limited to:    Richly detailed battlefields    Diverse range of authentically simulated vehicles and weapons    Varied pieces of playable content in singleplayer and multiplayer    Powerful scenario editor mod creation and a creative community    Learn section with bootcamp and virtual reality trainings to get you started.                                                                                             I just copied this from the games description in the menu. Decent game. 10/10 would physics again.  10
i cant play this game for some resone it just wont work i have the deluxe edition but it shuts off right in the middle then nothing pops up but it tells me its playing?????????/
Honestly I think this is the best game I've bought on steam.   Not only the best military shooter I've ever played but the best simulator and multiplayer community. There are too many gamemodes to get tired of the game and too many good mechanics of the game to get sick of it. I get pumped every time i open the game and hear the intro music and never regret buying it.  I highly recommend this game to anyone.
Total BS i cant even open the game and steam wont even help me other that that the game is quite buggy but fun untill your game dosent open then you prob have to rebuy it.
ABSOLUTLEY ! I CANT JOIN ANY SERVER AND WHEN I LAUNCH  IS LAUNCHES  LAUNCHER!  EVERYONE AT BOHEMIA AND ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH ARMA!
here are so many controls like I literally can't even10
very good game and mod you've ever wanted amazing realistic military simulator and you can build zombie survival mission with your friends? Yes welcome to  known as the last game you'll ever buy. With 1000 hours I think it speaks for itself.10
Perfect game but sometimes kinda buggy so make sure to download some mods.
Game runs smooth and looks good. Do wish i could keep the fps consistant sadly its the servers fault. 8/10 I do recommend!
 cannot say this for the vannila game (as I haven't played it) but the mods such as Battle Royal Altis Life Exile Wasteland and King of the Hill are so good I bought the game just to play them. And I don't regret it.10
game play is good but the keyboard layout kinda sucks
fter 227 hours of my life spent on this game there are a couple things I can conclude. 360 no scopes are not possible. Calling out targets are a must. Your a**hol* will be ripped apart unless you play like a team. No it's not a 'clan' we are a 'unit'. Call of duty are for children and ArmA is for men.10
Night time* -Hopped in a helicopter -Pilot 'where to bois?' -Nobody answers drops everyone at random side mission -Stay low profile as a sniper -Stayed back teammates finish side mission -Get's left behind evac leaves -Wait's 35 minutes for a helo to pick me up  10/10 would get left behind again10
This game just doesnt work for me - i was ex forces at frontline and in terms of grahics are the large scale of map is excellent.  However i feel the for one the amount of things you need to do button wise is nonsense - i even tried on a xbox controller and just doesnt satisify me at all - its a shame as this game does look great but i think i will stick with other army based fps
Its a badass game but you need 1. a good pc 2. skillz 3. good m8s 4. to have fun 68. non-rageing poweres 69. a big keyboard 70. to use WASD 71. and make catface like this --- :3 x3 ;3 B3   AND MOST INPORTANTLI: DONT SUCK!!!!!!!!
It's OK.    10/10 :)
mazing game. Good frames good gamemodes.  +10010
This game is awesome 8/8 m8!!!
If your a fan of the arma series then get this.
I have 300 hours on this game. Although 300 hours is nothing and i'm a filthy peasant. I've still plenty of good fun in this game.
quite the sexy game.
wesome Do i need to say anything else other than 'Shrek LeiksIf you can noscope This game is for true mlgs' Would noscope Again 420/1010
stands out on its own as a strange game. If you play this game without knowing what your dealing with you will rage quit. The controls take over 200 hours to learn the movement is slow and unforgiving. The DLC is a MUST becuase without you will not be able to play mods. Mods are the only thing that save Arma and the only reason it has such a cult following.  If you would like to get Arma I recommend looking into these mods:  Battle Royale King of the Hill  I recomend this game for any hardcore FPS gamer that wants to challenge themselves. The game offers a lot of stuff that I personally have never taken advantage of and only see it as a platform to play BR and KOTH.  10
O NOT BUY THIS GAME.  The singeplayer is not functioning. First time I played it was fine did the tutorials then started the campaign (which looked sweet). Then I had to do some other stuff so I saved my campaign and didn't play for a few days. So now I try to go back and continue the campaign and I can't. There is a content error. I had a mod installed via Steam Workshop (Battle Royale) which I uninstalled and I've verified the game cache with Steam and all files check out. The game is plain BROKEN AND DOES NOT WORK.  Screenshot of error -   http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/352771657374577293/E7D026BD68D57129568F64E427CA2C6D5F8BE72B/ -10
his game is terrible. WAYYYYY over-complicated. Just plain dumb. terrible graphics compared to 2 year old titles like battlefield 4. If your new to this game be prepared to sink at least 4 hours in just getting this piece of crap running. The game is useless without mods. Download mods and find out you need MORE mods to play the MODS you just downloaded. Endless file system corrections and disappointing when you finally get everything working. Im suprised this game ranks as well as it does. MOST POSITIVE?? why?-10
the FPS on this game sucks it stays the same no matter what settings youe put the game on and runs very bad.
im not good at the game first of all and i dont know how and what it is about
mmmmm yas very nice just like my dog we ate last night
Do not purchase.
his is a good game. regular free updates that could easily be DLC the DLC that does exist dosent even need to be purchased to have fun in this game. as well as that it has endless replayability with a highly active modding community the edditer zeus community made missions the campaign and much more. i cannot reccomend this game more it has something for everyone. whether you want to do simulated battles or just fly around in the realistic flight model there is even an Altis Life mod.  hope i helped someone.10
is an amazing military simulator with plenty to do throughout the game whether it be full blown battles in gamemodes such as King of the Hill or Wasteland or running a gang in the streets of Altis causing havoc everywhere you go there is something for everyone and this game certainly doesn't disappoint.10
otally worth its moneythe most valuable thing is that your old PC can run it easily :P10
f you need to cook your cake for a birthday but your oven isn't working this will do.10
irst of all...  -This game is purposefully designed to NOT work on AMD hardware. And no this is not me complaining because I have a bad pc and I'm butthurt. I have an AMD fx 6300 overclocked at 4.6Ghz and Asus Radeon R9 290x. and 16gb. This PC can easily compete with any Nvidia/Intel setup that is not literally built by the Gods and costs $5000+. If you have anything in your PC by AMD avoid this game like the plague.  So say you buy the game anyway and load it up...  -Game runs at 5fps. Spend 3 hours messing around with settings doing everything humanly possible to get a decent frame rate Finally get it to 45fps without your PC catching on fire. -Still get horrendous screen tearing.  But what if you have Intel/Nvidia and the game runs good? Good f-ing luck. Controls are nearly impossible to use and make no sense at all.  -Spend 2 hours just trying to walk around without the camera randomly locking up and forcing you to walk in a straight line while all your attempts at turning and looking around simply moves the character's head. -Switching aiming modes is hit and miss and about 80% of the time it is impossible to find how to get back to your compass. -Navigation tools are useless. There is no way to tell which dot you are on the map. If you set waypoints on the map you can never remove them and you WILL set them in the wrong place often. -There are simply SO MANY controls that half the time you have no idea what is going to happen when you press buttons. You might press I to try to pull up your inventory and suddenly find yourself laying on your back with your controls locked on head movement only with your gun sights disabled and no way to get out of this possition.  -The menus do not help. If you go to the menu to look at the controls it looks like any other FPS game controls. Only none of it works.  Finally give up let a friend try to figure it out.  -You friend plays around for like a hour trying to figure out how to walk normally. He has no more success than you did and gives up.  -Request a refund. -Denied: More than 2 hours of play time. No  I have more than 2 hours of play time it took longer than that to get it to run at more than 10fps. F-ing piece of trash.  As far as I am concerned this game is flat-out robbery. It is purposely designed to not work in any reasonable way and to purposely take you several hours to figure out that you will not be able to get it to work. So they are basically just taking your money and then making you waste your time to expire the possible refund period.  0/10: This is not even a video game it is malware. Would rather be robbed at gun point in a dark alley.-10
here is one thing you need to know about all the Bohemia Interactive games.  Every Bohemia interactive game will have an 'early access' stage. Thats when the company says 'our game is glitchy as hell but don't worry for it will be fixed in the future'. Then the sky starts raining gold on them and they forget about fixing the game.  DayZ Standalone is a live proof.-10
ith only 20 hours play time on this game I have decided to write this review.  Hyper realistic combat no such thing as shields or regen. Med packs will help to recover some health but you're still injured and can die easier.  Realistic ballistics. The rounds wont go exactly where your crosshairs are aiming.  Vehicles they are a blast though I find the helicopters and drones a touch hard to control.  Workshop support!  10/10 Would pretend to be army guy again10
ameplay is great but the Multiplayer is unoptimized as  you'll run at nearly 10-30 fps when you play MP (Only MP) even if you got a beefy computer.-10
10/10 Campaign has more cliffhangers and plot twists that Half Life 3
Best miltary shooter out there
One of the best shooter games you will ever play! There's so much variety in this game which makes it amazing! This has been out for like 3 years and it's better than any call of duty you will ever play! 10/10
10/10 Best game EVER get it and play altis or other 10/10
-10/10 would waste money again
ue to the overwhelming amount of mods it's almost impossible to enter a game. You'll receive the message: cannot enter because downloadable content has been removed. Game runs slowly and is not impressive on the graphics. Very very sorry that I spent 44 euros on this.-10
Bugs and bad performanace.
ery fun with lots of stuff to do I love this game and would definatly recommend this game to my friends10
ou're gonna need a $1500 computer to run it but it's so ing worth it.10
i killed the bad dirty irans 10/10 -IGN
wesome Game so many different types of mods to suit everybody!!! One of my fav games i have ever experienced truly a masterpiece!!10
Downloading mission file 0 KB/0 KB game en broken would never play again
This game is great. The only problem is that the game is not optimized.You need a monster pc to run this over 30 fps. 3/10
Wish I had knowen about steam refund at the time XD
i played 2 or 3 rounds it was ok i guess
Awesome! because Awesome!
11/10 would play again
Globally banned for no reason within first hour after purchase.
it is an amazing but i would say you need a strong computer to run it
very very good -realistic  -suspensful -excellent with mods  -very enjoyable  -new updade soon slight negatives -crashing in cars is buggy and needs to fixed
a cop put my in jail for nothing! i waned a payback so i went to the rebels ...  I GOT RIPD BY A 13 YEAR OLD KID!!!!!!  and then i got rebel. we killed all of them damn popo's!  I rate is 999999999999999999999999999999/10
his game is awesome to put it short.  This game offers a unique and good war experience it's fun to play with your friends or just by yourself.   The game also offers a huge varity in gameplay both in the game's content and the players' content is a very vast collection of diffrent mission and gameplays.  This game has alot of diffrent mods aswell there is apperantly Breaking point (DayZ) in the collection now.10
his game is very tactical and makes you think strategically the community is great and the game has almost anything you could want in a military simulator from community made content to extremely detailed maps and weapons. 9/1010
hates me. (Steam free) Every server I join it says there is a battleeye error and kicks me after getting back to the lobby menu  crashes. This sucks pretty pointless. Every other game that uses battle eye has no problem with me.-10
any Many Many Problems I was falsely banned over a year ago You never did ANYTHING to help resolve YOUR mistake therefor i give this a NEGATIVE review.-10
LOODY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE PERFORMANCE 2 YEARS IN IS STILL  AND THAT REJECTING COMPLAINTS AND CRITCISM FROM THE EXACT SAME ISSUE FROM ARMA 2 IS UNACCETABLE. THIS GAME STINKS  Edit: (My Arma 2 &amp; OA Review)  'You better get used to poopy frame rates because this games enginge is terrible. A few years on - no improvements. Then here comes  - same engine Bohemia Ignorantive decided to ignore the complaints and keep the exact same terrible engine. Enjoy your horrid looking sub par gaming experience.'  New update - Absolutely no changes. Nice. Terrible game.       YAY 30 FPS!!!-10
ery fun. Action packed and a great military simulator. Probably one of my favourite games worth the $32.99 if you want to get the full game for free as well as beta version access.10
fter 400 hours I'm still learning new things about this game.  The depth and breadth of the mods available for it make each time you play feel like a completely different game while the DLCs actually feel like they are worth the money with the significant changes and new gear they introduce.  For content creators with the introduction of the Eden editor in the APEX expansion makes making custom mission files (or even just screwing around on a map) a whole lot easier then previously.  Highly recommend for those seeking a realistic military simulation nothing else on the market compares.10
his  game  war simulator is good.  It's so good in fact I'm giving it a recommended.  But do I truly  recommend  it?  Unless you have a 12 core CPU and a GTX 980  OR  you enjoy an average of +-30fps.... no.10
i need help i didnt came out of the launcher
he game is largely unfinished. Its like an early access game but worse in many cases.   - when you try to walk up some stairs you'll be unable to unless you wiggle your mouse back and forth to make your guy seizure his way up onto the first stair.   -You'll get revived but without your gun this happens probably once or twice a day to me.   - Controls make no sense like when driving a car if you accidentally touch your mouse it'll steer your car into the nearest pebble thus causing an explosion killing everyone inside. You need to double tap ALT when you get in your vehicle to stop this then double tap ALT again when you get out to be able to use your mouse in first person.  - Optimization Look I get there is alot going on in this game.. but I have an AMD FX6400 @ 4.2ghz with a R9 280x and I'll get 30fps at best in many servers. My friend has an i7 5820k and 980TI and we have the exact same frames in this game. Which makes zero sense.  - Community Its nice because 'Most' of the time you'll be more likely to have a team in this game than Battlefield or other FPS's but you'll have probably 40% of the community like this and the other 60% varies from 12 year olds trying to fly you into the objective but drive you into a building or flip the chopper onto its head or some other nonsense or you'll get some  yelling military jargin at the top of his lungs demanding CAS at some coordinates and he'll bark orders and if you dont follow he'll try to team kill you. Its a pretty mixed bag to be honest.  Conclusion: I would get a refund if I could but I've put alot of effort into trying to like this game simply because it has so much potential as a concept but they used the iest game engine known to man and have put zero effort into fixing performance issues. In all the time I've had this I've seen various updates with new models guns and vehicles but not a single increase in my FPS.-10
mazing Military simulator that I think everyone should get.10
best realistic shooter 10/10 would kill csat again
I dont like the formating about how to manage you equipment is confusing
nly done it for a badge soz10
mazing game  the fact that you need a good PC / Video Card to run the game is completley wrong.  You wont be getting 100 Frames all the time eitherway no matter what PC you have.   BUY IT!!!!  Yes it does matter on the Server you join with how flooded the Map's are With AI and Spawns.   But playing KOTH  ALTIS LIFE to mods like TAKISTAN and amazing communities like Critical Gaming &amp; Project RP as well as other private communities make this game amazing.  Want to Role-Play there is a server for you.  Want to kill everyone? There is a server for you  Want to surivive in an area infested with zombies? There is a server for you.  Would you like to do real strategized missions that involve some of the most intense AI in game? There is a server for you   Overall amazing game still wish the optimization was better in terms of FPS they dont usually get higher then 30-60 in well populated areas.   Other then that its a MUST BUY!10
awesome except when a script kid ruins the fun but still awesome
This game is so much. I can find myself wasting away weeks to play this and shoot up AI and actual players. The maps are very large and very open and also the different servers and mods you can add with this are endless i love it soooooooooo much &lt;3 anywho i'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes military and realism
ne of my personal favorite games. The mulitplayer aspect is great. 20 different playable planes tanks and boats.  The APEX expansion in not worth the additional $40 I would recommend waiting for it to go on sale proior to buying.   https://youtu.be/mZRk3tHuMkA 10
Best game I've ever played.   It's like 2 games in 1. You have the military simulator and the roleplay! This game is way too good.
ve logged a few hours on this game so i think i can say a thing or two.   First off  isn't your normal First person shooter This game takes skill it isn't like Call of duty or Battlefield ther isn't a rank system and there isn't an XP system. This is 100% millsim You will throw out into a map that is massive beyhond any map you've ever seen. The combat is random at times and intense with no limit on 'fair gun play' Depending on what mode you play you and with who- you won't be shooting your gun a lot. this game takes a lot of time. The story mode is fun and gets you into some good basic combat along with a fair story line.   MP is full of mods and game modes set for almost everyone looking for either laid back game modes that you can hang out and play with your friends or 100% tactical millsims that rage on for hours with strict Millitary commands and stratagys.   the editer is another great tool in this game if you wanna try your skills in editing a mission or just playing down soilder to fight it out you can! The editer puts you in the driver seat for what you want to create!     Now lets talk about what you're gonna need for PC specs; first off forget the reccomended specs it's 100% BS   you're gonna wanna an Intel I5 or I7 first off this game doesn't like AMD regadlesss of cores.  8GB of ram at the least! 12-16gb is best. And a GPU that can hold up to Armas insane looking graphics ( did i mention this game looks amazing?)    Sadly lagg and FPS drops are all to common in this game even with my PC specs i get 15 20 frames in towns when small battles are going on.   BI never really optamized this game very well and it's really hurting us players who don't have enough money to dump on a new PC (i've been trying since this game came out toget it to run great still trying)     so last lets do pros and cons     pros   -millsim tactics  -large multiplayter games  -many things to do from flyingboatingdriving   -good story line with easy to get into modes  -realalistic battles with intense firefights    CONS  -poorly optamized   -too many mods on some servers causes issues  -easy to play not easy to get use to/into     Honestly there isn't much i can say bad about this game. I really enjoy it and have a ton of fun playing it with all the freedom it gives you if you got a good PC and wanna try something different. Buy !10
Created simple scenario Played it Got bored Added reinforcements for both side Add tanks Add planes and helicopters Realize what I made is pretty good Crashes  11/10 would get run over by a tank again
i liked 2 more but they are working on it
 wish I had more time to be a part of a clan and play this game actively. I love it it's probably one of the best FPS out there.10
So let me start this review with the few cons the game has to get all the negative stuff out of the way  CONS: 1: ive run into a few problems with the game crashing most of the time its due to mods witch is fine it just get annoying after a few crash's but this is mostly my opinion 2: The DLC other then APEX is terrible the people CARTS really. 3: The AI for the most part is terrible  Well now thats out of the way now lets get to the good stuff  PRO'S  1: The game is really fun ive put more than 700 hours into it and for good resson 2: The editor is great. its easy to make missions that are simple for the people who dont know what there doing but if you now how to do the more advanced stuff you can make some cool stuff. 3: Mods there are sooooooo many of them most are terrible but the really good ones are easy to find on the workshop and there is armaholic that has mods that arnt on steam 4: Mutiplay is amazing hosting for you and friends is easy just portforward and your good and the bigger servers are great like =7= cav. 5: The teamplay is amazing if you have a headset i recomend you use it if you play on the muliplayer it makes the game so much better.  Well there you go this game is great even with the bugs but the dev's have fixed most of them. With that said I highly recomend this game
mazing tactical game with a good mix of fast pace action and long drawn out gunfights. Game is even further advanced with the introduction of thousands of mods custom campaigns and custom game modes not to mention Exile.  Unfortunately slighly brought down with terrible multiplayer optimisation with massive fps drops between single and multiplayer10
Excellent warfare-combat game
Very good game. Defiantly worth the money
The bad optimization and Adverts fall into insignificance because of how good the gameplay is! Best game on Steam IMO.
I should have brought this game a long time ago. Great game
y first impressions of this game was down right spectacular. Upon discovering this game I have never seen a Milism game like this. The guns are on point the Vehicles are on point... Just about every detail on this game is on point. Except a few hiccups or two.  My overall rating for this game is 9.5/1010
ARMA is a great tactical shooter. If you were a fan of the original ghost recon game back in the day then I think this will be perfect fit. Warning: This game can be pretty resource intensive. If your computer isn't getting above 30fps with a distance renderdistance then you might as well return it.
ery adaptive massive community workshop and never ending fun with unlimited scenario/mission type building... awesome multiplayer.  Worst part is its a single core game and my amd fx8350 is not very good with it. Funny Even brand new games will run 60 fps for me. But not arma10
its a good game but could use a better tutoral for players that have never played a arma game in there life.
f you want a high intensity combat simulator this is the game for you. Attention to detail across the board with weapon dynamics and interactive world. I recommend for any one who is a veteran or simply looking for a strong military simulator.10
he best military simulation I've ever played. This could easily be my most favorite game of all time. Those two hundred hours went by like they were a weekend. This is why:  -Realistic sounds and military communication -Expansive maps without borders that tempt you to see what's on the other side -Beautiful graphics that immerse you into the military setting -Authentic physics that mirror true ballistics -Dedicated and passionate modding community with hundreds of mods that tweak the game in every imaginable way -Faithful developers that continue to improve and put out new content for the game that they don't charge for! -Large multiplayer fan base -YouTube tutorials and general bad assery...  Some Neg: -Single thread CPU dependant (4790K or 6700K prefered). Will not multithread which leads to some laggy performance even in single player. Some of this is due to how immense the world is that is being rendered. Apart from that it's just the way the game was coded and it's not changing. -Cheezy voice acting and silly repetitive character movements (small nitpick).  Overall I LOVE this game. Buy it at full price because that is what it deserves!10
reat game. So far I've logged 253 hours and it's going great.  But the thing is the DLC is basically a new ArmA game.10
ery good military simulation game.  does have a steep learning curve for people who have came from games like Call of Duty or Battlefield (Like myself). After you get the basic controls and learn how to hide behind cover this game extremely fun.10
An awsome war simulator with an editor that creates unlimited possibilities.
fter playing this for two years now this game is still one of the best Military Simulator game i've ever played.10
Really good game with great mods
very good game though they still have to fix certain things in it
 By far my favorite game there's just so much to do from exile(DayZ) to milsims.10
 Join unit  become friends with a certain person  certain person and i went through boot and SOI together   First operation  resting gun on top of rock with friend next to me  we are in fireteam alpha set to hold  fireteam bravo was flanking the obj  i have eyes on enemy with sniper  Sniper turns toward us  Hear a shot.  See the smoke  See the tracer pass through my friends head while he falls and dies  You will not be forgotten
hard to learn but really fun!
A guy pure walked up tae me wae a helicopter and heavy scudded me wae it. 9/11
ve only played this game for a few hours no for real and here are a few things I've learned in my short time in the strange world of :  -A Gtx 970 is a low end GPU here -It is the only competitive game to ever exist that has an understanding and supportive community -Driving cars with a mouse is a terrible idea -Piloting an aircraft period is a terrible idea -Your ping affects your fps somehow????? -Guns do nothing  No but really this game is fun you should get it.10
Werry good game.. I like the editor mode mostly.
A very fun game. Lots of fun things to do. I would totally recommend to people who like playing shooting games. Good Game. 10/10
his game disapoints me as an ArmA fan this game got lots of praise when it came out (which I didn't really understand) then in the last year or so Bohemia Interactive had been moving in the right direction finally and then Bohemia decided to remove the 2D editor recently which basically ruined it for me putting this game in an early grave for creators like myself who loved the 2D editor.-10
he only thing you need to know about playing  is that no matter what you do the game plays like . All Arma games play like  it is a physics law. Whether you have a i7 with SLI 780's or a 8350 with Xfired 7970's this games your FPS will change more than peoples opinions on Ben Affleck being Batman.   PROS: Workshop +++ Replayability  Open Map (a little empty though) Engaging Campaign (So far) Intelligent Difficulty (unlike Arma 2)  CONS: The Game engine Need for tweaking for a remotely SOLID 60fps Stupid animations The inventory system The designers made stupid choices on vegetation popping again rather then building a sound game.   FINAL COMMENTS:   I LOVE ....  BUT I BELIEVE IF SOMEONE MADE A BOT FILLED GIANT CTI MOD FOR JUST CAUSE 2. Then I have no need to play Arma at all.10
cant even get the game to open after unistalling and reinstalling why does it have to be so complex to play a game these days im not trying to write software or unzip a bunch of files...........
hs single player and unmodded version of this game are excellent!  While this is a great realistic combat military simulator the multiplayer aspect of the game uses mods for almost every server you connect to. The process of getting these mods installed is very difficult and in many cases results in days of frustration trying to get it running. The architecture should be set up to analyze what files are on the servers that are not present on the PC it is run on and download these directly instead of using 3rd party programs to validate mods which is usually only partially successful.  Check out the original Unreal Tournament for how this could be improved. That worked flawlessly!  Overall  is a great game and I spend many hours playing it at least when I'm not trying to fix my mods on my local PC.10
its 
Arguably the best military simulation so far. Keep up the good work BIS
this game is worth the $29.99 so buy it
ery fun and realistic military simulater game however I barely play the vanilla game (Do to the thousand of mods on the workshop and Armaholic). I'm usually playing the game with a mod called OPTRE (Operation:Trebuchet) which brings Halo to .  Anyways game is very fun to play with friends. After you get bored of the base game (Usually after a couple of days) you can download custom missions and other mods to spice the game up again.   Houndreds of mods on the workshop so there's something for everyone (Except Star Wars RIP Empire Strike).  So come on join the Arma club... We have Jackets.10
mazing game 10/10 hopefully they make it for console10
This a dancer of a game. Fun fun fun. Get yourself in an online MP clan and enjoy this game to the max. Thumbs up from the Hibby
Parked my helicopter in the middle of a field in the middle of nowheresville.  Cop of the year spots me.  Have to pay $55.000 ticket for parking in a 'busy' area.  $225.000 Helicopter gets scrapped after i pay ticket.  69/10 Would waste 280k again.
eep bringing us SIM users everything you do bc honestly I'd still be using laser guns outside if it wasnt for this.10
This game is what Military games should be!
reat game Had to relearn the helicopters again from A2 (that was fun). All in all great game.10
arge realistic maps a high variety of different (community made) modes and a lot of fun even tho you have to run for like a hour to just get sniped from a distance where you could not even see the enemy and start over and over again in the hope to see a enemy.10
Accurately simulates military operations and the meltdown of whoevers computer it is currently running on.  Great game even though I'm lucky to get 15 fps  9.5/10
I definatly recommend this game for anyone who's an advanced tacktics and shooter type player  Downsides no WWII mod and the WWII DLC is no longer buyable for some stupid reason. and the mods dont always work right
 slow paced military shooter so don't try to compare it with COD or BF in any way. and it is on a much larger scale than just aim and shoot10
hen i bought this game when it first came out i bought the deluxe edition. May i say it was the best money i ever spent games such as battlefield and call of duty can never compare.   The mods for the game are amazing and the community which surrounds the game.  But the one thing I am annoyed about is the APEX DLC itself. I am annoyed for me and all the ohters who bought the Deluxe  edition and were told that they would recieve all future DLCs yet we didnt recieve APEX as it is basically the same price as the base game XD.  Seriously the price of the DLC needs to be reduced for deluxe edition owners or given to those who do not yet own it.10
Steam wants me to write a review about this game eventhoug i have never played it and infact dont even own it. :D
ots of controls with complicated functions.  Maybe this game is not for me but the graphics are still good in this game.  This game a realistic millitary game. Maybe if you want something easier you could get something like Insurgency or other games but to me this game is difficult. So I refunded. Not saying its bad but its graphics is good.10
It is ok
is a fantastic war simulator first and thired person The story mode aspect isnt the best but multiplay life mods and king of the hill is Fabulous and i'd just buy the game for the zombie aspect(breaking pointepoch) Also on the steam worksop has 10s of thosounds of scenarios and mods that you can have at a click of a button. 9/1010
Best Athsmatic Simulator 2016  1/1  Best Game  (It is really fun)
is Bohemia Interactives newest title.  was made for more casual gamers making the Arma series more easier to learn.  is a military sandbox so you are not very limited to what you can do. Want to have a full scale war? Go ahead. Want to have thousands of jets flying in the skies having dogfights? If your pc can run it go for it! The base game of  provides many many features and content. Though if you want to buy the Apex DLC or get mods from the large variety of mods from the Steam Workshop or Armaholic you can go for it. Be aware that this DOES affect performance. Though this game DOES have its downsides. Like the horrible vanilla AI. If the AI went into combat mode they wouldn't get out of it until EVERYTHING on the map was gone. There are also many units to choose from on the  website from casual to semi-realism to full realism. All three unit types affect gameplay casual being using Vanilla  or possibly mods and they just play to have fun while semi-realism is based off a real military with its own seperate branches but there is no ranking system. Full realism is for real and hardcore Arma players to play as they were actually in a military branch. They have full ranking systems and you have to do certain things to get higher in the ranks like in real life. There are also many gamemodes to choose from for Multiplayer from Zeus to PvP and community gamemodes like Altis Life or KoTH. In my opinion  is a replayable experience. Everytime you click play on custom missions anything could happen the ending is never the same. The AI never acts the same.10
antastic game tons of online servers 10/10 would buy again10
Amazing Game! anyone that likes simulators and that has a good PC so you can enjoy the amazing graphics
avorite game totally inlove with it!10
If you buy this gamer make sure you use the external launcher with mods and find an exile server
Best with friends :3
The perfect Military Simulator!!! Just look at the 33 things about . :)
hail hitler
est Military Shooter  Well I've been playing this game for a long time now and it's awesome! Getting even better with every update I've seen  making progress. Everything in this game is good and fun!10
It's a pretty fun game
Anything you want or think of about war . You can see it here and play with it  Astonishing game . Totally worth it
 remember quitting consoles and COD to play Arma 2 (at first to play DayZ but got bored of that quick) and being beyond lost since the only other PC game I'd played was Minecraft and Counter Strike (which I was stupidly bad at). It took me a long time to get the ropes and when  came along I knew I had to hop on the train. And boy oh boy was it worth every penny.  is an artistic masterpiece capable of putting you in shock of just how massive and capable the world is. While  is boasted as a Military Simulator which is does a superb job at it is capable of so much more. It is a beautiful sandbox world full of fun. Land races tank battles Mil Sim missions King of the Hill (which almost feels like Battlefield conquest) DayZ and so much more silly fun you can do when with a few friends and an empty server. In this war torn world the only limit is your imagination.10
5*
is an amazing game for any military lover I personally enjoyed the realism and authenticity of all that Bohemia Interactive has givin us.   The only bad part is if you're new to Arma you're most likely going to start out alone however join a server and be a bit social and you'll meet like minded people.  All and all the game is very satisfying and I would recommend it with a 8/10 review score. 10
Amaizing game when modded and ok when not modded. Would reccomend to get  and mod it.
his is very realistic Sim but at the beginning there is so much to learn that it is some times difficult to come back to it. Vehical interface is still bit clunky. But I am still commitedf to master it if I can just find the time. Well worth a look if you like first person shooters with a bit more thinking to be done.10
reat game a lot to learn starting off new but after a few hours you should be playing well or at least better than you were 3 hours ago. Huge learning curve but worth the time putting into it. I recommend playing single player campaign first to get your controls down.10
This game with mods and the editor is so good. Fps in multiplayer is a bit bad but i recommend it :)
i really liked this game and i recommend it to all players to play it
Unplayable. Bugs left and right and vey cluncky
 Wow I just haven't played a game like it. All of my hours that I have put into this game I do not regret. From roleplaying on the beaches of altis to Military Realism in an Australian Milsim unit. This game has everything someone would want in a game. Everytime I load into  there are new oppurtunities for missions roleplaying stories.  Bohemia Interactive really hit the mark with this game. After Apex the game has got a whole load interesting with the game recieving updates Bohemia did a great job on this game this is also the only game that I will never get bored of and that is what game designers and game studios need to think about when designing their games with something that is timeless yet never repeats itself.  11/10 - Great Job Bohemia Interactive10
attle Royalle is awesome the game is very cpu dependent but never drops more than 30 fps if you reduce visibility to 1000 or lower.  You will not disappoint.10
Seems like it would be a fun game if you put more time into it.
The game looks and feels amazing with the graphics and immersion implimented for those really into the military typle of people. The game renders in everything individuals so frames may be an issue for you but it's honestly not that big of a deal if you adjust them in the launch menu.
A masterpiece like no other   Bohemia Interactive came up with a great idea and they did a great job in putting it into practice.  The performance you get while playing arma is also more than perfect.   With me having played a lot of arma in almost every single 'gamemode' i think i can clearly tell it is totally worth the money.10
i playd arma 2 then i died and the i called my friend dave and then
mazing game very detailed and fun to play10
ood game extremely realistic.10
It's okay I guess.
very good game. highly recommend getting this game.
Very enjoyable game if your into fps ans rpg
t is the game I have always wanted! An open world military game which gives so much options of things to do like single player multiplayer Zeus and playing scenarios from the workshop! The combat is realistic and the campaign is realistic!10
server sucks no good but it is a good game
 great simulator of my home country Alpacastan. I appreciate the correct modelling of Alpacastanians and there wonderful law-enforced attire of blue striped shirts hats tan shorts and sandals. I also love the fact that you can recreate traditional Alpacastanian picnics within this great simulator. It always brings tears to my eyes to remember the death of my grandfather Backwards Cap Guy- he was hit by a car and then shot by a spy during the Great Cleansing of Stan.  RIP he will be missed.  11 frolicks out of 10.10
This game is amazing i have seen gamplay i would recemend it to eny one that likes war games. This game is nice to play with friends. If i could get the money i would buy this but i dont have eny :( sadly
ello  I am one of these people that don't really have patience to play online and do some badass team realistic gameplay.  I have over 140h of gameplay and 95% of it is just me messing around in the editor. This game is fantastic if you love playing around with military stuff and THANK YOU SO MUCH TO MODERS !  The campaign can be fun but for me all the fun is in the editor and playing with the big guns.  I recommand it 100% !10
Ya this a great game.
Great game glad I bought it.
Pretty enjoyable if you like military sims. This is hardly a casual game and has a learning curve to it. I'd say the worst part is the awful optimization.
This is the best game on steam. To be honest with you this is the best game i have ever played! With argueably the most realistic mechanics in a shooter you have never been truely immersed in a game until you've tried this game.  Pros: -Incredibly realistic -Amazing shooting mechanics -Beautiful graphics -Smooth Gameplay -Amazing multiplayer content Cons: - Not owning the dlc can be annoying in some situations example i was playing EPOCH and after 20 minutes of searching for a gun I finally found one but then was deeply saddened when i realized it was a Marksman DLC gun so i couldnt pick it up and use it without purchasing the DLC  If you are into military weapons and tactics pick this game up and if you enjoy having hyperrealistic mechanics in your shooters then you'll absolutly love this game! 10/10 Truely a masterpiece in gaming history.
y far this is my favrioute game You never get bored playing  because there is such a viraty of game modes(Altis LifeTakistan LifeBattle Royale and KOTH Just to name a few) and sceanrios like hitman. Arma Is a game that i would defintly recomend. Arma is mostly perfect apart from the some what glitchy terrain and  Campaign.10
10/10 Would get blown up by CAS again.
had this since pre order the game overall is great with a large selection of mods
Spent 350 hours of playing this game mopping up the puddle that it made my computer into
Cod is for girls Battlefield for boys arma for men
Didn't play much... it was alright.
uns like a bag of  seriously MP is a slideshow but always fun10
sick stuff m8 die when u jump in a rock 8/8
reat game to play with friends  by yourself though. I recommend joining a realisim unit or a group of peeps who play this often so you can get the most fun out of it. you also may want to consider to buy the DLC bundle for maximum DLC and freedom euphoria. Getting a new PC just for this game. A GTX 970 will do it! (hopefully) 10/10 would buy all the DLC and shizz. P.S. you need a good rig to make this game look amazing otherwise it's pretty standard.10
i like the game but rlly rlly to many DLC to many
This game. You can do whatever you want in it.  It is the best game that have been released that i have ever played.  !!! 10/10 !!!
mazing Graphics Amazing gameplay just overall amazing10
ery good game it never gets boring cause it always get new mods or cool updates 10/10.10
ery addicting game I give it a 3 thumbs up.10
 Well This Seems a Decent Game For The Price you are paying. With a high quality graphics engine. But there are a few downsides with the game. Like most games that use a graphics engine of this quality and are generally free-world. There is a lot of walking and i don't recommend the game for someone who has a bad computer. CPU and graphics card. Currently i am neutral. Your Decision Some people like it. some people don't. But the variety of mods is over the roof at the current moment :)  Thanks for reading - Review - #0110
his game is addictive enough said.10
It's like better A2 but with f'kin' ragdolls.
The most realistic FPS I've ever played. Get it if you like a challenge.
 is the ultimate combination between tactical military shooter and t simulator.
ye this is pretty good i mean I got to invade russia with quadbike so 9/10
Great Graphics.  Great Mods .  Great RP Servers.  Worth the money.
hree words Get this game.  10/10 CAS missions are great.10
10/10 game i suggest apex lots alhough the money. Dont let the money trick you its expencive but its an amazing game
uns awful and is full of bugs. Also game has a bunch of fun information about the islands in the loading screens and most of it is made up/ doesn't exist.   The MP is glitchy and frustrating because it's only janky modded game modes or a co-op you need to que up with friends to play. The SSP is terribly voice acted and has awful pacing. Animations are silly and stiff.  The game is pretty when you stand still and look at the scenery though. Must have if you enjoy scenery otherwise pass.-10
very nice game.  Im just here for the community ambassador badge
..............................
Probably the best military game I've ever played .
 I would highly recommend this game for those looking for an immersive realistic ground assault experience.  What makes this shooter particularly immersive?   Aiming is affected by breathing and body position    Exhaustion is dynamic and is a major gameplay mechanic when on foot    Vehicles and weapons are based on real life    Sound travels at the speed of sound  The campaign alone has many hours of fun gameplay that forces you to think tactically. I will say that most of the servers did not appeal to my taste but BattleRoyale was immensly fun. If you like a Hunger Games style or hardcore gameplay in general you will enjoy the popular BattleRoyale servers (the mod used to play on these servers can be found  here ).  On another note there are tons of controls for this game so getting them all configured to your taste will likely take a while but once you've done that they should no longer be an issue. Also you can adjust the graphics settings to get better FPS and have it still look pretty good on a half-decent computer.10
you can pick APPLES!!!!!!!!!! you cant do that in any other game can you
ever since the new update i keep getting high fps(good thing lmao) and every few second horrible stutters. I DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON HELP
love this game very very detailed and campain really fun
Great Game. Recommend to anyone who can run it.
a very fun game you can get a bunch a mods to change up the game so the game won`t get boring.  is worth the money
10/10 Need to play this game. Worth buying the game. Worth buying the dlc.
8/10  An addictive military sim with beyond addictive mods! Incredible!
est game IMO thousands of mods/missions that others make for you to enjoy. Worth my money.10
wsome game. With almost 2000 hours I speak from experience. However I gave up trying to play because of CONSTANT bugs and crashes--every time I try to play there is some issue. Too bad for me. If you have computer skills(which I do not) buy the game.10
Love it. Amazing game. 10/10 A+ :D
The game is extreamly customizable with mods and gives a variety of ways to play the game 10/10
ealized that i could draw in the map so i made a dickbutt got perm. banned from the server. Great game.10
I started playing Operation Flashpoint back in 2002 and have stayed faithful to the series. Nothing captured the magic of the original OFP the way  does. I can't find any fault with --it is simply hands down the best at what it is which is a military simulation. If you are patient and plan out your movements you will suceed in this game. The graphics are amazing and the firefights are just too intense. I have a mid-grade graphics card and a $30 sound system and I'm still blown away. Just the stand alone  game is massive value for your dollar. That's all I have and I downloaded the free CTI maps and the mission 'Hunter 6' from the workshop. That's all you need to get started friends. This is one game you'll always come back to.
Great game 10/10 IGN
This is a really fun game and it looks stunning. The only problem with this game is that it is very cpu intensive. On ultra settings with a GTX 1070 and a I7-6700 i get about 50 FPS which isnt bad but keep in mind that was on single player in multiplayer I'd be lucky to get 30FPS. Other than that its a great game with a great community of players and modders.
Arma best game I have ever played....
I can now sort of fly a helicopter into a hot landing zone.
Love this game so much! I get great FPS all the time and it is the perfect MILSIM ever mad!
Flying a helo in Arma is litterally button-mashing simulator 2016.
Great game excepted the price of DLC.
till learning the controls good game 10/10 !10
The best game I've ever played. This is such an awesome game and so realistic.  Great work Bohemia Interactive!
The best shooting game out there must buy
Overall a superfun game but the ing battleye client ruins it all:/ 5/10
boring all they good servers got shutdown
It does not look good enouph for it to run this slowly.
od end my suffering thank grand master gaben for allowing me to return this beautiful piece of garbage. The game its self is very pretty but good luck being able to enjoy that as you frame rate has a stroke and goes from 50 to 2 in the blink of any eye i by no means have a super computer but i surpass all minimum and some of the recommened requirement. Also if you are new to pc gaming good luck being able to find a server with just the vanilla game cause you won't or if you do itll be you and one guy who doesn't speak english jerking each other off until you Disconnect randomly.  For 40 dollars i would never buy this game maybe for 15 but thats a huge maybe. That being said it is a beautiful game with great maps and visuals   1/plocibo ruski comrade?-10
onestly i had a real dank time fighting isis in one of the workshop scenarios they even scream allahu akbar  10/10 dankest game10
I totally recommend this game for the modders community. Awesome game as vanilla too
rthur Morris (1922–2015) was an Australian cricketer who played 46 Test matches between 1946 and 1955. He is best known as a prominent member of the 'Invincibles' a team that went undefeated on their tour of England in 1948. In his teens Morris became the first player ever to score two centuries on his first-class debut. After serving in the Australian Army during the Second World War he made his Test debut against England. He scored a century in his third match and two more hundreds in the following Test becoming only the second Australian to score a hundred in each innings of an Ashes Test. By 1950 he was Australia's vice-captain and had amassed nine Test centuries with a batting average over 65. Thereafter his form declined and his career ended after his first wife became terminally ill in 1955. In later life Morris served as a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground for over twenty years. Selected in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century in 2000 and inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2001 he is widely regarded as one of Australia's most successful left-handed batsmen.10
njoyed playing a good deal of SP mode. Even before when I pirated it to test if my pc can run it. SP is great! Absolutely amazing! had tons of fun with mods and mission editor. But as a SEA player this game's MP sucks BIG TIME! There is only one populated SEA server and its THAI so nobody really speaks english and everytime I try to join it I get   this   [imgur.com]  . What a waste! I regret buying this. I would still recommend it but if you're a SEA player looking to play MP this game has nothing to offer you. Unless you're Thai.   TL:DR SP is great! MP sucks if you're from SEA and not Thai.10
est thing since sliced bread for men at least.10
Event better than Arma 2!
is a very fun game that is when you can find a server that you can play on. i have had this game for two days now and have found 1 server that is playable. I got kicked from that server now every single one is an dlc or mod. i do NOT feel like paying upwards of 50 extra dollars for a already 40 dollar game so i can get into servers that i can play on. The developers really need to look into getting some official servers insteed of random people making a server that no one joins. For gods sake there is a arma addon for every single thing in the game that cost 300 dollars i just wonder how many people has accualy bought that addon that alone would probably pay for some official servers. I would have to say i would not recomend this game due to its por quality of trying to accualy play the game you have just payed 40 dollars for.-10
When this game becomes available on Linux systems?
kay... If you want to buy this game think really good. This game sucks if you dont have anyone else playing it with you... I have a couple of mates who play with me Roleplay stuff and Co-Op specops.  Just my advice Buy this game when some of you mates do Or just get bored. Just to show After 10 hours in my own when i first bought it Ive seen every bit the campaign. Only fun is editing some levels But gets bored. But this still is a great game! I would really recommend it If you do have a mate Or just like editing some missions. Which can be high tech sh*t. So. Lets get to the real deals.  Postives : Good Co-Op. 3D AND 2D Level/Scenerio editor. Great Campaign. 2 Step Server Hosting. LAN () And public if you have portforward Can include your own made mission into a LAN server to play with you mate. Realistic Outfits Vehicles And guns Alot of Guns Vehicles And Costumes.  Negatives : You get each DLC/Pack which u cant use. Waste of Space To get a proper map on this the steam addons will be 15+ GB In your own the game sucks after 10 hours of playing. Getting the editor do what you want is a hard thing to learn. (^Tutorials on YT are best Ofcourse^) This game can have OP A.I. So its quite ragefull.   My personal funny moments : Trying out all of the guns of the Wipeout (JetPlane) on the ground. And dropping a bomb and blow ourselfes up. We didnt know it dropped bombs :) :D  Thought we were pro by giving some aircover to the squad And crash straight into a tree. We laughed for hours  14/15 Km we did fly with chopper Which takes quite long (5-10 minutes) and then we saw the eject button We were like whuuutt.... And we jumped out..... No parachute... No Huron anymore.... Lets restart the mission....  We switched from Nato to CSAT just for a change According i start shooting CSAT.... Which were my team.... And my m8 suicide landen a chopper on me... RIP M8 AND ME INCLUDING CHOPPER    Well... This is a fun game if you play with the right men! I keep enjoying it everyday  And peeps.... Always go for NATO.... Not CSAT... Csat sucks.   10
Awesome military simulator that is serious and also goofy and fun
mazing game when it comes to graphics and gameplay but also a great game over all! There is so much to do with all the addon possiblities like dayz and battle royal.10
very good fun to play!
if you want to play online it is almost impossible to do unless you download a ton of mods and if you do so than you wont be able to play a different game type.
I like to play your game
f you want to join the army then buy this game instead of joining the real army great graphics great mods great everything. The DLC is kind of ridiculous but it does help.10
russian accents
f you like Mass community built mods tanks explosions snipers machine guns a  ton of death Hell raining from the sky because of fast moving jets You will love arma. Arma has alot of different aspects and mods. Here are some examples King of the hill- Start off with a weapon 3 teams fight to control an area heli's and land vehicles are used to transport you there once in the AO you must fight the other teams till your team has the most players inside gain weapons and levels from getting kills assists and holding the AO.   Wasteland - 3 teams Opfor blufor and indie Opfor and blufor are teamwork based teams work together to capture missions kill ai and player. Indie are solo or group based teams kill everyone steal everything. Many more shooting based mods are available however if you arent much of a shooter and enjoy Roleplay there are many based rp mods such as Lakeside and altis. Lakeside being a more serious rp based server.  However this game does have some flaws it requires a good pc to run well FPS can be choppy on some servers. But this does not ruin how much fun you will have in this game start from the bottom and work your way up to a highly skilled player.10
is a dissapointment simple as that.   The only real pro of this game is it's ability to host large worlds/maps and that's really where it ends.  The games graphics aren't great Even when put to max it barely exceeds the visual quality of games like Far Cry 2 which was released 5 years before this. The game lacks content copmared to it's predessesors weapons and vehicles are extremely limited in variety. Don't believe this 'over 40 weapons' BS that simply isnt true theres around 20 or so actual weapons and the other supposed 20 are actually just varients with underslung grenade launchers (which are detachable by the way) or even just camo varients. It took a year after the official release of the game before the campaign was even finished although I haven't tried completing it as it bugs out and crashes for me on the first level.  To top it off the game runs like crap My rig can run games like Far Cry 3 and Metro Last light on Ultra settings at over 100fps yet this game on standard fails to achieve a steady 30fps most of the time. You have to mess around with launch paramters and config files to make the game run at a mediocre performance level because the game is not optimised at all which I don't see as acceptable from a fully released title. The game is still a 32-bit application so the game wont take full advantage of your RAM if you have more than 4GB in most cases never using more than 2GB. The developers knew about this probelm when the game was in alpha and plenty of people complained about it and the developers have simply ignored this probelm completely.  The one redeeming factor that might make this game worth buying is the Modding community there's some really great interresting mods out there for . However it's sad to have to say that a game is only worth buying for Mods because that in turn means that the base game is so bad that the only thing making it playable is people actually changing the game itself.-10
ll I can say is if you dont like this game there is something wrong with you. So many this to do play RP (Role Playing) servers realistic servers and download a sh*t ton of mods. This game shows what can be made with time and shows true beauty. THE GRAPHICS ARE SO F*CKING GOOD ITS UNBELIEVEABLE!!!! In my opinion one of the best games out there.10
his game is the bomb great mods and great overall gameplay. A huge setp up from arma 2 in graphics and gameplay. I have played 31 hours of this game since monday that is 5 hours a day 10/10.10
I fell off a building and my character was still standing so I thought he was okay but then he ragdolled into the ground.   10/10 2 hardcore for me
Perfect game for TACTICAL and MILITARY STRATEGIC Gamplay! not for fun like running around and trolling. if you want to do that go f**k yourself and go get a life.
00% recommend it. Extremely active community. Tons of mods and many things to do from exploring the Tropical coreners of Tanoa to the dry plains of Altis. Lots of areas to explore vehicles to drive and wars to wage.  You can use the editor to make your own or zeus for live action battles without a rest. You can get many hours on this title and it will always stay fresh because of the active modding community10
ice game needs some optimitsing for lower systems for 60 player multiplayer. Overall a amazing game highly recommend to buy and play it!10
layed it a bit pretty fun10
This Is THE Most Bad  game Holy crap
0/10 too complicated
Pretty cool.
ummary: I like it but not enough to buy it.  Honestly  isn't terrible. Occasionally the objective is unclear and sometimes you have to travel a large distance for a simple task. (Swim 130m to 'disarm' a mine by simply pressing spacebar.) It would seem more rewarding to literally disarm the mine via minigame or something making it worth the travel time. Frame rate could be a little better. Graphics aren't impressive. Audio needs improvement. (Sometimes there is a helicopter above you making it difficult to hear dialogue.) The concept is really cool but I think for a $40 price tag I expect fewer issues. There are better games for your money IMO.  Rating: 3/5-10
is a military sandbox that tops its own niche. There are many aspects that have been improved off of Arma 2 but also some that remain—looking at you AI— untouched.  Pros: —New and improved graphics —No mouse acceleration —weapon and equipment customization —Slightly better AI *being incremently improved —over 30 different land air and water vehicles to choose from —Huge 270 km squared main island and 20 km squared smaller island —New underwater mechanics (diving) —Advanced bullet and penetration ballistics —*When everyone works together cooperatvely to accomplish a missiontheres a certain feeling you get that other games don't quite have  Cons: —action menu interface is a bit clunky *sometimes dangerous —AI are still sometimes incredibly stupid —only runs on 2 cores at any available time by default *tweakable in launcher settings —Can only use 4 GB max RAM due to Arma being a 32-bit program —Does not give full naked eye FOV unless you stay zoomed out —body armor is a bit too* protective —Sometimes Arma physics go wrong and flips your vehicle (rarely)  So obviously the pros outweigh the cons here leading me to conclude that I would definitely recommend this game to others.10
A pleasent military sim
It is a fun game
 hate the direction that bohemia interactive are going with all the DLC but other then that great game.10
its a good game with a couple good gamemodes
mazing Game Love the Altis Life..On a weekend free Looking to Buy the Game..10
uch fluctuations in gameplay sandbox battle royale a game for the Bohemia lover and creative type!10
his has to be one of the best games although it would be nice to add more vehicles and weapons.10
great game may get boring but eventually u will find new and fun stuff
 Would Say That This Is The Best Game Of All Time. Best Simulation Game.Mostly love playing Altis Life Where You Can Become CopsCivsAnd EMS. Very Fun Game To Play With My Friends. Just Buy The Game. TRUST ME.10
Best Military Simulator on Steam!
this game is tactical as 
ruined my life
How to play  in 3 easy steps  1. Join a Santa Maria KOTH server   2. Unlock the Alamut Launcher  3. Shoot your team mates at spawn with so called launcher and watch them fly away into the sunset  10/10 -ign  (im glad they fixed the random crashing tho :)
I played it a bit. It was fun.
this game is cool  with all dlc best game ever wit very good mods Godlike
hat more games should strive for depth and intelligence not just a game for games sake. But a platform a space you can make you're own.10
Really good realistic game. fun to roleplay on altis life servers!!!
recommend for legit hardcore gamer beside that ? just stay away from this game
a manly game for manly gamers
hile our group has many hours in the older versions of COD and the newer Insurgency we have found a great deal of fun not only learning so many new aspects of  we've found a new home.  is a fantastic team player game with many hours of fun ahead. Well done Bohemia well done.10
it should be transport planes like arma 2 cause its epic thank you bohemia but those who dowmnload kt shoould get it free
i like the part where one of my allies rush head first into the AI hostiles and kill all of them with a pistol   amazing
This game is the best one you could play a multi action game where you rp and you can play battle survers or you can play co-op with friends i would recomend  becuase this has new guns new cars and new people sadly in this one theres no changing skins but really it don't matter becuase of the dramatic deaths and missions waiting for you and its mission line is very nice and advanced and thats why you should recomend 
t seems that bohemia always catch themselves when it comes to the arma series: make an incredibly immersive military sim and amazing mod support yet have next to nothing in terms of optimization.  handles it a bit better with performance than arma 2 has back in the day but a word of warning no matter how powerful of an amd cpu you have (I myself have an 8350) it will crush it likewise with your gpu (so use a higher powered intel cpu if you get the chance and something like a 770+). If you want a smooth experience with  you'll want a rather beefy pc for it to look and run well and even then server optimization is rather trash so expect to lose 10+ frames when moving from singleplayer to multiplayer. Regardless it is still very fun and offers (and improves significantly) on more gameplay aspects in comparison to arma 2 especially the movement. If you're stingy on the price then wait for a sale if not buy it and may your graphics be pleasant and your framerate playable.10
is definitely a good bit of fun despite the random glitchiness.  Multiplayer is the main staple of this game and it's bandwidth usage is a bit much.  At the time of this review I have 420 hours in-game. Definitely one of my favorite games by far.10
somone buy me this game and ill give you rust hacks
ove this game!! It does lag a bit but in general its amzing!! Better get it its only 30$10
verallthis is a good game but I'm really confused about how to play together with my friends even if we are steam friends we cannot find each other in game. I tried to host server but my fiends still cannot find it. There are some guides on the internet that show how to add new port at my router but it's to complicated I don't know if the company develops this game can make it better otherwose I don't want to play it alone.-10
I try to play survival and it wont let me? telling me the exile client has been deleted? i just bought this game hoping i could actually play and i cant!!? can anyone give me any tips on how to get survival to work?
This game has pretty much anything you want life mod is endless entertaining along with game modes for pretty much anyone who loves FPS games the only thing is it does take a pretty beefy Graphics Card
Best farming simulator 9/11
f you've ever played a game where you've received an item you've really wanted and you know you probably won't get another chance to get it then suddenly the game crashes and reverts to your last save point then you would understand the anger that this game causes. Except you feel that same anger every single time you play. I've played this game for almost 400 hours and will be the first to admit how stupid I am for playing it this long. Playing online every single thing you do will be met with getting so cloe to your goal then utter failure.   I'll start with the community. I can't say much for other countries but here in australia every single other player is a giant throbing a**hole. Team-mates constantly team-kill on nom-teamkilling servers. Enemies wait to shoot you when you're in the menu when they know you've got no chance to retaliate but worst of all is that they constantly feel the need to abuse you further AFTER THEY'VE ALREADY KILLED YOU by calling you a 'c*nt' 'f*ggot' or telling you how bad you are in the voice chat. Which is something you can't moderate against. So yeah if you like it when the most common thing ever spoken on a server is to call you something derogetory then congratulations you're a masochist and welcome to . This game has caused me the have utter disrespect for any male gamer between the age of 13 and 29.   But that's not even the most infuriating part. Imagine you worked for many hours to save up enough to but an expensive helicopter then after you take off and are in the air the game chooses that moment to freeze you lose connection to the server and when you re-log you find your burning corpse and a respawn screeen. This happens to me the high majority of anytime I fly. Literaly not my fault not my computer's fault this game was programmed not with people's hands but their a**es. If it's not that then it's a vehicle that literally vanishes as i'm driving it. Explain that one? Just the sheer amount of money and weapons I lose because of how poorly this game runs is pathetic.  If you play on a server ever then you will know that the fps is disguisting pretty much always. And i'm talking like below console levels with a gtx 970 3.5GB. Apparently even 2 great cards in sli isn't enough to run this game at 60 fps or even 30 that is how well optimised it is. The sad thing is that singleplayer isn't bad and the fps is always 60 but singleplayer gets booring the first time you finish it. I expect a little more out of a $70AUD game.  So if you want to pay just so you can play singleplayer by all means go ahead. But if you want to play multiplayer like the many other thousands of people maybe consider spending your time doing something enjiyable or worthwhile otherwise  I'd advise you become a masochist and lose all respect for anyone you come across. Most disgusting game ever.  And I know damn well that the game is in pre-alpha but that doesn't excuse sh*t considering the game has been out for years and is still pathetically buggy. Bohemia releases updates far too slowly for this to look like a respectable title anytime soon. They seem to be more concerned with worrying about the aesthitics than if it can run for more than 3 seconds without crashing.-10
 just got the game with a few launchers and mods and i got to say it is well optimised for all types of computer ranging from retail office computers to full on tanks of a pc. The game play is great and is based on team and squad missions and tactics. Would recommend a few mates to play with for gamemodes like exile and wasteland. Overall a good game with alot of fun modes to offer with a leading story which will keep you hooked for hours. The tutorials are great for new players including myself that have just touched arma for the first time it takes you through alot main controls and scenarios which could happen in-game.   I recommend this game!10
Children play COD  Men play Battlefield  I play ARMA ( ?° ?? ?°)
I shot some guy in a tank.
terrible game ... battleeye never stay conected always getting kicked... gather you resources and get kicke all your stuff is gone when you return and car is put back in garage while your in the woods far from anyone collecting resources... car is all so empty to after you spent a hr collecting... games has great idea and runs 60 to 90 fps but in terms of how often it crashes you be better of just rdming people for the fun cuz it might crash before you go to jail lol
 vote for walls is a vote for freedom vote Daniel!10
I couldn't figure out how to open my parachute and so I died.
he best  game  Running on gtx 980 ti sli graphics are amazing FPS doesnt drop bellow 70 at most times.10
 love this game it was one of the first games I bought on steam but there are a few things that would make this game more enjoyable to play.  I understand that cars and helicopters are fun but what would be even better would be new gun. My fun with it is a new sniper to penetrate the rotors and bring it crashing down or a few shotguns to spray lead in a building against someone holding a hostage or a glock with a flashlight and a supressor lurking in the shadows taking down enemys one by on or taking down a whole group with full auto.  I feel like new guns would be the best for this game. Thanks.10
Thank you for this Game 10/10 P.
reat game great modding community. Don't buy any DLCs10
This will became the best if u download a few good modes
m in love with this game Bohemia Interactive is just like Bethesda. They wont let you down at all the developers are great and they listen to the community.10
Well it's realistic and it has big maps that are kinda bad (i mean stratis and altis) for my opnion but you can donwload mod maps and you can buy apex that has jungle map. One bad thing is animations and some sounds. One good thing is that there will allways be something new. +Mods and community+  One of my gavorite games ;)
One of the best realistic FPS games I have ever played!!  Gets better with mods!
new helicopter contrrols are crap. how do i go back to original?
uper realistic war game nice gamemodes including breaking point and wasteland. Worth to buy.10
 really like this gameBut is too bad becuse i don't have it :'(10
IT WONT WORK FOR ME
preety good game
this game sucks monkey 
rmA III has come so far from the alpha to the beta and then the full release. You will put in countless hours playing this game in a variety of modes you can play. With the modding community making amazing mods there will be endless options of playing the game. I definitely recommend this game for anyone that loves a military shooter.10
You get  on by artillery 10/10
don't get me wrong it's an amazing game how ever I have many problems with the pre apex game   1. lack of content. okay 3 armored cars only armored and 1 quad bike also 1 jet per faction also very little guns much little content very disapointing  2. the maps. 1 stratis is to mountainous to use 2 altis is to large not enough of the map will ever be used  3. the factions. N.A.T.O = USA USA USA CSAT= Iran . . . from the fuuuuuuuuuture AAF = we have uhhhh we have tanks yes we have tanks FIA = VIVA LA REVELOUTION  4.the story line of the campaign has many holes why didn't N.A.T.O notice when all units went dark on stratis didn't try to communicate after a few days of no info and why did the AAF feel provoked to attack N.A.T.O were leaveing in a month  5. 60.00 for a game that isn't any good unless you run mods to increase the experince while arma 2 can be played vannila and be fine for a long time  6. want to have fun well do to lack of content if you join a milsim unit then enjoy 10+ gbs of mods (all minor tweaks to)  7. I miss the old dlc form of new map new units new campaign really worth the money well 20 dollars here gets you a new sniper that should have been in since full release carts because we couldn't add it our selves for free must pay for labor and drum roll *drum roll* A CHINOOK yeah and A helicopter that no one uses as it sucks we just want the chinook for 15 dollars 10/10 bohemia GG #prayforapex  hope this helped please bohemia make apex into OA we need it here  *edit* I am an arma fan I have played them all at this point in time so im not a cod kiddie saying how can you no scope if you can't jump and snipe what is this WAAAA I loved arma 2 and I miss it very much but as  has all the new things oh well  *edit* I forgot to mention the editor which is pretty nice but can get annoying sometimes but still really cool also before I forget there are more servers that are legit arma not zombie mods so +1            now for the apex review  ohh boy here we go i would right this on the apex page but im not going to buy it there for i can just talk about content again well lets see no attack helicopters jsut drones for nato reskined guns and ctrg is the only new thing except for helicopters which is just reskined ghost hawk and lets see csat whats that . . . THEY GOT A NEW GUN SWEET and new a car for both . . . thats it were done uhh yeah and a vtol that sucks nothing else Im just dissapointed will not buy arma 4
rma is doing a great job maps are beautiful and my hod i love them. BUT if you are trying to get this game for the dayz/exile mod version good luck. idk wtf you need. i have downloaded every possible mod and extension and paid for maps to get what? not  an error message at every server. My final complaint dont ing make servers give me the green dot meaning i can play and saying i have everything i need when its just going to go to the loading screen and say error log out. rant over maybe im doing it wrong but i have talked to admins and had everything i needed to play yet not yet able to play. The only reason ARMA is still a thing is bc of the people making mods. h othe hell plays there actual mission? they make a 'new version and mao' for you to pay 40 dollars for. Joke. The only reaon anyone plays this game is for the mods and awesome admins in those mods. feel free to disagree with me but i havnt heard anyone once say hey lets go play the main mission on amra lol XD just the dayz mods and survival games and altus life thqat are actually fun. Rant over now im going to gp and try to get this stupid  errper message off my screen I probably have to pay them for money for something even though it says i have everything i need and is all green lol ing stupid. FU all10
st time  multiplayer epoch experience:  Joined game chose some gear and clothes  chose a spawn.  parachute deploy there   get shot in mid air   get kicked off the game  Would not play again-10
DLC bundle does not cotain all dlcs... it even said it would contain future dlcs BEFORE! I think the price was even higher! And now there is no APEX DLC in my inventory?!?  I do not hate this game but i hate how bohemia interactive betrays its costumers.
Best army simulation ever. Reccommend this game if you played most shooters :3
 got PTSD from this game I've never been to war though or fired a gun in that fact.   But in all seriousness this is THE BEST modern military simulation game out there today at this point in time.  The only cons I have is the fact that there are so many controls to remember.  But I would still recommend this game for most.10
erformance improvements ok dlc´s are very negative singleplayer is unplayable allways mission failiures AI is crap-10
 cannot recommend this game enough! If you are like me and you like realistic war scenarios then this game is for you! If you like funny moments with your friends this game is for you! If you are a graphics and visual type this game is for you! Lets get started with the main game.  1. The story is horrid but not as bad as other storylines such as Battlefield. 2. The graphics are beautiful! This game shows off what the PC can handle! 3. The gunplay is very fun and realistic!  4. The editor is very detailed and fun to mess around with! 5.The multiplayer is astounding! It feels like you are moving through a alive battlefield with real people pondering the next strategy!  Thats enough with the base game lets move to the real kicker... The multiplayer mods! I will be making a list of the main mods and details surrounding them.  1.(my personal favorite) Altis Life: Altis Life is pretty much just real life simulator! You get to be a civilian a cop a rebel a drug dealer a medic and really anything you want to be. But remember there are laws! KIDNEYS :D! 2. Wasteland: Wasteland is just living in a war torn world with gangs roaming around and whats left of the military to fight them off. Wasteland is pretty much the base game but with gangs shops and of course base building! 3. DayZ Exile: Remember that buggy mess known as DayZ Standalone? It was fantastic but this improves it in every aspect! It feels more zombie like! Hoards will pass through your base while you try to avoid them herds will get in your way leaving you to try to fight them off! Not glitching through walls every 5 seconds *cough cough* DayZ SA*cough cough*.  Overall rating of this almost perfect game is..................  9.5/1010
ay too complicated. I miss the good ole days of df:lw.  It is very well made and has excellent graphics. The camera sways and jerks too much its never that bad in real life - I was in the army.10
reat game with good ambitions for the future.10
10/10 - IGN. Definitely not bringing back up old memes so don't judge me please.
love this game its great truly shines but the mod part hope u have a good computer and great internet cause it takes a lot to run but seriously get this game get a clan and   up
est milsim around.  With all the mod support it can be whatever game you want it to be. From military simulator to Rpg to twitch shooter racing flight - anything.  Performance is hit/miss just like every Arma game. Use the performance exe pinned in the community hub discussions!10
Fun game to play by yourself or with friends!
( 8/10 )  A review from someone who barely has time any time any damn games.  Pros  • Hard – The game is awesome but the learning curve isn’t its challenging and that makes it awesome. • The community – Met a bunch of great guys IG some of which I still play with Joined and gaming community that was awesome. • Guns – the guns make the game the community add-ons make the game even greater. • Love AIA and CUP CUP make the game even broader by adding Vehicles tons of weapons gear and maps (amongst other things).  Cons  • Buy the game and play it. • Kidding. • ing glitches how the  am I dying by ing hitting a rock with a ing HEMTT. • Time you need time to get to know the game. 10
This is easily the best and most accurate military simulation game on the market. It gets closer to combat than call of duty ever will. I highly reccommend this game to anyone who is interested in seeing what an actual firefight looks like without actually getting into a real firefight.
Likes: Modded community - This game has massive amounts of mods that can make anyones experience worth while. graphics are much better than Arma 2. Lots of RP Communities. Lots of people to play with and lastly its Arma its just great.  Dislikes:  Absolutely none.
i dont know?
All around a fun game and a very tactical experience. Good survival mods as well.
Well I don't have this game but it let me write a reveiw for it.
It hasn't completely ruined my life yet. But it's getting there.  Rating over 9000.
Its meh
Boots up Arma waits forty years for loading screen plays server Crashes Boots up Arma Again Waits another forty years Plays server Doing very well Crashes; Loses everything  Well Played Arma Well Played 10/10
when APEX dlc relesed ?
with the latest update it runs like a whale on ice. lags are real and they destroyed the graphics imo. looks miore like an worse copy of arma 2 now. graphics were better before. and it ran better before.
Best game I have ever played (with ArmA 2 in a close second). The fact that you aren't limited to just war and that there is the option of roleplaying on life servers or downloading mods and messing around with them is amazing as it ensures you won't ever get bored. The constant development of the game from the games develepors also helps to ensure that you keep on discovering new things.
 has got to be my favorite game. the possibilities are endless really.
1 download 2 get 30fps single player 3 go on multiplayer and get 10-20fps 4 the fps is not playable 5 still plays  6 10/10
his game is good it's just not for me. I'm more into playing action FPS ARMA is more into simulation.  If you love simulation with complex controll you probably gonna love this.-10
it is glitchy alot :(
ame is pretty glitchy. I got an Intel i7 4790 running it but it still managed to freeze. also it has strange controls in the menu and my gun is very innaccurate. Considering in real life i can put bullets inside each other when firing at a target I find that disappointing that a prone position still left me missing a guy by huge amounts. Im never playing another Arma Game. Im glad they gave me a sample so I didnt have to spend 50$ This game has a lot going for it but it isnt for me. Maybe it will work for you   Edit=== I watched a video and found out why my shooting sucked My guy had been running and was tired... I guess thats cool. I wish I could make it work better I was so excited by the game when I first saw it but like every Arma Game I die too easy and too often because I cant figure out how to make my guy effective in combat.-10
i wont the game free plzzzzzzzz iwont for my canle gamingplaypro
hat can I say I have over 1.700 hrs in this game.   If you want to be screamed at by real marines but don't want to join the military buy the game and play on a realism server. If you want to be a bus driver in you spare time and smuggle some dope but don't get arrested for it buy the game.  If you want to have endless free and high quality user created content buy this game.  If you like sniping an unsuspecting enemy from 1.500 m with a 50.cal buy this game.   If you want to be guided through a quicktime hell and be the hero don't buy this game.10
is pretty good
his game is mediocre. Nothing really stands out. The A.I needs a huge boost to be 'balanced' and make the human player handicap. I've had machine gun A.I snipe me from 800 yards. The music is okay the graphics are okay and the sound effects are good. You never get the feeling you're in a battle. Everything is always clean. I've rarely had an intense firefight. You will spend a lot of time waiting on other players to pick you up via helicopter. Sometimes it takes 10 to 30 mins for pilots to realize there people at base that respawned.-10
The game stopped working for me after an update. Have not been able to play for three months due to Battle Eye Initialisation Failed. I have written a request on the forums for support but nobody has got back to me with a fix. Extremely disappointed as this was a great game when I could play it.  Terrible support from Devs. A waste of £36.99 as I got APEX along with all the other DLC too... which I will not be able to use.
Its simply perfect war simulator :)
mazing this game is really fun and by far better than any other survival game you'll find :)10
Worth every cent.
 step up from Arma II unfortunately its not as active like it :(10
very fun game especailly with freinds
fluffing awsome game !!!!!! If you dont like it then you a Trump fan girl
ery amazing game full of tactical opportunities  will push you to victory slowly stealthy or loud and very damn proudly. I recommend this game to anyone with a gtx 760 and higher as the graphics are amazing and the content is unlimited whether it be workshop mods dlc or even the vanilla game it is all full of great game modes and great gameplay.10
Went on to a A3 life server spawned and went to the dmv got a car and drove to the nearest reble outpost bought reble training got a group of unknown people and went to rob the federal reserve robbed the reserve  got every piece of gold sold the gold  drowning in 52 million dollars got imediately killed by 2 unarmed cops  10/10 would waist 5 hours of my time just to get killed by 2 unrmed cops
If you get this game get the  life mod
ilsim in its purest form; when you are done playing shooting games get real with Arma.10
Could somebody pls buy me this as a gift plsssssss
this game!Terrible gamedo not buy it!10
very good game lots of details within it and an awesome multiplayer servers.   Bad bits... Can be VERY glitchy ie rock clipping climbing and walking up/down stairs can become a nighmare when under fire. Not impressed with the clipping at all in this game many times I've died simply walking up stairs due to this. II hope they resolve it.10
t seams to be a rather boring invironment! no real game physics as in other hight class games like battlefield either! the sceneries look all almost the same in stile and color. always game files missing too.  it has possibilities though but as i said the whole game play and missions turn out mostly boring10
Don't Buy if you like battlefield  Its like X-mas without santa and booze and food and air and water   and a toilet  grafics are great but gameplay is a big fat NOPE!
Game sucks
i want a refund every time i try and play it crashes and fresses my computer
A great game... If you mod it. The base game is fine in multiplayer but lacks an immersive story. With some of the mods however it is as if having multiple games.  Update: It's  that they charge as much as they do for DLC that should have been witht the game anyways.
t actually has a story. It's not like anything else either. And it actually pulls you in so it's fun because you know what you're doing who you're fighting for but very little about the enemy.10
ad Animations.  Bugs Died from going down stairs.  And extremely laggy.-10
Finally sat down and played it (summer 2016).
this game sux battle field is better so yeah 10/10
10.5/10 would fap again
So realistic and hard to play but awesome game.
11/10 would.
 love this game This game i highly recommend This is one of the closest games to a military action game.10
ave to ammend my recommendation after making it almost enitrely through the campaign.   Why 'almost' and not 'completely'? This game has the most awful AI I have experienced in a long time. It's honestly at a point where the enemy AI are either expert snipers with any weapon at any range or are completely ignorant and stand in the open waiting to die. Realism is entirely gone from the firefighting which is ironic considering this is supposedly an ultra-realisitc 'war simulation'. The customized difficulty controls consist of two sliders 'Precision' and 'Accuracy'. At 40 for example the AI will not let you win a firefight period. At 30 they are so dumb they miss 80% of their shots and are basically waiting to die. The only inbetween is '35' which is much closer to 'professional sniper even when using a 9mm pistol' than 'normal guy who sometimes can hit you.' It's pretty absurd frankly and almost comical when they market this as a simulation.  I won't even go into the friendly AI. It's so bad it's become a joke and meme at this point. There are dozens of modders who have tried to address the issue which is fine but the fact that the team AI is so bad after years of patches says a lot about the developer's priorities. I can no longer recommend this game unless you can tolerate your team standing straight up in the open running in circles firing recklessly into the air or missing every single shot without a SINGLE WAY to control them or help in the middle of a fight. This sounds ridiculous but I was intentionally killing or letting my team die just so I could finish missions. Not sure how this game is so positively reviewed honestly. It's like they did everything right except the important parts.   Cannot recommend.-10
quite possibly the MOST lit game ever made
 youtube adventure with multiple choices that are about a bunch of toy army men and indians would be a better military simulator than this this is very incomplete full of bugs and hackers tons of servers who have admins that don't do anything but ban people at the snap of a finger. I would of rather pre-ordered sims 4 honestly and I don't even like sims. Biggest waste of 60$ i've ever seen Cannot BELIEVE More than even a thousand people bought this crap. It's just a re-skinned arma 2 with way less content. All hating aside now It does have good graphics. But bad physics. So you're literally paying for graphics.-10
it took forever to download and was a complete waste of seven hours of my life
NU LUATI CA DUPA PLATITI DUBLUI FUTAL IN EL
 bought this after hearing about the multiplayer experience. I get it installed and wait several hours before finally finding a server i can join. I join it and find that for a realistic fps i somehow end up in a small village with nothing but a pistol and a green shirt. No blouse? No helmet? This guy is breaking several rules he learned in basic training already. And was stupid enough to arrive with a pistol alone no less. Where is the rest of his unit? Well it looks like his landing was horribly miscalculated or he must have overslept because they are already across the map camping by an airstrip; leaving him to march many miles crawling through grass to avoid the endless supply of armored transport and hatchbacks that have broken headlights making you a virtual speedbump simulator.  I finally get to the airstrip and meet the merchant a guy with a 50cal berret barrel up his but judging by his posture. you get your **** and dart to a high hill and go prone so you may become grass simulator 2016 until you are rewarded for your hours of patience with a noob running in the open. You calculate your shot placement and hold your breath to take the shot. Buuuuut it looks like an armored unit wanted to turn your target into firework simulator 2016 before your shot can reach him.   after what seems like 3 hours you finally decide it is pointless and leave the server so you can have some sleep. Next day you end up waiting another couple of hours to wait for a server that you can join without any wierd error. Screw your 100mb/s service and 25ping this server says you cannot join even without need for other dlc to be downloaded first. Still salty that I never got my refund I applied for.  If you loving waiting hours for a server to join then this game is for you. they should rename it 'waiting game 2016' or also 'dark souls with guns' and also 'bad luck brian simulator 2016 - military edition'-10
amazing but filled with really mean and rude people
Its such a good game but you do need a very good pc to get a decent fps my pc is 2000$+ and i get 50 so do keep that in mind
ros: - fun - hours of gameplay - good if u have friends to play with  - thousands of mods available  - realistic and tacticool if ur into that stuff - hundreds of different types of servers (wasteland free for all altis life rpg exile zombies etc.) - graphics look fantastic  Cons: - takes a pretty good pc to run properly specially on online servers - hard learning curve - not ez for the noobs  - costs a lot (just wait for sales anyways) - unoptimized  I'll give an 8/10. Graphics is good hundreds of mods and scenarios from steam workshop.10
oving this game so far I like to play role play alot so with Altis Life it shows of to be very good when your playing as a trained police officer :) 10/1010
he game it self is not really good Gamemodes etc but the mods Im in love &lt;33310
 played it for a little bit fun but need a beast rig to play10
better than arma 2 still hard to have fun flying helocopters is fun though i think i got my moneys worth
 played CoD it's ok I played Battlefield it's cool I played this for a day...  Meh. It's a game.10
 could go on about this games outstanding attention to detail it fun and realistic play style sexy sounds and over all polish but no im going to en flam the  out of it. Why? well you already know the good parts time to bend this er over and smack the  out of it.  first off optimization WTF its 20-en-15 and still preforms like a total en spud server no doubt its much much mcuh better then en arma 2 which was the most  poor effort for 'game optimization' id ever seen whats that is there a building 10km north you cant see better load that in yeah thats a good idea while were at it lets just flop it out and  on the lines of code that might do anything other then  FPS.  now we come to the very very very cluncky general of the game whats that did you just en mag dump those 2 guys over there not even facing you? here let me have a en ciggy break then en load it in for the other guy or did you just want to move with out been some en special diet needy er thats goes ah sorry no i need en no gluten skim low fat hi gi reduced suggar vegan meat taisting halal approved ? ah yes and it needs to be 750ml or under or over kills me. i swear its like all the en guys you play as are like ah  me i outa breath after like 30m ah but their wearing en 30kg of gear yeah the  are you made of en  your trained to en do this its not en hard.  by now this fruit cake is done NO IM EN NOT! what about when you want play the solo campagin yeah i mean the game doesnt have en  en difficulty spikes heres basic en tra- ah  china america russia are here and the other en green  you shoot yeah them their like en aids in the 80's everywhere and not at the same time dafuq!??!?!?! you'll hide behind a rock like yeah finaly they cant shoot me and then bang dead resart how ah yeah some stray  bullet bouced and en domed ya ah cool. AH you dont need to en play the single player dont i i think i en do as most games these days alread come deprived of a solid single player its like ordering a steak and chips and them saying you can have the chips but the steak the chips are good but you didnt order it for the en chips you wanted the en boner giver medium blue steak not for en battered spuds.  ah yeah the games good tho  ya self  10
Great tactical FPS(or is it?) game many mod that supports it 8/10 - cold0dog8
AWESOME!! Highly suggest this game. Endless possibilitys.
 wouldn't recommend this game to anyone cause its a multiplayers worst nightmare. The engine is old as  the fps on my new alienware pc is 20fps in multiplayer. Un optimized piece of crap people I bought it in beta and it still sucks. If there were a demo i could of saved 44 dollars but got screwed in the ! SAVE YOUR MONEY maybe take a date to a nice resteraunt who knows maybe you'll get laid. Anyways i'm saving you from a bad decision!-10
he best game of the 2010s I have to admit it is even better than Skyrim. The level of simulation and reality in this game coupled with the combination of fun and play is amazing. I never thought that a simulation could be this realistic and fun at the same time! Must buy 17/10 ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING!!! You are an idiot if you don't buy this!10
ell i've played this game for above 90 hours now and after hundreds of hours of the ArmA2 series i decided it was time to step up and leave the 2 series and try out ArmA3.   Im impressed! Bohemia Interactive has done it again They've made a new ArmA of the new generation and probably doesn't need to make a game for the next 5-6 years. The physics in this game is such a high upgrade from the lower ArmA Series I feel like i have gotten myself the more realistic 3rd person and FPS version of Battlefield! The veichle's are great the campaign was much better than the arma 2 version as well as the multiplayer After the multiplayer for the other arma games shut down i felt like i wanted to make a complaint to Bohemia for shutting it down and i still do till this day. If they want the ArmA series to be the best realistic FPS and 3rd Person shooter game series in the world they have to put up the old dayZ and Arma 2/OA Multiplayer servers back up man!10
es many guns much death. The struggle is real.10
great realistic shooter
Quite realistic. Long gaming enjoyment
I don't even own the game. 10/10
ove this shooter Really fun play!10
RDM everywhere 10/10
o to bang off this review I'll firstly say that I played Arma 2 when DayZ was pretty much a bang hit such as when huge internet celeb's were playing i.e Frankie Pewds Womble etc. etc. So I know a bit about Arma in itself.  Now the pro's: ~ This game is pretty damn beautiful when it comes down to it. Hell there aren't any graphic mods out there because of that fact. ~ It potentially has one of the best modding communities anyone could ask for with mods coming out every year. ~ It's devolpment team actually listens to people's concerns and they fixed the game accordingly to what bug or what not is going. ~ The differences between this game and Arma 2 have a very vast threshold. ~ It has great immersion for those that play Military Simulator's or Real Life role-player's. ~ Finally it's a game that can enterain the mature audience's for more then a few hundred hour's of playing it.  Now for the con's: ~ To actually play this game and have fun you have to at least have an i-7 CPU and a good graphics card. It's possible to play on a laptop if that laptop is a $500 or above one. ~ Though few there are game breaking bugs. I.e someone moved me while I was on a turret and then I found myself teleported to the farthest reachs of the map underwater. ~ If you play on Public servers for certain game types expect to find people who will plain out ruin the game for you. ~ This one really isn't a con but kind of is. This game is for MATURE audience's and mainly because a mature audience will find it fun not a gaggle of 12-14 year olds.  In conculsion I'd say this game is pretty damn good. If you're looking for the fun of hanging out with a squad and kicking some  or if you're in it for the realism or anything else then this is a great game to play!.  Sincerely JT / Callsign: MockingJay10
The bestest game I've ever played. It has RABBITS! ING RABBITS! WHAT CAN BE BETTER! EVEN SNAKESSSSSSSSSSS!

Playing on a server. Wait for chopper to fly us back to base. Chopper comes. Accidentally put down a bomb. Try to take it away. Explodes. Everyone dies. Got banned. Would get banned again 10/10
I liked this game because it's awesome that nobody cannot dislike I think.
Get 2-3 friends. Play this game. Get some mods. Rinse and repeat.
this game man 5/10 Just a greedy company that do not care about feedback suck ur life  communities everywhere  FPS drop in multiplayer 80% of the server is western site useless DLC with unreasonable price 12year-old kid everywhere in America server Good mod that ask for money to play with it Epoch Life.  Altis Life server that force u to donate to get more guns and . Its not even called donate its should be called BUY/Pay-10
arma3 is not a simulator but close to a simulator.

ourettes asthma and shaky hands simulator. Well done Bohemia.10
mazing army game I really like the designs the weapons and the missions It's a great game to play with friends Altis life Domination and more !10
tole someone's ATV while he looted a body and then ran on him and killed him. (battle royale) this game is awesome it has an amazing single player (tough to beat) so much mods to play which is really really fun! like breaking point wasteland altis life or battle royale though there will be bugs/errors but just google it and solve it its easy.  i would defently recommend to buy this amazing game. 24/7 would play.10
he story sucks but the multuiplayer is fun sometimes but overall confusing if you dont know what your doing10
i want the game i will be getting it soon this will be a cool game soon once i get it!!!
iF IT WORKED I WOULD LIKE IT
I think i see the problem here.   http://imgur.com/p7HDZ0k
his game manages not only to be an exquisite military simulation game. But also an incredible helicopter simulator. And not only that but every single thing in the game used by anyone is usable by the player. This includes weapons armor and attachments. Not only that but there are 2 maps that ship with the game. There is the vast expanse of Altis. And also the smaller more confined island of Stratis. Both with a Greek inspired setting. This game manages to do all that and still manage to get decent frames on normal singleplayer and multiplayer experiences. All those complaining about frame rates are probably those that play Altis life and such. Which need a huge amount of scripts behind the scenes to actually work. This would be taxing in any game so that argument cannot be used against the base game unless you have a potato for a computer. This game easily achieves a solid 9.5/1010
reat game wasteland game type is a lot of fun and the single player missions are challenging.10
not really a fan.
Ive pondered the question Many times what is arma? It is an military simulator but it isent? the conlusion ive come to is Its minecraft for grown ups You can do anything as long as you have the skills and imagnation that the game requires and Yes Sometimes since its an upen world game it can get a bit willy wonka here and there but thats with every upen world game .However there are Problems of course that is with every game. Low performance pga how the Engine handle things and its an open world game
JU NIID TIS
ts fun but if your thinking of getting this instead of dayz standalone definetely get dayz10
gt;plays altis life gets arrested friend is a bounty hunter and uncuffs me friend shoots cop with rubber bullets friend cuffs cop people gather and shout 'kill the pig' the people drag the cop into the night avoid arrest  10/10 would trade a cop to the local gangs agian.10
Was awsome game. Was. thats the big word everytime i go to launch the game now it says initializing then crashes had this for couple months now no support at all from bistudios or any resolved solution from other forums it it worked more often i would recommend it
 only played Wasteland so far but here is my experiance:  Fun aslong as you can find a car with a gun in it and a pain in the  when you walk from town to town and not finding anything. Players will 90% of the time just shot you if they see you so you better hide or haul  when you get spotted.  With the realistic game mechanics and dynamic envoirment with beutiful lighting the game really feels like a 'PC master race game' and that thought gets further reinforced when you go to the settings menu...holy . I once belived there was no such thing as 'too many settings' but  makes me re-think that.   The game's auto settings are horrible! ~30fps and the amount of settings makes it a nightmare to fix. But with the click of a button in geforce experiance and i got a solid 45-70fps and no noticeable compromise of visual quality.  My rig: CPU: i5 3350P @ 3.1Ghz GPU: GTX 670 @ 915Mhz RAM: 8GB @ 1600Mhz  As you probably already know the game has a very wealthy community with many mods that hughly change the gameplay. Really solid package.  BUT this is not a game you play for 15min to kill time a lot of the gamemodes require dedication and A LOT of time. This is more of a game you play if you are sick at home and have 3+ houres to kill.10
layed Epoch mod In 15 minutes I found like 5 guns (I chose a vector.) I almost got ran over by a helicopter...yes a helicopter(Bad pilot.) Got chased by a quad copter and eventually shot it down got scared by a bird then I got hunted down and killed by the quadcopter owner 69/21 would Epoch again10
ood game. Wouldn't say great but there is a lot going on for it. Still glitches in the game this far along and all the developers see is $$$ for expansions. Like really? Kartz?10
Why is it Night Time?
best army game ever!!! nothin else to say :D
east of a game 10/10 would recommend.10
or the small amount of time that I have played this game I have found it to be extremely boring and monotonous. You might think that it would be fun with zombies or karts or other stuff but no its not. If you want to play a moddable game might as well play Garry's mod which is much much cheaper. The game is full of bugs and the controls are all backwards. Half the time I find myself looking at settings when I'm actually trying to open a door. Overall this game sucks and I reccomend that everyone steer clear from it. I also forgot to mention that it is poorly optimised.  9/10 If you want realistic  0/10 If you want fun-10
elow is my 'Black Hawk Down' encounter in  you can skip beyond it and find my list of pros and cons.  So I was playing on a King of The Hill sever with my freind Vlad. My friend and I needed a transport to get from our HQ to the AO. (it's about 3 km or so out) This nice guy by the name of 'Josh' decides to lend us ride in his Ghost Hawk. He welcomes us with a good ol' 'Welcome Aboard!' and then blasts ACDC through his com. This guy then flys through the sky like a pro doing spin flips and never going above 200 meters elevation. Since Josh is doing all this while going 300+ km/h we arive at the AO in seconds. Me and my friend thank him as he returns to base and both unanimously agree that we must fly with Josh from now on. We start taking Josh's rides as are main from of transportation. It all goes well until the seventh or so trip... Josh was circling around the AO looking for a landing zone when out of nowhere an rpg hits the Ghost Hawk. Luckily Josh is a badass who plays ACDC so he's able to crashland his chopper with minimal damage the only problem is the Heli has crashlanded in the middle of the AO... We all jump out of the crashed chopper but josh has been knocked unconsious. My friend rushes over and starts reviving him while I spot for enemies. Once he revives he tells us that he needs to be protected as he repairs the chopper so he can escape. We are happy to oblige. Things heat up very quickly as enemies start to swarm attracted to the huge bellowing column of smoke coming from the Ghost Hawk. We defended Josh like champs but alas we were soon overwelmed and the ghost hawk was obliterated via explosive sachel of the enemy. Never before had My friend and I met a guy like Josh.  He will live in our hearts forever. Josh's sacrafices will never be forgoten.  Pros   + Exellent graphics and a sold game engine (for the computer that can handle it)  + a very fleshed out weapon and veichle arsenal (though to be fair if compared to arma 2 it's actually smaller)  + HUGE caps-lock letter sized (270+ km) maps that put battlefield GTA and expecially COD to shame.  + very realistic combat with bullet drop and realistic health.  + lots of strategy implimented into the game and well practiced by the community. (by well practiced im noting that alot of these players are vet or former military in other words they know there  about combat)  + extensive single player campain  + exellent multiplayer scene. Notable features:   ~ having a good ol' combined arms conflict on King of The Hill severs  ~ salvaging stealing and blowing up other peoples  on Wasteland and Dayz severs. (Wasteland has NO zombie Dayz has ALL zombies)  ~ getting high on weed and trolling cops on Altis Life severs (these severs are were all the noobs and trolls go so don't expect to see many vets here.)  ~ No 11 year old COD -for-brains.  ~ Clan severs Wasteland and KTH are full of Badasses like Josh may he never be forgotten!  Cons   - Compared to the core game the DLC dosen't have that much bang for its buck so i'd suggest combo-packaging it to save money.  - A very unforgiving learning curve. Like I mentioned before there are alot of pro players here. in addition to that the controls are very complicated and numerous. At first you will find strategy-minded enemy players outthinking you. (the computer AI is pretty dumb though but still dangerous) Also a thing I noticed about this game compared to other FPS's is the guns have much more kick and are much less easier to weild then in COD. This is not a game were you just 'Gun and Go' there is and i can't stress this enough ALOT of strategy in . Skill in this game is measured by combat aptitude not how quickly you can twitch your thumbs.  Josh and community alone is worth the purchase 10/1010
reat game if you like Military simulators. large variety of guns clothing and tactical options as well as vehicles for land sea and air warfare. and has tons of community made scenarios missions and mods to keep you playing the game over and over.10
ITS JUST ING FUN
xtreamly  game not what I expected at all. I want a damn REFUND!-10
his game is by far the most approachable of all the ArmA games and it's a hell of a lot of fun. To fully enjoy this game you will want to have some friends and take full advantage of the avid modding community that BI has.10
little bugy but good
this game is really good nice graphics nice story nice ever thing and you dont need the best pc to play it 8/10
arbage single player amazing multiplayer. I love this game.10
 have had endless hours of fun with this game it is absoulutely amazing GET THE GAME!!!10
...
One of the most fun game's i have played so far outta every single shooter game's i have played i love all arma games more tatical then any others
Amazing addition to the Arma serise with realtime action and realistic gameplay running from shooting targets to being engaged by a team of highly skilled players on an Atlis life server. Would recomend to somone looking for a realistic take on shooters
 don't have this game but i can write a rewiev 10 out of 10 million dollars10
This is the perfect military game and if you are into tactics and positions in a fight this is he game for you. With several thousand hours of multiplayer gameplay and dlc there is so much to do:)
t's a really good strategized tactical 1st/3rd person shooter and I enjoyed playing it but i could only play on really close local servers because it takes a really good custom gaming PC to run. If you don't have good specs I think you'd only be able to play single player.10
reat game keeps me amused for hours. However slightly buggy here and there but overall a great game!10
Wish I Had Money To Buy It :(
Died of ladder bug  10/10 would uninstall again
pic game. Tried it and fell in love with it right as i was 5 minuets into the proluge. A must play and even if you dont like open world games or strategy i would still give it a shot. 10/1010
It's a good game.
how the hell is this still $55.53?
really good game with a some really good rpg servers and LOTS OF MODS
i wish i had the game.... and a better computer...
ery poor design for new users this is my first Arma game and i found it almost impossible to play there were no clear training missions and any that they did have did NOT give clear instructions. It took me 30mins of mashing buttons to figure out how to crouch :(. Was really looking foward to this game as all reviews and videos looked really good the Multiplayer is very laggy and the players are rude and not helpful i was kicked 45 times i counted for being a newbie. Very dissapointed will hopefully grasp the controls and basics soon just feel like ive wasted fourty-pounds. Do NOT buy this game. I do not reccomend it.-10
best army sim ever love it ! sadly the zombie trend is out cuz dayz stand alone is so much better !
The mods really make this game awesome.
why cant i play i downloaded the game and it coms up with another fing and it says i have to perches it but its in my steem libery
AWSOME game lots of different gamemodes rating it i would give a 10/10
i got  Digital Deluxe Edition and i dont know how to add the dlc. Also for my review its a great game will play no-stop if my Mom doesnt tell me to stop playing
it is so realistic and like the army nice game Europe
whats will all the massive 3 gig updates recently....
Very good game. Some times buggy but what can you expect from a bohemia game.
Cool Game.
his is quite realistic very fun to play with your friends its a great shooter game very fun to sniper people out and blow people up in tanks :D10
 is the best army simulator there is thus far.i give it a 10/10.
1. FRIENDLY!!! NONONONO  -KIA-  2. I saw something in front of ou...  -KIA-  3. did you heard tha..  -KIA-  4. how to pop up the compass??  -KIA-  5. wow the HELICOPTER  -KIA-  6. 'CLICK!'(mouse wheelclick sound)  -escaped without parachute-      11/10 best game ever
eople pretend to be certified pilots but then you ragdoll to the bottom of the aegean10
Great game. Bohemia Interactive does great work.
errible performance filled with bugs glitches. Price point is far to high for the overall quality to be so low. I would return this if I could.-10
o here we go a review of  of whats good and whats bad.  i found myself buying this game because i loved ARMA 2 and decided to try it out. The game is quite good but there's a few things that i consider annoying some other may also think that. The fps is inbetween good and bad depending on what server/mod you play it can be good sometime's if your on a server with a big and open map (it can b with lots of people) but once you join a KoTH server the framerate tends to get lower than usual (i know that there's alot of players and a ing city but bear with me) now i wouldnt say i have a beast rig but i can play almost all games on ultra with 60fps no problem even battlefront (i know its in beta but the graphics is wonderful) so i think they should optimize it a bit more.  the maps The maps are great eventough there's not alot of them altis got some nice terrain and a few hills here and there. great for life mods KoTh and such  stratis is a map i haven't played much only flight mission's from the workshop. But the map got potential for great survival based addons/server's   physic's although i haven't really noticed the physic's i cant still say that they are good i dont notice any flaws #blindkidprobably  the guns oh well here we go the guns are somewhat dull as i dont find them very goodlooking or good and the fact that to get more guns you either have to download mods (wich i dont have a problem with) although i have a problem with the price of the gun(s) dlc... I mean 1299 for a few ingame guns is odd and disturbing.  the dlc's and the price of the game For only 26 dollar's YOU can get both marksmen AND the helicopter's dlc (game not included)  meh id rather buy a game for that kind of money what's also complete t is that you 'have' to have all of those  dlc's to play on xtreme ricuardo's KoTH server (not a real server only an example) like cmon really?... So let's see to play on ricuardo's xtreme KoTH server you need to pay 70 DOLLAR'S...  no  any ways this was just what i thought of the game not that anyone is gonna read this but yeah :P  EDIT: yes i know i have only played for like 22 hour's but its just my opinion10
ow I actually have a good reason not to recommend this trash game.  Pros: Whats that? (It's arma don't expect any)  Cons: -HORRIBLE Optimization -They are so greedy as a company (ADDING NORMAL GAME PATCHES AS DLC) -(Relates to above) To get better weapons graphics audio and vehicles you must buy the dlc which once again makes no sense considering you already have to spend a huge amount of money on this piece of trash game. -A lot of dead servers because the game is so garbage. -Bohemia mainly ported a lot of the models and graphics from Arma 2 and to make everything look somewhat new they literally reskinned everything and put it in. It's very disappointing to know that Bohemia has to salvage things from the original game just to sell dlc and make more money.-10
This game is the best Action game I have ever played. It is realistic but no to close range combat like COD. Its also VERY intence. It gets your heart pumping. In my opinion BEST GAME EVER!
This bad update because character easy to trie and before update is better than this update.
I love the game but it keeps on crashing and i have better specs the the reccomened someone please help
This is the best Millsim out there ever as my community has 2 Arme 3 servers
I only have 8 hours on this game but I've already had a ton of fun on the game. It's a great time but you should probably buy it from  or when it's on sale.
here is a lot to say about this game I don't even know where to start.   is an excellent open world military sandbox with a focus on realistic elements and endless possibilities.  The infantry play is simply superb the combat feels extremely fresh and different from other games. The part I love the most about it is that it gets the VERY BASICS right. Rounds are fired from the muzzle of the weapon model itself (rather than from the center of the screen unlike just about any other FPS) there is the ability to move your head around and you can see your own body and legs in first person.  The maps are huge and detailed without mentioning the plethora of user-made maps. You can also download maps from the previous games.  There is a map editor that let's you do anything and I really mean it ANYTHING that you have in mind. Which translates to endless fun. Want to make an urban infantry firefight in the middle of a city? You can. Want to make an air battle with jets and helicopters and take part in it or simply watch it from the ground in the middle of the night? You can. Want to make a tank battle? A combined arms war? A scripted campaign-like mission? Want to just spawn 300 goats at once? All up to you.  Co-op with friends is simply one of the most thrilling and fun activities you can experience in PC gaming.  PVP combined arms battles with 90 players can be downright insane (although it can be laggy as hell).  This game never feels old given the regular huge updates which add core game mechanics to the game (without mentioning the gigabytes of various fixes and improvements). The developers are very active from discussing with customers to implementing feature requests (even very big ones such as weapon resting and bipod deployement firing from vehicles sound overhauling etc.)  And to top it all off bees cast shadows.10
is a great game  if you have a good CPU . I reccomend someone play this game with a 6500-6600k . I use config and get 50 FPS in King Of Hill and 60 while sniping . On Full servers with AA and Settings on Ultra i get 60+ FPS in most areas .  Love The Game it post alot of realism and alot of areas and some less but over all a en fun  game and i've played the shet outa it . Worth the $60 .10
fun but it is a little to high for me just play when it is free to play
The pre alpha simulation
Can barely run it. 10/10
Best FPS there is
his game is reconmended its fun and it will get better when dev keeps working on for the rest of their lives.  Its a really cool game and I enjoyed it its nuthing like battlefield series or americas army   But I wish I didnt paid $60 that really over priced and no poster map book case toys cd video cards keyboard mouse.. cuz its just electronic download :(. been 3 1/2 weeks since i purchased this and I will not spend $60 ever again stuck with 1 game that I could gotten more games with $60.  Now its on sale so I would have bought the digital deluxe edition for $39.  Expect this game is covered in bugs server DDOS etc. Hopefully dev fix and add good stuff for the game.  I expect this game gotta be much much better bigger than any game cuz I spent 60 Friggin dollars. I was told it will never drop the price down for long time. I have been lookin forward for deluxe edition but nope.   I reconmended get the deluxe edition ASAP if you like combat or altis life RPG. Common get it!   10
Don't be fooled by my hours. I've spent 1 hour in game the rest was downloading mods that I can't use -_-  Pros: 80 FPS in campaign  Cons: 10fps on any server...  I rate this 10/1000$ pc with 10 fps
This game is better than i expected it to be. i loved arma 2 but only up to a point and this game shatters my expectations as far as quility goes. I plan on being a buyer of arma titles for years to come. or however long thery decide to continue with the franchise.
ne of the best games of all time. I have fun just doing the single player or co op not to mention the multilayer. Exile and Breaking Point are two very good mods both very much like DayZ SA except better atm imo. The graphics are very nice in the game and the controls are awesome.  10/1010
Amazing graphics!
great but too expencive
Stole a police mans car in Altis Life Killed myself by running into a rock 30 km from any civilization 10/10 No medics online.
poop. might be good if it wasnt the laggiest piece of  ever created
uch fun such wow.10
Totally worth it. But I will wait for the price drop again. Untill then ARMA 2 :)
hats not to like? It's a fun and brilliantly made game that has a lot of realism and immerison which every gamer like myself loves.10
d like to say before getting into this review that I currently as of righting this review I have about 330 hours on the game and that may seem like a lot to some people but I'm basically still considered a noob.   Arma III10
It's alright...
ery fun definetily try it out10
ne of a kind military simulation that happens to contain 1st person shooting occasionally.  Known for its massive scale unfairness community produced content impossible system requirements steep learning curve and bugs.  You will be doing plenty of following:  1) Waiting 2) Running in the countryside 3) Crossing your fingers you see the enemy before the enemy sees you 4) Dying in various sudden and unexpected violent events caused by bullets explosives RPGs crashing helicopters or falling from tall structures 5) Laughing at bizarre glitches  In the end you either adore  and play for years to come or uninstall it faster than a speeding bullet.10
I bought the extened edition on another account then sent the extended edition to this account. i did not recieve any of the current DLCs with it only Karts. Game is great just has flaws to things like the $15 DLC packs.  Come on Bohemia you're not EA stop being money hungry.
If you get the 'STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION' error. Expect not to play the game. I have 12 hours on this and most of it is the game crashing with the same error everytime I start playing on a server. Try doing research on this? No answers at all unless someone knows the answer here then I would change this into a more positive review because I would actually be playing the game.
fter 10++ Hours in this game you will realize that shooting a real gun is far more simple than killing an AI in this game10
ou cant even play the campaign without dying on the first ing missions. the multiplayer isnt playable if you dont have dlc and the game is expensive as  without it. the editor is really weird to use and if you do it takes ages to load up a level.-10
kill all your team mates begin a war with in a war
ltis Life Breaking Point MAAAHHHH 10/10 COOP 10/1010
l;DR game is gud DLCs are  unbalanced t. I Have been a Fan of bohemia interactive after the whole Arma 2 Dayz mod craze i purchased and played arma 2 operation arrowhead and played the Dayz mod and base arma 2. year or two later  came into beta for 29.99. Naturally i purchased it after how much i loved arma 2. it showed so much potential i fell in love with . The game came out of beta a year or two later not a whole lot added but the core mechanics were there. April 1st 2014 The Karts DLC came to be offered fun little karts for 4.99 still accessible with out paying that fee. November 4th 2014 the Helicopter DLC came out offered new helicopters which i was very excited about. i did not have the dlc at the time but I was playing king of the hill and someone spawned in one the new helicopters. I was really infactuated with it i went up to it to check it out and all i got was a little window telling me to purchase this DLC to have access to this content. I was a little upset but understandable its DLC. It is now April 11th 2015 the new Marksmen DLC just came out and i played it for the first time in a while. me and my buddy hopped on the new end game ctf game mode everything seemed fine headed out to secure the intel. i hear a lot of distinct gun shots. the new VSS vintorez and the .338 lmg that i fail to remember. I spot an enemy down the street from me near the objective. I take cover and then peek him with my vermin .45 acp submachine gun. i take 3 shots at him he is hit notices my position aims and shoots me once in the body and i am immediately dead. Annoyed i respawn and head back out to gather the objective (Intelligence) the site has been cleared and me and three guys move in. i round by a corner and see an enemy player crouched in a firing position. I switch to fully automatic and spray my whole magazine into him (i mean why not) his player model visibly displays the damage done and yet the man still lives! He turns to look at me with his large lmg (Chambering the new .338 Caliber round) and puts a round straight into my chest once again im put to the respawn screen. yatatata shoot more dudes kill a guy (Miraculously :]) and attempt to retrive his fire arm. A little window pops up telling me to purchase the DLC to have access to this weapon. At this point i was rather upset learning i cant use the new weapons without purchase of DLC The devs even stated the game was lacking something in terms of weapons so this was created. So for something that should have been a free update (Kind of like the weapon resting and face paint etc;) i am quite livid these weapons completely change the dynamics of fire fights and weapons in general. with these weapons chambering such large caliber rounds every kill requires 1 or two rounds to kill an enemy. How is it fair that because someone paid 15.99 they can decimate infantry as well as vehicles one of the new DLC LMG's that chambers .338 can destroy almost 3 stryders with one 'belt' so thats really fair. that people who bought the dlc have access to weapons capable of destroying the planet while im here with my  on my hand.-10
Its so beautiful!
 haven't played this game much myself but I just got my new PC this is the first game I bought and I'm so far loving it!10
A very fun war simulator
This game is freakin amazing mang. This and Dayz is the way to go.
he most epic movie military survival simulation i have ever played. Wanna create your own action movie simulation where you decide what to do next? Then this is the game for you. I only play on wasteland servers coz i find it more challenging and yes the survival is there which made it more interesting. This game is fun playing with friends. You need to have a working mic you can't go typing in chat while in a gunfight right? :)  got low frames or performance issues? I have one solution for you upgrade your system.  I just did and it worked like a charm. Have a nice day.10
epic game got a sever for any body
ow - great game. I really wish I had tried it out sooner although it is not on sale often. Get it on sale!  *EDIT - OK so Ive played like 20 hrs. I have to say if this was released in 2013 and its on the verge of 2015 and the game is sooo f'n buggy and unoptimized - it really makes me wonder. That in a nutshell is the exact reason I held off on buying ARMA 2 or 3 until almost 2 yrs after initial release... and its still pretty crazy that I have to manually optimize memory and stuff to get even 1/2 decent FPS. And while reading all forums and stuff - why in the hell do I see some go-kart racing DLC? What the hell are they doing over there that they add a go-kart DLC over actually fixing the game?   I really enjoy the gameplay (when it runs smooth) but wow what an unoptimized setup (and I have a pretty high end PC). I truly feel like I just bought an early access release. And by the way - do they have a proper english proofreader? I mean I see typos missing letters and obvious grammar slip-ups that are easily noticeable. That alone should be a giant red flag.   Well I hope this gets resolved but not likely since its been 2yrs since release... good luck Bohemia - if you keep releasing unfinished games someone will inevitably replace you with a better more optimized game. Just look at all those hungry game studios and devs - its going to happen if BI keeps putting out shoddy products. Thats the way these things work...10
many graphics. much improve. wow.
Game is worth $60
Best Wargame ever made. Highly recommending  +most realistic game ever made +gigantic 'war playground' +attention for detail +neverending viarity of content +endless mods and new fantastic gamemodes +overall fun to play
Half the content of Arma 2 for many times the price...
reat game. If you're new to the game it will probably be pretty frustrating but once you a hang of it then it gets really fun.10
t's Arma 2 but better in every single way also Battle Royale ;) If you haven't guessed I adore these games10
Never losses playability. So much to do! Best game on steam! 10/10 Will lead my friends in to combat again.
his is an amazing game. In my opinion the graphics are better in Arma 2 both are great non the less its wonderful. Its fully moddable and good multiplayer and singleplayer. Its a simulator more than it is a game which makes it even better.10
It's awesome!
layed  for a half hour during free beta. Liked what I saw definitely would buy.10
till kind of an alpha.  Characters/Story/Dialog: 0/10 - Nonexistant.  Atmosphere - 010 - Nonexistant  Mechanics: 6/10 - Often a lagfest the guns and vehicles feel like Battlefield(with lag) and the AI is unrealisticly good at finding and killing you. Play multiplayer.  Environment: 6/10 - It's quite bland actually. Chenarus was interesting because it was like the buffalo: making use of every part. Altis seems like they didn't know what to do with cities and they kind of all look the same. The rest is farmland basically.  What I would like to see: The above problems fixed along with more content. As for Altis the place needs to look inhabited and there needs to be some acutal ing cities along with more environment...stuff.  How much you should pay: &lt;$25. The game will get better as more content is ported over from ARMA2 but as of now there's not much in the way of 'big stuff'.10
great game if ur pc can handle it lol
I hope you enjoy having a decent pc and get under 20 fps on some servers.
rma III is Awesome. Why you ask?:  Good Things:  ? It has a very Awesome Training Ground. ? The Graphic's are Stunning Long as you have a Good Computer. ? You can Play Solo or with Friends Co-op &amp; Multi-player! ? Did I tell you About the Mods!! (Amazing!) ? The Exile Mod (Hands Down!)  Bad Things:  ? You Gotta have what anyone has in there Lobby for Mods! (Some Like It) ? The Sound Sometimes Glitches on Some Mods or a Lobby! (Shutting The Game Off Wrong!) ? Mods Take a Crap Load of GB's but Who Cares right!? (Some People Do!)  ? You gotta have Some things for Mods too Work Correctly! ? Oh Yeah &amp; PING!!!!!! For Multi-player!! (Don't Let It Go Above 135 Ping!) (Trust Me!)  • P.S. - I Had To Reboot My Whole Computer! Thanx Bohemia Interactive. (Pi**ed Off)10
One of the best realistic pc shooter games you can get  10/10 would definitely recomend it
i think incorparates some of the best shooting mechanics ive seen in military sim how ever the mechanics overall can become quite clunky. You need a fairly beefy PC to make it look playable. it was gifted to me and i actually enjoy but i dont know if id invest to heavily into it. Its as close you want to get to combat and for that i give it a thumbs up.10
best game ever. super realistic
Very Nice I Recmend it to you wana bes
great war simulator game had lots of fun but theres some bugs with rocks and objects.
I only have 4 favorited games in my library. This game is one of them.
ands down the best combat sim out on the market!! On a scale of 1-10... I give it an 11!!10
not useualy my type of game but i thought id try this and loved it for this reson recomended
heres no multiplayer and the control scheme is confusing and the campaign is super ing hard but it looks good though-10
COD's for boys Battlefields for boys Armas for boys My little ponys for men
oesn't work wnat my money back!10
I love this game I'v play many hours of this game and I would love to get anyone to try this!
gt;Be me Have at least 10 people all around me spread out. I have recent cases of bad luck like always getting shot in the back by teammates. Patrolling around mountain advancing towards target Area of Operations (AO) and going to take out hostiles. We all come over the mountain now see the rest of the team about 20-30 of us entirely. RPG fires Heres 'OH  RPG' Me: 'WHE-' Of all people....Of all the ing people....It smacks me right in the face and my body flings back and into a tank. Because of the mods we used my body flings the tank in a 180* vert flip backwards and onto three other guys. 10/10 would get hit by RPG again10
Found out how dlc=money Previous one actually did something better with dlc.
Its fun but there is a problem with bad FPS unless you have a super computer
it has wierd controls but nice graphics
progress is very very slow so its kind of boring but still a pretty good game i guess
This game is ing fantastic. Download the 'BattleRoyale' mod. It's the most addicting thing you'll ever play
THIS  IS CASH YO
played it a lil
I RECOMMEND THIS GAME!! IT IS ALREADY IN BETA!! :D
Locked me out of DLC I paid for.
If your stuck with CSC and Battle Field then your missing out on great millitary games go right across you deadly cross hairs because Arma is a more realistic simulater of battle so if you here a single pop or crackle you may experince the real army feeling of fear.  contans great single player and multiplayer action with multible modes to choose from my personal favoret Altis Life which is and rpg mode.  also has realistic shooting (as in not so easy to hit someone) with out being careful. I suggest  to any 1.
ell have to wait a year to get a better computer gg m810
I Don't know what people are talking about the game doesn't have FPS issues with the right launch options and decent rig (no need to change numbers in the files eaither makes zero diference wether the rendering in the arma.config file is set to 1000 or 1 or even 0).
great game 10/10 would play!
So much fun! A great change of pace from any other FPS
Basically ruined a year old my life.   RDM in Altis Life  Dupe in Wasteland to get Tanks.  Cheat in Battle Royale to Win.   JustArmaThings
more snaps than the maurey show   10/10 would get ptsd form vidya again
ight from the git-go you are in a virtual reality which is basicly training you get familiar with the controls and play it a few good 3 or 5 mins Then you get farther in the game and you realize the entire game is about driving around a basicly endless map that has a few houses and such Pros and Cons  Pros Fun multiplayer shooter even eithout the multiplayer great level design  Cons Really terrible graphics it haunts me to this day like those targets AFTER the vitrtual reality looked like tan pieces of plastic The controls were so sencetive I couldn't go down a simple flight of stairs.   My overall rating? 3/10 still better than cod though  -10
homecoming is a dance that everyone wants.   No PDA  dont kiss ur date  homecoming is greaaat
good all round
makes me want to bump meth and become a lesbian
It's alright but I haven't played it much.
is the culmination of 13yrs of open world military sim expertise from Bohemia Interactive.   If you're looking for a challenging yet rewarding combat experience look no further. You're not going to be able to run 10mph or destroy cars with your fists or have to pump a full magazine into a bad guy to drop them. Like the classic game Bushido Blade a single strike can kill the enemy. One round to an unprotected head and they drop.  A huge improvement over it's predecessor  improves in all aspects of the game. The vehicle physics animation systems ballistics and first person camera have all been updated significantly or rebuilt from scratch.   This is a sim worth your time.10
who needs other games
xcellent military Sim with plenty of mods and addons that can keep you running for countless of hours. It will make you come back for more. Regardless of what you're into. If you liked Arma &amp;/or Arma 2 you may want to go through controls and so on before you join any servers seriously though.  8/10.10
  if you love Modern Warfighting to a new level and loved Arma 2 then most likely you own this if you Don't then what are you waiting for.  If you have not played any of the Arma Series pick this one up you are in for a Real Treat!
his game is amasing! :D! my computer prossesor is not really good but this can still run on 30 fps best game!10
Very good game fun to play with the mods
fter years of intense warfare against Eastern armies Europe has become the last stand for the battered NATO forces. On the verge of being driven into the sea NATO command embarks upon a most desperate measure.  In the hope of seizing what seems to be a well-guarded military secret Operation Magnitude is launched. A small group of Special Forces and Researchers are sent to a Mediterranean island deep behind enemy lines. However the mission is compromised and the task force destroyed leaving Cpt. Scott Miller washed ashore upon the hostile island. In his effort to carry out the mission he will face the dangers of modern warfare an unforgiving environment and the consequences of his own decisions...   Altis Life is a mod for  where players take on the role of paramedics police officers taxi drivers salt miners and many other ordinary occupations. You start with a wad of cash and try to make your own way in the world. Maybe you start running minerals and metal between mines and refineries. Maybe you become a humble fruit picker and spend all your money on a sweet new scarf. Or maybe one day you’ll have an interview to become a medical helicopter pilot conducted by other players. It’s all possible.   Nice MODS and full of good RP BUT many BUGS and PROBLEMS with this game ..   I wont buy the game because y have in deathmatch 2 much bugs and in altis life y have 2 invest 2 much time to find a good server .. BUGS and other PROBLEMS are ruin the game ..-10
70hrs+ into this game and it's still fun I hope you enjoy it. The physics engine is a little messed up (if you are in a hunter and ram a suv you and the suv can fly across the map.10
This game has alot to offer and is really fun
Mods make the game
Killed by Stairs 10/10
This Military Simulator definatley has something for everyone. With all the different games modes you can go from spending hours strategizing to a close quarters gun fight.
f you want to expirence a game like no other and have tons of fun with friends this is the game i recommend.10
Great game! ¯\_(?)_/¯
Great Game its just you have to purchase some dlc now to play over half of the servers
it's probably the most realistic game because you can shoot other people and stuff
i like this game very much
Diz geym verry laggy and low fps
well its not mario kart
ot that much my style of game i like Altis Life. 7/1010
It's like Call of Duty only it is fun.
It takes a lot of time to do nothing.  Updated 22Mar2016: You need to find a good server for multiplayer. The reason it seems that the AI is very hard is they are 100% accurate even on easy. There is no way to change that I have been told. No option in server/game settings. I hope the new DLC will correct that.
Amazing game could be better optimized tho
cool game
recommended for people who enjoy COD. but feel trapped in tiny maps with no ability to drive/fly vehicles at will. arma has all of those and more
Best shooter game.
No because it has been taken away from me and now I cant play it anymore thanks alot.
Very well done Military Combat Sim.  RiX 9/10
Love it. So much fun.
Trust my luck. Bought this game yesterday for over $80..... and today it's less than $40. Why have you betrayed me GabeN?! .................. On the plus side. The game has been fun so far. 10/10 would buy for full price again.
If you liked arma 2 THEN BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!  Has free mods in it no lagg if you had like good pc and fps drops arma 2 theres no fps drops. Doesn't exist!!
Any other games are so damn-childish.100000000000000/10
i played this game now 1500 Hours and its awesome. So many Mods to play Like BattleRoyale Wasteland King Of The Hill Altis Life. 10/10
its Wow.
It's okay I guess...' -Arma II  9/10
Fun bad multiplayer no-one is on
eally good fun plenty of mods/expansions &amp; like the other arma games will provide many hours of entertainment.10
An in depth game about; what else? Military combat and war. I love Arma 2 but this one expands on that and then some.  9/10
This is a really fun game with infinite possibilities. But it is buggy as hell sometimes when I enter a vehicle I die instantly
It's pretty good. The setting and the pricing for the DLCs are a let down but other than that this game is fantastic.
One of the best shooting RPG Games i have played.
Player: I'm hurt you got an medkit? Arma 2 Player: idk lemme check quick. *presses G*      Key bindings aside its the best Arma game in its series. Since movement is more responsive and with the various stances you can do(CTRL+S/W to go higher or lower from standing to sitting and lying on the ground) Only downside like all Arma games got is the Multiplayer performance since my game runs in Singleplayer with constant 60-200FPS in Multiplayer it goes low as 12-20 rendering the game unplayable since even if your behind cover and someone runs onto the open field he will shoot you in the head before you can even response.
h now where can I start like this game is just so god damn ing good literally no matter what anyone says opinions don't count on this game overall everyone has to agree that this is the best Military Simulator that ever exists and will ever exist! If you have a different opinion or find it bad/boring/ you really aren't a proper shooter player then are you?10
very slow paced!!!
fter years of intense warfare against Eastern armies Europe has become the last stand for the battered NATO forces. On the verge of being driven into the sea NATO command embarks upon a most desperate measure.  In the hope of seizing what seems to be a well-guarded military secret Operation Magnitude is launched. A small group of Special Forces and Researchers are sent to a Mediterranean island deep behind enemy lines. However the mission is compromised and the task force destroyed leaving Cpt. Scott Miller washed ashore upon the hostile island. In his effort to carry out the mission he will face the dangers of modern warfare an unforgiving environment and the consequences of his own decisions...10
becaus 3 hours buisy with installing mods still unable to play ! deleted all the mods and arma stops working at all can't join any servers..... thanks there goes the money :(
ave only done the campaign tutorial and i can say i've never played a shooter that has a longer delay between ur mouses movement to your in-game movements it's almost a half second and i built a X99 intel7 with a 970 strix video card and ddr4 ram SSD drive and etc. after turning off some 'motion blurs' it got a bit better but im still hesitant to say it's worth playing.10
ery good game 10/10 Must buy! :)10
This game is a must play! 10/10 would bang.... :/ its amazing! the best Military simulator!
i am not able to play this game as when i try to play it i am greated with exit code 0x0000DEAD - wasterd £££ help if know fix not on website
Epic physics i promise u will flip ur tank and kill your whole team
Graphics are amazing and its optimized like no other !
I dont really have any dislikes not anything worth mentioning anyway but the best part is ive alreadysunk just over 400hours in this game and still love it
reakin awesome game if you have a computer that can manage to make it playable 9/1010
ve played Arma for quite some time and unlike other games it has always drawn me back for more. In total I have 1500+ hours on Arma2 Arma3 and DayZ combined each offered unique experiences hundreds of hours of replay ability interesting communities and a lot of options of content creation and running your own catered server. there's everything from the most serious milsim to drug dealing roleplay games it isn't always good there's a lot of bugs and it takes some elbow grease and work to do get into certain aspects of the game. I still recommend it for anyone looking for a broad range of gameplay. It cost me roughly $100 for the Arma series and DayZ and I've gotten my money's worth and more10
ea it's pretty neat.10
Tis a fantastic game.
Best game for Co-Op missions and a good war game.
good game but very slugish when it comes to switching weapons and moving round
The only game you need in life.
Best bandaging with bare hands simulator ever played!
079 hours played to date no sign of slowing up... 10/10  At it's best played with likeminded people online10
So boring and Broken Should be free permanately 0/0
oorly optimised couldnt get more than 20fps no matter what settings i tried. Tried enabling hyperthreading through shortcut perameter and that didnt help. A lot of people online with high end hardware also report low frames.-10
10/10 Good realistic shooter but would be better with and adblock DLC because if you don't have a DLC then you can't use the weapons and you get nearly constant ads with the clothes on.
Terrable UI really overly complicated controls which ruin the experence also game runs really badly low FPS.  Boring clearly for train spotters and virgins only.   1/10 utter rubbish.
grate buy it. now now now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Buy it it's worth every penny.10
I like that It Gave ME a HArd Richard
Great game. Endless multiplayer options.
Terrible PC customization. FPS drops on multiplayer make it almost unplayable.
reat great game! Strongly recommended best game ever.10
10/10 would desync with 29 ping again
This should be titled running simulator. The combat is shallow and is not good. The vehicle combat is terrible compared to battlefield. And onece again u run and run and run not to mention all the bugs and glitches u encounter. dont buy this
he graphics are beautiful gameplay feels realistic and it's mindblowing even while it's still in Alpha stage development. Although the system requirements are quite high I completely recommend this game! Buy it now.10
 played Altis Life only and had a couple of enjoyable hours with a few friends there. Don't know about the military simulation but I have to express a clear reccomendation based on Altis life alone so the rest doesn't even have to be good :)10
for the little i have gotten to play i have fallen in love with the game my problem is i keep getting a D3D error and i cant fix it so the games just quits on me but im gonna build me a better pc soon and ill just play on it
i love it I LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OOM SOOOO GOOD
 game extremely boring. Don't play unless you have a deticated group of friends.
ighly recommend this game. If your into Milsim and taking things seriously this is the game for you. The vast amount of mods are what make this game. There's just so much to experience because this is such a diverse game.10
8/8 buy apex
Amazing game with so many amazing mods. I think my hour count speaks volumes about how great this game is.
this game is so realistic  9/11 would do it again
+The best military shooter I've ever played.  -Engine is trash -multiplayer runs bad and a lot of desync
asteland Server: -Spawn and get shot 10 seconds later -Spawn get ran over as soon as i spawn -Spawn run to a village got sniped -Spawn picked up a sniper and a ghillie suit in a crate. Went up into the mountains found them and sniped them. Put everything they had into a crate put it onto a boat drove out to no where and dropped the boddies and loot. -Drive back to the shore. -See them sitting at the shore line waiting for me Held down 'W' tried to run them over with the boat. -Got shot and ran one of them over. -Gotta love revenge  10/10 would die again.10
his game is terrible. I bought this MULTIPLAYER game thinking I could connect with my MULTIPLE friends but no not happening unless you want to spend hours setting up your router to forward every port known to man or pay for a server. No wonder why people just stick with consoles and their online gaming. Pathetic-10
or a long time i thought Battlefield had the best online shooter... Until i started to play Arma and especially  this have become by far one of my most favourite online games that I have played... the controls may take a while to get used to iff you've never played a Bohemia game before but once you get the hang of it this game is immence.  I highly recommend this game to anyone as it delivers the best online team based shooters there is and even has the often chilled out Role Playing version of the game Altis Life which I also lost many hour in but for me now it's all about King of the Hill.  BUY THIS GAME10
 played Arma 2 religiously. I booted up  for the first time and headed straight for multiplayer. I got into an intense firefight witha squad to my left and to my right. 'This is what this game is about' I thought to myself as I engaged the enemy. We fought hard and won the objective only to board a helicopter with a pilot who had that conditions Michael J. Fox has. We all died.   10/10 Would die to Michael J. Fox again10
A great way to get PTSD!
very good with a good computer. Would not recommend if you do not have a good bit above the required hardware.
layed it once during a free weekend loved it. Now I own it. From time to time you ask yourself 'what should I do now?' Well as long as take a look at the mod section and find tons of hours of content along with the tons of hours of content provided by the developers already your question gets answered really quick.  There are tutorials provided by the devs and there are keybindings to look at and  is a big game and it takes some time to get aquainted to but it's all worth it. It really touches the sense of being a soldier on a real battlefield REALLY REALLY well. It screams at you to use your head and to try using tactics and such to your advantage. There is also a campaign and it's really fun and well done by the devs but I think they kinda left us hanging....I can't wait to see what they turn the story into. When you look for mods there are all sorts of things guns factions vehicles more campaigns missionsetc. It really does add up to alot of fun. Tghe mods add more to experience and the missions add more to do and more stories too :D I've mostly explored the singleplayer aspect of it. The majority of my hours are put into singleplayer. I've only scratched the surface with this amount fo hours. I did play multiplayer at one point and I wasn't dissapointed there either. It's nice to come into human contact with a big game like this. Makes it more real. There is also an editor making it so you can make your own missions or just goof around with things or test things. It's like a big sandbox all at your command. There is a bit of a learning curve in the editor. I'm still learning. I know there are tons of guides but there just never seems to be enough guides to figure out how to do what I want. As long as you've figured out some basics you can still make some pretty enjoyable experiences with it. Just yesterday I learned a thing you can do with triggers which made everything much easier. You can set the condition for activating a trigger to: Triggeractivated trigger-name-here. So you can trigger a trigger with another trigger being triggered essentially..if that makes sense :D The point is that everytime you learn sometihng new about the editor it opens up a whole new set of possiblities and allows you to do more fun things. So point is overall there is alot you can do with this game but you really have to explore to get to it. You really have to think to get somewhere. It's all about perspective. It's all about choices.  ?/10  Go for it cowboy...10
ts a great game realistic and even better with friends!10
  is one of my favorite games. I took the free weekend and loved it. Now when i play FPS i am reminded of Arma. But there are some downsides.   1. There are many glitches which sould have been fixed a while ago since this is a prety old game. 2. Server issues when joining games such as the game mode switching for example 'team Deatch Match' is usualy changed to King of the hill when you join. 3.It can be fairly easy to hack.   But those are realy the only things I dislike about this very good game and I intend to play this as much as i can with friends.10
Okay so I've made multiple reviews about this game and this will be the final one because this is like my fourth already the game it self is good some bugs here and there but that's not much to worry about my favourite gamemode is Capture the Island it's like a real life modern day combat gamemode (its not a mod)  I am starting to like Altis Life aswell Epoch was fine but my interest went away in a few weeks so be aware of that if you are the kind of person aswell that your interest can fade away fast.  -The singleplayer if you're asking is okay too but really really hard I still cant complete an ambush mission which I've been struggling with for months but anyway moving on the showcases of factions have gone bad in my opinion you cannot leave the area without a guy saying that the demonstration have been stopped until you've returned also everytime you look at something the guy starts talking about the vehicle you're looking at really annoying.  -The DLC's are a bit of money wastes not that they're bad but you don't get as much as you payed for it I dont really know how to explain it but like you buy the Helicopter DLC for... I dunno 15 euro's/dollars and you'll only get like 4 more helicopters that you can enter which isn't allot I'd rather say at least 8 or something the same counts for the Marksmen DLC only in that DLC you do get more which is worth your money not only some weapons but scopes uniforms vests and some more aswell.  -The vehicles are a not that much it's basiclly that each faction has a vehicle of multiple genre's and then they extra vehicle's which are the same as the other ones but with different weaponry like let's say America has an HUMVEE with nothing on it you have an HUMVEE with an .50 cal and another one with an AT launcher. That's basiclly how it is with the vehicles theyre basicly the same but with multiple variants with each faction an own example thingy.  Oh and one more thing you can get Arma'd in this game in many ways what is 'Arma'd' - It's basiclly getting killed or having an action which simply impossible like here's what happened to me yesterday: I was in my car I pulled over at an shop I was going like 4/5 kmph I ejected from me car some how flew 10/20 meters in the sky and splatted on the ground like a birdwhich all of the sudden had no capability to fly anymore. and boom money gone gear gone respawning again with naaathing!10
It's lit.
thi game is really amazing i hope that alot more people will buy it even though millions already do. when i get enough money im going to buy this game. I LOVE ARMA
 absolutly LOVE this game!!! It's all hands on combat and it's greate for people who love FPS games it's really similar to Battlefield COD and such and I just love to watch FrankieonPC1080p play this game he's just too good!!! Anyways this game I definitely recommend this game it's just too good you guys!!! :D10
ell So far  has been an excellent game! Except for one problem. I CANT PLAY ANYMORE! So I get on arma and go to play wasteland and then I find a server Join it choose my role and then i get the loading screen for the server. As i hear the  backround noises Battleye justs ruins everything. 'You have been kicked off the server (Client not responding)   I would like it if someone from bohema or battleye did something about it. Ive only played for three days and this happened. I dont know how to fix it. So i spent $40 on a piece of crap that wont let me play. All I have to say is that Battleye should be removed. Theres thousands of more servers to go play on. Let them hack! How about you do the work instead of a client that doesnt work! I love  but sadly this is what keeps me from playing it! This was 92% of the games I play. But iI cant play it because you guys wont fix it. So far WE HAVE! Ive seen other ways to fix it but none have worked for me. But instead of keeping players on by taking away some hackers (As in the ones that dont know what there doing) You taking away 1/3 of the population of arma! And the sad thing is YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS! Its been on your forums! Its been sent to you! BUT YOU HAVENT SAID ANYTHING! I am just dissapointed that you made an excellent game that 1/3 of the people that bought it cant play! I just hope you read this and realize that your game is going downhill.   - One less player  This is another review for the game and yet it still succeds to dissapoint Yet again I cannot play arma Why? Because everytime I click on the arma Icon to start the game it automatically crashes and then tells me to go to a crash report site at  http://feedback.arma3.com/ . I went on it and found nothing helpful I have emailed Bohemia and have yet to get a reply. For some reason all my friends can run the game just fine but I am stuuck with a crash report and a site that has no information that can help me at this time. Please contact bohemia and help get this problem fixed because it has been occuring for over a month now. After I wrote my last review I fixed the problem with a help of a friend and I loved the game but a few months after that this keeps on occuring. Please help me fix this problem because it is very frusterating and I would love to get back to playing this beautiful game.     Sincerely - Sithcyclist-10
 my life is gone now
t is a good game but in the middle of a level the game crashed and I cannot play anymore. Battle eye also has trouble. Anybody has any idea whats going on?-10
Step 1: Buy game Step 2: Install game step 3: Play Altis Life step 4: ??? step 5: profit
 just want my steam badge but this game is pretty good10
ore forced DLC ads please! I haven't yet had enough of them shoved into my face while playing.  Other then the DLC nonsense the game offers a whole array of features not available in other games that pretend to do what Arma really does.  The learning curve can be steep but that is only because it actually has content to explore and get used to. This is not a spawn/die rinse repeat shooter when played properly. It is a simulator! Its crazy huge map will keep you interested for hours and combine it with Zeus and you have endless of original and fun missions/scenarios.  The graphics are amazing environment is beautiful and all of it is just waiting to be covered in the blood of your enemies whether you prefer shooting them from 2km off runnin them over with tanks and apcs or just just plain old dropping bombs and shells onto them.  I could go on forever about this game it just has way too much to cover. It is worth ever penny even though they did sell themselves out with this DLC crap. Shame on them!10
 would recommend this game for non-serious gamers as when I played it for the 3 day trial their was a lot of kids and people not taking the game seriously. However their was players that played seriously and some heavily role played on it. I'm guessing the non-serious players were people like me join just for the free 3 day trial.  This game is hard to get your head around but once you have it can be quite fun and frustrating as the maps are HUGE meaning that to buy a car you might need to walk across the whole map sometimes but apart from that it is extremely fun and enjoyable.   9/10 I would play again. I highly recommend this game!10
This game should probably go down in price by now......
m really enjoying  I suggest and recommend highly!10
I can barely run this game on 20 fps and it still gives me PTSD.
his game just does not work constant crashes bugs and endless garbage mods that will forever remain in 'beta'. I hear they're working on Arma 4 so this game wont even see anymore bug fixes instead they will release  DLC.   AMD Phenom II X6 1090T @ 3.2 Gigabyte GTX 770 2GB  16GB @ 1333 Mhz Samsung 850 EVO SSD  I am Running the game at 15 to 30 FPS avrg at 20FPS.-10
ES But MAKE IT CHEAPER SO YOU WILL HAVE MORE BUYERS because this game is 60$ and a bigg\ game people dont like to pay that much for a computer game that they dont know is going to work on their computer10
uch a brilliant game im in luv with it &lt;3 also the gamemodes are AMAZING!!!10
very good grapics
Really awesome military simulator realistic while being fun and have amazing graphics! Also really awesome community with loads of game-modes and mods !
reat campaign challenging and loaded with hours of gameplay. The mod community on this is hands down one of the best out there adding to the longevity of the game. Well worth the money spent.10
Its a simulation more then a shooter like COD OR bf but still is one of the best most real games for to date
o good for so many reasons you have mods life wasteland invade and anex gun game search and destoy (with sqauds in a giant map) and so much more! i have 1182 hours and i still keep finding more things to do!10
his game is a waist of moneyshould be free wish i could sell it-10
olid game much fun  One of the best Military Shooters in the last couple of years. Althought it has a steep learning it is a extremely relalistic and immersive.10
Pros : beautiful island ; beautiful graphics and sound ; character control finally became comfortable ; ' Customization ' of equipment and weapons ; a powerful editor and support modifications. Cons : No campaign; terrible optimization in a network game ; indecent small amount of equipment.
imply awesome. Slow but awesome. Graphics are on point and it is the most realistic military simulators out there. What are you doing playing CoD when you can be playing this masterpiece. They dropped the price from 60 USD to 40 USD. All the more reason for you to buy this game. Devs are very active and they are always coming out with new stuff. So buy this game. 10/1010
??
irst time using the CONFUSING menu eventually joined a server got to another CONFUSING menu then it black screened and i could not get off it even by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL ALT+ENTER etc...  Pretty  for a first time-10
his game is amazing!!! There is so many mods for this game it never gets boring. Me and my friends have been playing lately and we have been playing Altis life and Exile. 10/1010
1.Grab some freinds 2.Hop on  3.Go on Altis life Asylum 4.Have fun
I can truly say this game is a great game but the ing controls are the worst. I spent a whole hour on figuring out controls and game modes. The ONLY problem I have is the complicated controls.
he update wold be great to play if I could even start the campain or editor or a scenario. It physically will not let me select any to actually start playing the game.10
not a game that i would enjoy. just get frustrated. no reward for playing not fullfilling. in my trash games folder
good followup on  and still a super great running simulator.
its 
This game has been a great expirience with the players and the military strategy and how you use the military like strategy to fight people and the  life is good.
Taught me to always check bushes before hiding in them in Battle Royale 10/10
uy game get on wasteland server play 100 hours try out campaign play until save file corupts.   I give it a $/10. (REALLY ING CASH.)10
layed the free weekend yes nice game practically playing just to go with a squad don't even know what weapon i got learned how to get a weapon went with a squad shooting absolutely f*cking nothing because i saw everyone else shooting rocket blows us all up. gg 9/1110
Gud game 11/10 like COD with guns.
his is a great product showing that simulations can be fun and difficult. The PVE is spectacular and so is the PVP. It has a booming community and is updated regularly. It has its fair share of bugs though but still a great game. Also you dont need friends to own the game previous to jumping in (although it does help to) you make plenty along the way.10
So addicting and great game.
his game is AWESOME if you like simulation. This is a tactical army simulator. It has really fun multiplay and a editor where you can create missions and co-op missions. You can also post your map creation on steam. It does not have many mods on the workshop but I dont think it need alot of mods for a cool game like this. I totally recommend this for anyone that like shooting games. But of course I got my copy on sale for $38.99 or around there but thats the Digital one I think its called something like that. I like this game so much I'm thinking about doing a series on this game. Thank you for anyone for taking the time to read this. :)10
i really like this game its very fun
hat a waste of time and money. This game just like Arma2 does not seem to be finished. AI is a joke interface is super clunky. The only good you might be able to get from this game is multiplayer - that is if you have all the files/mods that the host have because the game won't download them for you you need to go to google find them and download them yourself.-10
This is a really fun game I highly recommend! If you do decide to give it a shot come play with me and many others on the amazing servers brought to us by Atlis Life XL! They have a great community for new players and amazing staff! Always sign up on their website at  http://www.altislifexl.co.uk/  Hope to see you there!
DayZ Breaking point Mod and KotH is the most fun in a video game you can have with a group of 2-5 competent friends (or even by yourself!). If you can can get over the steep learning curve and unforgiving deaths. But with all that nonsense you get can find sick gear/accessories/guns/cars and you can kill people and establish houses and territories. Very Sandbox mil-sim Game I give it an overall rating of 9/10 :)
This game is good specially when you go in to the ice age level and smash down a tree with a microwave.
oint Aim and click to shoot( am I missing anyth- Oh! ) and don't forget to adjust for any unwanted... what is it called again?  Screen Shake? I think I said it right...  Q: Should you Play? A/Q: Are you High?10
t's an awesome game been fan since Operation Flashpoint so I really like it and all that but it's an unoptimised garbage so I can't give it a thumbs up.-10
his ing game. I played alot of Arma 2 loved it almost everything about it bar 1 thing. Stairs. The bane of my life. I had hopes that stairs wouldn't be my biggest killer in  sadly they are. I mean how ing hard is it to make a game where stairs don't glitch you into walls and instantly wipe you out? I'll recommend this game when I can walk down a flight of stairs without worrying about getting sucked into the wall. Good ing day sir.-10
someone want to buy me the full game?
sucks
his game is awful i hate it...-10
Mod this sh.it
o you have no free time? Does your friends call you constantly to hang out? Do you wish you had more free time for yourself?  Well then  is the game for you! Tell those ers you're attacking an enemy outpost with your new realism unit and can't be bothered!  -- My Review -- Spent 4 hours attacking a tower in KOTH only to lose by a ing landslide... tower/10 would waste 4 hours again.10
uy  if you have a good pc and some friends to play with if you don't have either of those don't buy the game.10
if you get some friends to play Arma with you it's amazing a mic is pretty much needed if you are alone then go on a server and make some friends didn't your mom tell you that friendship is magic
This game is THE BEST!
This's ok for me but so many the command in the game then it's hard to learn.
his blows only adding these characters so i have enough to tell you that gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg-10
A must have!
I not play this game even when arab prince give me 500£
m no expert on war. I'm a bit of an expert on  though. Does that count?  I've seen the horrors of Altis Life. I've watched as shanty towns like Kavala were invaded by a faction of 5 people armed with military-grade weapons and armor terrorize the people and shoot down the Police like flies while I duck into cover between building to building hoping not to get shot. I've been a part of a checkpoint shakedown gone wrong when the patrols discovered the kilos of cocaine hidden in our truck and me and my drug-dealing partners having a shootout and tearing out afterwards. I've seen banks robbed hostages being executed suicide bombings in major towns and more.  I've seen the horrors of King of the Hill. I've always played Support surpressing enemies with an LMG and watching as bullets shatter windows around me only to see an airstrike level the building the enemy is in and to rejoice in the capture of a point. I've seen vehicles hit IED's and squads scattering to cover when hellfire from an ambush hits them. I've seen helmets popped off by sniper fire bullets tearing a building to shreds and pushes of a 50 man team to a victory.  I've seen the horrors of the Exile mod. Zombies tearing through a fort to get to a frantic survivor shooting blindly into the night assassinations on prominent server members factions going to war with each other in cities. I've watched the greatest fall to the clothes on their back I've killed those who I once trusted and the ones I've trusted have killed me.  But every time I play this game whether it be a peaceful stroll through Esseker looking for food or watching a billow of smoke dissipate into the sky from a distant explosion tearing through the air I get the same feeling of uneasiness as if something different will happen each time. And most usually it does. Almost anything can happen at any time with any amount of players on any game mode on any sever on anything in this game.   is a breath of fresh air for war games. If you haven't bought it and you have a good enough PC to run it save up your money sell something I don't care. You need this game and it needs you.  9.9/10 minus .1 because if I gave it a perfect review people wouldn't take it seriously.10
reat game definitly recommend RPG it is really fun and you will make lots of friendships on the way and it is just really enjoyable in general it also a good way to express acting through video games which include police Paramedics rebels and more! make money in so many ways! and most importantly have fun!   Do buy this game it is highly recommended10
 love military simulators and  is the thing for it. It's really realistic but not that anoying  simulator like RO.10
GREAT GAME. The better the computer the more fun thoe. Bad computers will lag and force you to turn the graphics down making the game a little less fun. Also  is more fun with friends so bring some along in you adventures.
Best military FPS
his game is amazing even though it has some rather big optimization issues.  I can deffinitely recommend it for something like the Wasteland gamemode!10
ne of the most realistic games I ever played and I played...10
A+++ 10 of 10 amazing game
 have to say that this is probably my favorite game of all time. I'm able to spend countless hours in Arma III and still have a great time doing so. There are gamemodes that everyone will enjoy and support for modding is pretty good as well. I would rate this game a 9/10 for its awesome action packed gameplay. While on mission there is hardly ever a time when I'm not on edge being aware that the enemy may be anywhere. Whether you want to play Arma III as tatically as possible in a video game you can. If you want to just play casually and shoot some bad guys cause it's fun.... Go right ahead you can do that too. I overall just love the game and play it mostly multiplayer because although the campaign is great multiplayer is where it's really at!10
ood game but it needs pationt and to play with your friends .. if you like arma 2  you'll like this one10
top 
Get your Arma fix today!
his is the most amzing strategy fps war simulation game ever  and i have been playing who knows tones of those type  but here the amazing Team Bohemia interactive just show again a huge quality and talent behind  and its DLC ! If you like editing this is even better you will never be bored the game is endless and offers you a way to create your own campagn or mission or just simply what you want to be challenged of on a warfield ^^  is so far to me the best War game simulation :) looking forward to play again ! Stop reading now and go get it ...10
For me is this the most realistic game ever! Campain is less boring than in Flashpoint and previous Arma series. For me is main Editor. You can create what you want. You can make funny scenes etc. This game is really originally and one of few games what are good for buy. Authors are looking after this game - thats next reason. THIS IS NOT WASTED MANY !
ON NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS!!!!! You want to vanish into your computer for hours on end ignoring you wife friends and family....... The standalone game is amazing alone and then you have the MODS.... Altis Life is the most fun you can have in RP. You can be anything cop criminal fisherman dope dealer anything! They keep making it better and better.10
Good game end of story :D
his game is such a piece of . Come on Bohemia learn some  from your previous mistakes. The snipers are near impossible to use due to the dramatic weapon sway even when laying on the ground after 10 minutes. My player is tired after 10 seconds of sprinting and my game seems to run the same on ultra settings as it does on all low. The Arma engine is absolutely terrible and needs to be completely re-done. The ing go karts drive like  like the rest of the ing vehicles. I run over a wooden fence and my car blows up. The dumbest  will really  you the  off in this  waste of money.-10
A game where anything is possible and is still boring and hard to play and pisses me off.most of the game is based of dayz... at least the multiplayer is i can't find a good map anywhere.It's hard to play running in a field and get shot miles away from ai bots or just people.Arma life is ok but i would rather play aginst ai.I haven't tryed the maned vehicles yet or choppers or even tanks or the map editor im sure im missiing alot but if only the game was easy.ing missing out on content..i dought the game will change and it's still a bit laggy so i give this 8.5 out of 10.
his game used to be so fun now I spend an hour or more getting started on my character only to be killed and have to start over. If you have alot of time to blow doing absolutely nothing then this is the game for you.-10
DOWNRIGHT THE BEST MILITARY SIMULATION GAME EVER.....ITS A MUST PLAY GAME highly recommend
 better version of Arma 2 but needs more content for its price point. If you are gonna buy this just to play single player wait but if you wanna fun game you can spend hours blowing your friends up in this is the game for you. So in a sense 12/310
Plane A get shot by tanks 10 miles away and keep dieing non-stop (my first try) Plan B take cloths off and use a pistol........ got 6 kills 15/10 logic applys
I give this game an 11/10 because i like taking my cloths off and running arond the battlefield...
nless you are a REALLY REALLY big fan of the Operation Flashpoint lineage avoid this. Avoid it until they see their stocks plummet so far into the ground that they finally decide to get off their lazy  and fix this piece of  up.  It's been what two years now?  It's still a leaky piece of  with major FPS and performance problems of which mind you 3/4th of these issues come from the ORIGINAL operation flashpoint. Litteraly NOTHING has been done to remove any of these issues and it very obviously shows.  Only pick this up if you don't have any of the previous itterations it's exactly the same minus a few gameplay tweaks.-10
ery good and enjoyable game however has very bad optimization causing very bad framerates even for many good rigs.10
100 Hours of fun! Worth to buy.
Its prety good game personaly i enjoyd it.
ersonally love the Arma series 3 started off good but has since got unplayable for me after each update. Gone from 60fps to sometimes under 30 regardless of server or game type. Nothing has changed at my end so given up for now.  EDIT:  Ok on my new PC this gaming is truely awesome. Just one of those games that needs a nearly insane amount of hardware to run best10
good fun game had some of my mos Funny moments on this game
his is a game that can consume hours of your day. If you like Mil Sim or FPS genre's then you should definitely look into this game. There are copious amounts of content created by the players and fans that you can download and add into the game for free. These range from Military or civilian vehicles character skins HUD's charater actions weapons tools effects and missions. Right down to environment objects like buildings or trees and rocks.  It is well worth the money. While there are bugs and AI issues these do not really detract from what the game offers.10
ello I'm seTup and I like this game  are a lot of mods for example : WasteLand  Battle Royale  Altis Life  Breaking Point  ETC.... And is very realistic  LIKE THIS GAME PLEASE BUY AND PLAY ATLIS LIFE OR WITH MODS IS VERY GOOD!!10
War is hell
I don't have this game but i can review it. Needs a good computer i've heard but i think it lives up to the Arma franchise with realism and you don't move like a lego man anymore.
Good game and very realistic :D
Best military sim!
Very nice game for rage :D
the only game i will ever recommend
Solid 5 minutes of fun.
Walked into a car going at the speed that my nan walks and instantly died  10/10
Very good game I love it 9/10!
this game is 10/10
h yes. This game is everything right with Military Simulators.  Realistism at it's best (Minus some of the ARMA physics).  Get it.10
It's Arma....... Although Arma 2 is still better in my opinion.  10/10
 is very relistic. Deff not a run and gun type of game. But best feature of all is Breaking point zombie mod. The mod works great
its a good game but over priced if you ask me.
love being shot from other hills miles away
Here are some pro's and cons about .  Pros: Fun Cons:
The game really only is truly fun if you have a squad of friends to play with on multiplayer servers. Playing alone is pretty much pointless. But overall it is a very fun game! I rate it 8.5/10
love this game!
great game but if u have a bad computer without good specs DO NOT GET i can almost smoothly run editor and play that on lowest setting
At first I was like -  ( ?° ?? ?°) But then -  ( ?? ?? ??) And then a bit after-  ( ?? ?? ??)?
on't get people to download the game for free then charge them to play the following day.-10
Spawned killed many civs were the gun shop was then i saw one getting held up so decided to be nice so i shot the bad guy took his stuff nice gun btw then blew the civs head off with my favorite gun the m1911 *BAM* he fell to the ground dead     Will do this again but i was kicked off the server 10/10
Simply the best game
Framerate is awful in all situations and the game is insanely unoptimized.
Great game Just wish I could buy out buy no money but it is an amazing game I got to try it for free on the weekend of March 16th it's been amazing
Never before did I think sitting on a hill 2 kilometers from an objective calling out targets for my friends was my thing.  I was wrong.
o you want to feel like you're about to die when you're actually not? Do you want to feel the fear of almost being shot when you escape by just one hair? Well  is the game for you one of the most intense and nailbighting games ever. When you come so close to living the dream in altis life and you die can be annoying but when you escape near death can be just as amazing as killing someone and picking up their loots!  is one if not the greatest millitary sims ever!  -PS you need a good pc. :P10
 haven't gotten a lot of play time in but the time I have had was a lot of fun. Great game over all from what I've played. Huge amount of player generated content. However horrible controller support. If the controller support were to get overhauled this would be the perfect shooter.10
Awsome game with great mechanics.
 liked it during the free weekend...so much to the game...too many controls to cover. by the time you see the target you cant react fast enough to kill a target IRL time. but the enemy can. If you are into that i highly recommended. the MODS make it more fun. If 327 button command isn't your thing and you dont feel like being left by yourself on a map that covers like 400 km...having to run to your next destination on foot...then I do not recommend this.10
the game was great and I really recommend others getting. I know I will be getting it
ne of the best games i have played. 10/10! It has great graphics gameplay and an all variaty of guns vehicles and has a ton of servers.10
Much better than Arma 2. Now when you run a rabbit over with your car it doesn't explode.
Found 2 shrek mobiles. 10/10
me this game is super-cool play it and enjoy it!!! ;)10
one of my favourite games in my library. i would play it 100X more if i could run it :3 however all i could say that is bad about it is that downloading external mods can be a major pain as in arma 2 so i would recommend to all who buy it for non official server with mods that you have a bit of patience with mods'n stuff.
 have only played it for the weekend but man do i love it. Despite the minor few glitches its great and man did it make you have to pay attention to your surroundings.10
This is an absolust beast of an game. Recommend it to everyone! Stunning graphics and many hours of brutal gaming. 10/10
his game is awesome and you must get it Nuff said!10
I need a review for a badge here it is Meh
It's fun... if you have 3 Titan GPUs.
eally very incredibly good!!10
he game is definitely for the hardcore gamer who wants complete immersion. I've been away from FPS for awhile and this game proved to be difficult even on novice level till I spent some time practicing. Also recommended specs should be higher my video card mets recommended specs and I can barely play this on standard video mode.10
eally awesome game runs like poop on my fx8350/290x rig though. It really likes intel processors being a singlethreaded CPU heavy game.10
this game is very fun and continues to supprise me every second. i highly recomend it to even to short minded people
well ive tried out the demo and its not too bad of a game but i think im gonna stick too battlefield 4 until the price drops to about 20 bucks
ITS GOOD IF YOU YOU HAVE A GOOD COMPUTER  WITCH I DONT  BUT THERE ARE ARE LOTS OF THINGS TO DO AND THE MULTYPLAYER IS AWSOME  AND  IN GENRAL IS NICE THE THE MULTYPLAYER HAS A GOOD FPS  AND THE CAMPAGIN S GOOD ALSO THE FLYING IS AWSOME. THE WORKSHOP IS NICE ADDITION TO  (SORRY FOR MY BAD  SPELLING) BUT THE THINGS I WOULD IN PROVE IS MAYBE HAVING SOMETING FOR PEOLE WITH BAD COMPUTER (ME) OR THE DIVING IS A BIT ON THE WERED SIDE BUT EVERYGAME HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS THE BEST THING ABOUT  IS THAT IS NOT A RUN AND GUN LIKE B02 OR B03 BUT IS MORE OF A SIMULATER I LIKE IT
Best sand swimming sim you will ever play.   8/-69.  would purchase again!
f you love REALISM this is the game for you. If you are a BF or COD fanboy you probably wont like it. Unless you are like me one who was scratching his head at the absolute sheet FPS on the market atm screaming into the wind...'is anything real anymore!!'....I hate them so much and by themyou all know which big 2 im talking about. All absolute crap garbage. I cant believe i paid hard earned bucks and continued in the hopes something finally would come out that would be decent. Burned!! Then...like the kool aid man...'oh yeah!!'  came crashing through the wall tipping me over in my chair socks blown off. My monitor flashed free  weekend. Ok...sure..i have nothing to lose. I have heard of Arma franchise..even watched some youtube vids on them all. At the time nothing really leaped out and said you had to play me. But hey its a free weekend so why not.  Now im just down right depressed. This game is so amazing. I finally found my gem. A game thats just so intense. The atmosphere graphics...aww god i could go on and on. Why am I depressed...you ask well all the money I have spent on the other 'two' I couldve put here. Where it belongs. Trust me in saying i have lots of titles of the other 'two' and now Im having to scrounge for loot so i can buy this. I paid for sh*t when sweetness was staring me in the face. Awesome game Lots and lots of different servers with different mods. Every game is unique and different So stop reading this and go buy it  PS. If you dont adjust your play style from the other 'two' fast you will get owned and die a lot. This community does not  around you will have to deal with many personalitys and the majority of them keepin it real and hardcore. Headsets greatly improve your chances of survival.   10
The best army game there is!
this is great for free  weekend
Great Buy its worth its full price. By far the most realistic military shooter GAME in the world.
THE most realistic military games ever i have seen headcams of soilders and its closer than call of duty.  The campaign is amazing but chances are that you wont play it. Don't play altis life though it ruins the game. CO-OP is really fun. but unless you mod there are no m4's which is a bit boring which is why i still play arma 2. But over all its a really good game.
he negative reviews for this game are COD fan boys and people with no patience. This game is awesome. Sure it's a total  on your PC but still it's the funnest game out there. I had bought Arma 2 just to play DayZ I then found myself playing Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA more than I did DayZ. I then looked at  on the store smiled and tried to play it. Couldn't even play on Normal settings so I immediately stuffed 500 dollars down my computer's throat and then tried again. The graphics are beautiful and the game play is even greater. I remember one time I went on Stratis Life a fan made game mode where you can be a drug dealer police officer or just the average hard worker. I met my BFF on there and we put our money together to buy a chopper. We then started picking and selling drugs running from the cops and so much more! Do you want a giant battle with a 100+ people with tanks helicopters and planes? This game is for you! Want to join a realism unit with other people and get the real military feel?! THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!!!10
you can even walk like a thung
y far one of the best Military sim game out there. Great multiplayer and singleplayer.10
I love this game so much it made me  in my pants the first time I played.
 years later but still a lot of lags bugs glitches and dropping in textures-10
Best Simulation game a lot of fun  JUST buy it and  it when you are looking at your game  IGN 10/10 420
The game is fun I only got a chance to play free weekend till it was over :( I wish it was free on steam so I could play again.
it is most best fun fur whole family. I love da bugs da loot and Dag00t
Is a super coll game i played this for the weekend and what can i say i will probably buy this game very very soon :)
Love it! the grapic and with 3 monitors.. THAT IS EPIC! Great game &lt;3
he game is very very good. The graphics and the fact you can't just rush into battle makes this seem like a great game.. However wait for a really good sale.  is poorly optimized and you will get LOADS of lag on-line. Multiplayer (Domination at least Co-Op missions with 2-4 players are fine.) is a mess. Most of the time you'll be confused and one-shot by aim-bot A.I. Also £10 for helicopters. GG. Overall: Graphics: 10/10 Optimization 6/10 Gameplay: 11/10 A.I: 5/10 Multiplayer: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WHAT IS THIS LAG/10 Community: 8/10 Overall : 9.5/10 Also dem business practices. Edit: DayZ and Altis Life basically ruined the community you'll now see 90% of the people crashing the helicopter on the base or just shooting everything in sight. GG DayZ GG.10
ery fun a big improvement in the Arma series. That fatigue system though :P10
This game took over my life..
reat game I have no problems with it really at all.  10 / 10 worth the money.10
10/10 would play again                                                                                                          doggo!
Highly recommend great game online.
f you like long range sniper combat and bots that never miss this is the game for you. Try to ignore the onslought of bugs throughout the game and all the other ridiculous gameplay aspects. That said it's still a pretty fun game but just think about how good it could be without all that aforementioned crap.10
An excellent game. The best military game the market can offer and with the mods and different themes comming each day this game will only become old when it can no longer be played. A very good buy. Highly Recommend it.
verything I expected ArmA to be...tons of flexibility and open gameplay and so many options most players can't cope with the information overload without practice.  Modding community is great even if the multiplayer scene has been corrupted by wastelanders and lifers.10
PLEASE HELP. GOT AN ERROR MESSAGE WHEN FIRST TIME TO PLAY.VERY DISSAPOINTED.
one of the best military shooters i have played up to now cant wait for apex to come out on full ralese and hopefully other DLC down the line   10/10 great game would recommend this game.
ice to play in a clan Altis life is verry fun also. dislike some buggs 8/1010
 love this game but it's hard to review since the mods change the gameplay a lot so I made a list of reviews for the mods that I've played. I'll update the list once I play more mods and I expect to play this game a good amount so expect many updates.  If you want to recommend a mod I recommend you recommend it in the comments.    Battle Royale10
This is so far one of the best Army/ Military simulator out there. *Pros* -Good Graphics -Many Items -A lot of good Mods - Life/Stratis/Altis Life - Wasteland - Zombie thingy (I haven't played but i've seen it) -People love my name in it :) #Mr Porcuppine (Has nothing to do with this but who cares) *Cons* -A bit of Bugs -Doesn't run well for a lot of people but it's playable for me.
This has been the best purchase ive ever made. the ammount of support the modding community and BIS studios puts into this game is outstanding. I got this game last november and im still not burnt out on it. keep up the great work.
Like Arma 2 except ly optimized
reat game solid 60fps with a gtx 970.10
One heck of GAME! Playing with the Big Boys/Girls here. Thats right....are you afraid of a GHOST?
 can see how much fun this game can be but when I'm 1m from the objective and can't get closer to interact with it and can't continue the mission until I interact with it... and it's only getting in the vehicle well sorry I'm not gonna' spend 30$ in today's market on such a game - I don't care how good people say it is. I like the graphics didn't mind the long install time love the mechanics - crawl compass etc. I guess I'm pickier than most however and wary of spending money on a game that starts out rather slow and buggy. I know we all wonder why someone can't get it right whith so many trying. This game feels closer than most others to achieving that rightness.10
 fantastic shooter game where players of all playing styles can enjoy ranging from military/tactical roleplay and PVP. Good graphics as well the only problem I have is the bugs that still need fixing.  9/1010
Best modern warfare simulation game ever. And its getting better with every new update.  If you want to experience the most real atmosphere of battle then this is just the best game you are looking for...
akes to much power to run I could get 40+ in dense areas and 100+ in not so dense area's on low settings. This was extremly unsatisfying. 40 FPS is not enough for a fps game IMO. I returned it after 2.5 hours of messing with the video settings.   I have an   i5 3570k R9 280x  8GB RAM -10
m I brain dead? I don't understand all the hype for this game. Someone PLEASE enlighten me.  The good part is that this seems like a very realistic military sim with stunning visuals.  The bad? Where to start?   The netcode is a joke even an insult to a game which claims to be 'online'. Players and vehicles teleport around the map colision between vehicles rarely works bullets take 1 second to travel 5 meters (I tested it on the rabits on a server with 50 ping).  The performance oh my the performance. On the lowest possible settings I am unable to maintain 30 (THIRTY) FPS on a server with 50 players. 'Get a better pc you f***tard'. This rig can run Battlefield 4 maxed out on 64 player servers with the lowest ever recorded FPS at 40.  The servers and the community are not what I expected at all. I expected coordonated military operations. The only 2 game modes which seem to be played are ALTIS LIFE RPG which is a cops and robbers open world RPG and KING OF THE HILL which turns into a mosh pit with no rules and absolute chaos.  Again someone please explain to me why this game is praised so much.  EDIT: It is not all bad in this game. I do not understand why but on some modes and on some servers the netcode and framerate are alot better. Also you can find a few people doing what you expect from a game branded as a military sim actual coordonated military operations. Overall it is a mixed bag but worth a look.10
Its a very fun experience. The game really does actually make you feel as if you are a US soldier fighting on the battlefield. Not much to say here.
urgeon simulator 3: Prepare to Die Edition Pros -no more stupid rushing Cons -no more stupid rushing We live we die we live again!  10 witnesses /10  10
ve only played this game for about 300 hoursbut numbers don't matter. I know what to say about this game. Lets start off with a nice little summary of the game.  ArmA IIIthe sequel to Arma IIcontinues it's theme of Military Simulation in a near-future settingon the Islands of Altis and Stratissouth of Greece. The game features a three part campaign and many multiplayer gamemodesranging from Team Deathmatch to Sector Control.  But summary's are useless. I'm going to tell you what you SHOULD know RIGHT AWAY.  First offDON'T ENTER THIS GAME TREATING IT LIKE CALL OF DUTY/BATTLEFIELD. This game is a LOT more realistic than 'shuut the gun and dey ded'. DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST DIVE IN. This game has quite a large learning curveso expect to die a lot at the start. If you want to practicefirst do Bootcamp then VR Trainingthen complete the campaign on Regular/Elite. You should be ready after that. Finally DON'T ENTER THIS GAME TO PLAY NON 'ARMA' GAMEMODES.This means gamemodes like Breaking PointEpochor Altis Life. These gamemodesin my opinion don't really represent what Bohemia was trying to achieve. Im not calling these gamemodes BADthey're ing great I just think that you should also look at the 'Military Simulation' gamemodeslike Invade &amp; Annex Co-operative missions or KOTH  Lets now do what I like to do when reviewing games Categorize and Pro-Con-ize. Im a weird man.  WORLD DESIGN  +Bigbut not big enough to make you bored of travelling +Diverse areas (UrbanForestsPlainsMountains) +Dynamic weather system (Fog can get to the point where you cant see 2 metres in front of you) -Too open (In my opinion. Needs more Woods and Urban areas)  GRAPHICS +ing Gorgeous +Very customizable -Demanding (If you dont have a good PCexpect 20-15fps)  GAMEPLAY +Excellent blend between realism and lots of action +Makes you afraid of just a war by how dangerous this game can be +SometimesI friendly fire because I thought that a teammate was AI (Yesits that ing good)  SINGLEPLAYER +Great as practice for new players -Not the best campaign i've seen  MULTIPLAYER +The most ing diverse amount of gamemodes +Easy to find a favorite +Co-op missions with friends can be the funnest thing you will ever do -Most was community made (which is still greatbut that means that Bohemia didn't really do any of the workthey just posted a bunch of categories)  COMMUNITY +Mods can range from better graphics to ING DINOSAURS AND STAR WARS +FriendlyRespectful community that doesn't hate on noobs -Where there is goodevil tends to follow in its wake (Almost every server I've been on has had a troll on at least 2 times a day)  THE FINAL VERDICT  Buy this ing game. Do you like Military?BUY IT. Realism? BUY IT. Role-playing?BUY IT.This has become my favorite game of all timeand the only thing that I think will beat it is ArmA IV.  BUY  THIS  GAME10
very good game love it it is nice i play it all the time !!
 combines just the right amount of realism with fun. It is extremely moddable with a huge third party open source community.
 am trash at the game but its amazing - Graphics are sick realistic - 9/1010
his game is good. The graphics are good but can be a bit laggy in mulitplayer in villages and towns but overall good. The gameplay is great running around with people watching your backs costantly. But after you die which is often you can be bothered to actually start again. I have spent hours collecting stuff and getting better gear and enjoing my self only to have it ruined by some guy 30 miles away in a bush with a ghillie suit with his 50.cal sniper one shot and your out. Bit annoying but I guess thats just life. So anyway if this game goes on sale buy it its defiantley worth but never never buy it for full price you would be stupid. So yeah that my opinion. Don't like my opinion thats fine you have your own opinion.   7/1010
k .  is one of the best damn games I've ever played.10
Loving it !
urchased the game beacause I was looking for a realistic shooter that can be played multiplayer. Fun for the first few hours as the missions are difficult but satisfying.   I played the game for a few hours got a hang of the controls and decided to go for the multiplayer. This was supposedly the strong area of the game and the reason I purchased it. Most reviewers give a very positve reviews on the game but fail to mention one detail : In order to effectively play online you need to purchase DLC'S and mods. The few servers I was able to access were empty or had little to no cooperation. The servers also have high ping and often unreliable connetions and this is from someone with wired high speed internet in southern california.   Pros : Realism Variety player support  Cons : DLC'S are a necessity to enjoy the game  To summarize do not purchase this game if you do not plan on also purchasing the $60 worth of DLC'S and modding it extensivly.-10
his has to be my favorite games of all time so many mods and so optimized. this game might have a triple A price but godaamn the perks you get are just a steal. the gunplay is so in-depth the graphics OOOOOOOO and the mods. holey moley the mods. so musch mods i can list off the top my head that arent poop. anyone with a decent PC needs this game in thier library.10
Crackin.
 great mil-sim although it's poorly optimized which is the biggest problem with the game.   Even with a gtx 780 and a 4770k I can still only manage 25 FPS in cities.10
 just realized I've logged in 263+ hours into this game without giving it a review. I have ADHD so it's really hard to keep my attention especially in games a hobby I love. Let me just say.   has taken 263+ of my hours while the upcoming game has only taken 180+ of my hours. Really? Is there anything else I need to say about this game?10
There is not much to say about it....  Game not possible to compare with others cause of very good graphic details and best military feeling i have ever seen in computer game If u have computer that can carry Arma on minimum midium and 60 fps enjoy gameplay and I hope u will love this game as much as me or even more :)
on't get me wrong this game plays fine and is really REALLY pretty so if you are after good graphics then this is your game. It just didn't appeal to me because at the end of the day it is really boring. This is coming from a guy who has played previous ARMA's and Operation Flashpoint games and this one is by far the worst. Pick up ARMA 2 instead and install a graphics mod. It's cheaper and is more fun overall. Just my opinion btw so you may totally disagree if you have the game.-10
These Graphics are better then my eye-sight.. But the game runs like crap
fun for hours
 used to love this game now i don't after the tapioca update the graphics were changed and my AMD can't keep up anymore so it's unplayable. they changed an ok graphics system to one that didn't improve realism and although its probably just me a little bit more eye strain.  is still an (alright) game compared to OA which is something I still hold dear and if you really do want  with it's mediocre altis life servers and lack of 8934 factions then buy it but i can't really reccomend it anymore-10
f you're into trolling you'll probably enjoy this game. The community is incredibly toxic and most servers require you to utilize third party programs if you want to get the admins to enforce their own rules. It's a massive waste of time and it comes with a plethora of bugs such as getting stuck on weird corners and then dying for no reason as well as awkward collision mechanics. Join an altis server and watch an hour or twos work get  away by some 12 year old call of duty kid who refuses to follow server rules yet somehow never gets banned. If you complain about it prepare to receive a barrage of snide comments in the chat. The in game reporting system is nearly non existent. I tried really hard to give this game an honest go and after purchasing a helicopter and glitching into a pole immediately upon take off only to see several hours work explode away and then being gunned down by a troll straight after respawning I think I've had enough. Good luck and hope your experience is better than mine.-10
tole all the ammo out of a allies back pack and drove away. 11/10  also is breaking point...10
Love playin this with my friend we mod the  out of it (and now my sounds broken) and have great fun with it.
his is the one i've been waiting to get for years.  Now that i have it i dont want to play anything else. This is pure awesomenes!  11/1010
1. fix the ai intelligence 2. fix the neck rubberbanding 3. fix the fatigue 4. fix bugs such as not being able to heal and forced walking
always playing it at the most boring times at the day recomended for 15 and older!
Brings my PC to it's knees but still a fun game
this game is nothing like the videos that i have seen about it! ive asked for a refund twice the first one they answered and the second tyhey just left! im not happy with steam as it cost me £35.99!
I wish I had enough money to get this game ive played it when it was F2p and Ive played Arma 2 They are really good : Wish I could get this game tho
his game is a combat simulator and its job is to impress us with the gameplay. And it did. 10/1010
Good game 8/10 (We all know we only own any Arma game for the Mods)
brilliand game +mods are first class ebdless hrs of gameplay
PC games done right.
 have been with the serie since the first Arma and played countless of hours with A1 A2 absolutely loving the experience. My main interest in Arma games was always the mil sim part (not interested in any rpg/zombie modes) and so far A2 OA is the best for that. Sadly Bohemia got creative and put the A3 in the near future with more futuristic forces what pretty much killed the 'realistic mil sim' part for me. But still A3 is a great game. It's unbelievably moddable so I was able to get my modern military fix quickly with user created units.  So the good: -upgraded graphics engine -gigantic map -bipods! Yea after few years they put bipods in game! -shooting from vehicles - same as with bipods - finally! -new more smooth and natural animations -game is super moddable -as usual great mission editor (I pretty much spent all my time creating my own missions). -driving is way more enjoyable than in any prev Armas  Now the bad: -no female soldiers/civilians -(if COD could we can too) -insane gun swaying and bobbing gets infuriating -stamina - your soldier will fall on his face after running for 10 seconds -compare to A2 not that many various units -still no tank/apc interiors -lots of people reporting insane lag/fps issues MP and SP.  Its a great game and you can pretty much mod it to whatever you want - rpg/zombies/survival (blah...booring)/ military ops/racing- peek your fix. Still if you are looking only for realistic military sim - get Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead and put the ACE mod into it - it will be insanely good and sadly better experience than A3. Great game sadly not the best in the Arma franchise. 10
ven though I don't have a ton of hours in this game the development and effort that went into this game is clearly shown with the beautiful graphics and smooth transitions throughout the game. Workshop scenario's are what I've been playing in this game however I am still learning.10
 mostly play King of the Hill but my friend and myself joined a rp server.  Within the first few minutes i had people kidnap me and I said I could fly helicopters. They decide to take me back to their base.  Minutes later they land and a cop pulls up. The kidnappers friend starts screaming 'Me and this other guy have been kidnapped!'  The guy who got out of the heli (The kidnapper) starts shooting at the cops he dies.  Cops pull me out but the other guy is glitched in. So my friend comes over and says he can lock pick it. So i tell the cops they say sure as long as he does not have a gun.  It doesnt work so the guy just reloggs  10/10 would get kidnapped by poor flyers again  BUT All in all this is a great game! I do recommend buying it it is worth the money!10
after all the time i have played in this game all i can say is its arma u win some u lose some but over all its a good game to play over all i give it a 10/10 ps for the money u pay for it they could realy fix the bugs in it an the frame rates
Takes me back to the black hawk down days. Get some of your rich friends and go play king of the hill. This  better than mdma.
yeah not a bad game........... loads of mods about to try
It's Great
Waiting for another Free Weekend*    *999 Years later*   *Free Weekened*   FINALLY.   I only played this game when it was on Free Weekend I am too poor to actually afford the game _ But I cant wait for another free weekend. Hopefuly they're going to do another free weekend soon!10
orrible game very poorly written instructions the AI is awful. I would not spend your money on this game I regret it greatly.-10
MHO Not as good as ArmA 2 but still worth the price tag get it if you are a fan of military simulators10
all i can say is great game many different mods you can play it can never get boring
Great game! :D
mazing mil-sim must have for people looking for realism.10
lahuakbar your team into the middle of a fight and get them killed 8/8 gets them killed everytime and if you want to be a total  crash your plane in the middle of a fight if you can even drive a plane. like jesus christ the ing controls of the plane on arma are acctually the controlls of a real plane. 8/8 would kill my team again.10
Best Tatical Shooter out just ing get it 10/10
fantastic game it self and then all the mods just make it even greater
 is a great mil-sim and a fun game to play with friends.
if your pc can handle the amazingness then get it 123.5445454 out of 2
t's  m8 yeah has some cool features decent graphics at times and what not but it's broken... The engine is complete  it's just ing broken... Tbh idk how such a large gaming company put out such an unpolished turd... DLC's are coming out while memory leaks and game breaking mechanics still fail.... And how long has the game been out? Good god bohemia.-10
A black guy shoots you in altis life and then gets beheaded by a chopper 10/10
44841
Gets better with every update! Modding community is growing my the minute. Must have for any tactical or military buff.
9/10 would be in it!
There isn't mutch to say other than THIS GAME IS AWESOME
The games pretty cool but it more great if Bohemia Interactive make the game Optimize my PC Very Low - It get 30 FPS only :((. I will thank to the Bohemia alot if they can make the game FPS Increase XD
Forgot you were still allowed to have this much fun.
eally great fps game. theres not much wrong with this game it is really fun to play10
It's a realy good game but:  Buys DLC Pack In my opinion the coolest DLC (Apex) gets released Does not get Apex because it's not part of DLC pack    gg I r8 8/8 m8
they could have done it a lot better but they have no competition and I love the gameplay :)
this gaME OS AMAZING'fKSA 10/2
 is an Intresting game... There is alot of missoins and online gameplay with friends... The only thing thats bugging me is that u requir a good pc to play on Medium... and There is some AI in the Singleplayer that .... In single player when u have mods active. ur gear u wear in the missions Goes MENTAL when u try to pick up gear when the mission is asking u for that type of Item requier... Ill give this gamne a 7/10.
If you like  controls and lack of immersion this game is for you!
his game is the closest to real combat conditions of any game I have played. The graphics are decent and the scenery is very dynamic. The game feels better than ARMA II with the ease of doing actions. Though due to the complexity of the game i would recommend a keyboard that can macro every thing. This is not Battlefield or Call of Duty this is more of a simulation than a combat based game. I think though with it being out for a while now the publisher needs to lower the price as the game ages and stop making dlc like its an Ipad freemium game. I do like that it is modable something most AAA game developers now forbid.10
why cant i run this ever time i click on the  short cut it brings me here
Buy it so worth the money. i would recommend getting friends to play with you otherwise it gets super lonely i als recommend playing on altis life servers such as olympus or asylum
this game wont let me play and just now when i tried playing it says i dont have it.... STEAM REALLY!!!!!!
Everything is amazing except the game needs more gunzzzzzzzzzzzzz like in arma 2
Landed hellicopter on tower four. Ejected off the side of tower four.
 singleplayer in one word: Crap   Multiplayer: Well where to start this is so diverse from shooting everybody in your sights to a place where you pick peaches and make a living out of that. If you have been playing COD/BF/CS:GO forget all your skills as they   DON'T   apply here as your shots are coming from so far away that the enemy is looking like a dot and takes time to range and compensate the distance to take that perfect shot. Most of my time in the game as been with   Ozzy Gaming   [ozzygaming.com]  which is one of the best RP ( Role Play[/i)] servers out there so I speak from a position from RP. The game does need improvement with its large share of   bugs   [i.imgur.com]  that need to be fixed.   In Short      Singleplayer   Great Multiplayer   Bugs o the bugs   Great servers / communities   -Joshieboy
ets run over by ATV moving at 60 Mph only breaks legs. 10/1011
10/10 would dickbutt again.
 was in my tank with my friend I saw a team mate approaching with an atv. He got out of the atv moved it closer to us. He took the atv and put it inside of our tank. We then bugged out and flew into space landing 30 Kilometers out from the mainland. Our first Space program was a succes. We had gained info about the Terrorist's base. Only at the cost of a $5.74 million US dollar tank.    Well worth 10/1011
st time playing this I go on altis life with a friend heres how it went:  We spawned bought a bag and a hat each went picking apples for a few hours  Then bought a car each and went to do some delivery missions  My friend crashed and I drove 18.5km to repair his car only to find he was dead  2 paramedics came and revived him I took the hat from my dead friends body first and offered it as payment  The girl took the hat because the guy didn't like it and then accused me of being sexist because he wanted my hat  He chased me around his ambulance for 10 minutes shouting 'GIVE ME THE F***ING HAT'  I dropped the hat drove off only to see the ambulance over take me and get blown up by terrorists  I then burned in the wreck trying to get my hat back  11/1011
Good graphics and sexy  music all it needs now is B****s
awsome game heapz of mods to play
eople that make mods for this game do a better job than the devs. 10/10  *UPDATE* If your computer is a potato you're better off playing Gmod for open sandbox stuff. DLC's are a bit overpriced for little content that is behind a paywall. Even if you don't have the DLC's you can still use the gear but will get popups reminding you to buy the DLC with a splashscreen in front of your crosshairs (With vehicles you can only be a passenger and still get the message). The devs are slowly incorporating features that came from mods (I maybe wrong but that is not a bad thing).  Overall it's meh. Wait till the game &amp; dlc's are $20 alltogether or $10 if you want the base game.11
most glitchy game EVER to be released. half the time it doesn't work and the oher half it keeps crashing. i'm at that point i want to uninstall it and i have only been playing for the last 4 hours that was after trying for 2 hours to get it working.
 Was kidnapped by some guys they stopped by some road and told me to take of my pants next minute they both went on road and my friend ran them other. 11/10 would take of my pants again.11
fter making money doing coke runs I was doing a gun run to my house had over 3 million worth of guns gears ammo etc in it.   Was getting chased by the cops but wasn't worried as I was in the sports hatchback or Honda Civic Type R as I call it was doing 320kph down a motorway and notice a quad in the middle of the road.  Swerved to avoid it lost control and hit a billboard. As expected it exploded in a spectacular fashion killing me and losing me my guns.  Would die in a speed fueled adrenaline rush again11
eeds better veicle vs player gunplay if someone is in a helicopter the people on the ground have no chance. 11
Fun Game  Its best played with friends though however it does feel very realistic and it takes a bit to get used to if ur used to more close ranged FPS
my friend got downed and i carried him only to get shot in left nut 10/10
his game is amazing! I enjoy having the more realistic feel while still maintaining the fun of murder!11
errible game not even worth the money-11
This game is amazing although it keeps getting frozen. However its okay my internet provider reads out its constant motto hakuna matata. I was outside in the recent snow and i was asking myself if I want to build a snowman But then i thought i just cant wait to be king of Altis. I died One time with my scuba gear under the sea but everythings better when i am wetter in my own pee pee . I had a recent visit to Kavala and i saw a hobo i thought to myself who is that girl staring back at me. I then saw a Hench Po PO man and i thought i wanna be like you i wanna talk like you i wanna walk like you. So i ran up to him and grabbed his sweaty bicep and said you've got a friend in me. It is best to start of by buying the bare Necessities in altis like backpacks and stuff But think about yourself really its a whole new world out there. However dont insult police because i got shot.  P.S i guess thats the circle of life
I have almost 600 hours on this game it's one of my all time favorite war simulators out there mainly because of altis life and the so many other things you can do on it.
I try to jump up a rock and boom Im stuck inside it 11/10
 did not have alot of time to play the game but the time i did play everything was pretty cool the game aswell as the community.   Not alot of 10 year old boys screaming in multiplayer wich was also a plus.  So i recommended this decent piece of a game to all you dip.11
wesome Game But FPS Is A Major Issue In This Game11
f you like war rpg and survival this is your game but... if you like realistic physics then this is your nightmare :)11
ery Good Game maybe not worth £35 but I advise getting it when it is on sale! 9/1011
ot banned for calling someone who had no life and were just chilling at the noobtown 'Son of a ' on an Altis life server. No Admins are able to understand Fun.  10/10 Would Definitly Recommend11
reat game hate that the dlc comes up in my game I would buy for the right price purchased carts maybe if helicopers was priced around $5.00 that would be exceptable  Since at this time I dont have it I would like to see the DLC ads in my game gone Mods and DLC are great dont get me wrong just no need for it in game.11
cod is better
i like taking my pants off in a war
hift+W Scroll+F and 609-619-7348. Those r the only buttons u press11
I love this game only bad thing is that its so addictive xD This game is so much fun to play with friends. None of my friends wanted to buy it at first once they saw a few videos they fell in love now they play even more than me xD
 fun game with a good mod support but still it has its disadvanteges like when u die the ragdoll animations and u can get shot 50 times and walk away still pretty good11
This was my first ArmA game and it was amazing The controls are not hard but not the easiest  This game is probly te best game i have ever played in gameplay but..... Now it crashes to the point i can't play any multiplayer but other than that it's AMAZING I think anyone who likes shooters and roleplay games  should buy and play this game at least try it sometime
good game cant run it over 60 fps on low
car physics fatigue is pretty dumb. good looking  Runs 11
Joined altis life. Met man willing to assist me. Trusted man. Man gets gun. Man ties me up. Man steals pants.      10/10 would get pants stolen again.
This is a great team-playing game if you find the right server. 10/10
69/420
When I First Played It Got Ran Over By A Truck 10/10
20/10 would bang
This isn't the game my grandfather or my brother played but my son has.
Most realistic first person shoother i have ever played
ave not played much of this game yet but from what I have experienced so far it was over my expectiations. I bought this game to play Roleplay servers mainly and battle royale well I hoped on the RP servers for a bit and just did nothing much but hopped in the back of a guys big truck and we drove it into the ocean it was pretty entertaining and battle royale I have yet to try it but from videos on youtube it looks just like hunger games on lets say minecraft but way better with gunscarsetc. Coming over from Garry's Mod roleplay servers to arma roleplay servers and all I can say is Why didn't I find out about theese awesome servers on  before. 10/10 AMAZING GAME HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU ENJOY ROLEPLAY OR HUNGER GAMES LIKE EXPERIENCES.11
20/10 I love it when a tank is after my MLG Go-Kart
I would buy but I have no money.
 worthy sequel to Arma 2 but with alot more features and -kickicking.10
fter playing over 1000 hours in  I have come to this conclusion. While it doesn't have as much quantity as ArmA 2 in terms of vehicles and weapons it does have a superior amount of quality to the few things it has in the default game. Not to mention workshop compatability which makes obtaining mods a hell of a lot easier.10
robably the best military simulator out therebut can be used to do so many different things turn it into a TDM and play 'king of the hill' play survival gamemodes such as Wasteland Exile and epoch. Even though it might require you emtying your pockets its deffinalty worth it! Only things that bother me is that some admins ban you from their server but because of the shared ban list you end up getting banned from a heep ton of them... Final thing is that it can get really laggy at certain points or in certain areas and i think it's because of the engine... All in All the game is great and i have a blast playing it!10
Its like  with guns
I was once the greatest warrior ever embraced. Then i took 200 rounds of pure lead to the face.  10/10 I wouldn't recommend standing out in the battlefield like a ing statue again.
est game in my mind. Started playing ARMA 2 back when it came out and the amount of mods you can get for both is amazing but this game takes it a bit further. I can spend hours playing dress up and making meth in my underwear nothing else compares. And if you want to play with milsim groups there are plenty out there. You can go diving with the female mod so you can have your babe with you go sky diving then watch the sunset together. 11/10 will try to hit on that chick again.11
This game is Good Because there are tank or other vehicles to play and still have bug - - like 1.Tank Can fly OMG So cool?No it make you die. 2.Quadbike can go under groud and fly 3.Building Bug.Just Go near then R.I.P. 4.Helicopters bug just land then BOOM!! But I Still Like this game good weapon.Not Really easy to handling some weapon.But Still fun. You Should Really buy this because it has turtle. (I like Turtle)
Very good game! I recommend it.
First Arma game I have bought and boy is it fun. If you ever get bored of the vanilla game there are plenty of multiplayer mods that can keep you entretained for more than a while
bumped my tank into a rock  my tank flew 50 ft  2 back flips later it stuck a perfect landing.  would drive that tank agian
ills first person shoots at second and gets killed by first person gg. - Sidechat  10/1011
hy why why is this game so lagy i get 14 fps and i have a i7 4790k @ 4.7ghz and a msi r9 285 if i put all max i get like 14 to 40 fps on a good sever but wen i put all low i get 14 to 40 fps like wtf why is this game so bad like what do i need my pc cost 1700$ like really and yall see why ppl go to consols fix this my god you have a very nice game and ppl still play it even if they only get 14 fps with the top of the line hardware this is ridiculous.11
This game is awesome. I just got it and its hella confusing. Get this game. Play this game. Learn the game. Dominate this game.
 don't know what to say about this game but heres a pancake recipe!  Ingredients: 100g plain flour 2 eggs 300ml semi-skimmed milk 1 tbsp sunflower oil or vegetable plus extra for frying pinch salt  Method:  1: Blending in the flour: Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the middle then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre gradually drawing the flour into the eggs milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated beat until you have a smooth thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.  2: Finishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins to allow the starch in the flour to swell but there’s no need.  3: Getting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug return the pan to the heat then leave to cook undisturbed for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.  4: Flipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle ease a fish slice under the pancake then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.11
t was the best of games It was the worst of games. 11
Super tactical tacticalness of being tactical 10/10 military simulation again. The book is way better and more tactical. But still tactical.
NABLE TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER BECAUSE NO LIST OF HOSTS POPULATE THE WINDOW-11
good game but sometimes drop fps most of the time
successor of ArmA 2 and ArmA 2 : OA is in my opinion the best ArmA game yet released. ArmA was always known for it's moddabillity and the user's freedom to create their own missions since Bohemia Interactive released ' Tools' modding became even more easy. There are many really good mods out there some are as good and big as a whole DLC! The game without mods is also good of course the campaign was well designed and there are many fun multiplayer missions which you don't need mods for (only few actually need mods).Everyone who played ArmA 2 or any other ArmA game and liked it for it's tactical depth it's moddabillity all the multiplayer missions or for whatever reason this game is defenitely worth it's money. A note to all DayZ fans : DayZ Epoch (the most popular DayZMod version since somewhere in 2013 i think) is comming out for  somewhen at least they announced it only closed alpha when i last checked.  tl;dr ? A GOOD GAME !11
wow it's like i paid for arma 2 again.
very fun intense and action packed
the best war game
I got perm banned from a server for being on the top of a gametracker leaderboard. Changed Ip got on server again. 10/11 would get banned for being in 10th place again.  I got banned for trying to vote kick an admin using a votekick feature that doesnt even work. 10/10 Try to make a working vote kick.  I once crashed a car into admins heli. Got banned for kamakazi 10/10 would crash again  Got banned for vdm but got vdmed the second I got banned. 10/10 Would be banned mistakely again 10/10 would be vdmed again  Got banned for running a guy over when vdm was diabled for reason 'VDM' 10/10 would vehicle knockout someone again. Great game but watch out for those admins.
Recommend buying there is alot of gamemodes you can play. Its like 1 game that includes thousands of games. Its really fun. And the marksman dlc is really fun to play around with.
This game has the best grafics ive every seen in my life!
hoever is over the aiming department .To you sir i say.....duh....duh...duh...downsyndrom you   .I shoot alot in real life and this...this is just patheticlike truly pathetic.The skill it takes to hit someone running without a gun is just godlike.In real life hitting fast targets really isnt no more difficult than one moving slow but yall act like it takes a navy seal to shoot a gun.I dont know if yall are part of the anti gun group that thinks you dont have control of your gun while aiming but you do.even a 5 year old does-11
I have it now and I like it
GET THIS  IF U GOT A INTEL CPU DEN U GET FPS IF UR  GOT AMD U R GONNA LAG LIKE A 
 is for Real Cadets.
The graphics are amazing and weapons not to bad.. i have to recommend if you want a combat simulator go ahead. if you like battlefield/cod you will not most likely enjoy it to much...
PIECE OF  BROKEN GAME! would have recommended it but game is broke for me at the Moral Fiber Mission. I want all my time wasted back. Absolute overprice peice of mut
it sucks
ogether me and 2 friends did a bunch of drugs drove into town square then proced to run over a cop whilst smoking from my body from the Marijuana. 11/1011
Arma is now my life.
his is a game that really does requeire pacience and skill to play happyly you have to really get to grips with the controls to be decient at this game i am not brilliant at it but i still really enjoy the game even if i dont pwn people. There can sometimes be some lag problems when you first get this game (you really need a good graphics card) but this is easly fixed overall i would rate it 9/10.11
ell... the polish on the game is amazing. Solid combat ( for the most part) tons of mods and a decent community. 11/10 IGN11
k so I wrote my last review at like 100 hours but now I have 10 times the play times than I did then. This game has become a strange addiction. In all honesty it sucks. The mechanics break a lot and there is a serious issue with AI. However; if you can get past the flaws using mods to improve broken features and also add more vehicles and guns then it is amazing. After 2 years of playing this game I can say that I still haven't seen it all. There is so much to do in this game that I can't keep up. 9/1011
Enemy Ai is Amazing Friendly Ai is terrible Love it
This game is the reason for my sleepless nights and being late for work.  14/10 would miss work again.
his is a stupid game i will never doge it the  again. Its a dimwitt of a game i outta i outta  -Proffesional Doge11
ame old sh*t just a different name ..-10
Servers aren't optimized very well. Not as much content as Arma 2: only 2 maps and very few vehicles.
Amazing game! Love the support of the game creators in allowing players to create their own modded version of Arma. Makes this game a very unique experience.
good game . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .. if u want to play at -588 fps. optimize ur  arma
horribly made shooter... fun with exile lame on its own...
amn it colonel shut up!10
One of the best shooting/simulation expiriences I have ever played.  (No call of duty players found here)
Fun game and nice graphics :D
Gun play has been much improved from arma 2. Not much mods available for mara 3 atm but im sure loads more will be coming out to make the game last even longer 9/10
it said a long time ago the free version was out for a day left i download it and the sell was over i play it 1 time an now it says have to buy the game now whats up with that
is in my opinion one of the best shooter's out there! its tactical and takes alot of teamwork. you can play singleplayer which is fun but you get the best experiance playing with friends and being able too use your teamwork and tactics to complete tasks. the games graphics are stunning especially if you run it on ultra the map is HUGE! it can take you about 30 min just to drive across the game can also be easily edited using the editor and there are many fun game modes such as zeus that you can play! all in all i give this game a 9.3/10 its addicting!10
ts a beautiful sunny day 78 degrees everything is green and vibrant birds are chirping. This is one of those days where kiddos like you should sit inside playing this game all day.10
hrought my playtime of  I realized how empty it is. I don't mean to sound like your Call of Duty gamer that wants all the action in my face money shot style but I would like at least something to do in the long stretches of nothing-ness. I know people disagree and say it is more realistic to find the fight but I would like for the fight to be at least a few minutes away and obvious.-10
 is very much an improvement on the previous games and I enjoy the smoother combat and animations than Arma 2s clunky movement but the optimization issues and bugs still remain although not as heavy as Arma 2s. It can be a pain to get into games on public servers where everyone just acts like its your typical arcade shooter or the other side where everyone is being a pain by trying to keep it ultra serious and kicking everyone who doesn't say tango down or whatever every two seconds which is why I recommend finding a good group of people like Shack Tactical to play with. But hey you could just ignore it all and play wasteland or arma life servers and never play anything else which is the great thing about gaming. Anyway hopefully this paints an alright picture in your mind about the game good luck and happy hunting!
eep in mind before buying this game you'll have tons of time just getting the right mods to play online most of the online games has some kind of mods then you have to remove some mods to access another rooms.-10
best game ive played in ages exsept for when i went to play elite dangerous for 2 weeks and went back to arma and terrorists pulled me over in altis life and asked me to get off and i forgot the button so they killed me and took 100k worth of gear outher then that its a great game i would lke it if the arm on the anti mine tank would work and pick up small crates and move outher stuff like cars and stuff useing the numpad to move it and a secret chair that players can sit on and the tank picks up the chair and spin it and stuff for fun i recon the hacker issue should be fixed also its rare but its anoying when it does hapen.
Fighting is the best part.
Ah a great game I had a very fun experience I started out with nothing and lots of times stealing peoples cars the second they got out. So one day i log on to see the police/military have completely militarized the town I lived in so I decide to take them down I buy a gun and drive to the airport to pull a terror attack in the city as Im driving a helicopter lands right infront of me as my nieve self sits there and says hi he pulls out an AK47 so I drive past him and shots are hitting all around my vehicle but alas I was not yet hit as fear began to leave me I finally felt safer when I was atleast 600 yards away when I get shot in the head. I was frustrated but I was fine I begin 2 drive to the airport again and I'm only 5-8 miles away when a car flys past me at the time I thought nothing of it then I stop for a second to look at my maps when I see the guy flying towards me! I think fast and decide to drive up the hill in hopes I would lose himbut no he is bumping into me so after 3 minutes of me getting really annoyed I make a risky turn and fly into a rock and die with my $500000 on me.... Oh but I was stubborn when i finally arrive at the airport I have all my money with me (1 mil) so I happily drive to buy a plane I then buy one for $950000 I fly to the city and spot a group of atleast 30 players including military and police I go full speed into the crown killing almost all of them while screaming ALLAH ACKBAR! I was so happy about the attack I respwan in the same place to see what I have done bodies lay everywhere and I hear a faint voice getting closer and closer and it was a man running up to me and then I heard him say 'That was a spawn point you ****' before i can even respond I see a bright light off my computer as I look at it I see words appear infront of me that say YOU HAVE BEEN BANNED!   9/11 would spend hours making money to fly a plane into a spawn point to get banned.

rma series has always had faithful fanbase and for a good reason while not the most optimized or most fluid gameplay wise they've brought a one-of-a-kind twist to whole FPS genre with realism and simulation.   continues this trend and does so very well.   This game offers INSANE value in terms of varied gamemodes. There is an endless ocean of great and not so great mods for arma which alter the gameplay in many different ways. Mods are the reason why you should buy this game you quite literally get dozens of games' worth of content by buying . You can play survival role play play massive war scenarios just shoot for fun it's all there.  Visually this is one of the most impressive looking games to date. Huge maps with absolutely massive draw distance fair amount of texture detail and good lighting effects really add up to a spectacular feel. Night time is especially impressive with really dark nights and tracer shots lighting up the sky. All this comes with a hefty price though this game really brings even most poverful computers down to their knees. Optimization isn't great this time around either and multiplayer performance suffers quite a blow. Please do your research before buying so you at least have some clue if this'll run at all.  Sound assets are good guns sound beefy and other little details such as bullet impacts really bring immersion and feel of danger to gunfights. Built in VOIP communication is absolutely necessary and it's done well with VOD and everything. Voice chat does get bit crackly sometimes though.  Gameplay has always been both the high and low point of arma series and this doesn't change. Luckily enough some features are bit better this time and I especially like the new inventory layout. Controls are still somewhat clunky and mousewheel has way more functions bound to it than ever necessary. Also arma doors are legendary for being annyoying... Buildings have some clipping issues which combined with awkward doors and bit jerky movement can lead to sticky situations. Vehicle controls are for the most part fine but cars blow up if you look at them funny.  Gunplay is a thing I've always loved in Arma. Realistic effective distances for guns and decent bullet physics make shooting and hitting really satisfying. Assault rifles can still be very very deadly up to 500m or so and draw distance allows for extremely long range sniping (sniping is real hard though don't expect point and click). Combine this with good gun sounds and visuals and we've got one impressive package. Close combat is sometimes bit iffy in multiplayer as lag and desyncing can make hit detection not work perfectly and it's common situation for 2 players to end up killing each other in CQB.  This is a war simulation game though so if you come expecting some fast paced shooting action for a 30 minute session every now and then you should probably look elsewhere.  takes dedication and even if there are some gamemodes designed for casual action they're still slow paced compared to other shooters. People camp for hours just to snipe you in perfect oppourtunity people try to avoid fair engagements you will die to players you never thought were anywhere near you you will be brought down by massive hail of bullets from attack helicopter mile high in the sky.  If you're fine with the things in last paragraph and have a good PC get  you won't regret it.10
he game its self is pretty  its altis life that makes this game.  www.altislifeuk.co.uk 10
 is a good game but im not sure if Steam supports mods such as the popular Life mod. Will reccomend buying it for hard disc just in case.
o you enjoy buying games and being banned from them for no reason? Do you enjoy being accused of hacking a game and losing your purchase and when you try to contact the developers people in charge of the servers and the provider selling the game getting no response because they don't care? If you answered yes to any of these questions then go ahead and buy this game. If you didn't well this game isn't for you. Albeit the game is very fun when you're not banned. The customer support is so  poor that I cannot recommend this game at this time or any time.-10
Some one buy it for me and ill be your bff XD
as of this point no. Too many bugs and crashes. Also everytime they seems to make a update to the game they just seem to add more bugs.
eallistic FPS and third person! GUNS PLANES CARS  TANKS  JETS  HELICOPTERS this is war! in game mods! Role playing game! 9/10 NO Lag No Bug  10
this game is fun
his is a fantastic FPS/TPS Shooter. For those of you who play CoD &amp; Battlefield this is hardcore FPS Here. Beautiful graphics fantastic freedom but whats the catch? Well you need a MEGA PC To run this  game. Anything beyond a gtx 690 should run it well on. Not sure on AMD Though. Plz CoD 9 yr olds do not ruin this game with your stupid raging. KTHXBAI10
The arm is gone dont know how dis was made but the jumping is shiot!
Ell This game started out great now all is does is crashes! starts running at 3 or 4 fps then crashes my computer!! even in editor. searched all over the internet found HEAPS of fixes but none of them work. comes down to the fact its just a poorly designed game  DONT NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-10
Well it would be a good review however the game seems to have a set resoloution that I can't change because I can't see anything. Waste of money even if it is on sale? YES
Amazing how this game works. Best game yet!
ltis life co-op missions breaking point king of the hill and more10
f you need a tactical teamwork filled adrenaline rush then ARMA is the place to be. You need to spend a long time learning the recoil patterns and even the wind speed changes how your bullets fly through the air. This game is not for the Call of Duty or Battlefield player who just likes to run and gun. There are lots of places to explore in the map because it's so big but in a gamemode like Domination or King of the Hill you'll be deployed to one area only so it will be a close engagement in that place only. Lots of workshop content to keep you busy after that campaign is over but the muiltiplayer is where it's at. 9/10 - Only for the hardcore military player who loves teamwork and long engagements.10
hen people ask me what do I think of  I would noramlly say its a great game and I reccomend it to you IF you are into a realistic slower pased game. However the game is very satisifying when you get your first kill or learn how to fly! Here are some reasons why I think  is a great game but is not for everyone.  PROS * has such a big community and a huge diversity of gamemodes. * is increddibly rewarding for major achivements you will achive * has so many amazing weapons and vehicals to test out and use in combat siduations *And So much more that you will discover if you get the Game!  CONS * has a huge learning curve and can seem rather difficult when you start out playing it * can be a bit too realistic for some people although it is not the most realistic ever *The campagin is a bit boreing and extremely challenging I would reccomend just playing the multiplayer *It can be a very hard game to run if you dont have a good cpu or pc in genral I use a I7 and a Nividia geforce gtx 970 and I get 40 FPS most of the time but it will occasianlly drop below that *The in game voice chat is not too good *A few glictches that are being patched  Overall Rating    8.75 out of 10   10
Amazing game great controls
Tis good.
it would be amazing but i really dont want to pay for the pricy DLCs
 very nice graphics and very good concept huge maps and heaps of things to do hard to figure out all the different controls and read the map but you can get used to it i will buy it soon10
This game is very well done. Great open world sandbox military game where the sky is the limit with the mayhem you can bestow. 5 stars thanks for the sneak peek!
I love this game its very very good and gives u a feeling like ur on field
Played the weekend free trial and it's the best looking war game I have seen yet. Games like this are the reason I'm glad I just bought a new and powerful pc. Awesome
ecommending this game is a no-brainer. If you are even into shooters with a nag for realism  is inevitable. The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield.   The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. Groups range from run-and-gun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff so there should be something for everybody.10
t's pretty damn awsome from gameplay to graphics this game is the bawlz.10
Best mod platform
I played a little
Nice game! i wish i had more time to play this game
pent 60 dollars for this game played it alot played the alpha and beta to test the game then today got battle eye banned for no reason and can't play one of my favorite games ever it seems like bohemia interactive is so cheap they have to use battle eye a screwed up hacker security setup that bans people who do nothing I was on yesterday play altis life then today I get on to go play with a friend I get a ban message they are too cheap to use VAC that actually works and doesn't ban people that do nothing it bans people that do hack and break the game I have also been banned on arma 2 OA and I sent a support message to battle eye and bohemia interactive and then I got a bot that messaged me back saying that I need to go to steam and I did I went to steam and I got a message from one of they're support consultants an actual person not a freaking bot I commemerate steam for this and I scould bohemia interactive and battle eye. I will be missing out on  life city life battle royale and many other fun game modes because I get banned for no reason by battle eye.-10
....
Great game alot of fun alot of chaos!
Its is a good and amazing sim and you should all have the chance to play it you will love it.
dont buy this if u have a AMD cpu
y 1st real experience with :  SO I join this random server everyone at base grandpa commander was yapping on to everyone telling us all to get to our squads and so on didn't really pay much attention some random bodies on the floor t-bagged em' while looking at fellow team mate.  Suddenly see a group of guys in scuba outfits thought they looked call the goto grandpa commander asking for heli he calls one over they say I need to join their squad to go with them (whatever that meant) 3 more guys followed me and the scuba guys into the heli not knowing what we were getting into.  Inside the heli I joined their squad after a white we get dropped off on a cliff near the ocean and team leader says to follow him. we walk like 1k till we see the radio tower our objective looked like no one was there looked easy. Team leader assigned us all a buddy so we'd work as small teams.  We move on closer to it come upon a small hut 300m out of the radio tower and team leader says he's going down with a couple of us while the rest of us stay up to support him. He moves down and they plant the C4 on the tower team leader says 'its gonna blow stay clear' and it slowly falls down. We suddenly start to spot enemies moving on the hill over the tower veichales with big guns small infantry teams moving quickly apon them. So they get behind a small area covered by bamboo me and the others including a sniper start taking out enemies on the hill. Teamleader called us all to move in except the sniper we quickly move in and join upto them. We hold off behind the bamboo for a while and a veichale starts moving in we all panic and fall back a bit but he eventually goes away.  Teamleader orders us to move up into the small house there was near the tower so we do we get a small resistance force as we moved in didn't take long to take them all out we hold position for a while and teamleader says we were suddenly the only attack force in the AO. Everyone else was at base listening to grandpa commander.  We fight off a few more small forces until it began to get dark all of a sudden it went quiet all we could hear were crickets. Then out of no where contact from the west contact on the north we were scattered out around the house some of us including me take hits medic came and quickly patched us up so we could continue to fight. Fighting became impossible some were low on ammo without night vision you couldn't see a thing and most of us didnt come with nightvision scopes on our guns.  Quickly a bigger force moved onto us veichales battered at us from all sides grandpa comander says the main assault force had moved in all souteast of our location our medic ran out of medkits we struggled to keep off the enemy and then our sniper left cut down to a 6 man team we struggled to keep the enemy away.  The main force had battled to the center of the AO when then our team leader gets hit medic can't revive him. We struggled to fight off the enemy no more infantry were around but an enemy veichale had us cornered near the house I realise my buddy wasn't here and we called for him no answer I told my superior i was going to check on him as i move up to his position i realise he was out shot by an enemy I call it and carry his body back. We try reviving them but no luck so my superior says we were going to move up to catch up with the other squad as we began they say the AO was captured and mission was ended the superior said for us to move up to heli and leave the bodies behind.  We sprit toward the propellars we hear of a near by heli as we approach it it suddenly begins to take off the superior shouts 'WAIT FOR US WAIT FOR US!' it waited as we all got on another squad was already on it we waited for another one of ours to cath up and he then says the heli was full and couldn't come back for us as we all looked at him he took his own life. The heli began to take off we didn't say a word the journey back.  That Is .10
Best game ever except the realism when you breath.
my game says news offline and i cant see any severs what do i do
why wont my game start?
Great game would recommend for action and RP
I want this game so bad :(
ince I see this is on sale I feel like I might as well make a review this game is fun but only if you have a great computer. Not a good computer. Only a great or amazing PC. I have a great PC that can run this game 35fps and 20fps on multiplayer. Be wary if you buy this game and have a AMD CPU. for some odd reason intel works much better.10
his game is just wonderful it is beautifully done very good and magnificent. It is a bit hard to play but not as hard as Arma 2. So I recommend this game for everybody and seriously you should rather buy  than Arma 2. :D10
Dont buy it retared game and it is complicated cant  play nothing because full off kids shoting alah akbar i rate this  9/11 wulde buy agen
ust don't think of this game as another brainless shooter-runner this is infantry tatical sim i think. it makes you feel your motal. if you like counter-strike this may make you crazy. but if you are a sim-gamer this suits you for the infantry part.10
Good game Hundreds of different mods to download and play for free.  8/8 m8
this is just an amazing game
this game does not live up to it's predessors. Was very dissappointed.
Lags when using multiplayer but when using campaign lag is gone and FPS is 100. Not going to play until they fix the lag in multiplayer and if you think it only me that lags in multiplayer maybe look up online and you will see.  I get 7-10 FPS on multiplayer I get 50-100 FPS on Campaign
hile  is a good game it is still has issues. Myself as well as a lot of other players have experienced multiple problems while playing one such problem would be when we are launching the game a message pops up saying 'Handle is Invalid'. Don't risk your $60 - $65 on a game that still has issues. Dissapointing...  EDIT: There have been a few things that I wish to add to this review. I think it was a poor decision on BIS part to add DLC's that cost money with little content. The Zeus free DLC/update hasn't done anything to the game multiplayer wise the karts DLC looks a bit fun but still needs more stuff the helicopter DLC only adds 2 choppers and a few new gameplay mechanics that should have been in a free update which costs $15. Also like I have stated before my game often crashes on even at the lowest possible settings. I'm overall dissapointed in this game and its just a HUGE waste of money that could be put to games that are ACTUALLY enjoyable and not riddled with bugs and costly DLC's.-10
Amazin buy it play it make love to it
oor Singleplayer excellent and HUGE ( I mean really really huge) multiplayer.10
0+ hours later this game still makes no sense. Multiplayer is buggy and laggy. Gamemodes are poorly designed the only thing that actually makes me play this game is the great editor it can be really fun to just make giant battles and play though them in different positions and perspectives.-10
Game not worth the money! UNLESS! You have a super hightech computer! Waist of 45Euro!
ITS KOOLZ (Did U see what i did there i said cool with a k and z)
is a nice improvement from ArmA 2 however it can still be improved on regardless of that it's well rounded and nicely polished for what it's worth You can get hours of fun online in multiple game modes or you can play a nice military simulator campaign there is also the Editor which you can mess about with and create your own user made missions and just have pure fun in.10
this is not good at all i love the hp style shure give them that and i love the story and that they go to what really happend the days and go throw them but i cant take the game serius when you have a misson where you need to hold out for 5 min and you take non stops fire to you and evry singel bullet they fire to you hits you. you can try to look throw the corners and you can try to stay down but some how a bullet will fly to you like a missile and hit you where ever you are and you at the same time taking tha kind of fire you also need to destroy tanks 2 across river and 2 on the back 2 in the 2 from the side and here is thing to there will be endles of germen waves. ow did i mention this is the only misson that if you so by a miss cklick ore miss fire and hit an friend ow back all the whay to the cheek point. i have nothing agienst like i said the story and the game it self but i would not recomend a game to people where they couldnt program to give you a chance to make shure you take the shoot and hit i playid alot of cod games like cod 2 and world at war but here is the thing whit dose games the are balance in there own whay you get a chance to do all of the stuff you need to do in this game you cant so no i really dont recommend it sins it is a bit broken but if you are a fan of cod go for it and get your self a chalnge of the year becuse this game dont f around ow btw i palyid on easy and it is like playing exper good luck good hunting!
OT RECOMENDED!  Why?  Well BI just keep adding steeply priced DLC that divides the community and or locks you out of things like guns scope vehilces skins etc.  I bought the game. (alpha BTW as soon as it went on sale long time ARMA fan since op flash)  I bought the first overpriced karts DLC (Only ever used a kart once in an online server)  I bought the helicopter DLC (Only so I could pilot the new helis nothing like finding a heli in Epoch and not being able to fly it until you buy another $30 DLC also the advanced controls are trash and ABSOLUTLEY no one uses them)  aaaaaannnnd I bought the overpriced marksman DLC to so I could actually use the guns I would pick up in King Of The Hill mode and not have stupid symbols pop up right in the middle of the sights.  So far this game has cost me over $140 AUS and now they lock me out of all the new stuff again and most of the servers have swithced to the new paid DLC map. So I guess I'll have to buy that to or just stick to empty servers...  When will this game be complete and not be over charging me for mostly useless addons?  p.s. with all of my money you think BI could optimize the engine so I don't need to overclock my i7 to 5ghz paired with my 1080 to get decent frames?-10
I dont own this game but steam lets me type a review for it. Don't belive me? Then look my games on my profile..  Since i havent played  i gotta say its a good game. I wish i had this cause i like to play Altis Life.  Thanks!
ery punishing but really terrific game. Would highly recommend pairing with the Epoch mod as that's what I spent the majority of my hours playing.10
i lOvE ThIs asome game   but i have a problom my luncher when i start it it frezzs for no resone
I CAN DYVE UNDER TEH WATERZ NAO ERMAHGERD SO KEWL
Huge Arma 2 fan close to 1900 hours in game recorded and probably alot more in mods.    is getting better but then this DLC package stuff has really in  me off. I bought into the game to support the development and now I have to buy in again to use a few weapons and what not?   Feels like a bait and switch. Sure I don't have to buy it but then your only using a small maount of the lesser effective weapons in the game. If this is BIS idea of pay for play they can get ed.
mazing warfare simulation. opposite end of the spectrum from Call of Duty. in the time it will take me to finish programming my peripherals (keyboard and mouse bindings joystick throttle and rudder pedal axis and vehicle combat commands) i could have finished most of the Call of Duty GAMES i got on sale and haven't even played yet (with Arma3 and Battlefield1 i probably never will play them).10
Play this. Stop your being robbed. LIfeeeeeeee
Best Military/shooter on the PC. As a combat vet I can't stand playing COD or Battlefield. This is much more realistic and fun.
10/10 Doesnt get any better than this
unning around acting like MIlitary operators and yelling 'Allahu Akbar!!!' is kinda fun10
 in summary is simply brilliant! There are so many game modes and role playing games which lie within this game to keep you wanting to come back to this game! Along with a good community which mods and creates more fantastic games and scenarios to play The game looks great and sounds amazing along with the physics to the most part very good And the Military Simulation is epic and also intense but very fun to plan your strategic tactics to ultimately finish whatever goal you are faced with  is great alone or with friends  You can guarantee that the mass amount of time which you will spend on this game is spent well as the pricing of this game is fairly high  is addicting and I would recommend this game to anyone! 9.5/10
Highly Reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys relaxed simulators or just having some fun in general go for it.
Like Chivalry but with tanks...   10/10 would lag again.
good game dont take it too serious ans there are bugs a plenty but its fun and the mods a fun and friends make it better dont get this if you want cod
its alright
This game is a fun open world sandbox game. This game can be hard but thats what makes it fun. I recommend this game
OU GUYS ED UP MY GAME!  9/26/16  I decided to jump back into the game after having not played for a while. Several months ago I was an avid map maker and I just wanted to simply jump back in for a hot second and shoot some enemies. But guess what I find out. THEY ED UP THE EDITOR COMPLETELY! Now its all in 3D and I cant do  because the controls are garbage and the ing layout sucks ! I am aware of the map option but its not like how it was! I believe I spent $60 ing dollars on this game when it first came out years ago and now I regret ever buying it. If I hadnt of bought it such a long time ago id be asking for a refund right now.  If anyone is thinking of buying this game because you saw a Youtuber playing it I highly suggest NOT picking it up. It has gotten way to ing complicated than its ever been and the interface is hugely disappointing. PLUS Bohemia Interactive has snuck in dlc into the game for $40!!!!!!! HOLY ! I just spent $60 on your game now you need more money?  greedy ! I probably wouldve bought Tonoa too if it wasnt for the utter disaster you guys have created in the editor! Im taking my money elsewhere! Ill just watch Frankie play it instead. So long....-10
best army game yet
Great game i would Buy it.
Yes a very fun game the only down side is that if you were to shoot someone they will take like 6 shots to the body to die...
not the best shooter but if you like being picked of by snipers this is for you
bsolutely great game I love it! When it came out for mac I was very happy. However I have not been able to play it because it opens goes through the whole 'loading addons' stage then it just doesn't work. It stays open until A. I quit it or B. it crashes itself.  But for anyone who doesn't have my computer and likes military shooters tanks helicopters and a whole bunch of modding then this game has all of it.10
 have been a fan of tactical shooters for as long as I can remember my first one being the original Rainbow six and all of its additions. Hidden and Dangerous Ghost Recon And the game that spawned this one Operation Flashpoint. As buggy and screwed up as that game was I was still able to eveintually play it. Not the case with this game. There is no excuse for the graphical bugs and gameplay issues present in this game.   There has been ample time for this game to be optimized and yet it is still a mess. I am able to play every graphic intensive game out there on my system yet this one is barely playable. It seems some people have been able to get it to work but no luck here. This is unfortunate as it looks like I would love this type of gameplay based on my history however looks like I'll never find out since I can't even get it to run properly.-10
somebody ran me over with a quad and broke my leg and I had to crawl 2km to a town..
is a very realistic military simulator. I have only played about 5 hours already and i am loving it great graphics music campaign line and a great selection of mods from steam workshop.10
is a cross between a game and a military simulator. It is more complex than the usual big-name games like Call of Duty and Battlefield making the learning curve potentially intimidating for beginners. In reality however if you can handle typical FPS games you can figure out the basics of  in about a week. The reward of sticking with it is immersion in massive beautiful outdoor environments (the smaller island of the two is about 20 km² while the larger one is 270 km²) tactical play and epic encounters.  There is something different about scrambling for cover as you're being shot at by an enemy patrol and not knowing where it's coming from -- and then after you find out having to use compass readings to share that knowledge with your teammates. It's also incredibly fun to take an AI squad under your command close to an enemy position assigning targets to them individually and then ordering them all to open fire at the same time on the unsuspecting soldiers.  Notwithstanding all of this quite possibly the best part of  is its open nature. While you'll probably enjoy playing the stock Escape missions you'll soon discover that there is a treasure trove of custom scenarios created by the community. This is one game that is worth the price just for the community creations alone.10
The best military SIM Ever
First Thoughts: 1. This looks amazing 2. WHERE ARE THE ENEMIES! 3. Stays behind rock for 30 mins while adams screames at me 4. Cool the AI did it for me  11/10 would  myself again
I love milk but  I  did not  love  how  much  less  content  this  game  had  so  good  day  to  you  and  I am not a good pooper
#Worth
It runs realllyyyy bad on my gtx 760 . i would not recommend this game untill they get rid of some of the bugs  EDIT- Get Battle Royale !!!!!!!! its amazing
Its exspenseve ! i wanna get the apex but its too much if it was 30 or 40 id buy it .....
eally good and interesting game not the game for arcade shooters who run and gun and not for the lower skill level of battlefield players (No offense but in this game you gotta do alot of stuff like salute people to stay in a server while you guys prefer to say 'Alright lets all go charge the flag. *team runs in all directions including suicide zone*... and I do like battlefield just making a little point) its mainly made for gamers who have time and like realism (or similar to realism). There are funny bugs like when I get lifted into the sky by a weather balloon and fall to my death after going 4000 Meters into the sky and then theres the hackers which just  with the servers. Zues mode is helpful if you are the owner and the workshop mods are excellent even if their not your cup of tea they are mostly well build and almost no bugs. I mainly use the RHS mods which can be found here:  http://www.rhsmods.org/  Very good and interesting game.The enemies can be tough no matter the difficulty first time I played I made the AI have no skill or anything I died 4 times on the first mission because I thought they would be easier. There are so many mechanics like they said in the video and more. I love this game and its just so interesting to me. If you are not a medic you can't heal yourself all the way back to full HP and you have limited sprint based on what your carrying if heavy armor your gonna walk everywhere if light armor you will have alot of running time but you should stay in cover as much as possible. Before every operation you do use the map (M) and try to find walls on the map buildings ect and based off of that choose how you think the best way to complete the operation would be heavy medium light armor? Machine guns assault rifles or snipers? Artillery cas or smoke support? it depends on what you want to do and how.10
i downloaded this one its free weekend now i can play it and i had to wait 2 hours for it to download so that is bul    but the game it self is good beside that fact
 wanted to like this game so much. The controls are so extremely horrible and the muted gunshots past 100 yards just remove any immersion from the expansive battlefield. I just cannot reccomend this game or series to anyone. Don't get me started on the network issues on any and all servers i've tried. Have you ever seen a vehicle move across the battlefield smoothly? Not me.   100FPS on max settings too.-10
est weapon game so far in the world everything is like in RL and the more you play you will not be able to stop playing   Even though Arma is more like an engine/editor for creating missions and stuff you will always have something to play here. There are unlimited possibilities in this game and together with the looking of the graphics you have the best game in the world.  60$ for this is nothing The new COD costs the same and has not 10% of this game  Everyone who says this game is bad has a bad PC to run it on medium or high because even then the grafics look amazing11
ood for raging about AI. Mods required AI intelligence not expected.11
Sale ends as soon the day before i get paid. zero out of ten.
The amout of Hours I've played explains how it's just so wonderful.
uy i need help with one thing i am new 2 arma i want to play altis life how do i get????11
eally Good game i recommend it to anyone who enjoys teamplay. Note: it is hard to understand the game at first however later on ones you understood the game it is really enjoyable.11
yes i do recomment this game
i git it for free and now its not why
ell its a pretty expensive game but if youre looking for a fun multiplayer experience with realistic gun damage and accuracy along with tactics this is the game for you!11
you can fight in your underwear    100000/10
so i downloaded the dlc bundle for  and i try enabling it and i restart it and then i get back on and its not there ive tried verifying cache
Some good stuff is waiting for you. I recommend it!
one of the best pc games i have played only down sides are the optimisation is pretty bad but apart from that awesome game
ery very tactical game and a lot of fun to play with friends. 9/1010
This game has everything you can ask for in a FPS game. The original gameplay caters to players who enjoy more simulated style combat. Though for those who like fast-paced and action-packed gameplay then check out the King of the Hill mode! There is also a great mod for those who likes zombies and/or survival!   Highlighted Favorite Features  - Helicopters  - Mod Community  - Large scale 100+ player battles  - ZEUS Missions!  The Problems  - Too expensive to play base game. (Small Player Base for this reason.)  - Vehicle/Tank physics terrible.  - AI/Player can easily glitch through walls.  - Does not support Multi-threads or 64-bit servers.  - Object and vehicle damage is static and lacks simulation/physics.  - Building interior creativity lacking.  Overall Thought  Very few titles are near the realism simulated in . Though if all the major issues I mentioned and community also have mentioned were fixed the game would probably be a lot more popular and become even more of a timeless title which it has proven itself to some degree.   Though I would give this title a 4.5 Star rating and put it on the shelf and wait for Arma 4 to be released as a Free to Play with a diverse marketplace to purchase vehicles/weapons/maps/etc. Until then...I recommend only buying when on sale.   P.S. I own all the DLC and had no problem paying for it. All my friends refuse to buy into it even though they want to play. Huge makes it difficult to justify playing this game.
f you genuinely believe in your heart that the only reason you're not a member of Seal Team 6 is because you weigh 265 pounds and still live with your parents you will LOVE this game.10
i5-4690k cpu GeForce GTX 970 16GB Ram  20 FPS  10/10 would love to be able to play
ove ! Cant Stand Steam!! If there was away to get it with out steam I woud buy 2! recomment the game highly do not in anyway recommend steam  UPDATE - Latest hotfix killed my game many emails bug reports and almost 3 days later and nothing from BI.   removed DayZ stand alone from my wish list.   I will waste my money some where they atleast pretend to care about customers.  Day 21 still no help. was emailled to delete my profile deleted all arma 2 and  profiles and the game still crashes.... they would have to give there products away and I still would not own one.-10
Why are you still reading Reviews? Just buy this good game NOW!
SupR Dank n' Bodacious

My day:  Joined a server Left the server Went to campaign Got yelled at by a guy because I forgot how to take a compass out Did some boring stuff Left campaign Joined a server Looked at the controls Walked around a bit Found a rekt car Repaird it Got in it When on a mission with 4 other people Arrived at the enemy base Blew up  11/10 IGN would forget how to use a compass again.
Police Officers With Inferiority Complex Simulator 2015
Best wargame !
Kids play COD boys play BF Men play ARMA
This review is better than the 'game'. And you have to buy the overpriced dlc to join most servers.
recommend. ing love it
ery good game multiplayer is excellent. Only DLC are expensive ...10
reat game so addictive. The multiplayer mods and plugins are the best part of te game. The story line is fine.10
This game is fun and good but not for a person who has crapy computer which in this case that person is me.  Gather your squad dive in !! hell yeah
the best war simulater ever
ery nice game for simulation gamer but i found much bug in this game10
Only played half an hour altogether. Not bad. Not bad at all.
10 out of train   would operate with
 = running around for half an hour and eventually get shot by an AI BOT that is using iron sights at 2km distance and who you can't even find using a scope because he's behind a bush! In other words unplayable and unenjoyable even on rookie settings unless you have 20 mods and then you'll spend 1 year trying to configure everything to your liking. Then when you go online all servers have different mods that you may like or not like.-10
Too realistic so it doesn't give me much entertainment but still a beautiful and an amazing game! 7/10
’m Rick Harrison and this is my pawn shop. I work here with my old man and my son Big Hoss. Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I’ve learned after 21 years – you never know WHAT is gonna come through that door11
lways liked arma 2 more :3 Doesn't mean this is a bad game I think I bought this one in a sale for like 30 bucks No money.10
Do it...
So fun  Much love  More server
ugfest unstable crashes horrid optimization casues full system shutdowns. I7 4790k @ 4.5GHZ GTX 970 16gb vengence ram 512 crutial SSD max 30-40 FPS with everything on ultra **Update** Uninstalled. Lost all of my player data not once but twice because they are too greedy to have deticated servers. I am out.-10
eautiful Game Cant wait for APEX! HOORAH!10
Wanna play realism mode?  Wanna go hard core for that real life experience? Head on over to EUTW or any other server that offers the same thing! To only get killed by spastics who can't tell the difference between factions!
eally awesome game just wish there were more modded servers for aus/nz that had players :D  Highly recommend10
Easily one of the best military simulators on the market. If you're a fan of Arma 2. You'll be a fan of . Although the game has slight optimization issues it overall doesn't effect the game drastically. Highly recommended a beefy/above average computer before buying. Side note Wish the game's flight aspects were made more realistic. Good Military Sim recommended.  8.5/10
eeded to get to a battle.  Player flys squad out to a strategic overwatch position.  Pilot doesn't know how to land. Flips helicopter and plows us into the ground. OK Respawn. Still need to get to battle. Different Player flys squad to a strategic overwatch position. Pilot also doesn't know how to land. Barrel rolls into a treeline.  We've been playing for 45 minutes. 10/10  No but seriously amazingly deep military sandbox.10
It calls itself a realistic simulator game and it is.  -Great Graphics -Good Campaign missions (scenarios or showcases) -Full sandbox mode -Multiplayer -Wonds affect the player  One bad thing is you will never stop looking at the control menu for the first few hours until you figure out what keys you will be using.
OO LONG BROTHERS HAVE WE SUFFERED MEDIOCRITY- and have come to lower our standards..  TOO MUCH HAVE WE BECOME COMPLACENT- and we have seen AAA games ignore what might have been..  SEEN THEM BECOME RECOATED YEAR AFTER YEAR taking a franchise and driving it too the ground.  WELL NO MORE  Here we have ArmA3 a game that stands against the tide and wants to do more be more give more. Here is a game where you cannot simply walk into mordor or compare it to any other notable shooter.  Mission editors powerful moddable platform amazing graphics as close to realism you can get with regards to weapon and vehicle dynamics incredible maps and attention to detail. To name but a few elements that make ARMA3 great.  My absolute highest praise for  for being what they set out to be and not seeying the players as ATM's.  TLDR: You are whats wrong with the world.10
ros: -sick graphics -sick physics -sick control capabilities -awesome dialogue between npcs and player -alot of realism in the camp setups and mission stories -multiplayer is alot of fun if you have 20+ friends  Cons: -enemies that can magically see you in full camo while u prone behind bushes at 3-400 meters distance with no zoomed sights or binoculars  -appearance of a difficult campaign based on designed circumstances requiring you to 'corpse run' your way through it or be Chuck Norris and one man army groups of 30 enemies at a time at 300 meters with nothing but an unsighted crap rifle and no ammo  -fatigue system that forces you to walk slowly and stop to rest while your npc partners can sprint 1000 meters in front of you and get killed leaving you to once again Chuck Norris your way through missions.  -over 100 silly keybinds that are not even good as far as default keybinds go and will require at least an hour configuring them so you can use about 20 of them. (Changing from a laptop to a desktop requires you to reconfigure all of them again)  -multiplayer requires 20+ friends   I recommend this game if you want to hate a game while spending hours afk in a bush because despite what the story requires your character is not Chuck Norris and you can't do anything.-10
If you like this game than get it
0/10  Flow a jet blow things up  crashed and burned alive.  would blow up again11
Best. Military. Simulator. Sandbox. Ever
mazing game lots of servers easily moddable. Enough said.10
Best MilSim out there!
 is 
is a great game with many ways to play. You can do the single player campaign which by looking at it is very realistic and has many features incorporated into it. You could download workshop maps and go shooting bots but the game shines online.  You can go into group servers with friends or alone and go and military roleplay. Or you can do what the game is used for by hundreds of people and Roleplay. The game acts like Garry's Mod with many ways to play and many posibilities. Even if you don't know what you want to do at the very least it's a good military simulator and if you're into RP one of the best games to RP on to date.10
10/10 Best Call Of Duty ever made...
This is an excellent military simulation game that the military bases their own simulator off of. This game is hands down the best FPS I have played.
Yes if i could PLAY IT .&lt;
One of the most replayable games ever. Assload of mods and missions After 3 years of release the game still requires 4 i7 6700k processers 1 gtx 970 and 246gb of ddr4 ram tp run on low
ore comfortable controls than in Arma 2. Easier to use mods. New features such as underwater gameplay. Faces are still bad and optimization is crap. Other than that it is good.  Optimization is better with current patch.10
Play with me maybe.
reat Idea for a game still didn't reach the point to where it is a game. It gets boring and repetitive after a very short period of time. Multiplayer isn't fun at all you get all these trolls that kill you while being on the same team. The finisher for me was when I tried using the editor Considering that I bought  on sale for 20$ The actual price for the full game including the DLCs is way more.    is an interesting idea for a game should you buy it ? Absolutely ing NOT!!!!!-10
its the  bomb.com
Better than Battlefield.
h you find a sniper rifle ingame?  you and buy the dlc! Wanna get into that Choppa? Go grab the in dlc! Woa that gokart seems like fun! Such a suprise it's a dlc content! You can't use any dlc content but the in game downloads them.-11
If you love getting killed by a tank 2000+ metres away.  I can't recommend this game enough.
orrible graphics horrible performance on a dual 980Ti setup.-10
reat Game lots of mods and modes to play. Everlasting Fun!10
Have an AMD processor? You are  out of luck because the frames drop like crazy in most multiplayer servers.
it alright.
The most honest review from me
This game is great. One of the better shooters i have played. very real and the gamemodes i have played are very fun. if you are consdering buying this game then dont hesatie and get it today
eriously get this cause you get access to the Beta and Full Release as well and the price will go up when the Beta and Full come out so save money!10
is like Weed hard to start but later it's totaly rad dude.10
Hav't played much yet but this is a great game. From the begining I was very drawn in and this is definatly one of the games that's hard to tstop playing! 10/10
one of best game  8/10 +Good Grap +Good Mod's +Good main menu +Big Map +have A lot of weapon -Story mode -shooting
Most realistic military sim ever created. hands down my most favorite game in the world.
 any amount of  up :
his is the best easily accessible military sim out on the market. Its relativley easy to get into great fun with friends and the amount of mods made for it make the game have almost unlimited playing potential.   I love it. 10/1010
the walking dead
his game is a near exact representation of real combat on a battlefield. It depicts the thrill of aiming down the sights at your enemy knowing at any moment that another could be doing the same to you. And with the help of the community by producing new mods every day and the new release of 'Arma III: Apex' is sure to keep this game alive and healthy for months to come. So yes I do recommend this game to people who want a hardcore shooter/battle sim.10
great game but they hafto inprove the grapics a bit
someone stole my pants and i blew up my friend with an rpg 11/10 would bang IGN
Another great and fun game out there in the world...666/10 For some of the creepy mods on the workshop .&lt;
Ive been waiting over two years to purchase this game. I was able to create a pc that can handle this game. So far ive veen practicing in vr mode and boot camp. Im impressed with the resources available to new players from the community and from Bohemian. The gameplay and the tactics are all steeped in realism. It gives me fond memories of my time playing classic Ghost Recon from 2001. I would recommand this game for anyone that wants a realistic combat game. I look forward to getting better at the game so i can join live games and maybe find some good clans and groups online.
It has potential but definately is not there yet.
cool cool
Battlefield' for grown-ups = great stuff!
akes some time getting used to all the controls but it is really worth learning.  A lot of things to do and almost every day is different.10

awesome ijust need the money to get it back steam took all my games away that i bought
Better than DayZ
Gotta say this game just gotta whole lot better with this map :D another 1000+ hours here i come
ighly recommend this if not to play now for the future. Not as MANY bugs as expected but still quite a few (Luckily no game breaking ones as of yet). Great physic models for the bullet projectiles and great gameplay as of this far.10
jumps out of a hemmt going 2 kph flies out of back and dies 10/10 i believe i can fly 
great game im lovin it
he sequel to the hit big box seller arma 2 this one is set in the future where robots have developed human like voices but still can't hide the fact that their robots because their unable to jump and open doors incrementally.  you play as male protagonist #42 as you are providing democracy to a poor stink country full of greenbacks suddenly not iran invades and you engage on a mission of killing anything with dark brown complexion and facial hair forunately for you you came prepared you engage cpu mode and your frames drop down to 10-20 the iranians dont stand a chance with your slowing down of time and u kick their   then the bohemia arrives and begins splintering the game up into a 30 buck DLC that contains a new map and reskinned content but can't seem to fix the AI in close quarters or implement vehicles that tires dont break when running over chicken wire.   the bohemians plant a huge bomb that intends to steam authroization check the whole community fortunately the hero is an avid cs;go player and brought his defuse kit he then resolves the situation on altis and everyone goes back to playing altis life. unforunately for the hero he was surrounded by csat and tried to retreat to a helicopter.  when he went to enter it a DLC screen popped up asking him to buy the helicopter having no funds the hero dove to cover and began firing when he ran out of ammo he went to pickup an enemys weapon when a marksman dlc screen popped up asking him to pay now the last transmission from the hero was 'war has become a well oiled dlc machine.. dlc tagged helicopters carrying realism unit tagged soldiers with dlc tagged weapons.. war has changed'  it's made huge improvements since the beta but still is hard to play without mods dlc is encroaching on bohemias marketing model making it even harder to play with your friends everyone likes to play this to pretend their in the military since the only other gamemodes are dark rp and invisible weapon simulator the game requies the same type of stupid players that the 2nd one did unfortunately i fall under that category again  10/10  EnEmY! FasT MoVeR! 12 O' Clock! CLOSE!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3k8y88P9iw 11
Spent 2 hours crawling through a forest to have whole squad get killed by a single machine gun. -10/10
I had great fun with this game. Still enjoy it when playing with friends.  Thumbs up!
reat game if you're willing to follow the learning curve.10
 Best milsim game out there - Tons of mods in the steamworkshop makes the game more damn fun - Very challenging for those who likes to spray and pray in CS:GO - New experience with different mods ! - Get REKT   9/10 - YOU WONT REGRET IT !  Edit: Still enjoy getting rekd by freaking AI.10
Worth your time playing this game. Awesome graphics and good realistic gameplay. I r8 8/8 m8.
The most Epic War / Military Simulation game... can build various kinds of play-styles ... recommended to play with a big group of peope it can be very funny
his game has a familer feel to Garrys mod but with added realism.10
est ing game ever ! Modded or not after all this time cod is for kids BF4 is for teens adults play arma.10
This game will give you heartattacks when you put on x4 speed and get shot/blown up spontaneously in 2am 10/10 would not sleep again
I've never played a Arma game before part from this one now. All my hours have been playing the  mod Exile and it's been a great experience! Still loving it after 400 hours of game time
its is my favroit game in simulation military
 played this game for a little while. It's rather fun from what i've seen I guess...10
Great Game!  Large sandbox game allow me and all my friend to have a great time messing around with all the things inside this game.   :)
Really fun and realistic recommended!
Every single hour I have spent is for the map creator. Not even one round in Multiplayer. Still had fun. I must be a weird person.
One of those games you can have a few beers and still play alright. Once your in a team with decent people you find yourself stuck playing for hours on end having fun. A true pc game with epic visuals where a monster gpu will come in handy.
o. I got this Arma a couple of months ago. Since then my grades have plummeted my friends haven't heard from me and I'm sleeping when I'm not playing. This game is intensely fun. The fps is kind of  but it's still fun to play on KOTH servers and hear people yell at each other while you fly them to the objective. 9.99999999/10 only because once I reach lvl 10 in KOTH my progress resets. If you're thinking about getting it JUST DO IT!!10
his game is amazing! Lots of mods and different kind of servers.. you also will have problems with dsync everywhere.. but its a great game!10
 have been playing this game for about a week now and I really love it it is very frustrating and hard to get the hang of but once you do its an amazing game. If you have this game and do not like it I recommend playing it for at lease a week before you give up on it!10
So much to do in this game.
ts good just wish it ran better.  my life i hate being poor work 40-60 hours a week just to survive with very little 'fun' money inorder for me to purchase a new build would require me to save for the next 3 years 'did the math to have minimum requirments met' and by then BI would have put out ArmA 4 by then then i restart my never ending cycle of un-enjoyable saving for a decent CPU and motherboard and ram and graphics card and everything else. Its fun on low settings with the resolution scaled down to about the 75% mark world looks pretty plain with no vegitation and no shadows even then still get a lovely 10-18 FPS i hit 22 fps once... once.  Fun over all tho. Thanks BI for an enjoyable game. :)10
i love this game i am not really good at it but i really enjoy playing.  i recommend this game to anyone whos into mil sims or otherwise.  THE GAME MODELS THE F*CK%NG SPEED OF SOUND HOW ARE YOU STILL READING REVIEWS JUST BUY IT!!!
Survive...   Adapt...    Win.?
 would have not bought this game if not for the DayZ mod for Arma 2. I didn't really like Arma 2 all that much but  was much better in terms of gameplay and mechanics.  That said this is the anti call of duty anti battlefield anti arcade fps. This is a very difficult game. It's hard to shoot things from more than 200-300 meters you'll not be on full auto ever (maybe room clearing with a heavy machine gun haha bratatatatatatatatatatatat). This is basically single well placed shots. If you've ever fired a firearm pistol rifle of any sort and tried to hit something at 100m out in a standing position you'll know what I mean. Even on a knee it's hard. Prone is by far the easiest as there is far less sway in your aim and of course breathing. Anyway alot of that carries over to . 50m targets are fairly easy 100m + targets start to become troublesome but not too bad once you get used to leading the target just a bit if they are moving or running. We're talking bullet drop velocity and all those factors. A stiff breeze will throw off your shot (more so for sniping) so it's a good idea to watch the trees for the breeze. Seriously it's more for sniping but long guns still get affected at larger distances (100m+ but really affects 1000m or more).   I love  - for ravage exile and all the dayz type of mods.  itself? It's cool I guess. Campaign is fun hard as hell. That's not where this game shines.  This game shines because of the mods if it wasn't for that this game would be DEAD DEAD DEAD. Hell I don't even think  would be out if it wasn't for Arma 2 and it's DayZ mod. That alone sky rocketed sales for the Arma series and brought to light the game.   If you are looking for a single player version of DayZ - then you should pick up the ravage mod. It is fantastic. There is also Exile which is online multiplayer very similar to DayZ as well.   Plus there are just a ton of Scenarios to play in  itself things like assasinations ambush convoys helicopter attacks tanks......it's endless.  This game has endless replay value after you finish the campaign (or just ignore the campaign but I think going through the campaign really teaches you the mechanics of the game and makes playing the mods easier).   tl;dr  ITS GREAT. Mmmk?10
I love the game but stop updating it when I want to play the game
I only played it for a few hours. It was alright...   10/10 would let a few hours turn into months again.
Desync simulator 2k(insert year arma came out here)
RMA are the living proof why games like Battlefield are piece of ing turd !!  you shoot an rpg at someone= they dont die you throw a grenade 5 feet away from somone=they dont die you shoot at some from your tank= the shell explodes right next to them and they dont die you shoot from a ing ac 130 the bomb explodes right next to the enemy AND THEY STILL DONT ING DIE!!  DICE!  BATTLEFIELD THEIR BALANCE OVER REALISM CAN SUCK MY ING !!  ARMA IS WHAT SAVED ME FROM THAT BS UNREALISTIC MAINSTREAM SHOOTER CANCER!!10
Dont buy this if you dont have a decent computer. I love my 10 fps in multiplayer!
ake ARMA Great Again! The big variety of this game is insane. The game might seem like a typical simulator BUT the MODS are even insaner ... The community is big and very helpful!  I would waste 1000 hours again on this game! Totally recommended!10
is a great game when it ing works sort your  out Bohemia10
reat game REAL men play Arma. Uninstall CoD and CS:GO and play this.10
This is the best military simulator I have ever played...
I Larrrv It!!! :)
just beat the campaign. its good
Best military simulator out there.
1000 hours played... that says it all.
Good Army Simulator For The HardCore Gamer.... But Also A Great Game For Noobs!!! 9/10
Fun game. Ive only been playing the coop mode lately.
t's not bad might play again I guess...10
e joined an altis life server got together picked peaches thought about making more money went to collect some weed crashed our car got some weed walked 4 kilometers in the dark while it was raining made it to a gas station because we were starving and dehydrated most wanted man in the land walks in on us (he has a rifle and gillie suit) theres three of us only two of us have pistols we all 4 stood there yelling at each other to not move and not shoot we made it out alive and we hear him break into the cash register we run to the drug dealer to sell our weed cant find the dealer some random guy shows up and tazes us and zipties us he lets us go almost dead we limp down the road for about 1 kilometer trying to make it to the nearest gas station then carl appears in his car and he picks us up and takes us to the gas station we eat drink heal and resupply make it back to the city. 9/11 would get in carl's car again.11
Single player is really weak and boring. Multiplayer is not fun for me. I need to keep playing to hopefully find a mode I like. It took me a long time to learn how to enjoy Arma2 and I think this will be the same. I have had it for years but haven't found the motivation to do that yet. Also the clouds are bugged and look really weird and they never fixed it in about 3 years.
un Interactive Exciting. Overall best game out there today.11
Do it. Do it now.
f you enjoy bugs glitches and dying from 1ft drops you'll love .11
 know it's a great game.. but it's unplayable for me. oh god it's optimized so poorly and I wanted to enjoy it so badly. both cpu and gpu didn't have spikes above 60% utilization.. ( 1070 oc and 6600k oc ) And yes I've read forums on how to optimize but it barely helped.. the drops are just too massive..-10
ool simulator of hostilities. Every moment gets better - making updates add new equipment weapons etc.10
layed thousands of hour arma 2 co  and few hours  its a good game i woud recommed  for sure bud seems to be lacking something time period just doesnt grab me as much as equipment in arma 2 i woud recommend you get arma 2 over this one and once you play the damn out of it  grab yourself  you wont miss anything that way.  and i dont recommend this game from survival /zombie standpoint.Get it for military simualtion that it is.There are better survival/rpg what ever games in that category.10
 bit janky to get used to but once you get into it it's pretty in sweet. I've spent a ton of time in the editor just playing with different scenarios because there's so much you can do with it.10
Addicting game
Owe yea..........Vote the 
f you like awful AI Ai that can shoot you through tree's rocks planes. And well everything if you love not being able to see who you were shot from and then not being able to complete a mission because the AI have ran off and you can't find them get this game. 10/10 for bad AI. Like seriously games that costs £2 have better AI than this. Simulator my . Would recommend for the fact the only decent part about this game is the multiplayer- except well you have to get mods to play half of the servers then the mods you get are outdated or modified on the server making it hard to get on said server. Will recommend when the developers actually take their time to make the game well playable. Don't get Apex if you have read this comment as it is literally are searching simulator find the guy that shot you so you can finish the mission simulator is more accurate. OH and btw the AI have a 90% chance of a headshot on you making them kill you instanstly almost everytime. Especially annoying when ARma decided to put a death limit on the missions...-10
really good game but if you have played cod or cs you might use some time to get used to the controllers :D
t seems that nobody can get a solid 60fps in this game.  Great game but please optimize it.10
reat game much quality.10
No jump button. Stops trickshotters.  11/10
he best army simulater out there.  Give you many differnt choises to kill someone weather it be a heliplanetank or by gun its still fun. You can play this for hours. One thing i reccomend is that you play on a wasteland server. Save up and get yourself a tank noob before you die!10
his game is amazing. Ive been playing  for a while now. I didnt want to write a review until I reached over 1k hours. The game itself is fantastic. There is so much to do you cant really experience all of it. The only downside is the optimization. But seeing as i get around 40-50 FPS in cities (mostly because my rig can handle it) it doesnt really bother me. Now if you're gaming on the lower end of PC's youll run into a bit of issues (crashes freezes lag FPS drop...etc). I'd recommend this game to players who are serious and as passionate as I am towards gaming simulation and community.   I also tried a few mods here and there. All were great and work amazing with the game. If you're on the line about buying this game BUY IT. I havent regretted it ever since. Hope this helps.10
reat game if you enjoy realistic military simulator or RP this is the game for you great mods great servers  10
ll get into the fps and system specs first then the graphics gameplay and my opinion on the game. The game's fps drasticly changes depending on what server and if you're using any mods and the action that's going on in your server my game usually runs from around 20 to 70 fps. The 20fps can happen if there's alot of action around with explosions vehicles driving around helicopters and jets flying. This is the performance i have on: Intel i3-6100 @3.70Ghz(4cpus) 8GB RAM Geforce GTX 750ti MSI B150 gaming M3 motherboard. I get that fps on kind of medium-high graphics i have some settings on ultra but some on low. I've found that to work for me the best. The game overall looks beutifull depending on the map and server render distance limitations. The gameplay is highly customizable litteraly you can make any mission and find mods for any type of situation you want to play or any kind of operation you want to do though this needs a good editor or editing team. The game is great especially with mods the base game after around 200 hours seems very plain and has nothing new to offer the dlc isnt good the dev's dont make the dlc and new updates compactible with mods and thus making problems for highly modded servers the game itself with mods is playable very long friends to play with is a bonus and deffinetly makes everything more fun and interesting but its not a necesity you can play solo too though it will deffinetly get boring faster than with friends. I recommend everyone to try this but dont purchase the dlc's they're not worth it if you are sure that you will use them and/or need them only then purchase them becuse the updates of the game are free only some useless content which the dlc add's that could be aquired via mods months before.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ As of October 2016 i can barely reccomend this game due to the actions of its developer apex dlc which they released at the price of 30Euro is very much the most overpriced dlc i've ever seen it does not offer content for the price that it asks 21/10/16 Just saw that they're releasing 5 more dlc's in 2017 1 of them will be free which dosent matter becuse it probably will be . Jets Dlc 'Orange' Dlc Malden 'free' dlc tac-ops Dlc Tanks Dlc  i cannot express how bad this is instead of updating the game with fixes and optimization updates they create dlc similiar to Payday 2's developer - Overkill which is very bad if it does go down to the point where dlc's are more than the base game itself can offer it will become a pay to play game similiar to World of warcraft or skyrim online where you need to pay every month to play surely you wont need to pay every month but the dlc seemingly will fall into your lap and ask you to buy them bassicly vets of arma 2 and now  players will feel the need to buy these becuse of the simple fact that the previous dlc didnt offer as much as it should bassicly resulting in an endless DLC spam from the devs instead of updating and adding content to the base game. If you do not have the dlc you will be recieving  ad's all around the game you payed allready for for example driving in any other seat than driver seat in any apex vehicle or using any apex gear such as the re-skinned vests or uniforms. Also commenting this fact on the roadmap announcment in steam i was banned for 5 days and my comment was deleted even though the game is rated 16+ and rated with bad lenguage so i dont understand what the  is up with this bias that the devs are trying to make out of . Its sad i really enjoyed arma 2 with barely any dlc if these dlc's result in me not being able to fully enjoy this game the dlc will come but ill go.-10
Its like fallout with swords
bsolutely love this game. Didn't think that I would like the complexities but it means that I'm learning how to do new things everytime I play which makes me love the game even more.10
I'm here to prove 20 fps is playable
 Awesome game awesome gameplay Poor fps but if running on a good cpu it can be ignored Most realistic shooter out there Has still so much potential to be revealed And the community servers are grear 85/10 10
for as buggy as ir is...its just damn fun
fun game i loved playing it but i cant run it anymore :/ still pretty fun
Amazing game that lets the user decide how to play.
rma is just a unique experience you won't get in any other shooter my personal favorite mode is invade &amp; annex and if you love hardcore realistic tactical action Arma is the game for you10
HIS GAME IS  DONT BUY IT10
ove it gets boring aftr 250 hours but mods make so you can play for ever. 1 of best games .  I HAVE 1600 hours ON THE GAME. LOVE IT .10
ay 1 of  Altis Life: - Gets Arma  - Joins Altis life server  - runs around for a while looking for things to buy  - buys wetsuit and goggles and runs around with other random people  - random people notice me  - gets called a n***a then put at gun point  - cops roll past  - shots were fired  - cops die  - I get captured and offered to some sort of satainic cult  - cops show up again and storm the building  - cultists die  - cops finish the ritual anyway  - I die  - there is no day 2  10/10 best game ever would play again10
e and my friend fly the Wipeouts and especially think they should change the name of the missle ASRAAM We all know why... DOWNSIDE OF : NPC are way to over powered they shoot you out of jets going 500 kph they can take a bullet and some how no scope you otherwise it gives you a challenge. 11/10 Would play arma again10
its a quite fancy game. it tickles my pickle. i like that. mmmmmm... i just nut in my pants.
he mechanics are not perfect simulated but i  every time i see it gun on gun off reload anything it is an awesome game with endless posibilities such as the life mods  11/1010
One of the best military style game i have played yet.
amazing game. i usualy play the altis life server which is an absolute great server. so many mods and different ways to play.
ne of the best games out there. The replayability of this game is insane and the customization makes this one of my all time favorites10
10/10 With mods ;)
not what it is made out to be. i bought it and the dlc's (execting a very god game what i got was crap.)
10 out of 10 Would find a csat mortar inside of a house again    http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/288601701268396736/A41B5AC3263731DACA33DD5DDAA5986D3BD50261/
ith almost 2000 hours I really recommend this game to those that enjoy there hard military sim games as this has it. But it doesn't just have that it and has many features within it like KOTH life servers and many moded gamemodes. Really worth it.10
For a person who likes simulators of war. This is one of the best. Not like blackopps where you run and die.
he Good: ArmA III is one of my favorite additions to the ArmA franchise besides of course ArmA II back in the day of the DayZ mod. ArmA (Armed Assault?) is an excellent first/third person military simulator and while the events displayed in ArmA III's original campaign and the Apex campaign are not actual the extensive multiplayer makes up for that. From roleplaying with Altis Life to all out Battlefield-style team-deathmatch in King of The Hill to even Hunger Games-esque Battle Royale gamemodes ArmA probably competes with Garry's Mod for it's diversity of online communities and game modes. Besides that after several patches ArmA has become one of the most realistic military simulators with excellent guns vehicles combat and strategy.  The Bad: The gunplay in this game while at time can be good I found to be usually terrible. Because of server lag (not Bohemia's fault) online gunplay has become as twitch-shootery as Call of Duty while typically the person first to see the other the one to emerge victorious. The one balancing aspect I've noticed is that the caliburs of the weapons. Generally in straight gunplay where both players start firing at the same time a 6.5mm will always beat a 5.56mm same with the 7.62 versus the 6.5mm. The movement (without mods) is also pretty bad in the game it feels extremely clunky and robotic. Sadly you can't expect much as it's a simulator game.  The Ugly: You need a pretty good computer to even be able to decently run this game which is sad considering how many people can't afford a decent enough rig to run this wonderful game.  Overall: The multiplayer is one of the most fun online experiences I've had in ages and it had me addicted for hours a day!  Score: 8.5/10  UPDATE 11/27/16: Nominated this for the 'Five More Minutes' game award on Steam. :)10
is a military simulation game released September 12 2013. Even though it was release a few years ago it's community stays strong and updates are persistant.   Gameplay  has amazing gamplay and smooth movements with VERY little lag. The game can seem somewhat complex when and if youre new to the game but when you get used to it movement mechanics and such are fairly simple. For example I thought that helicopter control and the 15 stances it offers would be difficult to operate I was wrong. Bullet drop windspeed and occasionally ricochete can play a big part in the games realism. The fact that you can move your head independantly from your body is very impressive in my opinion. Coming with this is an amazing third person feature useful for peeking around corners and over things. So unlike some fps games (there are more than i'd like there to be) you are more than just a pair of floating arms and a gun instead you have a full body with multiple stances to maximise cover and concealment.  Single player The game also features an emersive campaign that    makes you feel very helpless at multiple times such as making your way to Lacey on Stratis    . You can also make your own missions and situations in the scenario editor that you can post to the workshop. Making your own levels and just playing around can really up replayability.  Multiplayer  has many gamemodes to fit different players my favourite being Wasteland. The amount of vehicles and different weapons and clothing keeps it fresh and adds more variety to the game. You can meet some very nice people in servers allowing up to 128 players to join at the same time.   I would definetely recommend this game to everybody but I would wait for it to go on sale.  Thanks!10
Great game overall. Framerates could be better online but other than that I cant really say anything bad about the game. 10/10
It's just a dank meme isn't it
200 hours and i still dont know what im doing
t's walking simulator waiting simulator and a laxative all in one!10
lthought the community isnt that large its an amazing game i enjoy it yet it lacks game modes... 9.6/1010
his game make look call of duty and battlefield like games for little kids. The physics of every aspec in the game is incredible if you are a player of fast shooters forget all you know work team is crucial run like run like headless chicken is lethal for your team This game is over planification and execution are important objectives here10
This game is a nice openworld game with good roleplay ... lol
Best walking simulator so far
mazing 9/10 if you like military shooters this is the game for you you can play by yourself or with friends on multiple different gamemodes if you want to take a sep back from the action you can try some role-playing. Or if you want to hop onto some zombie apocolyspe survival action you can do that also. if you have the money for it try it out!10
ol some idiot bought me this game its pretty ok i guess11
EL This game FPS 2 good on amd CPU's 2 bad I have an Intel :(11
 Life is full of screaming 12 year olds that RDM 10/10
THIS GAME IS THE ING BEST
reat game poorly optimized.-10
The learning curve in this game comes from learning what will kill you that shouldn't. Have fun.
good game but needs optimisation
After playing more then 360+ hours i can say.  Wow.
noptimized clunky slow and very slow to update. The modding community is great but this game runs terribly.-10
Ok game but no servers to play the game only rpg servers
great game. definitely need to drag some friends along or make some new ones on it quick otherwise it can get quite boring though.
this game is the best it is so fun to play rp and king on the hill the jobs are good as will if i was you i will bye this games
10/10 IGN would play again
Really nice game and a noice military simulation.
wesome game with amazing detail and potential. If you are going to get this game i recommend looking into the different workshop addons you can download for this my favorite being battle royale. Huge open world survival maps. The dlc is okay but not really needed to be honest. the base game is fun and amazing enough as it is.10
 This is the most realistic shooter game I have ever played. This game is very strategic and so much more than a shooter. You actually have to read your bearings on a compass just to tell your friends where you got sniped from. This isn't like any call of duty where you simply run around shooting and flying. This game makes you run/drive/fly to your destination and any of those options are dangerous and/or hard to do. This game is amazing and has a 10/10 for realism. Granted my friend bought me this game so I didn't have to pay for it but I still feel like it is worth the buy. The DLC may be a bit too pricy but other than that there are no negatives to this game. Give it a go.10
This games is awesome! Havn't had this much fun with PC gaming in awhile.
unning Simulator that needs three Titan Xs to run properly with some of the best mods ever created. The community ISN'T a bunch of 10 year old tumors because MUH REALISM. Tactical armchair mercenaries that have over 300 confirmed kills will love this game. Physics and sounds that will make your face tattoo melt right off your face and then melt your face.10
 This game is awesome Perfect for the ARMY die hard fans out their looking to have some fun!10
his military-stimulator game is really fun.It's quite realistic as it involves military tactics and allows you to see how situations can be resolved in different scenariosit's also futuristic when it comes to the weapons and the vehicles (I'm talking about Apex DLC) this game is really a choice to be recommended to everybody :D (Sorry if there's any mistakes in my review English is really killing me sometimes)10
I've only played it for a few minuets..(lol) i really dont play much else. very good game! extrmely long learning curve if you're new to arma in any way.. bye bye COD &amp; MWF.
est Multiplayer Shooter Ever.  If you like DayZ and like the feel of Battlefield or something. GET THIS GAME. The Multiplayer has MASSIVE maps with amazing combat and realistic systems. Good simulator. Buy it now! Definetly worth your money!   P.S. DONT EXPECT TO GET GOOD INSTANTLY... It takes some time... I can tell...10
ruh just bought this game and it goes 50% off next day...  buy it tho11
battle royale is the best! very good mod. (the game is ok too :P ).
t's great if your computer is. 10/10 would play again11
ery realistic gaming engine. don't go running around straight away. hide hide hide!10
o I would have played more hours on this but college gets in the way and at the moment i'm installing about 30gb of mods... But WOW this game is beautiful is every way. How it plays how it looks and the realism of how the ARMA games are.  11/10 If you want an Army shooter which is in depth and where you need to use tactics then this and the first 2 are worth it. Plus the DLC is amazing it's not like in Call of Duty where it adds a couple new maps it adds missions planes heli and many more stuff would recommend this to anyone!10
1300 hours. I guess it's okay.
Really fun game for people that liket military games. There are tons of guns and uniforms. I play on co-op servers and can play for hours at a time. The biggest downside is that the game takes a beast of a computer to play.
 Review     is an excellent game and the apex pack is amazing. Arma creaters i hope you make a new arma arma 4 or arma combined arms or something like that because i would definitly buy it. This game is my recommendation to all of you. This is a must have game
reat game between all the mods and normal stuff on top of that the game can be a little dull and you need to have moderate patients most of the time but its great anyway!!!!10
ve been a player of the Operation Flashpoint and ArmA series for a long time now.   Positives:   - Game is limitless with the amount of external content being created.  - Nearly photo realistic.   - Most Realistic Consumer FPS.   - Supportive Community.  Negatives:   - FPS issues even with high end computers.  - The base game content isn't enough to last the user a long time.   Although there are some frame stutters and I constantly have to update mods I download for this game the positives of this game out way any negatives for me.   Specs:  CPU: i7 4790K OC 4.4 GHz GPU: GTX 1070 RAM: 8GB DDR3 2133 Mhz Installed on SSD.   10
Fun game with mods n stuff hope you have as much fun on this game as i did. PS - dontt play with scrubs
Good game. Fantastic graphics. I recrommend not to use it on Mac. Multiplayer does not work however Singleplayer does.
One of the Best game i have ever played
Best real combat simulation ever! You have to try this!
ne of the best damn games I've ever played I love the military simulator types and this one beats them all hands down 10
A good military sim
Best Military Sim of all time.  This game does take some time to get use too. U will also want a intel processor.
wow this gamw is just the best
our 1: Join a game only to get kicked assumed it was due to using my gamer name rather than a fake soldier name. Rejoin again with fixed name get kicked. K. Hour 2: Join a City Life server and get robbed when first spawning in. Hour 3. Join a rebel gang and hold Checkpoint Alpha in Altis ransom kill guys. Hour 4. Joined a gang consisting entirely of stereotype rednecks and 1 squeaker. Ok. Hour 5. Try to actually fly a helicopter fail miserably and leave a crater to remind myself of failure. Hour 6. Hold guy at gunpoint tell him to have a lovely day turned self in to police. Hour 7. Become crime-loving shitheel.  Went from upstanding citizen willing to join the cause to criminal. Thanks Arma.10
is a very naic yes
The only true military simulator! &lt;3
420/420
I dont reall like this gamei havve a exelent computer i got this game fo $20 and i hate it
Nominated for 'Best use of a Farm Animal' 10/10 would shoot goats again.
ohemia Interactive is amazing! Even though their games tend to have bugs they have the coolest community approach and the coolest people. I really want to support them by bying their games and show that they are doing a good job! :)10
awesome game if your into military stuff
-Plays King Of The Hill -Pilot tries landing in AO and blows up -New pilot lets us para jump into AO -Gets shot while parachuting. -Gets revived -Gun disappears in classic Arma fashion -11/10 would play again
reat game realistic military warfare simulator. Would recommend a server like  ahoyworld.net  and can also provide a near to realistic civilian simulator.  10/10 great game deserves more than it has10
The buggiest poor man's version of Battlefield. Love it.
Probably one of the best games I have ever played I made some really good friends from playing this game am now apart of a Military simulation group and we go on ops every sunday XD only downside is this game un-Installed its self and now i gotta re-install it..... meh its worth it thumbs up from me.
Best d@#! shooter this side of the Rio Grande
his game ran at 5fps a lot on my computer. My computer sucks. In the 60ish hours I managed to log in this gameI made a hell of a lot of missions in editorakin to my A2 experience. If you played A2this game feels more fluidtheres more commandsand I honestly have no qualms about the pseudo futuristic things people complain about. It's still got a sense of realism despite the near future setting. Something else I absolutely loved was as I said my my OA review mods. Arma3 even has a workshop with Steamsomething A2 doesn't. One can have fun with the CUP projectas it happensit isn't just another requirementbecause let's be honesteveryone gets CUP because of the dependencieshaha. But one must also realizethey can essentially mess about in Chernarus all over againwith units new and old and a better look than stoicdreary A2 Chernarus. Hellman I discovered Sahrani thanks to that. Also splendid camera is absolutely great. It really helps if you're a screenie takeras it freezes a moment and you can capture it. It's just greatits a great game. Get it. Like nowgo mug a person on the street for the money and buy . One can even enjoy it on a bare bones minimum requirement rig. GET .10

Apex is definitely a DLC worth .buying
A great game that you should definately buy if you do not own it yet. It's very addictive.
 I first got into the ARMA series with ArmA 2 + OP Arrowhead back in middle school mostly for the wide range of features then when  Alpha launched one of my pals gifted me the game and we proceeded to  around. I've picked up the DLC Bundle and Apex and I must say this game does not dissappoint. Albeit the DLC Bundle seems to be lacking content for the price. But this game is great for both dicking around and serious gameplay.10
own own anymore feelsbadman10
ood game but Bohemia needs a couple lessons about optimizing. I've been playing this game with SLI 780's about 350 hours now I upgraded my cards to SLI 1080 to play this game on a high FPS 1440p. NOPE. I got a slideshow. My FPS is around 15-30.   When the game runs smoothly it must be one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.  5/5 (SLI 780's 1080p@60fps) 1/5 (SLI 1080's 1440p@20fps) 5/5 (SLI 1080's slideshow - only if you got the right attitude)  10
git gud game rite now
So many modes with so many mods endless gameplay and hours
Amazing game its a 18/20 there is some bugs / glitches ect but amazing i love it and its so realistic
he game is great and has so many different game modes. One game mode is altis life which most of you have heard of. Another game mode is King of the Hill where you fight against 2 other teams for a sector on the map. My personal favorite game mode is Wasteland. For Wasteland you will have to download a few mods but it is very much worth it. In Wasteland you have to fight to survive while others try and kill you. You can make a team with others but watch out for other teams. I don't have as much time on this than some people but the game is very much so worth the price. When people hear about this game they always hear about how bad the FPS is. My PC isn't high end at all and I can run at max settings with 25+ fps in cities. Most computers will be able to play this game just check the requierments.10
this game im so good i love it
ne of the few games that costs quite a bit is years old...and still worth it. No game competes with it.10
It's probably the most realistic military shooter so far. And it's damn fun.
best ing game i will ever play
uy it now NO dont wait.....now10
 have no idea why its letting me review this game even though i do not own it. Wish i did though.10
 very broken game. A very rigid game where sh*t just isnt dynamic and fluent. Developers seem to develop wrong things new maps weapons etc but stairs still kill you and clipping through walls is just another day in the office. Truth is stairs rocks and other ambient stuff is sometimes more dangerous than a Blackfoot. But I remember when even windows didnt break and reloading sound echoed all the way to the other side of stratis. So there is lots of progress. And its graphically beautiful. Nothing better than a pawnee using its gatling guns and rockets at night ripping through 12 people in KOTH. And ofc lots of funny moments and tense gameplay. 10/10 would buy it again in alpha version again. Its a love hate relationship here. This game is a must be for mil-sim fans. Love it.Hate it.11
ent to Altis Life. Collected peaches sold them. Bought a truck filled the truck with peaches sold them. Made a million out of it. Bought a set of licensed guns. Invited people over to the Peach Kingdom to 'do jobs'. Knocked them unconcious cuffed them. Realized I don't have the required item to cut off their kidneys. Went back to the center to get some. Got the guy's kidneys then executed him. Came back home served my family a dinner.  By the way Arma looks like a good game I'd recommend you purchase it11
his game is very fun and extremely addictive but it does require a fairly high-end PC to play on the better quality and is very graphics intensive but it compensates for this with excessive creation possibilities using the Eden Mission Editor in game and the modding community is amazing and will provide just about anything that you want if it isn't already in the game.11
he most realiztic shooter Ive played. It is very well done and very tactical. Only down side for me is there isa 3rd person view option10
his game is the best game ever you can even make your own missions and share to the world i made 2   you can engage in tactical combat with a group of strangers or with friends when i say tactical i mean it  if you can get your head around the keys on the keyboard which takes a while.  i once stripped down to my underpants in this game and pretended to be dead in middle of the street and a group of guys wondered past me then i picked my gun up and blasted them all hahaha killed by a underpants man lol they even looked at me to see if i was dead its simply amazing10
buys game in the steam summer sale*  okay so this is the story of my king of the hill adventure.  gather my little nyes  So the first game mode I played when I bought this game was king of the hill and I knew I had lag problems. The first thing I do is see a heli and sprint to it so I could fly it. A bunch of guys in there 30's getting in and then I had a full heli. I take off (not knowing what to do at all) I manage to get it flying and I head towards the capture zone and I got too low to the ground and smacked into a telephone poll and some how the heli survives and all the 30-year-olds are like good job on that landing  then I reply saying 'idk how I did that I literally have no idea what I'm doing I just bought the game'. So for some reason people kept on getting in my heli and I got better at flying and got the nick name the Nye Airlines (my name at the time in arma was just Bill Nye) and to this day forward the nye airlines lives on.   doggo/10 would fly a heli into a pole again11
is the most fun experience I have ever had on steam since I got it there is so much to do and so much depth to the game there are even specific buttons to check the time check the compass stand in different stances formation etc. As well as that there is the great community and online servers like altis life and battle royale which I would highly recommend checking out. It's a great game and very beautiful. The only thing I would advise you on is check to see if you have the spec requirements. 10
ts g but a bunch of people who own the few AUS servers are  and ban u permently for minor things such as calling them ing  and cry baby wits etc.10
ay better than Battlefield 3 and Arma 2. It plays smooth it feels right.  Just. ing. Awesome.10
THe fact that use Battleeye like a anticheats engine is enogh to give a bad rating !
its 
Probably download a new mod every 1-2 days
Buy this game.
You cant play alot of the survers if you dont have all DLCs and with the game it costs more than 100 Dollers.
est game ever.  It has a realistic shooting enviroment and on higher tier graphics it looks great! 10
is a videogame that can be a simulator.  The engine is really old though and it can't handle everything. Sure it looks good but it is kinda old.-10
Pros  + Tactical gameplay + Very good ballistics + Big maps + Very realistic + Fun depending on the gamemode  Cons  - Even with a good gaming rig you will still see that 30fps in some mods - Slow gamplay at times - Controls hard to master - Quadbike (and everything else) instantly explodes when you hit a small rock   Other that that i would recommend  to anyone the heaps of mods to keep you busy through many hours of play time. My personal favourite mods are King of the Hill and Exile.  10/10 IGN
onestly this game hasn't let me down! I've constantly been  CS:GO and LoL everyday and out of all of the games  hasn't let me down. I've even purchased Apex that I was SUPER afraid would let me down and since the price is so high (around $30) It was even more frightening but I bought it because I was tired of the same old Altis and honestly it's so much better... When I got in it looked so much more beautiful and I can't believe it didn't dsync like I thought it would... Obviously it dsynced but I'll tell you what It's still the best game I've ever played!!! #TanoaLife10
this game is the bomb
GG well played
A very great game full of content
 don't get why theres so many good reviews for this game. Yes its fun but its so unfinished in terms of realism yes you can say this game is as realistic as it gets and its difficult but giving AI unforgiving aim and reaction time isn't realism people. This games idea is a gemstone but they chipped away it and cut corners while making this one they actually just didnt even work hard the Flow of the game is just dull and the physics are god awful cars get stuck on fences helicopter blades fly off when you hit a tent you get stuck in floor for vaulting? Its just so hard to play with the game mechanics just being unfinished. Its fun to play with friends but when it falls to the Milsim portion you just cant. Specially trained soldier? cant run 20 meters without breathing your entire lung capacity. Need to snipe some taliban? Oh heres no bipod. Driving 120kms an hour? here hit a bush and explode Its just so hard to play with this broken engine. Go Back to ARMA 2.-10
got quite drunk and decided that MP would be good fun  -find server and join  -selects 'Sunnyvale' as a good spawnpoint (if anyone has watched Housos they will know the name)  - spawns in -is immediately approached by two players one kindly asking if i was able to give him my kidney.  -asks why organ is needed. player 1 indicates that player 2 needs it for a 'transplant'  - asks what i will get in return am told 'ah yeah you'll get a couple of chocco milks and a goonsack'  -agrees to this deal. am thonged over the head - wakes up to find kidney missing and goonsack and choco milks in backpack.   100/10 will play multiplayer drunk again.  10
ad a lot of fun playing this but the engine makes it run like poop10
t has issues. It would be the best thing in the world if there wasn't bits missing like japanese porn.11
 wouldn't exactly say this game is 'fun' but it's very captivating. Tons of content. Great visuals. Especially enjoyable with friends. Don't forget the workshop add-ons and mods.10
Would put another 1000 hours into this game.
*Buys High-End PC to play * *Gets 30 FPS* nuff said
bsolutely love this game. Wasteland King of the Hill love it all. Worth your money.10
est survival fps/3rd person game i have tryed so far  many mods you can load and play = more fun! For new players like myself controls are kinda messed up but if you ever played dayz you will find your way easyer. Maps are beautifull also wather sits good on the enviroment. Many guns many scopeslasersnight vision and more also vechicles are awsome if you like driving cars helicopters and more this game maybe is for you especially on survival-battleroyale . I totally reccomend this game even if i have 19hs atm i give it 10/10 if you are a fun of survival pvp games  gunfights and 3rd person shooting this is for you !10
his game is pretty great but it also sucks. The campaign is amazing but the ai needs tweaking and some mission are legit impossible with the gear you have (only one or two tho). Multi-player is great too but to play well you need at least apex.10
Really great game with a lot of content to play with!
i haven't played enough to really give it a fair review but it feels great this far..
is probably the closest to a military game I've wanted. It has some futuristic themes without going outrageous yet has the simulation to make it more challenging. I played and greatly enjoyed the Operation Flashpoint games Dragon Rising and Red River but felt they had too much of a mainstream Call of Duty-esque to them. Especially Red River. While  has a decent storyline the character development isn't there. The main character has little to grow on and other characters while ok could use some more backstory. Probably the most interesting is SSG Adams.   Weapon usage ballistics and sounds have improved since first released. And it's all welcomed to me. Originally broken up into 3 parts the latest patch makes it all one long story. I love the first and second parts 'Survive' and 'Win' respectively. Though they are shorter than 'Adapt.' Win being the shortest with fewer 'cut scenes' than the others. But with the extensive open world multitude of showcases and huge multiplayer (which I have not experienced) it has more content than most games come with in an entire DLC season pass. BI has done an awesome job and didn't just give up on it. I highly recommend this came to anyone!10
Pretty good aye
So many options and varients
he golden standard of milsim with bonus poor optimization.10
Good game with mods like Arma3life but very laggy and people always calls me a fetus and shouts On the floor to be honest and then i gte robbed
y experience 1. Bought the game 2. Play takistan life 3. get that dank cash. 4. get a gun. 5.0 succesfully kill 10 cops. 420. fall 1 metre off a stair case and die.  Do it again? absolutely.11
I have a 980 and can barely get 30fps on high this game is extremely unoptimized
roken Single Player Might Be Good Fun as a MilSim with a Group ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately while the concept is generally solid the game fundamentally doesn't work at a basic level. Trying to spot let alone shoot targets that are just a pixel or two across doesn't make for entertaining gameplay. Is that slightly lighter green pixel an enemy soldier or just a rendering quirk?  This is made worse by the poor adaptation of the weapons and sighting which simply does not resemble real life. In game at 100m the dot on the scope is the same size as a targets head. IRL I've shot (dummy) targets out to 600m using iron sights and 4x scopes. At 100m you should be picking out which eyeball you want the round to go through.  Further more the single player game is simply broken. NPCs automatically track you and can see and shoot through objects and foliage*. This makes those infiltration scenarios a waste of disk space. In fact since one of the basic pillars of the game is supposed to be finding good cover pretty much all the missions are pointless. The campaign is  the showcases are the worst and the VR training room is so totally lame that I actually felt like I was playing WoW again.  Finally a kart racing addon for a MilSim are you serious? Obviously Bohemia is not.  If you're buying the game to play online with a group either coop or PvP then this may suit you but in that case you probably didn't need this review.  ----- * Yes I am aware that rounds can penetrate cover I'm talking about rocks and HESCO.-10
ow im playing arma for a couple of days and there are many thing that anoyed me :  1. quads are nothing much more than offroads ...just smaller. quads have no problem with rolling over 5-10 cm high rock pills. seriously  i crash and suffer damage from micro stone walls on the fields that are not bigger than 10cm.   2. when i bought the game i was so ing happy to install it on my new computer( wich i specially bought to play arma3) and was dissapointed. System: AMD FX-4300 Quad core processor (3.8GHZ) Nvidia Geforce GT 730 4GB Palit 16 GB RAM  that is way more than what is required . still i get only max 30 FPS on almost everything LOW and distance of 1100m. there are games developed by LOW LOW LOW LOW LOW end studios like Mortal Online from Star vault( only about 10-15 devs if im right) wich runs VERY much better but has higher requirements plus the game is Free. everything i leaned of bohemia is  that they just create bad optimized games for big prices . i can even run battlefield 4 on this computer on medium-High   3. i never thought about that bohemia became THAT corrupt to put standart weapons like AKU AKM ect. into a DLC that is about !!!30!!! euros. the DLC APEX includes some interesting new vehicles and clothes  but since ive seen so many weapons wich are these days NOTHING SPECIAL i decided to not buy the DLC .  4. RPG and Altis Life literally destroyed . there are TOOONS of RPG and altis life servers  wich have NOTHING to do with a combat simulation and sooo less game modes like CTI wich HAVE something to do with arma that arma is besides all the other crap nothing more than a expensive GTA San andreas Multiplayer clone.   in Short : a expensive GTA SA:MP game made without any love bad optimized that will go very very many times on ur nerves with some adverts while u snipe or play just because u bought a gun from a DLC with ur last money without knowing it . when u are looking for a combat simulation  go buy counterstrike but dont buy arma3 -11
awesome admersive game play of miliitary combat
Best and most realistic military game there is! Go !
Really good game to play with friends. I havent put a lot of hours into it but the hours i have put in i have really enjoyed
ros: -Beautiful graphics -Open world giant map -Massive MILSIM immersion -Large Variety of stuff  vehicles  weapons  MODS gamemodes  player stances ( this one i've never saw in any game)  Cons: - optimization this game after years  after Arma 2 didn't change at all expect 30 fps or minus over MP -Crappy SP AI bots are dumb as C.S Hostages -Sp missions may be broke sometimes -Not realistic at all for a distinguished MILSIM game  what the hell is all that futuristic halo crap? -Every now and then you must buy Apex DLC you are forced too  unless you don't wanna to play MP -Unrealistic Weapons Vehicles Soldier Gear  - Apex is more a call of duty infinite warfare dlc than MILSIM one  6/10 by a 2k hour ArmA player-10
has honestly gave me a lot of thrill because of the amount of activities &amp; events that takes place in 'Altis Life'  However there are still other game modes in  and im not suggesting that other game modes are not as awesome as this one but I really feel like  has really good gun mechs &amp; vehicles and General mechs . Worth to buy 10/1010
ecommend I LOVE this game flying planes to being a ground unit is the closest game I have played to real world combat.10
IT IS AMAZING BUY NOW but beware this needs a good processor an i5 of sorts atleast
ing monster of a game buy it
ood fun real smooth heaps to do..10
he Minimum or Recommended System Requirements are totally FAKE my graphics is NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650Ti but i just get 20fps in all low settings...that is super super horrible but the gameplay is excellent hope i can back in one or two years to recommend this game!-10
This is the best game i have ever got i love the mods it just a great day but the only down side is that fps is not that good when you play mod but if you find the right server you can get great fps :)
alling  open ended does it no justice  Almost everything can be custimized in this game including kit of individual soldiers and certain attributes of vehicles!  You're capable of saving an entire group of objects and simply plop them down and make your own battle field even entire armies! And this is without mods!  The mods for this game are diverse and fit just about every niche whether you want kit to be a cutting edge tacticool navy seal or be a snobby military hipster such as myself and have 90s era units equipment and vehicles  You can download a 60s era Soviet MIG if that's your thing!  Would reccomend this to anyone who's fascinated by military stuff!10
Told my friend about it and now he is a didacticed
that's my 
f your computer is powerful enough and you have tried the former ArmA series then this game must be suitable for you.10
extreamly complicated game of u think u can handle it ur out of ur mind.
hat can I say about .  is a huge open world fps/3rd person game with tons of differnt gamemodes such as roleplayingkilling battleroyales and much more. There is a wide variety of differnt guns and many differnt varients. I love to play wasteland its a mode where 3 teams have to capture various objectives throughout the map and you can test any gun or vehicle or clothing item in the gamemode. I have over 300 hours and I find the game very gun my moto is you pay $60 you must play atleast 60hours. I payed $60 for this game and it was worth every penny I even recommend to buy the marksmen dlc and apex. Im always looking for good players to play with feel me to add me on steam.10
efault game is fun Mods make it amazing NOT a hardcore game like DayZ unless you're playing DayZ Mods on it. Still fun none-the-less. Gotta have people to play with though. Two-Three people is the perfect squad number that goes for just about any game.10
Altough im in a mac there is a experimental port Wich i like but i despise the fact you can't instal mods instantly from the workshop if its just me please tell me how to fix it as i needed to modify the script in order to use mods
It's lit fam
Gr8 game with a lot of playing options. its a sure buy
 Hard to umderstand in beginnin.. :( but fun but hard and a bad thing is so much cost in the game like apex thingi first buy the game and then dlc it little expensive :( but fun to play and fun with friends :)10
nprecedented in scope and providing a comprehensive and accurate simulation of combined arms warfare. No game will give you the same deep frustration and complexity while simultaneously offering extremely satisfying f*** yeah moments along the way. The freedom and IN GAME TOOLS to create ANYTHING will keep you hooked forever.10
It's all fun and stuff until someone starts dominating you with a jet or something. And because you are bad you can't take it down :^)
Amazing battle sim recommend to all who are looking for a good sim
 have been playing this game for over a year now and with over two thousand hours I completely reccomend it. I first found the Arma series off YouTube as many others. I watched DayZ Mod and all kinds of other things and then one day about a year or two ago I bought a computor. The second game I ever bought was  and I would never have refunded it and in the beginning I played Altis life when I was just a little squeaker then months went by and I began to explore mods I joined my first mil-sim unit and I met new people and now I can say most of the people that are my friends on steam are from Arma and most I still speak to. Honestly this is a great game and it has had some up in downs for me and some days I was burn't of of playing it. But yes I do fully recommend this game (also sorry for the backstory lol).10
t's a game you can play all day each day and still not get bord with if you have mods like Exlie but be ready for 10-30fps and alot of bugs. 10
dude i wish i had this game lol i dont have any money but i REALLY REALLY want it!!
such an amazing game and its got so many diff stuff you can do
Pros:  -Sense of accomplishment after completing an objective -There is a challenge -Many types of servers -Great Community -Wide variety of downloadable content -Great Campaign (For me I can't say this for others) -The game is realistic compared to most war games. -You never know what to expect there is a sense of fear on what is coming up if your death costs you (some people may not like this)   Cons:  -Demanding game (You need a good computer) -A little buggy and laggy at times -There is a lot to learn if you do not know much (I had to learn a lot I didn't know much when I started) -Some people may not like how difficult the game is -Some people may not like having to go slow and take some time to plan and complete the objective -Situations could be very stressful     is extremely fun but it depends on the person. If you are not into spending a lot of time going slow and making sure everything you do is close to perfect and would rather play a more arcade style fast paced shooter you will hate this game. Yes this game does get frustrating at times and is extremely hard at times (if your not lowing the difficulty to almost the lowest it goes). But there is a good side to it being hard and frustrating. After you do complete your objective you have feel like you have accomplished something and you feel a relief.  Arma also has a lot to offer. You can complete the prologue and campaign. There is also tons of community made downloadable content to enjoy. Multilayer is also a big part of Arma. There are a lot of different types of servers. If you are a competitive player there are PVP servers. But if you are more of a co-op player there are many co-op players. If neither of those interest you there is also open world role play servers.  Lots of people complain about bugs glitches and lag. If you do not have a good computer I would not recommend buying this game. This game is very demanding mostly in CPU power. This does not mean you don't need a good graphics card. Even if you do have a good computer expect some lag every once in a while especially if you run a lot of mods.10
Would Roleplay again
amazing .... Nothing more to say
FPS is terrible in this game prepare to drop below 30 in any server with more than 75 people  Also it's pay 2 win you can buy DLC snipers that are way better than the normal ones. Stay away from this game totally not worth the price they don't optimize the game at all.
00+ hours of entertainment. You are going to need a pretty good computer to get the most out of it.  After a while Battleye kicks in while you get kicked out... forever. Battleye directly denies access to the game you paid to access for no reason.-10
Great game....
WTF this is impossible
 is the game where brave American's and pathetic Europeans fight against the Taliban. in the Middel east.
you dont have the skill or the patience for this game - ing shame
In depth tactical game which allows for some awesome mods like Altis Life
I don't remember having this game at any one point in time... but sure ill give it a review!
I can't play . It's the  free weekend and It's telling me to Purchase the game. Can someone please help me?
ame has awesome sooting and bullet physics worst physics the game have are car physics like when u crash the car doesent have dents but a broken wheel that you see but body structure is 100% without scratches. also wished that there was like a manual gear shifting implemented like in arma 2 where if you go up a mountain you can down shift for getting up the mountain faster with bigge revs and power. also there could be A BIG! potential for  car drag races and races becasue manual gear shifting is awesome. recomend to anyone that likes army stuff and shooting and understand the guns and how they shoot. but be aware there are a lot of key bindings that you will need to memorize to have the best experience ;)  EO.10
ove ! except one thing teh high price of the DLC way too high IMO.  10
if you dont mind sub-30 fps this game is great
I recommend this game because of the variety of things you can do in it. I also love the Eden editor which is easier to use compared to the old editor. The controls also feel great!
his game is for either 30 year olds that think it's real life or young kids that will be that 30 year old man one day.11
mazing game alot of fun mods too. recommend to download a3launcher so u can play mods easily10
his game is sooo damn fun just make sure to have a good pc btw the game is huge and combat is smart and fun think before you shoot there can always be a sniper hiding in the bushes 200m meter away. if you are pinned down request air support sometimes the game CAN be boring but then you are on the wrong place :P. that another thing the map can be so big that transportation is sometimes and issue but stay togheter with your squad and helicopters will always come and pick you up in the end. überfun game if you like military shooters hands down the best. i would write more but i think ive spotted a ta......11
  is not a standard fps it's a military simulator that is very immersive and requires a lot of time to get the full experience this game has a lot of detail and is as realistic as you can get. You can't expect to immediatly get into the action it takes time to get into a firefight and that will force you to be more careful. Your heart will be racing during the firefights because of the time you invested and it really is a special experience.10
poch is full of DLC guns that you can't pick up unless you cough up $15. other than that good game.10
spent 2 hours in eden editor making sick mission   crashes my graphics card  loses the mission  10/10 would have great times again
ometimes when I fly in a chopper I like to look into the eyes of my copilot while I purposely fly into a mountain.10
My god. This game. :O
Best army game
fps are horrible
1221 hours and counting of fun and heartache
It's like a shooter without the fun.
BEST GAME on the market!
Pro: The game is realistic Con: It is expensive and it may lag for players.
reat game but if you want to avoid stutter install it on high performance hdd or ssd since this game is hdd hog and reads constantly and heavily from hdd while you play.10
I played it a bit. It seems ok.
Does not work for me after I updated to the new nexus update. Screen is offset and mouse is somewhere else on screen. Unplayable. All my graphics went to . Great game and I want to keep playing it but I cant even select which server I want to join with this update. Anyone else having these problems?
I got this just to play exile. Best buy I've ever made.
 just cant keep a solid review on this game.  Its still solid like the rest of the Arma Series.  But it feels ier less optomised. Framerates drop like crazy online servers lag or drop you for one addon.   What pisses me off the most is having this game run so smoothly on coop and single player but once you try playing Altis Life KOTH or any server with 15+ people (Seriously? Boasting 100+ people per server and every single one of them is most likely a total lagfest) you need an internet connected installed crafted by Jesus and a Rig of the gods because you will lag. There's just so much going on. Which is great I love the chaos CAS dropping bombs a block away from you tanks firing upon enemy positions and the CQC is amazing at times. Just the lag holds it back nothing I seen on Arma 2 (In its prime)   8/10 when you're with a group of friends. 5/10 when you play online alone or attempt online with friends10
No word can truly describe ARMA. Just play it.
his game is a MILITARY SIMULATION game it will put into perspective a better way the militay (especially the front line infantry and spec. ops. soldiers) work and gives you a more realistic world to play on. Everything about this game is about being tacticle and smart not just rush and shoot like Call of Duty game or even Battlefield game do. The campains are long and more difficult especially considering you don't get 'superman health'. If you get shot 2-3 times or sometimes even once then you are dead. Explosives are more realistic in thier lethality and distance of effectiveness. You can customize your weapons and character on the go also by simply picking stuff up off of the people that have been killed (if you're into that sort of thing [I just replenish ammo if I can get it]). The Multiplayer is also completely different from other FPS multiplayers it is an experience that you just have to try and the graphics are amazing!  Rating: 10 out of 1010
ecent game sometimes buggy and annoying. Wasteland and KOTH are great battle royale is OK.   P.S. don't play breaking point if you have a VAC ban from a completely unrelated game from 5 years ago because the (breaking point) developer is an insecure australian who likes to roll around with his gang of forum admins talking  to people for no reason he has no self respect and seems to know very little despite having created a semi successful mod.10
It's okay I guess?
this is the least user friendly game ive ever played.
ull of bugs this is glitches galore what little content there is seems unfinished and rough. Its hard to call this a game and it doesn't completely qualify as a simulator yet. There are no collision mechanics vehicles colliding with each other or some objects usually ends with one of them flying off into the distance. I wouldn't recommend this game for 60$ not even for 40$ this was released as a 'full game' months before it should be and we're still waiting on a real full release in the mean time they haven't even added any of the old vehicles or equipment there is very little hope and I'd say the only salvagable content is the modding community which so far has kept  alive for as long as it is though most of the people who purchased it have given up.  I want my money back.-10
reat game! It has a ton of mod support to give the game a ton of variety and the mods aren't that difficult to find.10
Challenging but fun
This game is great fun to play with friends but warning to some with low-spec pc's this is a really damanding game but is worth it!
he base game with no mods is aright not much but WITH mods god the things you can do dayz huge battles and many MANY more mods that I can't count! Plus the steam Workshop support is amazing! Please if you want zombies buy this than dayz it so much more fun. Plus its at the steam sale $9.74 cheap! so you have NO reason not to buy this amazing game 10/10!10
Can Anyone please help me with the Parameters settigns in this game please. PC SPECS CPU amd FX(tm)-6300 six-core processor GPU NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX970 total graphics card memory 8190 dedicated 4096 shared system memory 4094 8 gig ram?
Amazing ! I love it !!!!!!!!!!!!
GREAT game on an expensive pc Ive upgraded from a laptop that had trouble running it to a beast machine The game runs at ultra and looks amazing.  LOVE EVERY PART OF THE GAME  CONS NEED A GOOD PC
t would be a 11/10 if you could join a populated server without high ping and buying the dlcs so far no servers in my area runs without  apex and low ping. guess im stuck in singleplayer -10
till one of the best game you could ever had. Classic old Operation Flashpoint combined with new graphics and systems. Because of mods and different game modes  feels like 10 games in one I am talking about strategic island capture wich is feels like real war then we go to social life in Altis Life missions then in zombie Apocalypse in Breaking Point there are missions that make  into like strategy and much more.  This is a unique and epic game. 10 out of 1010
 Well what can I say about this piece of . For a normally 60 dollar game the graphic are unappealing to say the least. Alright that's it! I'm done with this game! I'd rather press my face against a Hippopotamus' butt while it 'muck-spreads'! That's when a hippo takes a  rather than allowing the  to drop from it's  it presses it's tail against it's own -crack waving it back and forth shredding the  all over the place! That's how much fun this game is! Like putting a turd in a fan or a band-saw you just don't do it!   In other words don’t buy it save ur money. -10
Some games are worth the $$$$$.
Why am I so bad at this game?
 would have to be the most amazing and imersive gaming experiences you will have ever!!! The game Simulates a realistic military shooter. The amount of servers you can join is almost endless and the action is non stop!
k so I wanted a Battle sim so I buy  do tutorial and then keep getting kicked out of games as most of the servers need the extra DLCs most of the lobby are password protected and the tutorial isnt the greatest at explaining stuff.  The graphics are great and it runs smooth and even with the problems mentioned above im gonna stick at it as it looks like if you sink the effort in to it it will be well worth the effort.10
ve had this game for awhile now and have logged a good amount of hours and I love this game. It has its bugs but nothing really game breaking and the game is a new experience every time. I can never stay away for long and its a nice change of pace from the run and shoot of Call of Duty and have a more realistic approach.10
he game is fun on certain gamemodes but the minimium and reccemended specs that it says are not at all true. If you just meet those requirements do your self a favor and don't buy it and then throw your pc out the window.11
Just freaking awesome
ai is stupid but funny to look at
Most realistic Military sim i have come across. Must have good team skills to win
he only game where being ripped to pieces by a tank from over 1k away is considered fun. Is gud game unfortunately I'm not gud10
t's fine nothing special. 10/1010
You mod almost everything in this game.
 like it alotttt.. Only problem a  of updates and its not small updates its like almost the size of the  game10
rma is love Arma is life. 10/10 Would glitch through stairs again.10
List all of the reasons why you would not.
ery time consuming also a very good game 10/10 IGN rating (not really) but the game is good. It has so many mods that you can play like Takistan lide mod Lakeside Valley life mod Tanoa Life mod and there will probably be more to come. very good buy at the price that its at.10
uys   Starts Eden editor  Spawns 4 tanks and 2 assault squads  Plays as a sharpshooter in squad A  Tank #1 drives forward 3 feet then starts driving in circles where all the foot soldiers are sitting  Tank #1 runs over and kills half of squad A  Tank #1 drives infront of Tank #2  Tank #2 fires its main cannon into Tank #1  K: best game ever10
reat military simulator plenty of mods and community members but Bohemia's dlc practices do irritate players a bit. Overall would recommend10
aweasome game this is all i play with the great variety
est shooting game made so far (for me) if you dont count the funny glitches that it has.  10
reat release in a series of games that basically created the milsim genre. Excellent modding potential very active community. Personally I only play MP mods specifically Battle Royale which is a blast.10
i havent played this game alot but i can tell you that this game is  10% skill 40% walking 15% fps (get it) 15% dying 29.99999% wondering what the  is shooting at you .00001% putting a 9 year old in front of a firing squad  10/10 would firing squad a 9 year old again
othing beats joining a tacticle game mode in  finding a small vehicle and slowly driving it into a much larger vehicle until it flips or flies into the air. I reccommend statis wasteland ¯\_(?)_/¯10
ell with ~900 hours in  and probably twice as much in Arma 2 I can officially say that this game is CRACK. If you are looking for a good milsim or something that can be modded out to be whatever you want it to be  is a great choice.11
his game is a laggy broken bug riddled mess.  Now over to why i love playing it.  Yes  may be riddled with flaws but if you're looking for a good time with friends and active workshop/modding community and a hard but fair tactical simulation then this is your new game.  It is kinda jarring to learn and holy f*** controling a group of NPCs the first time is a cluster  of epic proportions but once you get the hang of it it's very rewarding to pull off flawless ambushes and 3v10 the AAF and CSAT bases.  All in all the flaws are minor and if u can live without the 60fps PC master race thing then it is worth everypenny and hey! with the 2 week steam refund policy all you really waste is time downloading (wich rly isnt that much).  A point to note though is that the DLC is more or less mandatory the game is super boring after a while if you dont have it the Kart racer DLC excluded since cmon..... Kart racers?  Give it a try and GL HF.10
aving played a lot of Arma 2 I had trouble making my inevitable move to . With the tide of players moving to BI's newest version of my favorite game I couldn't hold out for too long. Perhaps it was the many many memories I have playing Arma 2 with friends that held me back. I wondered if  would provide the same experience.  This review is meant to offer some insight to players still waiting to make the move from A2 to A3. I won't cover much about graphics as the difference is obvious there. Clearly A3 looks better.  GUNPLAY This was one of my most important factors in deciding whether or not I would like A3. At first I hated the gun sway and the seemingly complex stance system and figured it would simply detract from all the fun I could have in PVP. Eventually like all things you get used to it and I noticed that I seem to escape more shots from other players and players miss more of their first shots than they did in A2. Is this a new population getting used to the game? Maybe but it seems like ranging is more important in A3 than it was in Arma 2. I can't be sure but it seems like the distance in A3 is less....forgiving. Once you master it though firing 's weapons is more gratifying than in A2. The weapons sound amazing. Fire off an M320 at someone from 1000+ meters and enjoy the feeling that only Arma seems to give.  VEHICLES/AIRCRAFT One of the first things you'll notice is that ground vehicles don't excatly handle like they did in A2. Be prepared to slow down! Driving some of the vehicles at high speed is akin to steering a cinder block on ice. I still am not a fan of the vehicle handling but I do like the physics of the cars' shock absorption when getting air or going over bumps. Cars seem to flip more easily than in A2. One of my favorite things about A3 is the option to turn on advanced flying. This allows you to operate an aircraft more realistically. With this option turned on (game settings I think) you'll get to regulate the power output of your heli for example. No longer can you descend so fast without concern and then slam on the power at the last second. You'll have to regulate it downward. But again this is optional. Again the sounds are amazing here as well.  LIGHTING Wow the lighting is the first thing I knew I loved about A3. The new Tanoa map being released any minute now through the Apex DLC shows off the lighting really well. A lone lamp post in the jungle that you can actually see from far distances makes A3 maps feel real and alive. The sky lighting can seem a bit bright at first I think but with some adjustment it's amazing. Vehicle headlights also look incredible at night and flashlight attachments on your weapons work well to enhance that 'oh man who's watching me right now' feeling.  MAPS This is where I'm not a fan of A3. I understand the arid setting and what it offers to large scale battles but it's hard on the eyes. Luckily modders have brought beloved maps like Chernarus Lingor Namalsk Panthera and Napf to A3. Today as previously mentioned the new Tanoa map drops in the Apex DLC and it's an incredible map. Probably the best map BI has ever released. I fully expect it to become the most popular map for mods like Exile and Epoch. Attention to detail is everywhere. Get lost in the jungles or island hop. I expect gun boats to finally get some love from players on this map.  AI Ai is much better in my opinion. It's an impossible line to tiptoe the balance between being a challenge but not too much of a challenge as to be insurmountable. AI in A3 feels like it walks that line much better than A2. Of course this will probably vary from server to server too much to really say the AI is well-balanced.  BUILDINGS For those Exile Epoch and DayZ-clone mods you'll be happy to know that A3 maps like Altis have many many buildings to enter. Nearly all of the buildings in the game are enterable. Loot yourself silly.  SUMMARY If you look at the server count the Arma community has clearly moved to A3. And I think this game has earned the bulk of the community. If you played a lot of A2 you might have some difficulty with gunplay at first but give it time and learn to go prone and deploy your bipod and wait for the right shot. You can deploy your bipod on most surfaces that are at chest level whether standing or kneeling. Get used to using it it will make all the difference. With Tanoa coming out today I definitely recommend popping the cash for it and .10
rma  what can be said about the game  let's see  originaly named operation flashpoint  it had the premier graphics and the 1st game in history to be able to kill a guy then steal his gear weapons and vehicle in open world  it was released as battlefield 1942 came out  it also had a sequel called red dragon  then arma 1 and the add ons  arma 2  add ons and now   the devs have beast super computers when they make these games using thier own engine thats why its rough on normal pcs  (not everyone can dish out 9 grand for a desktop ) lol just for ahizzles and gizzles you all should try to play operation flashpoint and see how many fps you get =)  it is how ever hard on a pc  it has amazing graphics physics and sweet a$$ guns and vehicles  it s a well made game from details on the cockpits to the tail rotor blades  deff reccomend this game for anyone ballsie enough to play it  but not to many play vanilla so id try some epoch or exile =)10
is absolutely the best Military simulator ever. i have enjoyed every hour I have spent playing. the community is Strong and helpful in most cases.   Can be hard to pick up and play if you have no experience dealing with Arma but once you figure out the mods and installing them your Possibilities are almost endless with much of the User and community based addons.  I highly recommend this Game. 10/10 10
Honestly I really loved this game and played it a lot when I bought it but it is a little glitchy and the movement is also quite squishy but still the game is what a full realistic game is like and it really has a lot of content including the long Campaign and the Multiplayer and all the other battle modes. All together I rate this game a 8/10
i like the sound of death..............................................so this game is sick
o you want to walk for 70 hours and then get shot by a sniper WELL THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU11
 very good fps made to complement military trainning in the US army. Each part of this game is designed to be as much real as possible and an extended mapping of the keys is necessary to fully enjoy all the possibilities offered to you. Many vehicles great maps modable weapons and various equipment (parachute diving suits gillies) make this game a gem of its own! A must buy for tactical fps fans :D10
F YOU WANT THIS GAME FOR DAYZ MOD BUY IT FOR SURE! The dayZ mod runs flawlessly on my PC. As much as I love this game it is so poorly optimized. I would've thought by now it would at least run a little better in multiplayer but it is still pretty laggy and I get tops 40fps on a good day. The rest of the times its 30 and under (mostly under) no matter how low or high I have the graphics settings. The game is so much fun when it runs correctly and it has a decent campaign buy it if you have brand new hardware. If you are running with something about 2 years old its gonna be booty. Like I said 3 times in this one review I LOVE THIS GAME and you will meet some really cool people working as a team... That is if you can handle low fps 90% of the time.-10
Great tactical game tons of fun to be had.
mazing :D but crashes a few times... :P still good game can't wait till they make a 4th game. ultra ultra realism thats when my comp cant handle that stuff. xD10
is an awesome game if you are looking for alot of replay value then look no further. The amount of community mods for this game is insane and will constantly give you a new twist or view on the game.10
0/10 optimization  10/10 physics didn't know in real life that cars can fly  10/10 didn't know you could die from falling down stairs  10/10 realisim  literally 10fps  yum.11
r8 game but the salt.. the salt...10
Lots to do and very fun
I have managed to get 70 hour of gameplay by messing with mods and the Edenn map/mission editor thingy. Truly a great game.
got robbed of my organs and  and then had to sing to survive
no clue what to do. 10/10
Altis Life = Better then Real Life
ne of the best games ever made in my opinion. I love the Arma series because the game lets you do whatever you want really. Love all the mod support for Arma as well. 10/10 for me which is saying a lot.10
t first the game worked fine. i enjoyed it but  after afew hours the game wouldent start and there would be multiple errors  it constantly wanted me to create verify and connect a bohimia account to steam because of units? At the end i gave up. I tried everything-11
lways something for you to do in . You can be a soilder in war a civilian living on the lsland of Altis a survivor of a zombie apocalypse and much more!11
Still an incredible game to this day i have played it for way too long but i enjoyed it i feel like there is so much more to discover in this game but i don't like the idea of the paid dlc's
ohemia please fix your damn game before releasing any more updates. I would rather have helicopters that don't explode when I get in them than helicopters with a fancy new flight model. Fix your .-10
Really good but hard to run. A lot of modibility and replayability Its better to buy during a sale.
This is a great game. Be warned it has its troubles and can definitely be slow paced at times but every shot taken feels meaningful. This game is not for those who enjoy fast paced 20 minute matches. You will spend hours walking and not fire one shot just to get to a five minute fire fight. You will be  at the performance and the unability to find whoever is shooting at you. This game makes you think and take your time because running around will not work. It is a different style of game but well worth the buy.
ont recommend for solo. the worlds DUMBEST AI. My team doesn't do anything at all right BUT the enemy AI can see thorugh bushes can see you from behind their head and hear you from a distance they're very accurate all while my team being the complete oppisite ing idiots.-10
this review is from someone new to the Arma series and military simulators. The most enjoyment I have found from this game has to be the scenario editor. If you enjoy map editing and/or scenario editing I would highly recommend this game. Also the multiplayer is quite enjoyable if you find a good team or good scenario. The game is graphically gorgeous. Has some of the best lighting effects I've seen since Metro.  On the downside. Your character fatigue is ridiculous. For being a simulator you will immediately die if shot. But on the other hand you have to shoot the AI several times before they will. The game can be very complicated at times if you're not familiar with this like myself. All in all it's a very good game if you're willing to put the time and effort to learn everything.
It is k...
eed a good pc for sustainable fps in game  but it's worth buying  a lot of gamemodes10
onestly a great game if you love military type games. Even if you are not into full on military simulations this still has something for you only problem. GOATS!10
this game isnt call of duty   its not dayZ  its both
Great military simulation game!
an you use mods (yes you can) can you play RP (yes you can) can you play missions with friends or with people you dont know (yes you can) can you game use a world war 2 mods or anything like that like the halo mod (yes you can) can you put a zombie mod in (yes you can) can you do a quick scope (f**k no this aint call of duty) do you like GTA and like to drive around and see what there is (yes you can) can you have clans and make your own clan base with AIs protecting it (yes you can)  do you like setting up clan fights (this game is the best for it)  is there any furries or bronies playing this game (i have no clue am a furry soo i guess so) like building your own maps and put down as much as you want with no limits unlike halo's forge (yes this game beats halo's forge)  want to hide in a bush and wait for about a hour to kill one dude from 2700mm way (yes you can) love first person ande third person games (with this game has both) want to go in frist person in carsjetschoppers soo on (yes you can)   hope to see you in the game10
est game ever played and a gread continue of ArmA211
This game uses more of your CPU and GPU in the main menu then when playing. 10/10
t first i had no idea how this game worked or what to do i also had a low end rig which it didnt run well on. but sfter learning the basics the game modes and mods i have found it to be super fun especially with friends. This game is good only if you have a decent rig and play on good servers some popular servers only give me 20fps with a i76700k and 980ti but other servers that are near exact same give me nearly 100. dont recommend it for a low end rig at all but the game is great10
Boom and boom and boom
etter thank Call of Duty better than Battlefield better than all fps games - is great game with realistic shooting and aircraft system. :) But car driving system is not good - very strange.  And it has a lot of mods my  folder have a only 107 GB. ;)10
annot get this game to work single player works but not online. Dont have time to deal with that kind of stuff i just want it to WORK and it does NOT.-10
Do not buy this   game bad quality crashed every 2 minutes and just not worth it man waste of ing money !!
ing love it been palying Altis Life since January 2015 and i love it  I got videos if you got time to check it out.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSjTySE1Aio&amp;feature=youtu.be
Not-so Pogchamp
 dont know what OpenGL 4.1  Someone please link me to something to download it Thank you!-10
Emersion factor: 10/10. Minus rocks and stairwells.
I Love the game so muchc that I would actually recommend to any friend
tory is ok actual gameplay is overall the best you can get though10
Gaben Thinks This Is Pretty Epic!
ing great game! I only ever play on one server (GTA) but all i can say is i only ever play this game. Love it 10/10 from me.
Atlis Life makes this game 100% worth buying.
 have depression But good game m810
 really need help I have a fx 6300 clocked at 4.0ghz and a gtx 960 but i only run at 30 frames all low. I tried alot of differant methods I have seen a couple of bench marks with the exact same specs as me and the get at least 80 fps. Hopefully I didn't just spend 60$ on a game where I should be running 60fps max.-10
A must have game!
Some things glitch out and end up not working
The most realistic game i've ever played. Loads of fun and endless possibilites  11/10 would mercy kill my injured friend for him ammo next to a burning helicopter in the middle of the forest again
his is by far the best game Ive ever had.Its unlike thoughs modern day games its more than that and thats why i like itand all my favrite youtubers play it and so do my friends.10
ere's something someone once said. 'What we have so far? Big island that is not usable and is total uninteresting but eats recources like crazy while the AI cant really use it - vehicles get destroyed and stuck everywhere - FAIL! To big towns - GHOSSTTOWNS - because if u try to create scenario with life - the already bad FPS get worse - big surprise hu - that was never a problem with ArmA before - NO not at all. FAIL! Enterable building everywhere - FINALLY - but their are empty. FAIL! No civilian life. FAIL! The future scenario is no future - is just a complete faildesign because u dont have the balls to stand up against the whining community and deliver a truly futuristic scenario - which could have been really awsome. FAIL! We have no real factions- just the same repainted  on other units.FAIL! No real diversity in guns. FAIL! ZEUS- nice idea - bad implementation as always - cant even create patrolareas with one click - instead we spend all time clicking like crazy to give units waypoints - simple triggers would be essential as well. FAIL! Virtual Arsenal to equip units - nice idea AGAIN bad implementation - exporting and adding it to init of units doesnt work for JIP in MP - SPLENDID FAIL! PhysX - nice we finally have it - do we? Hm lets see - shooting AI lets do them their crazy i-dont-care-just-a-scrathc-dance-and-i-shoot-you-in-the-face-right-away and when they ragdoll -ragdoll often sends them flying. FAIL! PhysX and vehicles - i was so looking forward for nice vehicle races across the islands - still the same  since over a decade. FAIL! In the past the series had to offer big battles and big scenarios with quite reasonable performance - not possible any more with ArmA3. FAIL! Action Menu - do i need to say more? FAIL! FAIL! FAIL! Still no real revive for coops and MP with JIP support (norrin or Grime has shown how its done) FAIL! Damage Model - same  since over a decade. FAIL! I can go on like that for months.... Convince me to buy ur DLC Bohemia convince me to still want to support you. I still love the game despite all ur FAILS - but supporting you?  YOU GUYS IGNORE ESSENTIAL GAMEPLAY PROBLEMS SINCE YEARS AND U STILL DONT GET IT.  YOU BOHEMIA  YOU VERY MUCH' - 4years Alpha3   But other then that it's very fun.10
can not get bundle to work.
he most realistic game to ever exist the most addicting game to ever exist the most mature game to ever exist the most brutal the most cpu demanding the most graphically beautiful the most pleasing experience in the steam store. BUY IT PLAY IT.10
nlike Battlefield or Call of Duty in  when you hear a 'tic' or a 'tac' the thing you should do is to find bushes arround you cause if you don't you're dead. The thing that i like about this game is the realism. When you fly a helicopter you can't just fly it arround there's some kind of procedure or something. If you switch the helicopter control to advanced boy oh boy........ my chances of hitting the ground increases to 100%. 20/10!10
bsolutely terrible game. Totally unoptimised. I'm running on a high spec PC however the FPS is averaging around 10. This isn't acceptable and I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this game. To be honest it's the entire  engine.. Just poorly created.-10
ods are what makes this game so great. User content easily outclass DLCs in every aspect.  P.S. Optimization is amazing I'm currently playing on an array of 50 gtx 1080 and doing rock solid 26 fps in 640x480.11
 think the forum post that I made sums it up well. Tl;dr the game's community is terrible and the multiplayer is full of  mods that barely work with the occasional gem ruined by the community that inhabits it. For a more detailed review of my free weekend day with the game read below.   After my dad bought  I thought I would try it out as well. I've been interested in a realistic modern FPS but they don't really exist in numbers these days. After taking over an hour to install the game I was able to play the tutorial while tweaking with my video settings. I eventually up to over 30 FPS while looking really good. Then I decided I wanted to try the multiplayer out. What a mistake that was. 's player base is actually worse than ARMA 2's in that every single online server is some  reincarnation of the Hunger Games or DayZ without the zombies. I spent about 4 hours trying to have fun in these game modes. But to no avail I was playing a really bad set of mods set in a gigantic map that might as well be a copy of Just Cause 2's getaway island all in a modern FPS simulator. It was like trying to play paintball in playground that was clearly a copy of McDonald's playplaces.  After some searching I eventually found a Domination server which was as close to vanilla ARMA as I was going to get. It was incredibly confusing there was no tutorial to explain any of the game mechanics/mod additions and people were wrecking the base's vehicles. I was desperate so I tried to play anyways. After about 10-15 mins of gameplay I noticed that my FPS was lagging really badly. I had just found a team of coordinated players though so I just tried to play through the pain. After the 5 of us singlehandedly took the next objective everyone was complaining about FPS issues and I was getting 13-18FPS. There was clearly something wrong but luckily for us a moderator just got on! He reset the server for us which I thought was really nice.  But it was to no avail. Everyone was still having FPS issues and I guess that has to do with 's terrible optimization and/or the custom map's or plugin's memory leakage filling up our RAM. Then I encountered a new problem. The moderator. He was especially grumpy and clearly over 40 so being so out-of-touch with not understanding everything he was getting really upset at all of the new players. He understandably kicked a new player that was spamming the minigun on our helicopter even after the moderator told him to stop.  And then I got kicked for no reason presumably because I was also in the helicopter? I came back in told him that he kicked the wrong guy and the moderator essentially blew me off. Whatever screw him then. I found a FOB to spawn on that somebody set up on the enemy's flank. I was able to shoot a couple of guys before they shot me off the hillside. I spawn back in and everyone is doing awesomely. The enemy has a Frogfoot firing missiles and bombs into the city the Warthog is doing the same thing we had mortars they had mortars and I was able to move into the town because it was getting absolutely hammered.  So I set up shop in a 2nd story window down a street when I spot a couple of soldiers. I aimed at thier bodies but couldn't see a IFF tag so I shot one of them. After the other part of this ambushed squad came back out in the open I shot another one. I was unsure about whether they were friend or foe still so I kept an eye out for server messages in the lower-right corner. Loe and behold this guy was a friendly and I just shot him. The other guy must've been a friendly too which means that I accidently killed 2 of my teammates. I immediately said sry on Side Chat but it was too late.  Apparently the immature community that seems to make up 's multiplayer though it would be funny to set up a special plugin for teamkillers. Whether it was an accident or not after 2-3 TKs you are immediately teleported away from the game and your position in the town to some prison with several annoying soundbites going on in the background and nothing to look at but other TKers and a really low-quality repeated billborad of some kind. After I sat there for a few moments I was also wearing pink clothing that had TEAM KILLER printed all over it. And there was a soundbite of a baby crying because that's how annoying the moderators wanted to be.  In short I accidently made a mistake and was punished in the most immature way possible. By being imprisoned in an annoying micspam room with nothing to do for 6 minutes. Wow. In every other FPS you either lose a bunch of points get kicked or are killed by the server. In  the s that run the only close-to-vanilla server throw you in a prison that forces you to listen to once again MIC SPAM that is against the server's own rules.  I'm so glad that I got to try this game out this weekend because I would have regrets had I bought it. Thank you ARMA devs for letting me experience the tiness that is your multiplayer. Glad I didn't waste my money on it.-10
oor performance on high-end PCs Low player count huge learn curve.  Good for people with nerves of steel bad for anyone that does not have more than 3-4 hours of just sitting and waiting for something to happen.   Not recommended.-10
broken game broken promises.  alpha comes out has great voice over quality great hit registry guns work when you shoot them. They update it. Broken voice over broken hit registry (90% of bullets don't register a hit) car physics are for trolls all the servers are run by admin and friends (donate money and they will ban whoever you don't like) planes don't work AA shoot you down from 5 km away. The only thing fun is flying a helicopter. Running is broken in the game. Play epoch mod and get shot by a five year old hiding in the bushes in his underwear. Bad games made worse. Just pretty graphics however half the servers run terribly and don't support high frames so even if you have a nice computer good luck getting good frames. Would have been great if they just left it in alpha instead of screwing it up.-10
ried this for the free weekend to see if I could enjoy it. Played on normal and the difficulty was far too great for me to find fun. I respect this game and feel its good and everything but even on the lowest difficulty I find it near impossible to find and shoot the enemy. Gun sway is really intense and this is with me lagging behind the rest of the AI players walking to preserve energy (im aware of the extra stamina drained when moving crouched). Enemy seems to be able to see through foliage. If you like incredibly difficult things this game is for you. I took my time to do the tutorial learn the buttons positioned myself carefully and usually just ended up getting shot. Theres time compression thank god however a lot of people might not even realize its there. This game has its moments but I would recommend Operation Flashpoint Red River over this any day I find it much more satisfying moment to moment. I am an adult with a full time job walking through the woods simulator isnt my thing I gave this game a chance and I feel as though I wasted two hours of my life yesterday. I want to love this game as much as the original operation flashpoint...but I can't I simply can't (in cleetus voice). Graphically things went well I have a gtx 660 and 10 gigs of RAm on an i5 with shadow play on and recording I was getting somewhere between 25-70 FPS. FPS drops intensely around buildings. I am runnning it on ultra settings. If you have a system similar to mine you can be pretty much assured to play at an acceptable framerate. If you have friends to play with turn on OF:Red River. The friend I tried this with was too frustrated with the shooting mechanics to enjoy it. This game is good mind you but not for me....-10
aid $70 for this and I've spent more time trying to figure out how to join multiplayer servers than I have even played the game:  PlayMultiplayerany server - - Loads for a second then returns me to server list without saying why as if it never happened before.  Waste of money thanks.-10
rma 2? Amazing. Decent DLC. ? Great. HORRIBLE DLC. For the simple fact they're charging £10.99 for TWO helicopters I'm just done witht his game.-10
is not a game you should pay $60.00 for. The game does indeed offer a few nice features but it does not offer the good realistic and tactical gameplay you would recieve from Arma 2-10
fix everything plz
ll I can say is this is the worst POS coded game I have ever played. While I do not have the most current hardware 280x 3.6GHZ Proc 16GB Ram and SSD the FPS are at best 24. When using autodetect I get 14fps. Really? I spent money on this? Save your money and buy something playable. I even tried the process prioroty and run scripts. THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY-10
ad optimisation in the engine leads to FPS lag meaning you need a pretty insane rig to run it even tho you shouldnt have to. Has A LOT LESS content than previous Arma versions (Not counting community ofc). I enjoy the game but the FPS issues (which cant be fixed because they have to re-design the engine) and the lack of conent makes it stale quite quickly.  Edit: Due to some incredible community members some missions are now actually playable. Wasteland by Sa-matra is very stable as are some Altis life servers.  System:  i7 4770k @ 22ghz 32Gb RAM @ 1600Mhz GTX 970 OC'd  With this I get around 20-60FPS wether It's on low or ultra it still runs the same.-10
ad to see how far Bohemia Interactive has fallen. Dont buy this B$#@ S%$@ or the DLC all DLC should have been in the game in the first place! ARMA 2 had chinooks in the game for free they released Cart Racing DLC before Helicopter DLC.... If you do own  already dont waste your money on DLC the community will mod more Helicopters/Islands into the game for free then BIS ever will. Just wait dont waste your money.  Stay Far Away-10
is definitely more improved than Arma 2 the experience is much better and the graphics has improved and the maps seem to be bigger. However to play it with at least 30fps or higher you need a supercomputer to do so as this game is horribly optimised. Here is a comparision of my frame rates playing different games  Battlefield 4 - 70fps (ultra settings) Tomb Raider - 120fps (Ultra settings)  - 40 fps (Standard settings)  The graphics of this game is comparable to Tomb Raider.  Verdict: Don't buy it unless you own a supercomputer.-10
 bought  way back in the heady days of Early Access past. I remember very distinctly playing a bit with it playing some multiplayer with friends and thinking to myself 'This is cool but it feels unfinished'. So I let it sit for a while.   came out of early access and that feeling of unfinished-ness never faded. The amount of content in the base game is frankly embarassing. There's basically one of everything: one OPFOR IFV one BLUFOR IFV one OPFOR assault rifle one BLUFOR assault rifle etcetera. The content that is there feels much less like it belongs in a series touted as a realistic infantry environment simulator and more in the latest AAA shooter- firearms with tinny unconvincing sound vehicles with fictionalized designs and paint schemes that make them look like they just rolled off the set of a bad low budget scifi film CSAT infantry have  bugeyes on their helmets. The underwater gameplay is a one-trick pony of a gimmick- there's a single underwater-capable rifle in the entire game and there's rarely a reason to actually do the sort of frogmen ops the rebreather gear lets you do unless you absolutely positively must find some way to cram it into a mission you're making.  On top of all that they nixed the old DLC policy that I absolutely loved- wherein if you didn't have a DLC you could still make full use of its content but at a lessened (visual) quality. Instead you just can't make use of DLC equipment and vehicles- you get a large popup telling you to buy the DLC (or at least that's how it was last time I played).  It's frustrating.  iterates so well on Arma 2 in some areas and completely fails to deliver in most others. The new movement and physics are a massive step forward from Arma 2 the new flight modelling on helos (while not being DCS quality or anything) is great the game looks significantly better. But there's barely any content (a problem BIS won't be correcting: they're already selling DLC) and what content is there feels jarringly disconected from the idea of realistic infantry combat this franchise sells itself on.-11
ow is this a Full release game....? THe net code is from 1998 and it can barely get 40 fps online. Single player is great! But holy  man the whole point is to play online. There is a game changing glitch or neck snapping d-sync every 8 seconds. Walls just randomly murder you and the cqc is just dreadful. Id write a longer reveiw but i just dont care i already put 100 hours in this abortion.-11
10/10 Would not buy again  -Gamespot
I have an 8350 clocked at 5.0 and a video card 290x twinfrozer. I score 9250 on 3dmark and this game runs like crap no matter what. On top of all this I hate the amount of control buttons this games always have. They need to make them like operation flashpoint.
h.   I'm gonna plug away and play this to the end someday but even if you buy it now and aren't affected by the fact that the initial release contained maybe one fifth of the final content they slowly leaked out to users there are still so many issues with this game that it's not really that fun to play. Yes it's realistic I suppose if you don't count the fact that you can be shot in the face by a man with the vision of an eagle and the aim of a robot who is so far away or hidden behind bushes that you can't even see him but it's not fun to play.   Consider the mines in the forest of the second level that you can't detect and kill you forcing a checkpoint restart and a frustrating trial-and-error progression through the area again and again.   Consider the checkpoint about 5 minutes along from that one that is placed at the start of a 3 minute march followed by a battle that if you die during it makes you start back at the beginning of the eventless 3 minute march.  Consider these issues exacerbated by the manual save system that only lets you save at certain times effectively dooming you to long endless stretches of replaying and replaying until you can slog through whatever ery they stick in front of you.   Consider the poor optimisation that leaves the game chugging on a high-end pc and still displaying all kinds of low-res textures anyway.   Consider the frequent updates that corrupt your save files and render them unplayable.   Consider the lack of a co-op campaign - one of the few things that made the buggy mess of ARMA II fun and literally the only reason I bought this game in the first place. Perhaps I should have done my research but then perhaps I had no idea what the total content of this game would contain when it bought it and was shocked to find it bare-bones until they released the last of it months after I purchased it.   In some ways it's a vast improvement over its predecessor - it looks much better and the confusing and encyclopedic control system is explained MUCH better. The mission objectives are also a lot clearer and completing a given mission isn't as much of a 'pray that you're in the wrong place rather than that the game as bugged out' scenario.   But I still I don't know what Bohemia were attempting with this - so many design choices leave me tearing my hair out in frustration (why on earth would it take them months after release to add a tutorial section to the game? Should that not have been one of the first pieces of content released?). However I suppose that most of my gripes regarding content have been resolved at this point so at least that's a plus for those considering whether to buy but all the odd little design quirks combine together to make playing this game a minefield in itself.   One wrong move and you're ed.   I do not recommend this game.-10
his game is buggy as  have fun clipping through walls and spawning outside of the map  physics... it's like from one of those indian movies if you hit something you gonna feel the impact after few seconds.  Do not buy this game.-10
This game is trash. Arma 2 with updated graphics and controls. You cant run for more than 10 seconds at a time because EVERYONE IS OVERWEIGHT apparantly. Just ruins the game. Cant go anywhere quickly unless its in a vehicle. AWFUL... was going to buy if it was like 10 bucks at christmas sale but not anymore. This game blows just like arma 2. The only thing arma 2 had going for it is dayz mod. and even that got old.
uggy mess in which I get around 15fps in large multiplayer battles on the lowest settings on a GTX 670. Oh the AI on single player is absolute dog  too but at least I get around 40fps on single player! :D-10
Arma 2 was better. The pay to win kinda ruins it and battleroyal is the only good mod. Wasteland is kinda boring on the giant map.
unoptimized as hell
 am ing angry because they make me pay almost as much as the ing base game costs for DLC disgusting-11
Horrible optimization on a system that runs Doom on high settings at 60 fps. Really wish I could get a refund.
 fps on any setting
This game would be fine if it was on Early Access but feels very unpolished for a almost 3 year old game
HIS GAME IS IN BETA DO NOT PURCHASE  DLCS ARE BROKEN GAME IS BROKEN MODS ARE BROKEN  THIS GAME HAS NO CAMPAIGN YET ADVERTISES ONE IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT ENJOY THE 5 MISSION PROLOGUED OF TELLING YOU THAT THE GAMES F&amp;^$%KING -10
More demanding than a gay bank robber. 4/10 #NeedsOptumumizations
or the first time in the series the official campaign is actually playable and enjoyable. Play it before they break it with patches! ...was my thought on the first episode.  The second episode is filled with uninspired generic missions that don't even have an aim unlike the first episode where you could obviously tell what element each mission is trying to introduce.  The story too is non-existent here. It's basically just repeating the point that the first episode already established. Repeating the same thing is completely fine in storytelling but that's only if you haven't repeated it enough times yet. What's repeated in the second episode has already been repeated just the right amount in the first episode.  To the surprise of no one the third episode is even more uninspired and boring. The missions in the third episode don't contain a single unique idea unlike the second episode which has a fistful of those.  What's worse the story is absolute garbage. Everything interesting happens off-screen and the game doesn't even give answers to the questions it raised itself while giving answers to the questions that didn't exist until that point. It doesn't even have a conclusion and ends in an abrupt cliff-hanger. It's the definition of trash.  All episodes combined the campaign doesn't even use 1/8 of the interesting locations in Altis and Stratis. For some strange reason even after the introductory first episode there are so many missions that take place in Stratis which is fairly small. If they make sense in the story standpoint that's fine but they don't. All of those would have been totally alright to take place in Altis so it doesn't make any sense. Also the missions in Altis take place in very boring locations. Even though there are tons of varied locations (e.g. huge town stadium ghost hotel airport vast desert mountain full of windmills) they only use the same type of locations: small town. Even worse the third episode takes place entirely around a single town Neochori. Why did they decide to do that we'll never know.  The game itself is fine though and that's what matters in the end.10
The controls are all over the place first the mouse then the actions and you cant change walking controls but its a good game if i got feedback.
 cannot recommend this game when ArmA 2 is still alive and well.  First of all the game is lacking in content for example most of the weapons and vehicles are the exact same for different nations with different paint schemes. The map is huge which is great till you look closer at it. Most of the buildings are empty no furniture nothing. A lot of the assets are missing even basic objects/buildings for some missions that were around since the OFP days like CTI just aren't there.  The gun handling feels like something straight out of battlefield if you know how to control the recoil which by the way is not hard it basically goes straight up you can be completely accurate at 300m with a fully automatic weapon.  The character handling feels very awkward and this is coming from someone with 2000+ hours on arma 2 I know about awkward controls there are like 3 movement speeds all of which take around 3 keystrokes to get in/out of what happened to the good old days of just pressing W then going? This isn't a damn car I don't have to switch gears depending on the speed I am going at.  Speaking of cars the cars handle very awkwardly aswell the acceleration is just ridiculous it takes forever to get up to around 30kmh then it just switches on the afterburner and off it goes!   Hey look an afterburner! Oh wait it's a trainer jet a stealth a10 and some freak su25 thingy. Oh boy there is so much wrong with the planes and helicopters in this game. I love aviation hell I'm trying to make it my job so this part hurts me the most. Where do I begin with this... Let's start with the easiest L39 it's a trainer it's not supposed to carry weapons and you're gonna tell me it's gonna go up in battle with no other air support? Ha good joke. I'm gonna be honest I like the looks of the su25 looking thing but it's never going to happen much less in 20 years. The SU25 is still doing well and if it were to get upgraded in the next 20 years it would probably only be the systems and avionics either that or they will build an entirely new aircraft from scratch or replace it with the already existing ground pounders. Oh boy here comes the big one. That damn stealth a10 freak. There is so so so much wrong with this it's not even funny. Alright let's start with what stealthing an aircraft is all about. Sharp edges to bounce the radar off in a different direction than where it's coming from the whole aircraft needs to be sharp guys not just the engines. Notice something about the stealth aircraft that are flying around today? Internal stores. You don't want those suckers reflecting radar signals now do you? The a10 is a subsonic CAS (Close Air Support) ground pounder It is literally designed  the enemy up and they'll know what hit them but it won't matter cause they'll either be dead or their equipment will be too ed up to shoot back. There is no use stealthing a plane that will be flying at under 5000'. Everyone and their mother will be seeing that bad boy. It's also supposed to take damage the whole titanium bathtub  and whatnot by sharpening the edges you are adding more structural failure points in the event of you know a missile hitting it. I'm no aircraft engineer but to me this makes sense if someone is reading this and actually is an aircraft engineer please tell me how wrong or right I am. Same goes for stealthing helicopters I mean come on how are you going to stealth a ing rotor spinning at hundreds of rpm and constantly changing pitch/angle? The mi48... This is not how things work you can't take 2 choppers merge them together and add some stealth t on it and expect anyone to take you seriously...   is set in the near future. around 20 years from now. If you look at military history in the 20th century progress was at it's peak in WW2 up to Vietnam and then kind of slowed down till the mid 90's and we're now more or less at a standstill. We're still using tanks aircraft and weapons designed in the 70's and 80's and perfectioned. It takes a world war or some major conflict of some sort to get us off our asses and to put our thinking caps on. So do you really think that 20 years from now the ak's m4's m16's etc will be out of service and replaced by a new standard of 6.5mm caseless shells? That we won't be still using abrams strikers t90's and BMP 90's? We'll probably have the f22 unfortunatly probably the f35 PAK FA and others most of this stuff will most likely be old  with fancy new systems.  I half blame dayz for how this game turned out. DayZ is/was a good mod/game but it attracted the wrong kind of people to ArmA it didn't attract milsim people it attracted the general public that likes shooters and zombies. The funny thing is most of the dayz servers you find on ArmA 2 are those stupid 10000 vehicles ones with military weapons in every corner and everyone shooting everyone else in chernogorsk that's not survival that's just glorified deathmatch either way I digress. Bohemia probably decided to make the game more accessible for those people leading to this casualized shadow of what was once great.  I could let the whole 'it doesn't seem finished' part slide if they weren't releasing DLC for the parts that aren't finished... You are expecting me to pay 15 bucks for 2 helicopters? When there are barely any in the base game to begin with? And I do agree that all of the future bs thing that I've been saying can be fixed with mods but modded servers are not popular and the most modding the general public wants to do is grab one of those all in one mods like dayz.  TL;DR: It's a casual version of ArmA 2 designed to cater to the general public. If you want a military simulator I'd recommend ArmA 2 over this. If you feel like arma 2 was overwhelming then this is probably the game for you.-11
ery frustrating game overly complicated gameplay with a very unpolished combat system. Gun sway is completely unrealistic and annoying. Navigating the different in game and in campaign menus very frustrating. Lots of bugs random people walking in place. Not very impressed so far.-10
rma ... well what can i say? That haven't learned from the last time.. Make a better server list that doesn't suck your internet dry.. or makes you get kicked out for not being able to connect almost each and every time. I was doubing to purchase this titel but when it got on the free weekend and i played it.. well ... let's just say i'm not turning my money into this game.-10
--- Low FPS even in smallest settings with a computer which runs BF4 with good graphics easily --- No proper single player campaing --- Multiplayer servers full of rpg 
Don't but this  without 7x GTX TITAN X..  0/optimize
he games has potential but i hope u like walking and driving cause the map is comparable to the real world the map is so huge it makes the game a joke and unnecessary lag i like the idea of being able to have more room to plan attacks better but this is just insane i possibly would have liked it if they made it simple to play but the instructions were horrible and not written the games has way to much problems for me and i can already see going through hell just for 1 round of shooting. i would rather go play battfield 3 and not enough players all the games are empty except 2 and the admin kicked me out of the 1 lol and after that i tryed 1 more game then i had enough only can take so much problems in a game.-10
rash tbh Arma 2 was better-10
orst performance ever  Have to turn everything down except for the res and textures and set scaling to 100% to get 40 fps otherwise it's at 30 fps at 17% gpu-11
bought the game -rig sucked back than so set graphics to low -spawned into altis life -bought a hello kitty truck -ran over a pleb -chased by cops all the way to the northern part of the map -bought a rifle with night stalker -killed all 5 cops chasing me with -20 fps -got back in car -feeling like a pro sniper -drove into a tree -car ing explodes -UNISTALL UNINSTALL UNINSTAAAAAAAA-10/1011
my dang multiplayer servers aint popping up in the server section why it do dis its a good games but that glitch sux
 loved Flashpoint but this game has one of the worst singleplayer campaigns EVER! At some points completely unplayable. If you are into singleplayer - don't buy this game. The only thing you can enjoy here is the multiplayer which can be AWESOME at some points and it is the only reason why I have bought this game - at some point I was hoping the campaign will be at least a little enjoyable but I am very dissappointed now. I don't recommend buying this game until they fix all the issues in the campaign.-10
I have very low fps on low graphic settings in  while my PC is able to run BF 3 on ultra without any glitches having MUCH better picture. It is impossible to play this game. Very bad.
I guess im the only one who thinks this game is impossible and honestly made me think about killing myself.
It's been 'released' for a few years now and I can't help but feel like this is still an early access title.
trekking+bug+desync+low fps+a few weapons simulator
What I liked:     The tactical and simulation aspect of Arma    Very in depth shooting and cover mechanics    Open world plus challenging gunfights steep learning curve    The sheer number of vehicles weapons attachements is great   What You Need to Know:     God this game is hard to run well( got a 7870 and it looks terrible on low settings)    This game is mostly played for mods such as Altus life(lame) Exile Wasteland.    You can play Zeus or other military warfare based gamemodes too but not many up at time of playing    80% of your time playing will be boring sadly you get in a helicopter or vehicle and will die before you can get to any meaningful engagments.    You must play with a group or the enjoyment will hardly be there    I played this game only during 2 free weekends and both times wasn't enough to convince me to buy it 11 hours of trying so hard to enjoy it :(    My Score:-11
hilst being a unique and ambitious game with unparalleled scope and detail the overly complicated bindings and game-mechanics and lack of any meaningful tutorials for the more complex systems often result in frustration. This game is known for its mod-ability and whilst this is a blessing given the clunky unpolished state of much of the core mechanics the number of community mods/ variations of gameplay modes adds to the confusion and inaccessibility of the multiplayer game. The poor optimization also leads to performance issues in multiplayer regardless of system specs.   In summary- i want to love this game but its too demanding on my time and patience. This 'game' is for the Hard Core MILSIM fan only.-10
mazing concept. Amazing tactical play. Even a great community. Amazing mods.   All negated by the worst engine known to mankind. Multiplayer runs at around 10-20 frames regardless of tweaks and optmisation.  poor resource allocation.   Great game  devs.  -11
y Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead review can be seen here:  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/33930    in terms of stances and movements was a step up but felt like a step down compared to ArmA 2 due to its smaller amount of content samey feeling terrain and limited arsenal that was so small it didn't even have a single shotgun in it... until now. The AiA mod is easily avialable via workshop now meaning more can play on the many servers the require it which for the unintiated is a big deal. Instead of just the massive empty Altis and Stratis maps (which largely looked the same) classic ArmA maps such as Chernarus (Not the updated DayZ Standalone version unfortunatley)TakistanSahraniUtesPortoRahmadiZargabad (ArmA Operation Flashpoint anyone?)Proving GroundsShapurBokovinaBystrica (Basically an only slightly more accurate version of it's real life counterpart that was less detailed than the final version of Chernarus) and the generic Desert map which really has no purpose but is nice to have anyway (Oh and some completley new tropical jungle map being worked on). Not only that but ALL of the weapons from Arma 2OABAF and PMC have also returned bringing what must be at least 200 new weapons to  (And finally at least two shotguns...lol.) Still not satisfied? All the vehicles and units have also been ported. Any battle is possible now. With this much content  is practically a bargain at 30 dollars where as before it was ridiculous that they would ask that much for so little content. The only remaining issue is the game engine but it's slowly starting to run better as it's been updated to use modern hardware a lot better now. Worth a buy!

game with  physics bohemia interactive deserves to have high caliber lead thrown in their direction with extreme prejudice.   you .  I would rather have to deal with a naggy wife for the rest of my life than play this game for an hour.  Also they dont know how to use more than 10% of your processor. This is worthy of execution.-10
Optimised for supercomputers and quantum devices. Engineered to 24fps for the cinematic experience.
unoptimized piece of stinking  made by utter jews
o decent manual available. The training in the beginning does not show you how to use the sight on the gun. So the next step where you have to shoot targets in a field you have to hit one 400 yards away but there's no clear way how to use the sight on the gun. The cross hair on the screen is not accurate enough.   Wished it had a better manual because playability is paramount to graphics.-10
ith graphics made of clay and a price tag that is as bad as a call of duty game this is truly the best shooter experience of the decade.      This review is powered by NVIDIA™ Phyx™-10
ne of the most poorly optimized games I've ever played. Game feels incredibly clunky unresponsive and laggy online. Not worth the hassle.-10
or the money... well no.. this game is worth 10 times less than what i paid for it. actually i have played phone games more exciting than this.  my review for  is simple i got it on steam sale i played it 3 times. and its been pretty bad.  - the servers cause FPS lag (because I get 40fps normally on some servers and others it crawls to 9) - the missions are basically to try and troll people - the maps are big and awesome but theres not many people and whoever you see just kills you - its just boring half the time.  so if you like just exploring the virtual map and doing jack all half the time then this games for you.  but you could be doing that in the real world and have an extra $30 bucks in your wallet (sale price).  decisions decisions..-10
You'd have more fun stabbing yourself repeatedly with a rusty screwdriver.
f you've got a fetish for first person shooters and the military and happen to be rejected by a real life military branch or happen to be a mechanic or cook in the military then this game is for you. other than that move along in your real life and join the military. if you can't and happen to be in a wheel chair and love the military then buy this game and dream. -10
ingleplayer feels like Duty Calls Multiplayer feels like Red Orchestra without fun.-10
ill you be satisfied with this game? - No! Should you buy this game? - Yes!  This game is extremely imperfect. It have a lot of significant problems related to game design user interface AI multiplayer optimization realism game engine and a lot more.  But despite this this is the best military sim game which is available at this moment. In future there will be much more better game than Arma but for now you are definitely should buy this game.  At this moment there is no other game where you can fly on semi-realistic airplane land it on runway 1 km long get out from the plane and continue walking or take a ground vehicle.10
his game is very buggy I have an average graphics card that can run most of the games out there but with this game you need like a $9000 computer to even run it. The Maps are way too huge for your graphics to run smoothly I had to turn everything down and even still I was lagging like crazy. I would highly recommend playing the Battlefield series instead of this game because A. You will get more enjoyment and entertainment from Battlefield B. Your computer will be able to run it C. Better vehicle system and lots of weapons to choose from-11
iterally the worst game I have ever played in my entire history of gaming. Crashes horrible optimization extremely boring server issues buggy characters game breaking errors. How did they even get so many good reviews?? This is from MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE not some hatred or bias against . I assume that many fanboys will downvote this.-10
hile crawling at the amazing forest enjoying sights you're spotting an enemy in a bush 5 meters from you. You're making a 3 well-placed shots right into his unprotected face from your heavily modded fictional MXC(whatever that means). Blood animation confirms that you've been successful. Enemy runs into the other bushes. He probably HEAVILY injured..  This is what Arma3 is. Unpolished unfinished game with fictional weapons on a map that makes you feel yourself an alien. They should really expanded Eastern Europe theme instead =\   Arma 2 Wasteland   Wasteland-10
his really is a poor game and should not cost £36 here's why:  1) Recommended system specs are a lie. I could not run the singleplayer campaign above 30fps at 1024x768 lowest everything including draw distance with a FX6300 and HD 7770. False advertising and also extremely unreasonable hardware requirements. Fanboys will tell you  is super advanced etc. so demands a lot of the CPU but I believe it's just poorly optimised. You can have a lot of units moving about and framerates will stay smooth but as soon as people start shooting performance plummets so I believe it's something to do with badly optimised effects not demanding AI (which is pretty poor in any case). Multiplayer performance is even worse and when 20fps is considered 'normal' it's effectively unplayable. People should not accept 20fps due to game restrictions and the dev's ought to really address this.  2) Gameplay is terrible - so bad that it feels like it's buggy rather than poor design decisions. Jogging for about 10 seconds will cause you to start panting and creates extreme weapon sway - maybe they are trying to simulate a Wall-E future of fat soldiers? Again really kills the gameplay considering the size of 's missions which require a lot of moving about. Recoil on weapons is ridiculous and feels like your guy is shooting with only one hand with the gun held sideways. Damage is ridiculous enemy targets will take 2 headshots and some more chest shots to be brought down. It all adds together to completely kill immersion and makes the game feel like a chore.   3) Immersion - Again keeping in mind how bad the shooting mechanisms are the AI are utterly gamebreaking as well. You can empty a clip of bullets in a relatively small 1 meter area around an enemy target. He will not budge he will not flinch he will just keep on shooting you until you die and you probably will die because of the awful recoil system in place which makes aiming for the player impossible. The AI are basically terminators who will simply run about from time to time stand still and then shoot you to death. There is a mod which reduces recoil and with this mod a player can mow down these AI like fish in a barrel simply because they don't move once they've decided to stop and shoot you.  4) Content - Really really lacking. Okay they have a single player campaign (which is pretty dull). But what's really bad is that they seem to have left a lot of the content up to the community to develop. There is no ambient combat module in the editor unlike Arma 2 there is no SpecOps module in the editor unlike Arma 2 there is no quick mission creator unlike Arma 2. This makes a huge difference in the game because it means if you want to actually experience the sandbox of the game with AI you have to either 1) create relatively complex scripts yourself; or 2) download other missions or mods. It's not a pick-up and play game which is disappointing considering Arma 2 was.    just goes wrong in so many ways from the gunplay to the AI to the stamina and damage system (basically every aspect of a fps) and the lack easy to use content such as an ambient combat module or quick mission creator to the incredible system requirements. It really is not worth £36 and while the futuristic setting is very appealing and graphics look nice there's no real reason to get this over Arma 2 which is much better overall.  Save your money!-10
I thought this game would fix the giant mess it created in the last arma game. I was so wrong and i wasted my money on yet another stupid pile of crap. When you cant finish the tutorial because it wont tell you how to aim down the sight or tell you what the hell barring 220 is supposed to mean i give up and shoot the drill sargent. Game DELETED!
oorly optimized game engine you can have a beast of a rig and it will still run horribly.  Stop allowing this by not buying it.  For the people that have it make your reviews negaive and make it be known that this is unacceptable. They will have to eventually do something when their sales drop off.-11
I haven't played the game for 8 months.  Back at it it suddenly came-back to me: Like everything else in their life Chinese can't play a game without cheating!....  That said I would prefer not to play at all rather than to have a guy:    Showing a RED or Blue or GREEN dot on his character (as per a teammate) and shoot us all.   Teleport himself on the top of a tower.   Suicide bomb when wounded.   etc...   http://i67.tinypic.com/1671f7n.jpg   http://i68.tinypic.com/s41661.jpg  chinese cheaters  steam server  So... what can we do about it? ?? (It's happening in China.....)   -10
d give this game an honest 4 out of 10 rating. It has some pretty impressive depth but its still not a great game. I will talk about the single player  cons: -friendly AI is completely  there must not have been an infantry military advisor on this or they told him to  off or something. Friendly AI moves in a completely absurd cluster employing zero patrol formations. Friendly AI also does not shoot move or communicate at all besides the most clunky and vague methods. Due to the fact that friendly AI just walks around clustered almost all the time they instantly get suppressed by enemy AI that will put accurate fire on you from literally a mile away in game with small arms and often your friendly AI will just get obliterated and you will probably take one of those mile away rounds to the head yourself.  -Weapon sway is just ridiculous you will need to download a weapon sway mod if you dont want your optic constantly moving around in about a 15 degree swivel for no reason it makes it kiiiiiiiiinda hard to engage any contact let alone the enemy AI ing with you from a mile away that dont have optic sway.  -There is no real CQB in this game it will leave you alone to clear an entire village while the rest of your team provides security and the movement and interaction with doors and such in this game is soooooooo rough the game will often get you killed when its limitations put you in comprimising positions  -Mission briefings are a ing laugh vague and meaningless about as legit as a Mc donalds supervisor talking to his employees  -Vehicle animations are not fluid at all helicopters for example look like they are attached to marionette strings or something and vehicles look like they are super imposed on top of the ground when they drive because they dont react realisticly to the world at all in their natural movements on the road or off road  Anyone who has actually served in the military will most likely have severe problems getting over how non mil sim this game is for what it is supposed to be based on its reputation. Its ok but not worth the price tag-11
ame launcher won't load no one in the community assisted me in fixing the issue 10/10 would refund again.-11
Pile of .
Spent over 3 hours loading into a game and downloading mods. Join game where I have 5 frames and everyone yells at me. Try to change controls and control menu breaks. Get frustrated ask steam support for help. Sorry you have over 2 hours on the game. No refund. Enjoy your 5 frames and default controls :) I'm on a laptop so I don't even have numpad keys so I'm pretty much ed in the  here.
this is the problem that i have after the new update okay i open the game launch it whit the launcher and then when its loading the addons  this thing pooped up Addon 'A3-BaseConfig_F' requires addon 'A3_Weapons_F_SMGs_pdw2000' and then when i click OK the game started but whait is it working?? well only for couple seconds just until the bohemia interactive logo show up end then the game crash and this notification showd Warning:preNLOAD format in object a3\anims_f_exp\data\geom\sdr\m01_executioner.p3d again i click OK and another notification show up it said The exception unknown software execption (0x0000dead) occurred in the application at location 0x0000000075B1A6F2 that's my problem
he matchmaking is broken (As in it doesn't work) and I can't join most of the servers because I need to buy the $30 DLC. I really want to learn this game but it's too much like work.  Get a mentor or prepare to look up how to aim down the sights. I'm not kidding -10
lright  first of all : how the  am I supposed to even shoot properly in this game? Honestly . gasilion of unnecessary options such as : watch  different kinds of aiming etc . But guess what? You can't jump! I died because 0.0000001 meter wall stopped me from running away! I tried  tried to play it with my friend but he rage quited as well. This game sucks  money wasted.    Just to let you know  I'm not noob. I've been playing shooters for 8 years or more and I even participated in a E-sport competition but... this game is just...too much for me. I don't have enough patience to play it even more.   3/10 ( because graphics were good )-11
his worthless game studio instead repairing game (killing stairs as example falling through floor) they add DLC button in server browser to make more money on unfinished game. This is the only game that is crashing my PC and/or Video card in random moments witchout any reasons............. And the best part is that I'm not the only one with this problem this problem is since 2013 and they didn't bother to repair it. Instead they added go carts for money... In game about war.......... I tried to eliminate this random crashes by changeing almost all my PC components and no luck only the same parts are disc drives (i changed from HDD to SSD) and CPU (i5 4690k) everything else was changed. THEY WILL NOT GET ANY MORE OF MY MONEY IF THEY DON'T REPAIR THIS CRASHES FIRST!-11
Don't even get me started with this .
I would suggest you don't buy this game and just go play other stuff and try to be happy because quite frankly it gave me the worst gaming experience I've ever had after 12 years of gaming.
hat a pile of **** needs heavy updates.-10
ownloaded Game into steam Played for 40 Hours total. Game disapeared from computer. Redownloaded Played for a while Game disapeared again. As someone with a download cap and 2 other gamers in the house was. not. impressed.-10
ecommended graphic settings: Ultra Starts game 22 FPS and laggs - Sets the Graphic settings to Very Low 22 FPS and laggs...  -- Buys a new GTX Titan  Starts game and plays for a while...  23 FPS and laggs.  Thank you Bohemia Interactive for yet another  brilliant  graphic consuming game... I think my GPU is just complete . 16GB of Dedicated Video-Ram just isn't enough for  I guess..-10
too expensive
his game has not worked on my machine. I bought it but there is no way to get a refund or sell it or anything. When I go to the makers of the game they say to go to steam for a refund. When I go to steam they so go to the other guys. 60.00 down the drain for a game that I cant play. This will be the last game I download and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone-10
The worst game in the series. 1 run - 1 screenfreeze. The issue has been reported to BIS many times but they do nothing. Waste no money! Don't buy the game!
Briliance...
he game would be good if they dident spam you with the TUCKING APEX thing all dam day Plus half the stuff in the game you cant USE becuase you need to buy the APEX to use it..................-10
et me start off saying that the gameplay and the overall game is the best thing I've ever played. One of the most realistic military games out there but however the game has alot of errorsbugs and fps problems that needs to be fix some but errors are the biggest one's. Errors can keep from playing your game and that sucks when you pay a good amount of money for the game. I not trying to say the game is bad. I'm just saying you need to be ready for the errors you will get and some of them will take alot of time to fix it for yourself if you don't know what your doing. you just might not fix them at all and not get to play it.-10
he worst AI ever even mods cant fix that dumb AI. doesnt worth 60$-10
Just get Arma 2 its better and cheaper.
he gameplay in itself is actually quite good and enjoyable. Technically this game isn't all that great. It is optimised horribly (extreme cpu utalization) it's just laggy all around. And yes i meet the hardware requirments. So if you have the chance to try this game out before buying i strongly recommend that. If it's running smooth on your pc it's a game worth playing.-10
he community is toxic af and almost all the game modes are DayZ like mods or RP. It could've been such a good game but it's garbage. Don't waste money on this.  Also:  ??????????????????????? ??????????????????????? ???????????????????????  ??????????????????????? ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????ArmA ???????????? ???????????????????????-11
ave to download 1000 mods just to play multiplayer. So that's pretty cool. Also servers are .-10
ere you a former player of Arma 2? Do you want to play a game that connects both FPS and real time strategy in one wanting to be a hero and a leader? - then this game is not for you.  This game is for people who wants to spend money on a uncomplete game then spend more money being commercial spammed to spend even more on DLCs and then on top of that you get to spend more money to get a reserved slot on the PVP elements of the game.  If you enjoy just dying in a game this is the right game for you when you play on the online servers you will be blown up over and over again by a distant A10 air to ground fighting aviator that can see your motorized veichles anywhere on the map with precise precision - this is the perks that players that initial bought the game that has progressed way further than a new comer than you will possess.   Unless your buying the game from someone thats selling his account with all weapons unlocked and a infinite pool of money for good veichles in PVP element to start off with then i recommend you not to buy this piece of junk. Its sad that such a good graphical game being a development from the past Arma series turned so  both in gameplay balance poor community and being slaves to commercial of money begging.-11
well spent 60 euros on the game and says my ip is reported for spam      how the  is that possible i never spammed anyone
ros:   Extensive weapon penetration system Engaging story (black guy dies) Nice Graphics    Cons:  Same model for Rocket Launchers for Independent Blufor and Opfor usiing different skins Same model for Armoured Transport for Independent Blufor and Opfor usiing different skins DLC that should have been included in base game Go-Karts  _______________________   GET ARMA 2-11
 didn't even own the game for 30 mins didn't even get to play except when they we're offering to play it for FREE! And I was GLOBAL BANNED. wtf. That isn't right that's called fraud.-10
orst ing campaing ever honestly.   Like how are you supposed to know where the  they are? *Middle of war trying to get to safe point* Hurry! *Hears gun shots* That's normal in a war. Ah what the ? I was shot? *Looks around* Exactly 0 exposure though... *Dies* WHAT THE  IS THIS?   Also you need DLC's for the good stuff. Pay to win? Yes.  campaing? Yes. Did I alt+f4 in the middle of the campaing because of t? Yes. Do I recommend it? No.-10
otal waste of my money if I had the chance to refund I would totaly get my money back. Go and buy Squad.-11
ad performance  stamina system buggy as  (played chernarus and the ground was white...) the movement system and animations suck they take way too long and player controls are funky and inaccurate overall 2/10 good idea bad in practice-10
ack of content such as weapons and vehicles (vs. previous games) empty greek islands with debatable level design singleplayer campaign old game engine graphics &amp; physics low quality audio &amp; voip poorly designed and broken user interface (feels more like a 'point-and-click' game than a first person shooter) d-sync and fully priced 'pay-2-win' dlcs for the weak minded.-11
I run a unit for  unit and all I have to say is get a good group of guys and play with them and do it like t supposed to be (Tactically) and you will have the best time ever! HIGHLY Recommended!
 lot of grass and a long draw distance don't make games beautiful. It just runs slowly and looks ugly. Better lighting and colors would have helped a lot. The scenarios have very poor voice acting and no suspense at all. The controls are just idiotic. And it thinks I want to play with my Xbox Controller just because I have it plugged in. So I have to unplug that controller every time I want to play the game. I don't know what they were thinking but this game is one of the worst shooters I've ever played.-11
t is great that i bought a game with 2d editor and now someone dicides that i can't use it... no question I can send back my game.. and i want my money back. STUPID POLICY of Bohemia... should be punnished I want my game.. with all components.. I PAIED FOR IT!!! and i want it!!!!!!!!!!! for god sake.-11
Good  m8. I give it a solid ????/?????
his game was such a disappointment I have a fx 9590 8 core and a r9 290x the 450$@ launch one XFX double D (it has 5Ghz mem clock instead of 2.5ghz and i get   frame-rates so if i dont have a Nvidia card i cant enjoy this game?  YOU!-11
not worth $54.99
AWESOME! GET IT!
ou know what's t?  Paying $40 for a game then having to pay $60+ for content... in order to play the game.  This  should already be in the game itself.-10
Buy. This. Game.
game of the year
If you want to buy this game to play coop with your friend - never try do this. The only reason to do it is if you want to see 'server is not responding' all the time you want to connect.  It is very strange that such an easy issue is still not solved in 2014. Don't spend your money on this game.
n absouloutly SH*T game. Cannot stress enough how bad i find it. The minimal gamemodes along with their boring opportunities make this game a complete waste of money. £40 for this? It's not worth £10! In the near future it may improve; it needs to improve drastically to appeal to me at least. As a simulator outstanding. As a game made to play for enjoyment and having fun useless. I find more fun in the Call of Duty and Angry Birds franchise. Not Fun! Not Enjoyable! Not Worth It! Bohemia need to up their game or they will definately DEFINATELY decrease in sales. Do Not Buy This Piece of Horse Crap.-10
ars in this game are absolutly terrible.. Not to mention the mad desync causing you to crash your vehicles into your friends and ending any chance of a successful fun game. Honestly. TOO BROKEN.-10
mazing game the fps isnt to good tho.10
This game make my  bleed. You have to waste 3 hrs in order to play 30 min because it is filled with  bugs and it isnt optimized for mods. Game for autists 0.69/19
ot the game for me it has very good graphical detail but that is about it. Multiplayer is very laggy and borderline unplayable controller support is listed as a feature however only a select few controls can be mapped to it - Making playing with it extremely difficult.  I bought into it when it was £20 in early alpha I would not pay £40 for it now and I'm glad I didn't.-10
Most realistic army simulator? more like the most realistic b*llsh*t simulator. This game is about as unrealistic as whales with detachable pen*ses that fly to jupiter and f*ck jupiters babies while on steroids. I can name 3 games more realistic than this right now. World of Warcraft. Toontown. Fapville on steroids extreme. THOSE ARE ALL 10x MORE REALISTIC. But if you wanna hear the big black juicy good parts of this game well here they are. This game features breaking your legs from 3 foots drops. dying from jumping out of a vehicle moving 2 KPH. Dying from drowning in an enclosed submarine. DERPING FROM LSD THAT YOU GOT FROM A F*CKING HOBO. but best of all dont forget the jerk circles. (this review was made entirely for comedy purposes) serious part ----- this game is pretty bad and they keep making it worse
ou'll shoot your eye out kid! Well maybe if you could figure out how to shoot.-10
This game freaking sucks big balls!
s is typical for Russian developers there is little foresight applied to teaching game mechanics. The learning curve is steep and harsh. The AI ridiculously god like.   If battling an uphill struggle wearing nothing but boxer briefs while burly vikings throw large barrles full of stones down at you sounds like a good time then  is for you.-10
LITERALLY the worst game I have ever played
Maybe if it was possible to use sights.
igh....   is a First person military simulator..... and there's the problem. Simulators are notoriously buggy and dificult to optimise notoriously unforgiving  and above all notoriously dull. Unfortunately  suffers in all these areas to some degree or another.  Online multiplayer is undoubtly the heart of the game ( as shown by the frustrating AI in the rather soulless single player campaign ).  Without teamwork howerver the game quickly can devolve into a run and gun shooter unsuited to the simulator style severity of gameplay... GOOD LUCK finding any real teamwork on the great majority of online servers.  Perhaps the only servers displaying such teamwork are the hardcore milsim servers playing invade and annex....by their nature impenetrable to newbies.  Which leaves........well not much.....probably best avoided.  ( Dear fanboys please consider that i really did try to like this game.....even through gritted teeth)  A game you'll come to loathe.... if you've the good sense (addendum)-10
doesnt run well even tho its optimized ™
f you like games that are to hard and are not enjoyable to any extent go head waste your 60 bucks on this game... game is extremely laggy horrible hardware optimization and online play is a joke... if your look to get anywhere close to 60 fps max settings you better have a top dollar machine.  Story mode is ok if you like getting shot at and never knowing if you hit the enemy or not ....-10
he controls and gameplay are way too clunky for me. I don't get the appeal it has for people maybe I missed something?-10
IS really hoping for the community to fix their game even more arcade than ARMA 2 still can't deploy bipod since first ARMA lack of content 6 month waiting and the only good updated one is SP really hoping  will be as good as ARMA 2 but the reality it isn't  welcome to the  reality-10
antastic Graphics could be a really good game if they would stop screwing with it. The AI walk through things all the time shoot through things Fall into hills mountains you name it. Every time they do an update it screwes all the maps up and some things now cannot be fixed yet Like Events and objectives. This does not occure 1 or 2 times its everytime they update. They are not interested in fixing it just make the mappers do it. Im not wasting my next 6 months with this crap. and BTW if you think the bare min requirements will work fine then I hope you like playing solo. We have all had to do major upgrades and still runs buggy. I just do not undersdtand why the hell you would make a game that cant keep up with todays processors-10
 This game is for the hardcore frankly it's not for me. But this is my review on the game and what it is not just my very limited experience. Let's say you are dissapointed by how untactical modern shooters are like call of duty and even sadly battlefield. If you want a game in which death actually means something and where you have to coordinate attacks for a chance of success then really play this. That or you can go sell coke on altis life. Your choice.   TLDR: I don't really care about this game. It's not a bad game it was just a waste of my paticular money. Go buy it if your friend said to.-10
verall I would give it a 1/10 why? Because this game sucks. Every server I joined was extremely laggy and seemed like nobody seemed to know what the hell they were doing and yes I joined other servers than Wasteland. I find the guns horrible and inaccurate and yes I'm aware that it is supposed to have some sort of realism in it (that's why the vehicles are so realistic right?) but the guns feel like they are to inaccurate for me at ranges 300+ I find it hard to hit anything while in ARMA 2 I could hit a tire on a moving car. The only reason I didn't give it a 0 is because of the ragdolls.   Edit: The campaign was horrible I mean I realize that ARMA is really known for its voice acting but I mean come on it could've improved a LITTLE bit the campaign was extremely boring and I had to speed it by 4x to even be able to play it the story was stupid and I'm glad I didn't play long.-10
ughh. waste of money...
ell what can I say my uncle got me the game for my 15'th birthday here we are 2 years later and I still play the game with him when I get the chance I highly recommend  either solo or with friends.   The campaign is reasonably well done but the real reason I play is for the mulitplayer there is a range of game modes that range from casual that you can play with friends and have a good laugh then you have the super hardcore modes I haven't personally played the hardcore modes but I have heard good things about it the immersive gameplay being told what to do and waiting 2 hours before engaging some enemies and then being told to stand down.  10/1010
Banned for someone elses fault Period Life in altis gets givin million bux BI bans me  you Bohema!  you!
 year ago i tried to play  with my old pc but unfortunately i couldn't play the game because of huge fps drops and screen tearing isssues. I was very disappointed because my pc was still good enough to reach recommended requirements. After that i decided to invest all my summer job salary to a new pc. I spent huge amount of money to my new beast pc rig (cpu i7-4790k gpu gtx 980 ram 16gb etc...) just to find out that i still couldn't play . My average frames per second is about 25-30 and i have noticed a lot of screen tearing.  WARNING: GAME IS POORLY OPTIMIZED!-10
h wtf is with the controls and player handling? Seriously eventhough the graphics is 10/10 the player controls brings the game down to 2/10. The UI is also horrendous. Find a better UX desinger already.-10
The worst game in the world... full of try hard s
NEVER BUY GAMES FROM TRADING SITES!!! YOU CAN GET A REVOKED GIFT LIKE I DID!!! PLEASE UPVOTE THIS REVIEW TO KEEP IT ALIVE!!!
Pretty .
ARMA III HELICOPTERS While exiting a helicopter it hit me and I died. I tried again and my parachute didnt deploy. I tried again and I died from hitting the air hard enough(WTF)  ARMA III GROUND VEHICLES My tank hit a fence and broke down. My truck did a flip on a 1 cm high pebble and crushed me. A quad bike nipped the back of my truck which caused it to explode as if it was hit by a rocket.   ARMA III PVP People go under the ground and shoot you. You get fatigued from walking 2 metres but a red dot sight will cure that for you somehow. You swap kills a lot because of lag.   ARMA III GRAPHICS  Graphics can be good but high end computers lag.   ARMA III FUN Doesnt exist.
his is absolute BULL####! The fact that there are only TWO helicopters and BOTH are for TRANSPORT!? Are you even serious about keeping your community base Bohemia? I swear it from this day onwards that I will NOT support any of your games that are released EVER in my life again - and you most definitely will not catch me reccomending this lackluster effort of a game to ANYONE - on the contrary I will make an active effort to warn others away from purchasing this piece of ####!  First you release a game in alpha and promise that the entire game will be ready in the next few months it took you over a year and a half just to release a SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN. HOW can you call it a game when it does not even have a single player campaign?   Then you rip off your community by charging $15 for an obvious last minute effort to release a DLC to get a quick bit of money? #### you and your company. Seriously. The expectation for this DLC was atleast 10 different helicopters in mutiple roles - from new attack helicopters and support helicopters from offering different utilities such as possible winching functions? Yet you are determined to destroy a great franchise and name for a game with your lackluster efforts in releasing both game content and support.  I hope I am not the only person who feels this way and that the word is spread because I hope that with these efforts that your company actually hits the banks and liquidates because frankly the ARMA reputation would be held more intact with you going bankrupt than with your current efforts.  -This is coming from a veteran ARMA player who has bought into your franchise for many years (just check my steam library if you doubt this).  LONG STORY SHORT:  DO NOT BUY THIS DLC THE DLC PACK OR EVEN  THE GAME AS YOU ARE GAURENTEED TO BE RIPPED OFF BY MONEY-HUNGRY LACKLUSTER LAZY PROGRAMMERS THAT HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER TO RUIN THE NAME OF A GREAT FRANCHISE. THE GAME IS AVERAGE AT BEST AND ANY GAME CONTENT PROMISES ARE EMPTY AND LACK DELIVERY. BOHEMIA NEEDS TO BUCK UP BEFORE ANYONE SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER PURCHASING ANY OF ITS GAMES OR DLC'S.-10
uy arma 2 insted this is crap. -10
kay i have  since 4 days and actually PLAYED the game for maybe 2 hours. The Campaign and showcases are fun and the mechanics work as they should. So me and a friend got some mods from the workshop and maps from armaholic. And we built two big fun missions. Mine didnt work. I hosted and he got stuck at Wait for Host. We tried everything the internet told us. Nothing worked. So we built short stupid missions to actually play and shoot a bit. Then we wanted to try his mission with another guy. He didnt even made it onto the server eventhough he had all the mods. I got stuck on the briefingmap because the host wasnt shown as 'on the map'. Some other time i also got stuck on recieving data but only once. We host over LAN with Hamachi and are really  off after only 4 days of 'playing' the game. We had much fun with ArmA 2 and tons of mods back in the good ol days and as ArmA 2 died we mourned a long time. Now we thought  would be a new beginning and we could relive the old times with mods and self-made fun missions with cops zombies aliens and all that stuff that worked in ArmA 2.  But nope.  So im very sorry to give it a thumbs-down because i really love the game but without a working MP its just an empty shell.  RIP good ol ArmA times-11
this game is some cheecks. Multiplayer in a nuthshell: many people doing nothing while a teammate mows you down from a helicopter
after putting 1500 hours into the game i can say there is nothing appealing about it.
Very good and realistic game but why I have 25-30 fps on multiplayer and 60 fps on singleplayer?Really?Servers are also laggy
obile games. Get the free version and there are ads. Pay small amount of money and ads go away.  . No free version. Pay 40$ and theres ads. Buy all the dlc and ads go away....for a short while then another dlc is released and more ads show up.   Gameplay is decent as long is your ping is good and you find a half decent server which is almost impossible.  Dlc isnt even worth it. Only reason i bought any dlc in the first place was to get rid of the damn ads.-11
 Only reason Im giving this game a negative review is because BattleEye Anti-Cheat System and  of Bugs with mods after Apex  Before Apex I could play on every single server that existed in game just downloaded mods and ready to go but after Apex came out  got real. BattleEye can't update signature missmatch for mods (that are downloaded from Workshop) server not respoding battleye can't connect to master server/firewall block. Its a great game that is worth every pennie loads of action diffrend mods diffrent gameplay open world but until this 'BattlEye – The Anti-Cheat Gold Standard' more like  standard gets fixed or replaced im not comming back.-11
ntil they learn how to optimize there game it's just not worth a buy. Even on a good pc this game runs like a turd. sad.-11
Amazing game. Has some rough edges and some game features i liked in arma 2 that arent here but oh well :D
ll Arma games suffer from the same issue unfortunately.   Buggy as hell and has more buttons than a NASA space craft.-10
ealy its crap still my computer should be able to run it atleast in medium setting. if i play single missions its resoable stable but when i go for multi player. than  hits the fan big time.  masive lag textures not loading properly crashing because of memory errors  wtf is going on ARMA was such a great brand releable and good system. now its totaly crap. people keep saying i need to go to win 64 and up my memmory of my maching i say frag that i should be able to run it on this machine acording to the tech specs.  so fragging fix it so i can play.-10
I didn't like how in order to get into a highly populated server you had to have a subscription or sign up for some website just in order to be put on the waiting list for a spot to get in. Not a game I'd recommend
0 dollars for content that should be in the base game....ha ha ha. Bohemia has become money hungry every year there turning more and more into EA.   Before  downvote this The base game has barely any content copy paste vehicles for opposing forces.   Now they charge:  $30 F***ing dollars for some unique vehicles and a map.  $12 for f***ing 3 helicopters  $12 for f***ing 4-5 guns.  $2 for  go-karts.....WHY??? -10
 game that could be amazing but is completely broken by all the completely illogical bugs. Let's start with the absolutely horrendous framerate this is not something based in inadequate hardware. Once you start playing on a server you may notice 100+ fps things are moving along nicely. This means you managed to strike gold and entered a freshly booted server. As soon as you get into a small community the framerate drops. To insanely low levels. &lt;45 fps is hardly uncommon. This happens on every single server. Once the server is rebooted your 100&lt; fps is back. This is of course just the tip of the iceberg. Every single staircase on all three maps will  you up. You get stuck in them you teleport around you fall through them. Amazing stuff when you're running up a tower while being shot by everyone including their grandmas.  Once we've started handling this usually rememdied by running in fully standing position you're still getting rubber band lag and all kinds of incontrollable spastic movement. Amazing. But here's the real piece of the pie - the server browser is the worst browser I've EVER had to handle. Not only does it send you flying to another server when you select one but refreshing the server list even with decent constraints it's a major gamble. Will you find ANY server at all? Probably not. Okay let's restart the server browser then. No. Of course not you have to restart the whole ing game to even have a chance. But no usually you still find absolutely nothing what so ever. Okay so you give up and decide that 40 minutes of trying to enter a server is way too much. OH hell look  keeps running even though you closed it 5 minutes ago. And you've suddenly got no internet connection. Supposedly this is due to some overloading of routers but have fun trying to solve that issue. Nothing helps. You just need to wait it out. Or reset your router. Or restart your computer.. Nothing helps in any consistent manner.  I love the gameplay I love the slow paced sniping and the huge amounts of features. Too bad you can't ing play it.-11
t feels like soldiers who have never played a videogame made ARMA III.  This game is the most unintuitive glitchty mess I've seen in a long time. Simply not enjoyable to play. Annoyingly it seems so promising as a large-scale shooter but it just doesn't have the quality to really satisfy that niche. The optimization is abysmal; completely unplayable problems arising from strange performance issues are frustratingly common. There are common glitches that break the game such as ladders and walls magically killing you. It's not worth the money for this kind of attention to detail.  Do not buy ARMA games unless the devs suck your  in return.-10
session lost all the time and i try to uninstall and install the game and cant play in any server .to much problems with this game !!!!!!!!!
 Should you get it? That Depends.  What is it? A Future War Simulation game.  Pros: Large Maps Large Weapon Selection Fully Upgradable Weapons Large Vehicle Selection Large Community Large Variety of Game-Modes.  Cons: Goes from very slow-based action to sudden moments of speed... It can be disorientating. You will die many many times. You will rage many many times. Your game will bug out many times. You will randomly disconnect from servers many times. You will have no-idea what you're doing many times. You will accidentally crash your car and burn to death many many times. You will spend 90% of your time customising your character only to die and have to repeat it.  But the main question is: Will you have fun? To that I say: Hell yeah.10
h wow. Another DLC package included edition.-10
O NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE TO ROLEPLAY AS A MILITARY DUDE OR SOMETHING. YOU WILL LITERALLY WALK AROUND FOR 8 HOURS TRYING TO GET TO ONE PLACE. If you really like that kind of stuff why not just join the army ?-10
ill me my friend made me get and i though this game wasnt immersive enough-11
ot a great game but a great community.    Ok the game is great as well.10
oring game you spend most of the time running around trying to spot some pixels in the distance. Yes that's probably realistic but it's not much fun. Particularly when one of those pixels shoots you and you have to revert to a point 20 minutes earlier. Also seems to involve huge amounts of walking around without really doing much. Again realistic but not much fun.-10
charged me an additional 39 dollars locking my game and support won't help. Don't buy.
Fantastic gameplay// Horrible performance Under 20fps on multiplayer (high end rig)
nfinished so its bad-10
till not sure why I bought this game... it's never fun to play overly technical the controls are ing horrible and even after all that you still just get randomly sniped een if you know what's going on. also the people that play this alot are a bunch of inbred hicks... if you don't believe me join any random server and just listen to voice chat.-10
This is an army shooty game where no one wants to actually shoot at real players. There are only servers for co-op AI-hunts or playing pretend dressup with their armyguy dolls on RP servers.
he single player campaign is virtually unplayable isn't enjoyable and just becomes more difficult and frustrating the more you play mostly due to AI enemies that can see you hiding behind a forest 7 miles away and then shoot you right between the eyes before you've even had time to find the prone key. YES I know it's supposed to be a simulation but I at least would like to feel good while playing it and not slowly develop post traumatic stress disorder like a real soldier would.  This game gets some points back for the active multiplayer community and great mods that are available and it looks great when it's not lagging but the disappointment of the single player campaign still lingers and is a stink that's hard to shift.-10
 might be mistaking but i will talk for myself only!  At first i saw  in sale so i say lets buy this game! Wow wait lets see the system requirements. So i see that my system is way way better than the RECOMMENDED  and i buy it! next day i run the game for the first time i run the tutorial and everything looks fine. I love the fact that the map is so close to reality according to where you are! For example the place KAVALA at Greece was extremely close to reality! And the environment just amazing!There the problem starts!  Even when a helicopter comes close i have a huge fps drop to 5-10 frames!   And im like why the hell is this happening? i meet the recommended and more!  So i decide to run the auto detection and let the system decide! After a while the system decides to put everything at low quality so i can play the game smooth! YEAH IN MY DREAMS! i met 30 fps max in a fight situation!  So i really dont know who the hell i have to blame! blame my system? i cant cuz my system has 2 gb vram hd 7850 i have i7 cpu i have 8gb ram etc!  So what i did was simple. REFUND. never touch a game from this company again!  -11
Nothing worked waste of money
 dont reccomend  its just not up to my standard's it needs to completely remake its engine and then i would be happy.  Performance = Rubbish (even on a high end systems)  Gameplay = great for playing with people  Muiltplayer = mulitplayer is almost unplayable due to the performance issues  Content = the content is really good just that most of it is useless and the work should have been spent working on optimizations. they are working on dlcs and other things for the game but hardly any work is spent on making the game more playable   Final conclusion this game is half complete and need serious work to be up to par with modern game engines.-10
Very laggy in multiplayer.
makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give  its long lifespan. Unfortunately  is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here until Bohemia's support starts paying off.-11
o far I love the game's difficulty and community around it. However the AI is broken. Multiple times I have found a patrolling unit or AI sqaud member crashing vehicles into walls. I like the game but I am giving it a thumbs down as to draw attention to this issue.-10
erfect example of a 'Dad' game. Unless you derive fun from dicking about in sandbox servers you'd need to be retired to get the most out of this clumsy game. My military geek friend convinced me to by this and I regret it.-11
 dont like it because so many servers need mods and dlcs for money. Its a nice game for people into the military tactics and such. I personally don't recommend this game unless if its sold for 15$-10
aste of my money. The people who developed this game to be like actually war literally had no clue what they were doing. One thing apparently an enemy soldier can fire accurately at a 500 meter target or more that is moving at full sprint and can take them out. That would almost never happen in real life but in the game it happens like every two seconds. Second of all the fatigue and weapon sway are stupid. I can run for like three seconds and the soldier is almost out of breath and can't hit crap even when prone. I'm a private in the Army and I could run a mile and then immediately take a knee and fire at a 300 meter target and hit it. Third thing I can be maybe 50 meters or less from an enemy I can't see because they are over some type of hill or behind a rock or a building and I can't hear them in game before I see them which again is not realistic. This is ridiculous.-11
t's like ArmA 2 but 3.10
multiplaye/co-op refuses to work after hours and hours of tying still no joy. can not find or join my friends server...waste of money.
s a long time fan of the series I wanted to love this game but I just can't recommend it right now. The developer has gone overboard with the DLC overcharging for just about every addition to the game. I bought the complete game last year with all the DLC and now I'm already unable to use content that has been added since then to the point where the game is almost unplayable.   Want to play a mod that has DLC in it that you don't have? Good luck. I was playing Altis Life and picked up the most basic pistol in the game only to find out it's now considered DLC and therefore neither me nor my friend could use it. Not only that but now this game has almost constant in-game POPUPS that block your view make it impossible to look down your sights ALL DURING THE HEAT OF COMBAT. You can't make this stuff up see for yourself:   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827632355   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827632391   The game engine is a huge improvement over Arma 2 the maps are brilliant but the weapons and vehicles are okay at best and the DLC popups completely ruin the game. Avoid this blatant money grab. I won't be purchasing any more DLC because I'm not going to reward this nonsense.-10
rather not spend an extra $70 on dlc 2 play multiplayer xddd gonna go get squad instead
It's like Day Z but worse.
would rather buy winrar
i like this game they should add the hovering jet back from arma 2.....this game is Smexy
ummary: Tensions rise as NATO peacekeeping forces begin to leave The Republic of Altis: a strategic fault-line between crumbling European influence and a powerful resurgent East. But when a key radar facility drops off the grid a Mediterranean flashpoint risks escalating into global conflict.   Also Gameplay: The engine is a big step up over ArmA 2. Things like the adjustable stances dynamic fog physics and underwater terrain add tons of possibilities in the game. Setting: This is one of my major problems with the game. Sci-fi and simulation don't mix well. While I know that everything in the game is possible the fact remains that most vehicles and weapons are pure speculation. The equipment not being used in present day armed forces partly kills the immersion for me. Hopefully ACE mod will fix this. SP content: The campaign (so far) is awesome. BI managed to improve the storytelling and the gameplay as well as the realism. MP: performance in MP can be horrible depending on the gametype and server. I don't often find populated servers with interesting gametypes as there only seem to be 2 popular gametypes on public servers. Collapse10
OULD REFOUND FOR SURE. This is sooo badno real gameplay in the story mode. Online? Unless you get the expansion that costs 25 pounds I don't think you will have fun. This is a sandbox game...-11
yes. A huge game with lot of fine stuff in it. Its really fun to play actually..... BUT; you gonna reconize very soon what ruins this game again: - if you think you put 1500€ into a gaming machine and though arma would run proper.... forget it.... in singleplayer you wont get troubles but in multiplayer. Some server run with 50 players or more and thats simply too much for this game. Gotta be honest it depends on the mod you play but compared to singleplayer its a huge framedrop-difference. - as you noticed its 2014..... this games has bugs that takes you back in the 90s..... it seems to me as its still in alpha maybe beta now; 45€ aint justifiable!!!! ..... and for sure not the dlc that includes 2 chopper for 13€..... cmon the community can make better add-ons and doesnt want any money for it! - if the fun isnt ruined by the stuff i already mentioned it will after you noticed youre hard work was wasted by a hacker. You need to seperate a good gamer and the fact that 3rd person can be very tricky if used smart or the fact that its not like hitting stuff in COD or it can take up to 5 bullets or even thermal-attachments was used with a hacker-child that uses god-mode and hits anything with his aimbot..... or even more annoying stuff like finish a whole game by probably 1 click...... 80 peoples will lose all their stuff by 1 hacker..... how can bohemia make it that easy to hack its game?.... im not talking about a hacker once a month....... if you have some game experience after a while (im personally talking about 600h+) you will notice them in almost ANY SERVER!!! and dont think they get caught...... steam wont support your work with finding and banning the hacker... of course not .... its like 'hmm the more hacker there are the more player dont wanna play this game anymore.... and what will they do? ..... buy a new steam-game!!!!! perfect lads'..... this game is death good bye!-10
Arma III is for real men... One shot one kill... 2 hours for just begin the first chapter... Enemy see you before you.. In brief : a real war's simulator. But ok : it's lagging...
Seems like a fun game! Quite a bit more complicated than point-and-click so I uninstalled it.
Don't expect to be able to play multiplayer unless you have a PhD in computer networking.
too realistic  except for the bit about iran being the bad guys p.s free weekend is nice but i want skyrim free weekend you s
This game is broken  The new launcher update broke the game for 45% of users  IS HORRIBLE DON'T BUY IT WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK!!!!!
roken POS  dwarden plays favourites within the community will hand out bans for some yet not others. Clearly purple circle club happening in the dev modding commuinity between  dwarden foxhound for armaholic unsung devs all a pack of paracidical cockroachs who have no people skills  preferbaly need a bullet in the head.-11
eed some pulish the game its really cool with physx and good graphics. they need fix multiplayer for now . beta ends soon on september.2013  i hope the game will have more freatures and stuff overf pass the beta test thanks for this good game10
ou have to have a really really powerful computer or enjoy the low frame rate. You'll get in start playing and then when you want to pick up a sniper you'll have to pay for them or shooting will be near impossible. If you want to use some of the vehcials then you need to pay for DLC. ARMA 2 never forced you to pay extra to actually play the game how you want. It let you play it. Bohemia are just trying to screw you out of as much money as they can.-11
Used to be a great game...Now it is CONSTANTLY harrassing you about downloading the latest DLC. What a shame.
could not stop dancing and doing tae kwon do.   8/10
Its alright.
COD IS MUCH MORE REALISMTIC. DUMB ARMA HAS NO KILLSTREAKS AND THE CHEAP GAME HAS NO ULTIMATES.  IF YOU WANT GUD MULITRARY SIMOLATUR BUY CALLOF DUTY 5. NOTHINGI S MIRE REALSIMISTIC.  BUT ARMA IS FUNNER FOR N00BS SO I GIVE THE DAUMEN HIGH!
If this game could be optimized better this would be a fun game.
This game has more bugs than the amazon rain forest. I rate 9/11
Had to wait for the dlc to jump.  ??????????????????????? ??????????????????????? ???????????????????????  ??????????????????????? ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????Jumping?????????? ???????????????????????
ad since alpha the game's pretty damn neato but my parents fight a lot :(11
ORST PURCHASE EVER!!!!!!  There is literally NO FUN IN THIS GAME if you don't purchase DLCs !!!!  THEY LITERALLY SELL EVERY ING THING IN THE GAME!! GUNS CHOPPERS CLOTHES MAPSect. WTF?  This game is basically a DLC game.   and what's worse? 21FPS at the LOWEST SETTING.....(I5 + GTX970 + 16G DDR3).......are you kidding me???-11
Requires a high grade computer to run dont waste your money
is aweful!  Engine outdated stupid Community and Apex is unnecessary.  Arma is a b*tch!-11
he game is good but then after buying the 3499€ game you have to buy the 2999€ APEX DLC to even go online so the price of the game is 6498€. For that price you can buy minecraft and overwatch (non origens edition) and stil have some money. And dont get me started on all the oder DLCs for 2147€.-10
o you all know this game it's ArmA.  However if you want to actually play the game you need to purchase all the weapon DLC's to actually be able to use half of the weapons in maps like Wasteland or KotH.  Don't particularly want to buy the game over for the 4th time now.   It wouldn't even be so bad if they didn't COVER YOUR ENTIRE SCREEN AT RANDOM if you happen upon a DLC weapon or armour (assuming you can pick it up) with watermarks making it hard to see in the middle of combat.  Heaven forbid I want to use a Ghillie suit that I bought from the (wasteland) store without having to dodge watermarks.-10
is a military simulator. It's so hardcore almost to the point of it being painfull. The campaign is not the most fun. You don't get the feeling of wanting to finish it. The multiplayer is full of lag and desync. Another thing that you NEED TO CONSIDER is that you will need a top of the line Intel Core i7. But even though you will still end up playing at around 30-50 fps. You may be asking what about just turning down the graphics? Not worthit as you will get about a 5 fps difference for playing on low versus ultra.-11
his game has some serious performance issues. For starters it's 32 bit which is never a good thing in that department. The thing that really upsets me though is that I have a decent machine (GTX 1080 i7 4790k) and yet I still have constant lag spikes that are super annoying and make the game unplayable at some times. The lag spikes are persistent no matter what I am doing. They even happen in the game menu. After some advice from my friends I spent $80 buck on some high-end RAM only to end up with no noticeable difference. The only thing would be left is the HDD however even that is fine as far as performance goes. This is the only game that I have issues with and it sucks because I really enjoy the gameplay.-10
ou can shoot up a school sad part is that there's no kids inside :C-10
his game is very realistic. I cannot however for the life of me understand why it is so difficult to design a launcher that will auto download all the mods you will need for a server. CS:GO does this automatically so I don't understand why this cannot. You will get cancer from this game if you try to play anything but vanilla and vanilla  is boring af. Until they fix this I cannot reccommend this game until its on sale for at least 50% off.-10
 drove a go-cart and ran somebody over.  Rating: 10/1011
noptimized gar no matter the rig. Not worth 60 -10
It always chrashes no matter what i play and there seems to be no fix
crap game! we could do better than this laggy crap with the hardware we have now a days. Als full of thieving !  avoid!!!!!!!!!!!!!
his game was just too slow for me.. Some servers are 'meh' at best. The maps are so large and the server populations are so low its a very slow experience.   I've tried several of the game modes which does tend to make for a different play experience but for me I like combat atleast every 3-5 mins in a game versus running/driving/flying across maps for 10 mins to get to the action.       -10
so i got this game and wont even let me install it or show in my library but to my friends it says i have it wtf.....
 would not get this game until after it fully comes out. The game is in what still appears to be an alpha stage in which there is very little content. They need to keep coming out with new vehicles and guns in order for this game to be worth buying. Right now I would recommend ARMA 2 before this game as ARMA 2 has much more content.-10
bsolutly Amazing army simulator Great with friends if you wanna try something tactical. GREAT Game and love the custom maps which people make. Very high quality and considered and can keep for entertained forever! Great Game. 9/10 Con: The only con i have is the AI is very skilled when it comes to where you are they know very much. but thats the only downside i have.10
a very good all around game
 isn't worth the price. For $10 maybe... But we all know how greedy Bohemia interactive is.  The game is so-so even if you have friends who will play it for you.  There is only so much you can do on an island with 20+ weapons and a handfull of vehicles. Even the level editor is kind of basic. Optimization is MUCH better than ARMA2 but is still  poor leaving the game looking disgusting no matter how good your rig is. You can get a good hour of fun just screwing around but it'll wear off. Stick with Battlefield Bad Company 2 on steam.
I think this is one of my best games i have right now. My favourite thing is on  that it is realistic and not like call of duty.
ad this game since pre alpha havent played much because of bugs. but most are fixed to my knowledge. But the biggest down fall is your playing exile and you have no gun you find a gun on the ground but cant use it without the dlc.... walk a little farther and boom someone has the dlc and just shot you with the gun you should have been holding....-10
great game and great graphics
Fantastic game! Really great graphics and a lot of fun if your into Simulation Shooters!
Got into a plane and accidently ejected dooming my squad
I am ing mad this game cu k i just payed $60 for  sake and it wont launch ive tried everything ing t!
verything is mess while you launch it for first time ! there is thuosands of menues  options  and other stuff !  single default missions isn't to much and its very linier and easy  without any story line  just go from A to B thats it ! there are thousands of modes that many of them ll never works correctly or even launch !  downloaded and installed more than 20 gb of modes and cant even run one of theme !  sceneries ARE SUCKS ! i downloaded many of them and those doesn't work ! only show me the fake list of sceneries ! all modes and sceneries installed from steam or  Armaholic.com  or A3Launcher software and those are official !   you just makes my pockets empty At all with a freaky garbage game like ARMA III . its just a game with the only a name  there is nothing to explore or play . i brought to buy all the dlcs ! lol now i can flying with choppers  now i can ridding carting cars and can access to sniper weapons  and got ZEUS DLC also  but sorry man ! you late  no body play zeus anymore  lol  thank you bohemia interactive to satissfy me with these awesome stuffs . lol   there is no rankup  level up  damn upgrade your skills ! nothing !  you just an as s hole who got ARMA III . ohhh... ! such a honnor ! :   11 gb of main game content + more than EXZATERABYTE MODE AND PATCHES ! LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL   im sick of playing this game;it make me sick .    my opinnion is  do not buy it;if you gotta choose between several games
I Don't have the game lol
ay too expensive. It could have been so much better if only they had optimised it for non-NASA PCs.-10
ameplay is good. But then it's the ArmA series the servers are not optimized properly even with high-end hardware your bound to get low FPS. Until they actually get their  together and optimize the game. It's a NO from me :P.-10
nice ing fps armatards
est military sim in history of games but totally unplayable in multilayer becasue of worst netcode logic in history of gaming. Single player is perfectly fine with possibility to have over 60FPS even on mediocre hardware but in multilayer performance drops by about 1000% - no matter if there is a lot of action or not.  - 120FPS in single player drops to 11(ELEVEN!) FPS in multilayer server with just 40 people. - Performance of server can affect FPS on client! (Unique in the history of game design!) - Very bad performance in multilayer - So called 'hackers' are able to take control of game and do *everything* like flying cows with rocket launchers - Probably the worst client/server architecture ever developed in history of games - script running on client side can affect FPS off server AND other clients no matter how good hardware they have. - A lot of servers are running a lot of unoptimized and hacked scripts which can bring the game to crawl even when literally nothing is happening - Users can inject code into server and hijack it - Server can hijack user interface [even escape key!] of client  - Exactly the same problems existed in Arma 2 since 2008(?) and none of them were fixed or mitigated - There is no option tot ban particular IP address - One script-kiddie can ruin and crash entire server becasue of insanely bad server and client side code and architecture  NOT RECOMMENDED. I wasted money on it! They did not fix anything since Arma 2!-10
Very boring unless you like realism
his game is a huge disapointment so far like they took ACE mod and used new graffix.-10
WINDOWS 10 is not supported ?!!!?!?! WHY? I play like 8mins and the game crash!!!!!
everything is  about altis life.  off you 
t was fun at first but it grew old quickly. I purchased due to Atlis Life mod and quickly found the lack of players willing to comply with server rules made the game not so enjoyable. The large maps are nice and all but too damn big for 100 or less people... I enjoy the realist consideration of the game such as fatigue from sprinting and its effect on aiming.   Overall  does not have a lasting effect on me. Some of the situations that occur are very fun and memorable but I often find myself logged in running around in circles doing nothing. For large scale combat (meaning hundreds of players at the same time in the same location) on maps the size of  maps I would recommend Planetside 2 which is a free-to-play game. The simulation  offers is extremely impressive and quenches my thirst of rendering 360 No-Scope Headshot noobs useless. However as a game I don't enjoy it as much.-10
This aint cod = 10/10
his Game is not worth it stay with arma 2  10
NOT worth the price. Luckily got it when it was alpha for $30. Lacks content and engine is still a piece of crap.
muliplayer servers 99.9% populated by 3rd party server providers and are mistreating players with false positive anti cheat clames with no proof.
f there is a worse game than this please someone tell me. The game is completely unoptamized for any pc in existence and in order to play it you basically need to know code to fix the god aweful fps. PC specs for anyone thinking that there pc can handle it. CPU i7 5820k GPU GTX 1080 8gb RAM 32GB gskill trident memory MOBO MSI Gaming 7 PSU 1000w EVGA G2 1TB intel SSD 4tb WD black. Game playes like crap on a 1080 a 980 ti and 2 780 ti's AND ANYYTHING ELSE. STAY AWAY FOR YOUR WALLETS SAKE!-10
you don't get to shower with other men.
WHAT THE  AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
Nice Game Never got the Chance to Play  Life tho
WOULD GET A THUMBS UP IF...  the AI companions were actually COMPETENT i cant empahsize this enough. THE AI IS ABYSMAL by FAR tthe worst ive ever seen npc's cant even intentionally enter buildings if they do its because their  pathfinding led them into a doorway at which point they struggle and thrash around trying to get back outside. Its ing pathetic.  walking in a second story room didnt run the risk of having you clip through the floor and fall to your death  the enemy AI wasnt able to headshot you at ungodly ranges without missing a shot (Theres a certain structure that has bullet holes on each side when they impact. Shot after shot right where my head should be not to mention they can see my head and take aim on the other side of a wall)   the game didnt run like absolute  (i7-4790k w/ Gtx 970 obviously my pc isnt the problem)  BOHEMIA INTERACTIVE WOULD DEVELOPE THEIR OWN ING GAME AND RELEASE IT WITHOUT ALL OF THESE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING GAME BREAKING BUGS. INSTEAD OF HAVING THE COMMUNITY TRY TO FIX IT FOR THEM.  This all being said as much as i want to actually ENJOY this game and recommend it to people. I cant. Not for $60 (still... that)  TL;DR I shouldnt have to download modpack after modpack to fix this game for the devs. Thats what ing patches are for.  Also this game sucks dog di ck-10
Its le meme tastic '10/10 its ok' -ign
 other than the dayz mod lol
ame sucks don't bother paying their price.-10
A game about walking.
has industry leading gameplay mechanics which show a number of improvements. Optimization graphics and sound effects have improved considerably but it still isn't excellent in terms of optimization or sound effects. Steamworks integration is a very nice bonus.   It's a better game than ArmA 2 especially when you consider that it's best played in private co-op sessions on custom missions but it's very disappointing to see that  has no noteworthy game-changing new features. It's a great mil-sim the core game is very good and better than any other mil-sim but it's also a poor sequel.  The first release has minimal content which is now expected due to the sudden change of an episodic release.   See my full review here:  http://www.gnd-tech.com/content/961-ArmA-3-Review 10
his game sucks  only play with a group of 50 people. If not its bad. FWI In the wasteland gamemode there are  tanks that act autistic until they turn on their aimbot 0/1o  10
k so arma is a great game but they dont seem to give a  about the people who bought the dlc bundle awhile back who were promised all future and current dlc because the didnt give them apex. Dont get me grong  is a great game im just salty about not getting apex.-10
he absolute best military simualtion game I have ever seen!  Everything from bullet drop wondering if you have the right camo for your current hiding spot to even keeping track of you Ammo count in each mag makes this game more than worth the effort to sometimes run for what feels like years just to get that perferct vantage point before lighting up your enemies. In my case(I love playing sniper role) that's usually +600m away.   It's a game that requires ALOT of dedicated time if you want to get the best out of it as this is the only way to usually coordinate proper military oporations with fellow players(usually involves a plethora of fun stuff like tons of awesome vehicles and the thril of being part of a big oporation).  -You will die. -You will rage. -You will be on the edge of your seat if you play the game right.  The comunity in my experience plays a huge role in how good this game is and they are in general great people. The mods and different game modes are tons of fun and it's easy to just join some randoms and have a ton of fun together.  On the bonus side. The visuals are stunning if you can run them. (Please don't bite me for getting this wrong but I have heard that this game relies more on CPU than GPU in general so having a GTX980ti might not necessarily give you the performance you expect if you have a sub-par CPU).  My gear: (Runs this game in NVidia surround resolution 5760 x 1080) -i5 4570 @ 3.2GHz -MSI Z87-G45 gaming mobo -8Gb RAM -MSI gaming g4 GTX 970 twin frozr -3x 24' monitors (BenQ 2440l)  -Runs this game super smooth on med-high and smooth on ultra (Bare in mind a bad server can give you poor frames even if your rig is up to scratch sometimes)  All in all. WAY worthit if you love miltary simulation! For the amount of content and experiences you get I cannot recommend enough! 10
 found this game to be un-enjoyable to play for a few reasons.   Far far too many key bindings!! I spent much more time than I'd like checking 'what key is that again?' going through the key binding config or figuring out how to do things. Also I often found that I accidentally hit a wrong key or key combo and spent longer than I would like figuring out how to undo it.   It's just annoying non-intuitive and I doubt I'll spent much more time playing (5 hours in as of this writing). UX fail.   The performance isn't great either (quad core i5 w/ gtx 960 here) so you better have a really good PC to run this beast if you want decent graphics at decent framerates.-10
GREAT GAME 9/10 LUV the graphics and game play
ihated this
Arma 2 with less guns.
 would recommend the singleplayer only - the Multiplayer got ruined by the community.  PvE:  - Hard restrictions on every server (You cant use this because class you can`t use that because something) - Abusive admins - Stupid rules  - only 3 or 4 server are actually populated  (Ahoy World is the worst server to play on - Admin dictatorship)  And on Altis life server it's only deathmatch with a RPG look - Bandits vs Civs vs Police  PvP:  - CoD styled missions (King of the Hill) - Boring matches (Koth Island control) - Only a few populated server   All in all I really regret that I spend 30 € on it -.--10
my game just dissapparelled at second day i bought it lmao
Arma 2 is better
othing like COD or Battlefield. It's absolutely killer on a pc I have a amd fx 6300 8gb ram and a geforce 760 4gb. I get about 20-35 fps on medium settings on multiplayer. Soon to be ugrading to intel and a 900 series geforce gpu. Other than that if you have a good pc buy this game. 9/1010
.
Do you wanna play a game thats unoptimized and server browser works only half the time. Then this game is for you....
ip off of the game that created video game Leagues of Legends.10
Must buy!!!
Fun game but the optimiztion issues killed it for me. Lowest settings 20-40fps with a GTX970?
Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play 
Very  game. feelsbad man if u spend money on this 
has some great features lots of game modes lot of mods and large open maps. But the client is glichy. I have a pretty high end RIG and i still drop to below 30fps at times and of course there are pleanty of hackers around to prey on the weak.   The game has (had) so much going for it if the right people were to put the time and effort into it I believe this could be one of the greatest games on steam. But at the current state (and not seeing much happening in the future) it's too glichy for the $40 price tag. When on sale ($19.99 is what I paid) it's a good buy but seeing as there are so many free simulator shooters and survival games this one just needs to step it's game up.  Happy trolling guys. I'll be in the Hills with my .408 waiting.-10
not work in windows 10
aybe it's me but I don't get what's so great about this game Most of the time I can't connect to a server with players and when I do there's some error or other stuff that kicks me out again and it look's to me as if the whole world is empty.  I probably 'do it wrong' but this game is not for me I'll go back to battlefield.-10
ith it's indulging MOBA enviornment  proves to be one of the most realistic minesweeper games to ever come to market.  Although Arma lacks in features such as hitmarkers Gears of Arma Theft Auto VII proves to be well worth the ?13.37.11
is amazing it has lots of variaty and uses tons of tactics and different stratagies.  is tons of fun. It is insanely fun with friends. It's a great game and I recommend it to anyone.11
Altis No-Life
orst ing game i've ever played.... The least optimised game i've ever played unplayable with 1-35FPS all the time wiht a GTX780.... Dont buy unless you want to spend 50 Euros on 100% pure garbage-11
 was driving a truck at approximately 10km/h blew up flew 300 meters above sea level and landed on the opposite end of Atlis.   More realistic than real life.11
Tried to land helicopter on top of a car while the intire rest of the team are fighting back the enemy. Car blows up. Kills 3 enimies. 10/10 Best noscope sim 2002
his game is great compared to ArmA 2. Its less clunky and the UI is easier to use. The inventory system is more effective and simple.   If you have ever played ArmA 2 then you know the classic missions everyone played. Domination wasteland and taki life.   Domination has gave way to invade but its still the same. Wasteland hasnt changed and taki life is now Altis Life.  The game itself gives more potential to build upon or come up with better missions. If you arent happy with the current missions do it yourself or wait a bit.   If you are unfamiliar with ArmA then understand this the game isnt for everyone. This isnt CoD BF or Planetside 2. You arent going to be constantly stimulated with guns blazing and explosions. But every mode when you die punishes you. Whether it is travel time or losing your hard work. Dying is not something viewed lightly. Which forces people to act smart and fast.  Overall if you are into these style of games. Pick it up it will be worth it.10
ude said that he has DayZ H1Z1 Rust Call of Duty etc. in his library.  replied him like; got Arma3 in my library.10
THIS IS A DAYZ RIPOFF GAME PLS RATE MY REVIEW SO I FEEL KOOL
There is a lack of content also I hated the game becuase it never ran smoothly and it felt really incomplete for a game that has been out for 3 years it seemed very ike there where alot of bugs
 good modular game you want a shooter... you got it... you want a RPG game... log on to a server... you got it... Workshop support active community.... and a bunch of play-time!10
h Alas  is finally getting the last campaign and the Fixed Wing vehicles we have been waiting since launch for. Since launch the game has taken a good 5 steps forward in the right direction. Adding in the Zeus mode will ensure the survival for most hard core CO-OP players. With Arma being a series relying completely on the community to build machines of war I hope plenty of modders continue to add content to . The series has proven its worth and I feel the strength of the Arma series is just now getting recognized. The community is the backbone of the Arma Franchise so I encourage anyone loyal enough to create idea's. The Arma community is accepting we accept new players who need help and guidance were not like Call of duty where your whole team is a bunch of 10 year old kids calling you names. So if you decide after reading this review to buy . Good Luck Your going to need it.10
Playing at 8 fps such good wow  Can't wait for new computer to max out at 60+ fps have to wait until xmas eve to get it whhhhhhhhhhy
ts a  game you have no clue what you doing. in basecamp you cant hit at taget at 400m the game dont explane how to work the scope. if you press careful ones right click you get the small red dot on top if you hold it down you zoom in at the side of the riffle... WTF I WANT TO ING USE THE TELESOPIC SIGHT!! HOW HARD CANT IT BE TO EXPALINE THE PLAYER TO USE A SCOPE.. IS THIS GAME ROCKET SCIENCE?  THIS GAME! dont buy it dont support at game developers that make games cryptic. why even use x to duck and z to lay down.. WHY?-10
The only game series which is progressing from installment to installment instead of degrading.
is good like really good...10
a must have game
is one of the worst games i have ever played and i have no idea how people play the game the controls are confusing and completely ridiculous you set the game to the lowest difficulty and still die by a single shot. and if you happen to press a certain button (still no clue which button that is.) your game completely freezes on itself and only allows you to move and look around.-10
ell every single FPS is  compared to ARMA III. Just. This.10
his game is AMAZING. With its various gamemodes such as King of the Hill Wasteland Altis life and Invade and Annex(All made by the community)this game is very fun to play with friends online. Single player is suprisingly good for an Arma title so brownie points to the campaign dev team. But I will say this the game is a constant work in progress. I have seen it progress since alpha and even now they are adding units and they are not yet done with the campaign still but as long as it mantains the level we have been seeing then I think its worth it. 10/1010
This game is ing great 1000/10
fter trying for about 5 hours in vain to just get past a small phase in a mission in the game i can finally say i gave up. above the insanely hardcore combat system i got killed countless times by mines that i can't understand how to tell their location so it's just a simple annoying random death. Also the game has a lot of bugs mainly graphic. i'd say the devs rushed too much. 5/10 game health 3/10 gameplay 8/10 graphics -30/10 gameplay forgiveness. Bought the game when it was 50% off and i regret spending every and each $ for this game which i just can't play.-10
payed for this game today and played it today and must say im very disapointed and sad it cost anything near 60$ when mp lags to a  :/
orst game i've ever played. This is  and this is the worst 30€ I've ever spend. .-10
est game 2002 not call of duty 14/10 would buy again instead of pizza.11
There needs to be more female characters.
 know this is only beta but I already know that this is going to be one of the greatest multiplayer to date. The combat simulation is perfect the tactical gameplay is perfect the squad system is perfect the open world is perfect. The graphics are perfect (You will need a good computer to handle this game.) 10/10 BUY IT!10
Good luck getting into a server lmao
ot recommended. It is the most glitchy game I have ever played. My ping could be 30 and have over 40 FPS and still rubberband. I'm level 30 in the king of the hill servers so I'm not necessairly a newbie and my game is up-to-date. I've lost connection more times than I can count due to battle eye or just lose connection to the server. I've spawned in the middle of the ocean. I've run straight through railings to my death. I've been trapped in helicopters because I can't eject. This is all very frustrating when you've spent over $1000 on your gear and vehicle only to get kicked out before you're halfway to the area of operation and making money on those servers takes a considerable amount of time.   Don't get me wrong. When the game works I have LOTS of fun. I love the teamwork and communication involved. But I also have long periods where the game is simply unplayble. And what point is having a game that works only half the time? Your results may very but for me I've given up and don't recommend anyone get this game.   Another complaint; the ads  puts on the screen as you're playing is the most annoying thing ever. I've gotten killed before because they literally put a popup in the middle of your screen as you play that you cannot click out of. I made a point of never buying the APEX DLC out of spite because of how annoying it is. I don't think anyone should either!-10
riginally I bought this game to RP on NoPixel. I ended up dropping ~240 hours on nopixel and got bored. Played wasteland was a lot more fun.  Game is 8/10.  I got killed by a wall so i had to drop 2.11
Great game must have
1/10 I love this game it has gave me so many amazing moments of epicness.  (Get Battle Royale and Breaking Point mods).   lol and noscopes are included kbye10
spent 2 hours setting the keys well now i can't refund it  edit came back to the game seeing this 3 year old glitchy mess being sold FOR 55 DOLLARS WHAT AND THEN YOU NEED TO PAY FOR THE MOST OVER PRICED DLC IN THE UNIVERSE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE GAME NOT BUG YOU CONSTANTLY BECAUSE YOU PICKED UP A GUN THAT YOU NEEDED AT THAT MOMENT  well im never buying another one of there games again  edit once again i decided to try the rp servers well there was a mugger every single place the police say you did things you didnt so they can fine you and i got a gun to stop the muggers and one tried to mug me so i shot him then got a bounty on my head got arrested a day later i thought i was kidnapped tried talking to the people that where arresting me no respawnce all they wanted was the bounty no rp at all then i waited 10 mins didnt have a car because my friend had one so i ran over to the closest city then the game bugged i floated slightly off the ground for 3 seconds then died i said this game is  then alt f4 that   also im starting to think they are faking reviews and botting votes as no one has commented saying why they think im wrong or what ever and i already have 3 downvotes and one upvote please to prove me wrong comment something saying why im wrong  i rate this game 5/5 levels of terminal brain cancer
016 update:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDOM7D4NT6Y  No comments required.  'This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things.' This is the kind of line you'll find in most positive reviews of . The thing is  fails miserably in every single front involving both 'the finer things' and the basic things. BI Studio decided to use an ancient patched-up engine used since the times of the Operation Flashpoint. You'd think the bright side of this is they used the saved money and resources to put everything into solid focus on most important aspects of a 'military sandbox' they claim they've dished out. Long story short - they didn't.   is not actually worth a comprehensive review so let me show you some of examples of how bad execution you can expect in every single corner of the game. Ironically the praised mods greatly expose  as a game that doesn't provide even a basic set of properly implemented essential features. What the DayZ developers achieved with the engine also show what kind of bad apple  is.  Performance:  has already become legendary of it's poor optimisation within the gaming community. The game has completely inadequate system requirements to what it presents. Even taking into account some little simulation (unlike by the common opinion) under the hood. All of it topped with lack of proper use of multi-core processors. Just one of the forum topics on the subject:  http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?147533-Low-CPU-utilization-amp-Low-FPS   Damage and wounding model: I knew it wasn't perfect but what I saw and read left me in awe. A 'military focused sandbox' 'military simulation'. So you'd think the model is at least solid right? If so we could as well call Return to Castle Wolfenstein a military sandbox. FEAR 1 would be something  could only aspire to. To put it simpler: The model is non-functional. You can shoot a man in a freakin' finger few times and he will die. You can put a bullet through the back of a knee of a man and he will only flinch. Helmets protect whole heads uniformly (yup including the face!) bp vests protect the entire torso uniformly. To put it into perspective some of the damage and wounding aspects of  are worse than those in the decade+ old Operation Flashpoint (same developers). See:  http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?168548-Damage-system-sucks-fix-needed&amp;p=2784549&amp;viewfull=1#post2784549   AI: Not a trace of human-like behavior. In a close quarter engagement if you put bullets into AI's arms it will only flinch slightly. First second third - flich flinch flinch. And the he'll kill you with a perfect head-shot without any delay. AI also simply 'isn't bothered' to survive. AI under suppressive fire? No problemo for AI! See:  http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=23969    Sound: You'd think sound location (spatialization) would be important for developers of a 'military sandbox'? You pretensious brat! Arma doesn't use any sort of spatialization. By now you should already know better you shouldn't expect positional audio of any sort (HRTF binaural Rapture3D...;7.1 surround is not positional audio). The game doesn't even do the basic stereo panning on many sound samples (sic!). It's unplayable for me without DolbyHeadphone enabled in the preferences of my Asus Xonar.  To top it off if you imagine a certain situation should involve 20 audio samples (steps equipment 1 equipment 2 wind ambient birds door opening squad mate unholstering his pistol...) you can cross off about 10 of those to get a feeling of how rich the ArmA's audio environment is.  'Erm... so maybe... the potential?' Until there will be a copy of 'ArmA's potential' for sale I'd like to stick to evaluation of what I see. Even if I give it some slack it doesn't really make the picture more bright. ArmA has been released a year ago. Fundamental aspects of it by all signs need rewrite or ground-up implementation which isn't even on the horizon. You plan on giving feedback and asking on the forums. The only thing you'll get is a slap in the face in a form of a shopping cart DLC women DLC real sea streams DLC or maybe Latin America Forces DLC.-10
f you enjoy getting insta-sniped by terminator AI the second you try to sneak up on them this is for you.  If you enjoy not being able to see your opponents but they can see you through all the bushes and trees with their x-ray vision this is for you.  If you hate fun this game is for you.-10
 dont really know what to say about this game. I perfectly understand that some people may like it but I know that I certainly didn't...  Basically if you're not a hardcore military fanatic do not buy it.  The main problem I had with it was that I bought it thinking it was a more realistic battlefield with bigger maps and more accuracy concerning vehicles weapons weapon mechanics and that stuff. And as you probably know because you aren't me it isn't.  First of all the game mechanics themselves are in my opinion faulty and sluggish. It doesnt feel like you're in control of your character whether youre controlling a vehicle or the character himself. The UI is the worst I have ever seen in a game. Especially when it ocmes to looting one of your victims.  Then the AI is completely bugged/overpowered in the singleplayer campaign (which is ridiculously bad btw) I was grenaded by enemies from 300m away.  The multiplayer is bad too because servers are   very   badly managed and end up with your spawns being so far from the war zone that you spend most of your alive time in a chopper to get to the warzone and then end up getting killed after 2 minutes on the ground by a camper in a building who knows the map better than you. And trust me this gets very frustrating after a while it just becomes a cycle of death - long helicopter ride - death - long helicopter ride etc.  The only context I would recommend buying this game is if you have maybe a squad of a friends with the game and mics who will play with you in co-up community made missions. But that's pretty much it.-10
Good game cancer community
t was great when it came out. Now the game is filled with ads for the expansions and there is no apperent way to disable them.  I could only recommend this game in it's original state before the ads and there is no way to revert it to an earlier version soooo....-10
lpha was fun. Beta was fun. Release was FUN. 10/10 open world military infantry sim loving every moment my computer can handle running it.10
he single-player campaign was the only part of the game that I was interested in. I found it unenjoyable: I couldn't see the enemies that were shooting me. Apprarently their eyesight was dramatically better than my soldiers. I frequently didn't know what it was that I was supposed to be doing specifically. E.g. it wasn't clear what the symbols on the map meant. The minutia in the simulation detracts from the gameplay. (E.g. it wasn't clear how to launch and fly the UAV.)  I guess are far as 'realism' goes this game might be in a different league from other shooters. So if that's your top criteria maybe it's for you. But I couldn't forgive it for making the experience unnecessarily unintuitive. So I can't recommend it.-10

Mods made this game very good and fun to play
It was good for a few months and i really enjoyed it but now none of the servers show up and when i join from the browser it takes a long time to load a then crashes same with quick play and the a3 launcher doesn't work either. can anyone help me fix this problem.
This would be a thumbs up if I could get more than 20 fps with a powerful computer.
owever I think those 5680 rewievers said enough.   In a few words that's example of game genre monopoly which seriously slowed down everything in this game except it's price. We may love and enjoy the only one playable milsim in Steam but still there's much to improve.  Game got it's 90% positive reviews just in case of the fact that there aren't many   good   milsims to compare to Arma.  By the way instead of improvements that are   really needed    dear Bohemia made DLC's. Hopefully we have waited only 15 years for bipods. And here comes Apex DLC with much more really much more improvements that should have been in-game since 2013.   And don't be lazy guys check out the price of Apex and recognize that it's more expensive than game itself in 2013.   Yes yes. ~~~ I bet people would by 60$ optimization DLC instead of that. The problem of engine is that lags don't come from high graphic settings. They come from view distance setting which have to be set low to play with normal fps. However singleplayer doesn't lag so much so you have to choose:  ~~~?1: Play with the dumbest AI ever in SP missions without lags.  ~~~?2: Play multiplayer with the most terrific lags ever. Most servers use mods which make even more lags.      Other hateful sh!t:    For the memory of the brave soldiers who have died being stucked in a fence. Somebody kill the 'v' button.  You can heal youself infinite times in vanilla. Just like in real life medkits set you HP to 75%.  Who cares about that you can sprint half a minute with 15kg machine gun?  Ah we have AP and HP ammo in every game but hell yes not here in the best milsim of our universe.  Oh cr*p you can't normally reload weapon in vehicle. You even can't change the seat.  Very realistic radar really.  Tell us that hero who has made realistic helicopter physics with 1 second delay for engine power control turning your helicopter flight in a 999 ping simulation.  This game don't have realistic physics for planes. Not sure if I should be happy about this or not.  Bohemia was brave enough not to use the nodegraph for AI. Sure it's impossible to put nodegraph on 270km^2 map but guys bots are stuck only in towns. Wasn't it hard to make nodegraph in those little settlements? All of us know that if we'll make NPC drive through whole Altis on a truck it will spend 40% of time bumping random garbage can or house before it reach it's destination point.   Sure you know that AI has other problems as well because sniper NPC still can't make a single hit with his GM6 Lynx from 400m but can pistolsnipe you from the same distance.  Another trouble is low basic content. You gonna say this game has it's awesome mods and be sure you're right. Despite the fact that that must-have mods won't work after every update. And they're still unstable.  To be sure how great vanilla is check out if there are any servers without mods and tell me later how much in % you've found.  People are judging physics but it seems that no one noticed this dumb recoil system an more even dumber penetration system in ballistics for vehicles I hope fellow WOT or WT players will understand what I'm talking about.   Be sure everyone LOVES scrolling mouse3 to change a gun!  NPC walks through stones.  It's fixed now but I remember those times NPC couldn't drive on a brigde.  100% of civilian popualtion are wierd 20yo men. No children no old people no women.  You can shoot out armoured glass with SMG.  We certainly enjoy control system.  Please tell me how NPC survive after 127mm shot.  NPC don't care for driving over their mates with an APC.  Anyone remember those times when NPC teamkilled you if you've crashed UAV?  Guns don't have safe mode. (Mods gonna help you)    Do you already have stairs phobia? Because they gonna come to you at night and make you fall though the Earth to the south pole .    B*tthurt is over.  -10
 guess if your going in the military it might be fun but for an everyday joe like me it's just too slow and difficult.   When the gun fire actually starts it's a lot of fun but I tended to die immediately after that happened :(. Guess I shouldn't join the military.  -11
ew patch gives rendering issues net code slingshot issues still has the freelook bug now the zoom in the gunner seat of armor is bugged and you need to mash your plus and minus keys over and over before it zooms in or out. Graphics wise it runs a little smoother and looks slightly better.-10
imited selection in customizing keys. AI is insanely tough even at the lowest settings. Too many odd keystrokes to learn. Overall just not very intuitive for the user. Really didn't enjoy the guns either. Has to be played through additional software other than Steam.-11
ried to return 1 hour over the 2 hour limit. Thanks Steam. It's an okay game fps are just unacceptable.-10
i played this back in 19291291ui1000000000090909
This game is so awsoooomeee!!!!!!XD buy it now!!!
got game and didnt have full game and had to mod it alot 10/10
thanks bohemia
This game made me lose 60 pounds in one day now i am 600 pound i was gonna eat myself to death im just getting healthier and this made me get a job and now i live in an actual house i demand a 10% refund on this game or I will suck your wee wee for free don't push me you have exactly 10 days
 spent all my money on this game played for 10mins and i had to get off leaving the game open came back next day played had nothing good to do all the servers are  maps way too big to do anything if it even had any thing to do its not even a good sandbox game its  so basicly i wish i would had closed the game so i could have got a refund D:-10
eally wanted to like this game. Seems buggy and unoptimized haven't even played online because you have to buy DLC to get into any games. Feel like I wasted money on this one.-11
he game is great but there are WAY too many bs servers. It's like playing ing Garry's Mod. Why do I have to play all of these weird survival servers that are not at all immersive? How can you actually like put 100s of hours into a Life server where you just click on stuff (I'ts already a video game I want it to be at least kind of engaging) and pretend you're doing it? Don't get me wrong they're fun for awhile but I just want an actual war-like experience from this game.-10
 would not recommend this game for one reason entirelly this game has extremely unbelievably poor performance. The problem is so huge that out of the 300 hours I played at least 200 of those were waiting for the lag spike to finish and another 30 trying to get into a server because it's kicking me for no reason at all (friend in the server just sees that i'm getting kicked without an explanation). The kicking happens so often and so many times per game session (some days it just completely  on me and after 10 tries I just give up) that it gets extremely annoying and repulsive and combine that with the lag i was writting about (plus the average 20 fps when not in a lag spike even at lowest settings) makes the game time spent in the game an absolute pain. While it does have it's moment they simply aren't worth all the suffering. P.S. I'm getting poor performance while the friend I mentioned plays on a cpu graphics procesing but gets a lot better performance than me.-10
ve played this game since it was in early access. I've put way too many hours into this broken game. It will always be broken. It does not matter how good your PC is this game just runs like absolute trash. Nothing will change with Arma I dont care if they come out with Arma 4 it will still run like  and have the same issues that have been around since Arma 2.-11
Best army simulator engine old as my grandma tho
1- Start game 2- Launch into editor 3- Die because you randomly spawn on a beach bleeding 4- repeat 2-3
yes i do plz buy it and play
When the  can AMD users get over 20 fps in MP? fix your code you 
This game has its quality but I find it so hard to play that I end up never playing...  are for those individuals who have either a real glutten for punishment or have a major hardon for playing military. I for one would much rather play Battlefield 4. I give it a 4 out of 5 in the regret buying category.
i if you wanna rage because you died and lost everything in A3L buy this.11
Plane crashed into the twin towers..  or did it?  #GovermentIlluminati911ConspiracyTheroiesRTheyRealOrAreTheyFakeBushDidItOrDidHeConspiracyTheory
Not as good and timeless as ARMA 2 but still worth a play when i want to bully some milsim babbys
or what this game tries to be (Which is a war simulator) it fails misserably at that. The movement is clunky the A.I Is dumb and overpowered as hell.  So if you get into this game being all like 'Yeah this is what war is like this is realistic and really precise' Then sorry. You need to get out in the real world pall. Because I don't consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic. Same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs.   This game is however one of the funniest games I have ever played with friends. The amount of vehicles the guns the destructible enviorment. The overall map is not to shabby either.   If you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that.  If you get it to play it as a serious war game then i'd say the clunky motions and faulty A.I ruins that emediatly10
his campaign is completely broken. Otherwise I was loving this game. Too bad. Sad that I didn't notice the problems til 3 hrs in.  Discussion about it here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app//discussions/1/360671727317498131/ -10
The game is not playable on minimum system requirements.
10 fps with recomended requirements hell no
Buy Arma 2. More content. More better.
 More like  Apex. Buy the expansion or don't play the game. You're lucky to find a Stratis or Altis server. Also I couldn't see any FPS improvements in MP even a server without mods still runs under 30 FPS on low where as I can play the game on high settings around 35 FPS in SP.-10
IS GUD 'IS' SIMULATOR  rate 11/9 CUZ IS FUN
Gets on rpg server  walks around guy with a car drives towards me and stops i look at him and say ' you looking at ' he went forward very slowly and a single hair touched the car i Died   MOST REALISTIC WAR SIMULATOR OUT THEIR
is an amazing shooter. way better then games like Call Of Duty and Battlefield 4! It is a must have for anyone that likes shooters but even if you don't like them. It has things like Altis Life  Life (NOT RELEASED YET) and much much more!11
ou can't play online with the base game because every room seems to need the DLCs in order to play.  Then of course you're gonna have to download a 3rd party launcher that auto fetches mods for you.  Then you have to wait while those download and install.  And when you finally have all that done you get TK'd by a bunch of a**holes that think it's funny to repeatedly crash helicopters into you.  It's prohibitively hard you'll die before you have time to react you may never even know where or who killed you.  My final conclusion: This game needs a multiplayer demo so people can see if they like it before dropping $80 on it and getting f***ed by steam's return policy.-10
stephan hawking runs better than this game
Very yes. 5/5
ote that this is the MAC PORT I'm talking about. The Windows version runs perfectly fine and smooth. My PC runs it at ultra settings and it is great war game. Before you complain remember that I HAVE A PC THAT IS ABLE TO RUN THIS GAME.   This game doesn't run at all. It crashes even at the beginning of the prolouge. I really don't want to be a Mac fanboy but I would say that they didn't do well with the Mac port. The 'video' setting is very laggy and crashes the game every time I change a setting. The game barely runs and the FPS man. Never have I ever seen 3 FPS in a game. The audio are also delayed at some points such as the dialouge where the man is supposed to say 'Woah!' but it gets delayed for a few seconds. Honestly anything else is just your average 'it doesn't work'.  To sum this up I would suggest playing the on a PC and if you only have a Mac DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR YOUR MAC. I suggest saving up for a PC so you can play the game. In my opinion I think this Mac Port was a waste of time for Bohemia Interactive.   I HAVE A PC. THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE MAC PORT.-10
It's pretty k but can i get option 2 report prayers wwho quikscope better then me??!?!??! xxdxdxddddddd lmeoaaaaaaa k?
i7 + 16gb ram+ gtx 780ti can't even get 30fps on low or max in multiplayer
cut content   cut wrists
Constant dlc advertisement inside a game already paid for
 have no clue what these game developers are doing.  I got a 5930k 32gb DDR4 980 GTX x 2 in SLI a rampage V Extreme motherboard and this game wont run much over 30 fps for me. I put EVERYTHING on low and still 24 fps. Autodetect did something right but still not over 30-40 fps. And its not even super pretty. The game might be good but the optimalization just is so bad its insane.  I wonder what graphics the rest is playing on because this is t. Neither of my 980 GTX will go over 911 mhz either while playing it. So it stutters while not utilizing the graphic cards. I want my money back its a 'bad code'-simulation.-10
 absolutely love this game! The community is huge and amazing with vast amount of servers to be chosen from Altis life wasteland domination and other common game modes like conquest DM etc... And with a large support for moding the game can be played litteraly forever with mods coming out nearly every day on a popular website Armaholic but even the base game is entertaining just enough with servers with different game mode types that are updated regulary. And if you dont like what is given to you you have the option to go out on your way and make your own missions or mods and play them with your friends.  The game looks very nice on Ultra settings. there are no major issues with the game besides very small and usually unoticable bugs that are often fixed very quickly through updates. The game has a range of interesting DLC such as the new Kart DLC orginaly as an April fools joke was released due to popular demand and the game still has upcoming and anticipated DLC. I would definetely recommend this game to anyone as it offers a wide range of options of how and what you would like to do in the game.10
I have better pc specs than the recommended settings and i can't get more than 18-21fps. which is unplayable so i rate this game 1/10 cause it lied to me and now i wasted $30 i'm already super picky what i buy and this just made it even worse
 thoroughly enjoyable game a bit of a steep learning curve in order to better understand the control systems and the basics of aiming and shooting accurately however the community is awesome. The long-range team based encounters are amazing and it is without a doubt one of the top 2 MILSIM games out there.  If I had to chose between BF2: Project Reality or ARMA III i wouldn't be able to these two games are the best examples of MILSIM games you can find.10
NO this game can suck my   (no homo)
I would recommend it to someone who is new to the series...However..If you are a hardcore ARMA II player like myself  Then DO NOT BUY THIS...Unless you want to play altis life or some other crap..  this game was one of the biggest let downs
OW  never spent my money that well -.- BIG SARCASM THIS GAME IS FAR FROM BEING A 'SIMULATOR'   Its not balanced gameplay/control are HORRIBLE This game is a waste of Time Money Brain usage.   I DONT RECOMMEND THIS GAME WHAT SO EVER-10
Awesome War game always up to date!
this game is the ing best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
he only way i can describe the inner workings of this game is to envision a car junkyard. Now imagine throwing a giant white sheet over that junkyard and painting nice colors on it. Thats what arma3 is.  Just unnaceptable for a 2014 title. I can't believe how poor this game's engine and game mechanics are. It's just shocking to look back 16 years at games like delta force 2 in 1998 and think that this is actually worse. There is so much erratic behavior as a result of poor engine mechanics it is not even possible to even pretend to try fixing them all.  After looking into it i discovered that this game uses the same exact base engine as operation flashpoint from back in 2002. The same engine that arma1 uses arma2 and now arma3. It's like trying to re-use a 50yr old boat trailer meant for 13ft boats on a 100ft YACHT. It's just lazy and unacceptable. I even read a huge article about how the actual developers of the game confirmed that the engine does not utilize multiple cpu cores. And why would it? The engine is ancient and just heavily modified. (i know this is the part where you argue and toss out comments like 'Ohh but you didnt type in the command parameter -8 threads or something shallow like that) that does nothing. If a game is not hard coded from the base engine to unload different tasks onto different cpu cores. Than it does not make any difference if the game can recognize multiple cpu's or not.)  Arma2 had much better graphics in terms of realistic color pallette. If you ever look at arma2 screenshots or dayz videos it actually looks real. And there is so much in the way of woods/trees/bushes and other vegetation in arma2 to the point where you genuinely feel like you are in the woods. Arma3's colors are unrealistic and just plain fruity.  Arma2 was more acceptable as a 2008-9 product. Do you remember all of the different maps in arma2? Do you remember the THOUSANDS of different structures in terms of houses/outhouses/farms/industrial machinery. What does arma3 have? It has one map. Stratis. And the other map is no different. So please don't tell me arma3 has two maps when it just recycles the same terrain from stratis.-10
Worst game ever
Too damn expensive with DLC
Everbody has played ArmA. Everybody knows that this is the most precise and tactical shooter simulation out there. Everybody knows that Bohemia Interactive are the best game devs in the world. Everbody knows that no AAA game will ever even reach half of the quality of ArmA.
Its an ok game best part of the game is obviously its multiplayer but with the constant connection problems it can be a drag and its not realy worth a buy considering other games do mp better!
 paid 30 pounds for a game that crashes every 5 minutes. I have checked forums and i have tried to fix this problem for the last month. I dont think the issue is with my computer. I dont mind any of the other countless bugs in this game but i draw the line when it crashes constantly. How am i supposed to imerse myself when this is constantly happening. I am gonna just stick with arma 2 which is a fantastic game and has already got a better community.This game is more then just a dissapointment its unplayable.-10
3 hours on record gets globally banned. best anti-cheat system saw it coming before it happened vodka/10
00000000x more rewarding then BF4. Doesn't crash every 32 seconds like Arma 2. Engine isn't as . Install it to an SSD. Mods are fun and the people are pretty accomodating in the realism servers if you're willing to learn and listen.10
his game is fun when it actually works. But there is one CRITICAL PROBLEM - there is some as yet unknown issue that can completely break the game for people and they will never be able to play it again. Iv had that problem for YEARS now. Never fixed never address BI is too lazy to bothered. Should of never bought this. WASTE OF MONEY ON A GAME THEY NEVER FINISHED.-10
mazing game if you love the Arma series also the new dayz epoch and overpoch mods for this are great :)10
not what i expected..
it sucks
fter trying it during the free weekend I can say this is definitely worth buying I'd get it for myself but my PC specs don't allow me to play on servers that are highly populated (80+ people). Good community and many different type gamemodes (also the breaking point mod) make it worthwhile.10
hey improved Arma 2 a lot to make this game but it isn't in the right areas. The game takes place in 2034 but they still have you using a map and compass. Left control and right control key combinations are in here but I don't want to play a game where I have to use control as a modifier for my keys at any time. This game needs more menus commo roses and context-sensitive commands and needs to get rid of the dead weight.  Don't buy it.-10
its a great game if you can overlook the bugs and the desync... i would recomend hopping into a atlis life server then go and make some in game money and make some new friends and have fun! its a really realistic game but ill have to give it 8.27/10 only because its buggy :( but if you overlook the bugs its 9.75/10 on my books!
reat simulator when you are playing with people who are serious organized and actually simulate warfare - horrible piece of  when you verge off that track (Go karts? Wasteland? and other stupid game modes along with a bunch of dayZ hungry kids and immature 12 year olds). Mods enhance the game as which it did for Arma 2. Coop is very good for when I said 'organized' but can sometimes just consist of idiots running around and lone wolf 'sniping'.10
ery true to being in the military boring and miserable.-10
Don't bother trying this autistic game
 was talking to a guy in a courtyard and a tank out of nowhere squished him. So I stole his gear then a guy came over a started shouting 'ahahahahahhahahahhhhhhhhhahahah' with unusual music in the background while placing a Satchel Charge on the floor nearby and set it to 1 second he then said 'fly me too the moon'.  I've always wondered if he fulfilled his dream of space flight.10
poch Mod.  First time playing I find some ghille clothing and a little pistol with two magazines.   I take off running around exploring and such. See a helicopter I go to hide. Once it passes I keep on running right?  Well I notice this little black thing in the sky following me around. It turns out to be one of those little quad-copter remote controlled drones. So I decide eh. I'll just outrun it. I take off and hide behind a building thinking I'm safe.   Not even two seconds later there's a sniper round that hits the wall next to me. So I freaking book it about 200meters into these tall bushes. I have ghille camo on right? I should be safe. Well after about a minute or so something moves past and catches my eye.  It's this naked armless bloodied up ... thing.   I full on gun it straight out of that bush just moving as fast as I can to get away. It decides to follow.  I unload two magazines into the foul abomination that it is before it finally dies. (Let's be honest I missed... a lot)  THE THING EXPLODES. IT'S HEAD COMES FLYING TOWARDS ME. I backpeddle expecting it to explode...   Only for a truck to come out of nowhere and run me over where I stood.  10\10 would play again.10
oorly optimised I thought I'd be able to run this game fairly well on my new GTX 970 But that wasn't the case as I can't even get it to run at 60fps on medium to low settings.-10
suck my  let me fly the ing helicopter
his game has a good campaignbut if your looking to play multiplayer i wouldnt reccomend it all lobbys are ethier fullemptyor locked they have no searchservers pop up and you have to choose one its really unorganized and bad i bout this for battle royal but it was so empty and hard to find a lobby i got a refund on this game becasue it was so bad i would much rather reccomend h1z1 for a better multyplayer experience.-10
Coming from a non ing fanboy this game is a buggy piece of . Have fun getting 30 fps on all quality settings from very low to ultra and i have a GTX 970 and Nvidia recommends i play on Very High so i have the specs for this  show game. The devs at bohemia once again proved that they are the worst in the world. Have fun gouging your eyes out over a potentially bad  game.
Should i get this??
Very good game 10/10! Only i noticed that i suck at thiss game...
Danced around naked around a tank in wasteland mode 10/10
Slow paced mid level graphics low fun factor waste of money more importantly waste of time nothing but geeks a sqeakers  Understand this those people that have 1k + hours are complete losers and have spent half the time proned watching a hill hoping to see someone to kill
This game is pretty cash
This Game is awesome BUT You MUST have a very good config
Best game i have played give this game 10/10 would recomend to a friend fawking luv this game
these dumb cu n t s dont have a clue how to make a game
e and a friend were doing a massive co op mode and we decided to take a quad to the objective. Later on about 6 KM away from the objective the quad breaks so we start walking there. We gave up and said 'Screw it' and shot eachother / grenaded and my friend was bleeding out so I gave him a medkit. Then we walked more and the objective changed to about 13 KM away and we gave up again so we shot eachother. Now we are both bleeding out on the ground and stranded in the middle of nowhere. Until suddenly a friendly Tank came moments later and patched us both up. Then we are inside the tank and I go afk for some juice. By the time I got back the tank driver left without giving me nor my friend permission to drive it. So my friend brought up that while I was gone a helicopter was here and a guy offered to take us with him. My friend said 'Ok but lets wait for my friend to get back' (being me) So when I get back my friend gets in the chopper and said 'Cmon lets get in' I was wondering where the pilot is so I got out to find him dead underneath the heli. So then me and my friend got out and walked to the nearest air base 2 KM away. halfway there I realised there was a respawn button so me and my friend used it and spawned at the air base to find dead allys everywhere. So we looted them but then the server restarted so we got on gmod. 10/1010
his game is crap the campaign hardly works downloaded scenarios are on the hardest difficulty even when you put them on easy when the campaign does work the npcs wait 20 minutes between sentences and the editor is so confusing beginners cant use it at all.-10
o after 227hrs of play i got the infamous memory not being able to be written and the other about referenced and can no longer play. i tried every single fix to no avail. there was talk of an update which cause this to happen which was almost a year ago and there has been nothing done. dont buy this game unless you like being swindled.-10
n my opinion It's not optimized for the PC but If you have a beast PC and you like realistic war games get it.10
Kekingly Good   420/20 would plai agen
wesome loads of fun story multi-player mods. many memories made friends etc. if you've ever wanted to rob the fed or be a king on a hill maybe kill some zeds become a hero i'd recommend  for you. 10/10 loved it hated it got it pregnant blew it's brains out unforgivable man.10
est game ever. Forget buying GTA V all u need: arma3 + workshop. So many game mods and realistics.   PS: still got killed with doors like in old days ^^10
on't expect your average FPS from Arma. This is more of a military simulator but the sand box element adds great gamemodes like Battle Royale.10
Great Game!  10/10 would get shot buy 5 russian guys again!
est Military Sim hands down.10
 doesnt work with a 3000$ pc yeah right buddy get your  together
One of the most laggy game I have ever played! It says it needs OS 7/8.. I have windows 8.1 It says it needs processor i5... I have i7 It says It needs 4 ram.. I have 4 ram -_- It says it need GeForce GTX 560.. I have GeForce GTX 650 It needs DirectX.. I have DirectX  WHERE DID I GO WRONG? 6k worth Nothing.. Extremely Laggy Please fix the issue's
fter buying  there were moments when other games were seducing me:  1. I wanted to buy CS:GO / Insurgency type shooters as they looked appealing. But then I thought I can 'make' it in  editor with community mods 2. RTS games invited me to buy them. But then I thought I can 'make' it in  editor with community mods 3. Tank / Jet simulators looked appealing. But then I thought I can 'make' it in  editor with community mods 4. Some RPGs of today look cool and were on huge discounts. But then I thought I can 'make' it in  editor with community mods 5. Wow that flashy game with so many paid DLCs of new terrains and units. But then I thought I can already enjoy them with free community mods  Hence enjoyed a bunch of other games buy just buying . Saved a ton of bucks..  10/10 :D10
wesome Idea but overcomplicated to a point where the movement is clumsy and engine not pleasant to play in: you get stuck in stairs and doors use scroll wheel for every thing WT?!  An for crying out loud get the engine optimised to run SLI GPUs at 100% not 15%.  AGGGRRR angry!-11
 A tactical game that is fun to play with or without friends with a properly fledged storyline with good mod support. The only thing holding it back is the awful optimization. Theres many guides to counteract that though.  Ive played it during the free weekend later bought it for myself. Its worth it11
ad problems with Battleye severs couldn't join any games.... Too bad so sad.-11
ing mexicans
bsaloutely awful bad framerates bad gameplay bad connections with servers being kicked from every session i join automatically-11
I've played it for a couple minutes. 'S alright.
its looks cool
this is call of duty for mil sim
f your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if your looking for an outstanding cheese cake recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients:  1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs 3 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons melted butter 40 ounces softened cream cheese 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon vanilla 1 cup sour cream 4 eggs  Directions: For The base:. If you're using a dark pan preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan 375. Combine the crumbs melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on. Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter. For the batter:. Make sure everything is at room temperature. Combine sugar cheese flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this. Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then add the eggs one by one mixing well after each addition. Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight. Release the sides of the springform. Eat.11
This game has been out for almost 3 years and it is still $59.99.    I suggest waiting for a sale...    ...or another 3 years
vidia GTX 980M 8gb Vram. Running absolute lowest quality can't even get 60 fps. That and using Xbox 360 controller for windows sucks. Didn't even make it to gameplay two deal breakers right there.-11
i could not sell jews in this game. very upsetting :( *sad rawr* *sad nuzzles*
i didnt play it alot but i think its not worth 44.99€
icrosoft in late 2014 took the wraps off the Technical Preview of its next Windows operating system and in doing so it took everyone by surprise. We expected the next generation of Windows: we just didn't expect it to be called Windows 10. None the less here is Windows 10: the next Windows OS for PCs and laptops smartphones and tablets. And indeed an OS for servers and all points inbetween. Microsoft said that Windows 10 is built from the ground up for a world in which mobile- and cloud computing are key. Execs from the company said it was committed to making Windows 10 friendly for the enterprise ideal for keyboard and mouse users but also optimised for touch. Oh and Windows 10 will put the same interface on devices with displays ranging in size from 4in to 80in. 'One product family one platform one store' says Microsoft.  Given the lukewarm reaction to compromised Windows 8 these seem like bold claims. They are necessary though.Also necessary is Microsoft's decision to make Windows 10 the most beta-tested product it has ever released. Windows 10 was tested by over 4 million people around the world before its launch. That doesn't mean it's perfect - indeed some people won't like the privacy issues (see far below) or the forced updates. Others won't like the new Start menu or the fact that there's now both a Control Panel and separate Settings app. But these won't be issues for most people - minor gripes at worst - and the improvements new apps and new features make it well worth upgrading. For more detail on this see: Should I upgrade to Windows 10?11
I didn't play this game yet but I feel so good knowing that I am a part of  community. 9/11 rate
Why the #### is this still 60 dollers.
est game ever played. Dayz is 100 times better than this piece of . Atleast i can join a in server in less then a minute. Play arma takes 65 min to join a server  this    gaben  valve  these  developers   everyone eat  s
Is wasting your entire childhood on this game a good thing?????
give me the game as gift pls !!
it's okay i guess...
bohemia the next EA in the making-11
ot Google's new Quantum computer can run this at a smooth 20 FPS...11
f this game was a fish. It would be a well made well served action packed fish.11
Nobody bother purchasing this. You think you are going to get a Call of Duty multiplayer atmosphere dont believe it. It is absolutely dead with no actually modes. It is all running around. It is not even a sandbox it is complete trash. Do not waste your money like i did
t was the year 2014 i had played the game for about 4-6 months now.  little did i know this game would change my life...   i had just hopped on a altis life server  i walked around until i met a rapper he told me his name was joshua and he had come from stratis and was trying to set off his rapping career by changing or relocating to altis.  he gave me a snip bit of his tallents ''twinkle twinkle little star have you seen the backseat of my car.'' he then proceeded to tell me about his master plan to get the money needed to fund his consert.  he was gonna ''jack'' a car and use it to transport peaches across the contry and sell them to the ''black market''  he wanted to bring me with him he said i could be his manager.  i agreed we ran to his friend joshua said ''ey yo dawg i need me some cash'' his friend then dropped 12k enough to buy joshua a gun.  joshua then bougth a gun he then told me to run to a specific street across town and hide in a building near the road. he told if he didint come back ''go to the green tree near a mountain.'' ''umm okay i guess?'' i replied.  as i hid in the house i heard a man's scream that was swiffly ended by a gunshot. I came out of the house wondering what had happened. As i came out i saw a dead man on the ground blood covered the road. joshua told me to quickly get in the car.  As i entered the vehicle he told me after all this was done he would go see his familly and tell them all he loved them. But as soon as he spoke those words a bullet flew across the car and into joshua's arm. his horrifying scream scared me as we took of full speed the sirens comming from a cop car rang in our ears.  joshua screamed his scrared face looked straight at me and he said '' im sorry salmon im sorry for everything for involving you in this for indangering your life... im sorry''  joshua pulled over we exited the stolen car. 3 police cars stoped infront of us the police officers screamed ''GET ON THE GROUND'' joshua didint like that the phrase sparked something into joshua that day. i saw flames in his eyes as he whispered to me ''run salmon run'' i listened to him and ran i ran for my life as the cops started shooting in my direction.  I looked back while running and saw joshua pulling out the gun he had bought he shot and killed 2 cops i heard in the distance ''I LOVE YOU SALMON IM READY JESUS TAKE ME AWAY'' as a bullet entered his skull it felt like everything was in slow motion the sight of my friend being ended by a bullet scared me... joshua stumbled back and fell down...  his breath slowly ending i knew joshua was in a better place.  joshua didint diserve this harsh life this harsh ending.  a tear came out of my eye as i ran away...   something changed salmon that day...   11/10 would cry again11
A great sim.
 was somehow allowed to review this game despite not owning it.  10/1010
Combat so realistic that I got shot through my screen and got sent to the hospital. 11/10
Please buy the Bad Review expansion pack to see this review.
Realy fun game to play its worth every Cent.  Most epic thing about this are the DLCs just like APEX its so sick. I recomend this game to everyone even fun if you play alone it is still enjoyable. And the Graphics are 10/10.
ell so far i have gotten 95 hours clocked in.Though that isnt much compared to others its enough were i am able to give a review based on what is in the game and not a preview where i am like this game is so F***ing awsome.Even though that person barley got any knoledge of the game.What i will be discussing first is the campain.Though i found it fun it was painfully bad.If you plan on getting the best singleplayer story.Its for sure not here so go somewhere else.Second is the editor.This is honestly where ive invested the most time whether that is making scenarios for me and my freinds or just shooting the hell out of people.So it is really nice with the things the editor offers since this is a sandbox type game.And lastly i will be discussing the games multiplayer.The arma community has always been amazing whether that is learning military commands and tatics to modding.Also with how many other players there are in a server that you normaly would play on.(wastelandAltis/Stratis life and king of the hill).In conclusion if you love military action and want a fun and realistic military simulation.This is the game for you.If your looking for something like CALL OF DUTY than DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.You dont find guys every where you go its lots of traversing on foot/air/wheel/tract long distances to kill mabey 1 to 20 guys.20 is only if your lucky.The score i would give this is 8.5/10 because of the story and also the mechanics and some phicics are F***ed up.10
this games is cool and stupid
he shooting overall feels better than arma 2 but the scope sway is  its impossible to play as anything other than light infantry going prone. while i overall enjoyed the game i can not reccomend it as the game runs like  the reccomended specs are flat out lies this is because of the games incredibly  optimization once this issue is resolved i will give this the full positive review-11
Play King of the Hill Fly into AO Die Quit Uninstall.. Reinstall Play again Get a penta kill Win 10/10
his game is: 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain 100% reason to purchase the game11
fter installing everything tooking me like ing 5 hours i turned the game on suddenly this  doesn't want to work soo gg wp refunded as well ;)-11
Just learned the basic controls. I am going to try to learn how to fly a helicopter tomorrow I'll give live updates when I do.
i wanna let everyone who is reading this the 'DLC's' are  sh!ty. like i might as well have taken a sh!t and took a picture and made it a DLC. although that might be a better DLC than 's. DON'T waste your money on this spend it on some boi pu-C..
diiis game sucks because fps is  in mult  0/10 this gave will destroy your eyes
 found a car went 140 mph and crashed into a rock.  10/10 Would crash car again.11
hatever you do be thankful this review is up. It might be realistic and such but the controls are horrible. You are limited to few weapons and cannot record gameplay footage without setting the game to view in window screen. Don't waste your time downloading this as it is 11.2 GB and there's not alot of things to do.-11
banned for no reason
its great!
ery good game I recommend it11
onestly one of the best hyper-realistic military shooter games out there. I guess if you enjoy that type of game you'd like it.-11
One of the releastic game.....i guess.....But have a poor animation.And the graphic are good enough to burn your graphic card.  5/10
nothing wrong at all couneless hours of fun in all gamemodes
he animationsgraphicssound are all a big step up from arma 2 the ai less so. But hot damn the modability of this game is amazing! the virtual arsenal anywhere mod lets me choose whatever i want in any single player campaign or mission. so say if i want i cant start the campaign with a sniper!  another great mod is the RHS american forces mod avalible on the armaholic website. each new weapon has insane customization and great animations. For example you can get a M16A4 assault rifle or M4 Carbine and put a 8-10x scope on it for the lols!  Another thing to look out for is Iron Front  mod porting WW2 into 11
I would not recommend this game as 90% of the players are chronically  and have aids
wont start up broken game need to be updated i should not have to go into file and delte stuff just to start the dang game
. Get  2.cant figure out controls 3. Goes on altislife 4. Walks around asking people about trains boats and jesus. 5. Meet a guy sounds gay 6. He was just Canadian  7. We go to Kavala to stel Kidneys. 8. Get kidneys drops the victims into the ocean while restrained. 9. Go back to heli time to fly back and sell the kidneys  10. ????? 11. Profit  9/10 would rob organs and sell drugs again.  No but seriously buy it . There are mods and gameplay for 100s of hours.   Fukn pigs11
NLY ONE REASON WHY I PUT NEGATIVE REVIEW:  I PAID FOT THIS GAME 60$ (OR 70$ DON'T REMEMBER) WHEN IT WAS ONLY CRAPY ALFA WITHOUT ANY DLC's  NOW IT'S 40$ FOR THE NAKED AND IMPROVED VERSION. WELL THAT'S DISRESPECT TO THE FANS AND FOUNDERS.  ONE MORE THING - THE CAMPAIGN IS LAME SO TECHNICALY I BOUGHT THE RIGHT TO PLAY USERS CONTENT. WHAT A DUPERY...-11
Sims with guns...
his game is amazingly most brilliantly fun with friends. I don't know what else to write. Here is my favourite stir fry recipe: Ingredients  1/2 bunch of fresh coriander 3 cloves of garlic 1 thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger 1 bunch of spring onions 1 fresh red chilli 1 lime 2 carrots 1 head of broccoli 2 higher-welfare skinless chicken breasts 250 g medium free-range egg noodles 50 g unsalted cashew nuts vegetable oil freshly ground black pepper 1-2 tablespoons low-salt soy sauce 1 tablespoon fish sauce   Method  1.Pick the coriander leaves and finely slice the stalks then keep aside for later. Peel and finely slice the garlic then peel and matchstick the ginger. Trim and finely slice the spring onions deseed and finely slice the chilli and cut the lime into wedges. Trim peel and thinly slice the carrots at an angle.  2. Cut the broccoli into small florets then finely shred the stalk discarding any gnarly bits. Cut the chicken into 1cm strips. Cook the noodles according to packet instructions then drain and refresh under cold water. Drain again toss in a little oil and put to one side. Lightly toast the cashew nuts in a non-stick frying pan until golden then tip onto a plate to cool.  3. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok. Season the chicken with a pinch of pepper then add to the pan and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes or until golden. Add the coriander stalks garlic and ginger and cook for a further minute.  4. Next add the spring onions carrots and broccoli and stir-fry for a further 2 minutes then add the cooked noodles. Keep stir-frying until the noodles are warm and the chicken is cooked through. Stir through the soy and fish sauces then remove from the heat.  5. Divide between bowls sprinkle over the nuts sliced chilli and the reserved coriander leaves then serve with the lime wedges for squeezing over.  11
This game dosen't know that not everybody own a NASA super computer to run it
ell I could give this game a good review if the minimum system requirements were not a lie if the game could actualy do a decent bit of multithreading or not run like  when you try and do anything relatively complex.-10
layed for now 30 hours only Battle Royal Exile and my loved Mod Breaking Point. Its just amazing and a lot of fun!10
Its Alpha...
is one of the best games ever made because of the great looking guns vihicles and lots more. And if you are a guy who likes to mod a lot like me you shuld get the game i have now more then 45 mods installed and the game gets just better so i rate the game 10/1010
 bought thisreally exited to play it.Bootcamp ran....Okwith a few freezes here and therebut i suspect thats my dying hard drive.I jumped into multiplayer really looking forward to itbut it ran like crap.Now I knew buying this that the performance wasnt greatbut my godI thought that they meant it doesnt reach 60 often.I was wrong. I was getting frames as high as 30 and as low as 5even when standing still.Changing settings to low didnt help and i expected at this point that is was the serverso i tried another.Same thing.At this point i realised if i tried longer i would have over two hours on the gameand have a chance of not getting refunded. So i quit the gameand requested a refund.I really wanted to play itbut 12 fps is not playable.I have an r9 380 and I5-4690kso its not my system.-11
This is an okay game but its ruined by the T  CUNT DLC that constantly interrupts you and blocks your screen it is  overpriced garbage would rather spend my £8 on a blow job from a ING INDUSTRIAL SHREDDER.   singleplayer is very lacking but the editor is fun.  7/10 would desync and blow up again.  YOUR FILTHY MOUTH  HOLE BOHEMIA CUNTERACTIVE TRYING TO PEDDLE ME UR  DLC
Map Simulator. 10/10 would press M again.
My laptop can somehow run this on 60fps high-very high setttings. Fun game
his game is brillant if you enjoy 20fps at medium graphics. You need about 10 GTX 1080s all with 7 I-7 4790k overclocked to 4.5Ghs to run over 30fps. Rember this game costs £50 with all DLCs so you enjoy that. 10 / 1011
Look at how many hours I have on this. Then look at the review. You can spend a lot of time playing on servers that are great. I've made friends on it. But it's not everyone's cup of bullets.
be me playing Wasteland Survival mode spend 2 hours searching for some decent equipment get shot by a random f*g 1km away. mfw  13/37 would recommend.
Played this when it was free.   Good game.   Its only 30$ right now and i spent my 50$ buck on reign of kings and CIV V cuz i didnt know this was on sale.  WORST DECISION OF MY LIFE. I cant believe how bad I missed this amazing deal.  Asking any kind soul out there to please gift this to me. It would be much appreciated.

e and my friends were on a trip through a small village called Gardwood. There were lots of nice people living there and we spent the evening eating at Denny's. He makes great burgers I can tell you that. After the lovely evening we went outside for some fresh air. We then opened our backpacks and pulled out our AK-47s.  We then proceeded to scream 'ALLAHU AKBAR' as we slaughtered the village citizens men women and children in cold blood.   Just kidding I don't even have this game  10/1011

o decided to buy  last year and the DLC packs recently (Karts Marksman Helicopters etc)....Installed Tried to join a server got told I have been caught cheating and have now been banned?  Absolute disgraceful game DayZ is another piece of !!!!. Avoid all Bohemia games!!!!!!!!.-10
his game shouldn't have been released yet. Deadlines kill games. I love this franchise but this game is a big steaming pile of poop. I DONT RECOMMEND IT AS OF NOW....This game isn't worth 10 bucks and they are still trying to scam people out of their 60 bucks!  For 60 bucks I want a perfect game in the aspect of NO BUGS. This game is full of them. It seems every update that comes out makes the game worse not better. The devs care about the money not the game. The same bugs are there since the alpha release...  Save your money on this pile of garbage.-10
  A fantastic war simulator that requires tactics and communication to achieve your objective. Amazing vehicle gameplay where people can become very experienced in both Driving and Flying. But the modded half of the game is a completly different story there are so many more things to experience while playing the great multiplayer gamesmodes the community has to offer. Overall an amazing game that is certainly worth the money.  Pros: -Multiplayer Community is great -Mod Support -Very realistic mechanics -Weather system -Day/Night cycle -Very detailed maps and vehicles -Highly populated servers  Cons: -Takes a Beefy Computer to run -FPS is inconsistent  8/10 would Arma again10
alking simulator.  That is all all. Deleted of my account got conned into buying this :(-10
laying on difficult settings feels like dark souls. Very low fps Otherwise lots of funbut i simply cant reccomend it in this state-10
I guess its okay lel
et a i5 or i7 with the ability to overclock this game is very cpu dependent and wont scale well with alternative setups10
ice really nice.10
is an AWESOME game I have not played it much but the amount of time I have been playing i have had SOOO MUCH FUN! If you are looking for a War Simulator here you have it!10
ugs bugs bugs and low frames. i have GTX 660 frostbite and i cant run in the max. I play BF3 ultra and 30frames... this game is waste of money-10
his game is legit and amazing. The devs try not to call it a sim but it's as close as you can get while still being a game. It's very realistic with damage and weight models. Body armor and helmets give a degree of protection. The same applies to the variation of vehicles in the game. The 2 maps are HUGE and there are plans for DLC in the future which will no doubt add on to that. Speaking of addons the giant mod community for the game is always hard at work making new missions weapons and vehicles to add into the game free of charge. There is endless replayablility with this game and if you're a shooter/military game fan then this should be in your library. Honestly if the game was more optimised (Insane CPU usage for projectile physics and AI decision making) I wouldn't even play half of the other shooters that are out today because Arma does it all and MORE. Pick this game up!10
It's like Call of Duty and Battlefield.' -IGN
ot a game for the casual shooter. Slow and steady is the key as this is a simulator not an arcade game. Those who love combat realism will love this. With realistic physics there is a lot to do in this simulator.10
 very fun military game that gets really intense.10
Very good mil sim.
Awesome war simulator.
this game is ing hard.   10/10 like skyrim with arma would play again.
I takes the origanl aspects of the other games in the series and make it ten time better worth buying
Best Arma Series game ever :3  when it on a free weekend and yet still better but i wish to get the game when it was free but way to expensive i would recommend the game for those people who dont have it
Wait for helicopter pick up simulator' 0/10
After only 24 hours of gameplay the game done goofed. I can't play it and when i try to redownload it it does not work. So gameplay is a 8/10 but the Dev's is a incredibly low score of 3/10
The best game i play on steam and my second game purchased
f you were the smart shopper that decided to read reviews before by this game congratulations. You already outsmarted me. I bought this game because I had imagined something relatively like Battlefield or Call of Duty but on a much larger and more realistic scale. Well instead I got an overly realistic laggy impossible campaign game that breaks if you try to play 1 mod. Personally I would not recommend this game to anyone. I found absolutely no enjoyment in this game. I've played with some friends on a Wasteland server and it was fun until it became Minecraft faction servers in which case you build a base and wait for it to get raided while spending days trying to find someone else's base just to return and find that an x-ray modder has already taken it out. If I was given the opportunity to get a refund for this game I would in a heart beat. The campaign is impossible even on the easiest difficulty because 1: The guiding voice (example: World at War sniper mission with Reznov when he tells you to wait for the bombers) gives you the most basic and obscure directions and expects you to figure it out (i.e. the mortar team in the forest. finding the mine detector.) 2: The hostile AI will drop you in less than 3 shots and you'll never know where they came from and just keep respawning at a check point and trying to find a way to get past them without dying 3: You're friendly AI can and will die in combat and the medic rarely heals anyone or tries to revive anyone. Multiplayer wasn't as bad as long as you were among friends. A friend and I would play Zeus (a gamemode in which one player is able to do anything while the other players just play and wait for the Zeus player to do something) and mess around with vehicles. The vehicles were probably the only thing about the game that I didn't hate except for the artillery. There are no instructions or help tips or anything to help you fire the artillery vehicles. There is no hit indicator as to whether the shell even made contact with the ground or hit four miles to the right of the target. The aircraft are another thing I hated mostly because the were nearly impossible to fly. If you tried landing a jet or a helicopter you were better of grabbing a parachute and hoping for the best because more than likely the aircraft was just going to explode on contact with the ground even going less the a half of a mile per hour. So overall I would rate this game 2/10 just because not all of the vehicles and gamemodes sucked.-10
two words.   Don't Buy This GAME.
oesn't run that well when playing multiplayer because for some reason they thought it'd be a good idea to load the entire map... Kinda the same mistake Unity made by having 12000 NPC's on screen at once.. So it's not a bad game at all very fun and good looking when the game runs smoothly however if you're looking for a fun military simulator that you can play then you might wanna buy Arma 2 instead. So it's not that I dislike this game I have a lot of fun with it it's just that sometimes I have to run it on low to play it at 30fps at most. I have GTX 970 if anybody's curious so yeah 7/10. Wouldn't recommend but it's a fun game still.-10
There shouldn't be any in game purchases. This is how companies loose trust in their customers cause you turn around and screw us by trying to make a cheap buck. Go F**K yourself Bohemia!! You cheap  M*therF**kers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This game is pretty terrible.
I hate this game.
cummy making us pay more money with dlc most servers use dlc so your only playing like half the game unable to pick up guns or use vehicles.  performance buggy as  and did i mention the stupid money grubbing DLC?-10
it goes of the game by its self it takes the 
Could be very good but isn't simple as that.
 have no idea why but this game is kind of boring. I want to like it but I can't...-10
beastly game
 accept the poor performance bugs and little content (never mind there is a good amount of content. It's a shame it's behind a paywall though.) because it's still in a Early Acces Alpha oh wait it's not. It's just . 10/100.-10
 really recomend this game it's a really good game with a lot of possibility. I love this game10
this game is 8/8 GR8 game M8
Totally boring and stupid. It is not for fun. Buy evolve or Battle field hardline. this is Garbage
fter several months of trying to use this game I have had enough.   Today the latest update removed all the mods in expansions (with no guidance about how to reinstall them) that made this half completed game playable.   Despite its huge potential and possibilities BI have developed and sold a half completed game thats over complex unintuitive with poor; single play functions gameplay and AI command &amp; control editing and character / vehicle modifications.   Despite excellent features (Virtual Arsenal and Editor) they are not interconnected but isolated elements requiring complex and 'out of game' processes to bring them together! When was this acceptable?  For some reason its set in 2030 (why?) and relies far to heavily on the modding community to make up for its fundamental weaknesses (e.g. BIPODS for LMG and snipers rifles are an urgent requirement you can not use the weapons effectively (or realistically).  But no Bohemia Interactive priorities 'Go Carts' over critical game weakness to be addressed waiting 2 years to have this addressed in the DLC  Stream can I ask how I get my money back please?-10
ince Operation Fashpoint until now I still play this Simulation knowing their is bugs awaiting around every corner!   10

If this game is on sale buy it because I promise you'll have fun.  10/10
hy I do not recomend it  -'new engine'  Still the same arma 2 bugs  new still unoptimised graphics  -Directed by james cameron  Every viecule will blow up because of a bush -AI  Still the same Unintelegent Aimbot/wallhax AI -Commanding AI  Still the same  contols with worse path findings -Fatigue  Basical a Fat Asthmatic Simulator -Multiplayer  still the same buggy piece of crap with poor hit ditection -Body armor and Damage  you will die from a 9.3mm in the foot and body armor only reduce damage even if you got shot with a 9mm at long range  Is It worth Buying at full price Still after 2 years Not at all. They obviusly try to use the EA marketing Strat with the poor DLC wich are basicaly small mods worth .99$ over priced at 15$.  I got only at a steam sales and you should do the same Just watch out Last time they removed the marksmen dlc from the sales but not the rest because it was the top selling object they had.  This game is Bohimia international version of a Czech gangbang Exept its  volentary ....-10
his game is full of bugs complete waist of money!!!-10
uy it use it fix it mod it upgrade it......oh yeah buy this :) 9.5/1010
Great game but lost 200 hours of work due to my profile vanashing....... great
wesome game with many mods buy this if you like the strategic and tactical side of warfare...10
he perfect war sandbox! Anything from small squad assaults to full war!  Arma3 is one of the few modern games that provides good support for modifications. Also the regular updates to the game are really nice.  If you want a little slower paced game than CoD with more thinking. This is a good game for you.10
 tried to 360 n0sc0pe. I teamkilled its fun.   10/10 - IGN10
ot about 50 hours in  now. Pretty good game love secondly only to DotA 2. The only thing and quite a big thing about this game that I absolutley despise is how it's pretty much PTW or Pay to Win. Although not so much with it's cheaper and smaller DLC's but it's basically a COD level of ptw except worse. With the DLC's you get bonus weapons uniforms armor vehicules and a map as of now. The DLC weapons and armor are usually the better weapons and armor as well wether they're just straight upgrades of previous weapons or mroe useful sidegrades. Some are completely new but are almost OP as I'd consider them primarily playing on Wasteland and other PvP servers. All in all I do enjoy this game and it is definatly playable and enjoyable without DLC's as long as you get used to the almost copious amount of intrusive ads you'll receive when using or near 'Premium' content but at least they let you use some of the premium content just with ads even though it's all content that should have been in the base game imo. 8/1010
The latest best military simulator I've played.
 reinstalled this game after a year of not playing it only to discover that I now need all 4 of the game's DLCs to play on 99% of servers. What is this crap? Even if you get the $20 DLC bundle you still have you pay $35 for Apex because again 99% of servers need all 4 DLC packs. After running the numbers I concluded that that is $55 more than I should have to pay to play this damn game online. It's one thing to not be able to go to servers on the Apex level but it's another thing to get locked out of servers on the vanilla level that arbitrarily require Apex.-10
t is simmulation it is action it is a SURVIVAL that u have to feel  AND IT IS FUN10
n use for very good milsim purposes great community overall fun slightly high skill level and takes a while to set into it.10
good game to play
New dlc features Cup holders 10/10 would buy
BUY IT RIGHT NOW OH LAWDY
reat game epic battles beast graphics and amazing gamemodes on multiplayer10
he first thing that I will say is that  is cheap (not in the money way!) every thing is poorly done it does not worth the price. The best animation and models are from addons that cost too mutch for what they have offer. Why I play this game becaus it si the only game like this !!!! no other reason! Im sure that if it would have competitors the developer would start to fix there game. btw there is mods for arma better and bigger than there arma (RHS) (just saying that those guys hase a smaller team and earn not money by doing mods but arma has a bigger team and earn money)-10
 constantly felt like i was cutting this game slack for the scope of it's map but in the end the campaign is pretty AWFUL way less interesting or even realistic than the original OFP (which is a blast btw) they've done almost zero to make controlling your AI squad even remotely interesting or intuitive the gunfights feel very clunky performance is meh  graphics are POOR by today's standard even on max settings multiplayer is often a lagfest  here's a word about military realism - most SP missions have you go in either alone or with a squad ingress is mostly on foot so is egress there are zero radio options for backup or any kind of coordination i didn't even find an option to choose with position in a vehicle an AI should take so you are alone and you get wounded trying to take on an enemy base? can't call for backup and good luck egressing on foot even at 4x speed while your character grunts like a pig in labor..its certainly nothing approaching realism...i was in the infantry this isn't how warfare even remotely works  id say that Arma2 SP was far better in this aspect with vehicles and a way to call a helicopter to pick you up and drop you off...it felt way more intuitive  overall no i would not recommend this game having a giant map doesn't excuse all the above mentioned issues also having a gigantic map and a 75 or 100 player limit is more of a frustration than a benefit  id say if you want a good military game either play OFP or Arma2 campaign both are rather good-10
I think this game is good
No Linux cross-play with Windows players.
MAXIMUS FIREPOWER  AI are cheaters 4/10
I havnt even played this game yet!
first 20 hours wtf are the controles 40 hours later how the  did he kill me 1000 hours later what mod shold I choose *looks at 6000456082405689 mods* hhhhhhhhhm...*joins russian server*
play the free vrion a glich for the boot camp pis fix
So I Payed $60 for this game a whole back and today i start playing it i get black screen for 10 minutes i cant Alt-Tab I Cant Do Anything But Ctrl-Alt-Delete so i do that it comes up but my cursor was gone so i close out the game by restarting my pc ive done this 6 times now and nothing happens ive verified the cache 3 times nothing still happens its starting to  me off
I expected this game to have way more zombies in it. 2/10
brings a new meaning and overall completely redefines of what you think about military games. I'm going to keep it short because theres around 1000 different things I have to say.  1) Great great great game Bohemia did a wonderful job  2) Not really optimized but its one of those games that is constantly being updated so it can be fixed soon.  3) You're going to need a moderately beefy or beefy PC.  4) Gameplay is amazing if you're PC can run it buy it.10
awflul preformance on most pcs unless if you have a epic pc it will run badly. looks like a good game but from what i seen you can't run it well until this game is optimized more and works better i cant simply give it a super high score it is a 5/10 for me     i recommend it if you have a screaming fast pc but if you dont you should buy a new one or wait...     until i have a better pc i can't give gameplay revews because the fps can't go over 15
Personally i don't like it. But don't get me wrong i think it's really good game just not for me. (Purchased it just to try it out)
t was 9:00pm... I needed money for guns and my rebel group. I ran in with a handgun at the clerk's face and he started to give me the money. But it was too late the cops were already here. I shot and killed one of the cops and stole his police cruiser. Next thing i new more cops were onto me tailing my car. I slamed the brakes and get out my AR. I started unloading magizine into their windshelid. There were too many for me to handle. I got tased and arrested. When i got out of prison the first thing i did was meet up with my friends again and go back to my house. Than I Played .   11/10 Would write a misleading story agian10
t's a good game has some nice game mechanics. DLC is a bit pricey though10
Combat loggers? Never heard of them before...
Still arma........................................................still need 50 titan X's to run the multiplayer
his game is complete trash wont even launch because battle eye doesn't work.-10
 like this game.  A3 - 7.5/10 A2 - 9.5/10  Arma just doesn't cut it for me if there was a public life mod similar with all types of mods then I would be interested. It's boring and demands a high cpu.10
f you like arma 2 you will love this game. If you have not it is a military game but there is lots of mods for this game which makes the game alot more fun like : zombie mods racing RPG and minigames10
Wonderful game. ????
A very fun Modern War Game! I also really like the mods for the gam.
This is the most boring 'First Person Shooter' i've ever played in my entire time of PC gaming. It's like if the developer of Rust had brain damage
n AMMAAAZZZINNG Game such a big change since the last two it's more optimized contains more mods more realism and it's just really fun.10
Hey thats pretty gud
Great game! You'll need a pretty good PC as the graphics are f***ing amazing. 10/10
This is my favorite game ever it is really fun i rate it a 10/10
HOLE  IS DA BEST GAME IVE EVA SEEN I RATE THIS GAME 3/10 WOOOOHH.   THIS GAME IS SO BETTER THEN DAYZ STANDOLONE   THIS HAS BEEN BERT GRYLLS AND IM OUT YEAH.  I ATE RAW POOP  IN THIS AMAZING GAME.  BTW U ONLY NEED GT POTATO 420 MLG TO PLAY THIS AMAAAAAZING GAME  I HAVE NOT SMOKE ANYTHING KAPPAAAAAAAAA
 game i would recommend to people since alot of stuff has happend to it over the last mouth or two having some well devloped mods such as Epoch  life Breaking point and many more mission files you can put hours of game time into10
 have not bought this game (yet) but i played it in the free weekend. I loved it I love how realistic it sounds. Sure the no bipods are a little bit annoying. But the game is continually tweaked and small things will be added in due time. I am a big fan of sound effects and  delivers them on a silver  platter with the best poutine in the world. The purchasing factor on this game was sound effects. After about 5 minutes I found my way into an artillery. Then I fired it. Oh My God I felt the rumble in my feet (subwoofer on my desk) and the bang in my ears.  is the best game if you want the best sound effects in a shooter. Battlefield Call of Duty and World Of Tanks don't even come close to this level of sound effect quality.  is in a class of its own and when I say that I mean that there is not even a teacher because all the other games have to take from  in order to be in that class. For me? This is hands down the game of the decade. This game is awesome in sound graphics mechanics and realism. I would buy the  out of it10
irst time I started playing was on Altis Life as I shouted ' the police and all the 10 year olds on the server!' I realized a game allowing me to unload ammo into a bunch of civilians from a stolen heli is a game for me.  9/11 would massacre Kavala again.10
ess than a year and I have put in around 400 hours across a number of servers.   What  does well: + Mil-sim gameplay + Realistic Physics (I'll try to say that with a straight face sometimes) + Stunning graphics + A solid single-player campaign (Seriously I prefer it to Operation Flashpoint CWC or ArmA 2's) + A large variety of vehicles + Mod support (RHS ArmA3 Life Takistan Exile Wasteland) + A very active community and fanbase + Heli-flying - This is aided by the fact BI also made Take On Helicopters however Heli flying is much easier in  and this is a good thing.  What  does not do well: - Framerate - Large learning curve - Some people in the community can be right ***hats you just have to deal with it.  What I would give Arma out of 10? 9.5/1010
this is the best game i own. the gaming experience i've had of this game is awesome. its so much you can do in one single game. i never get tired of it.
World's slowest development gets forgiven because it has resulted in the world's best FPS.
t was a fun game for a while very realistic good graphics but they do not let you play without buying DLC. They advetise way too much and pick on players who do not pay extra for pointless DLC. It was'nt that bad until the last update. This Apex stuff is 10x worse. The main menu is the menu to a DLC campaign (which is the main button) and using Quick Play in the Mulitplayer section always makes you join a DLC server. That takes it too far. I love Bohemia Interactive but they TRASHED this game.-10
they have had plenty of time to make it not so 
This is a very fun FPS/Third Person shooter. It has good combat systems. I would recommend it.
i really whant this
uarenteed no arma 4 they wont fit 4 lines on the logo10
Disgustingly better than ARMA 2 in every way.
ey  this game is like a going for something.. what you can get .. but you need do to something for it.. its good game but you need to learn it first.. its easy learning.. (When i buy this game i try first editor ... i found a video how to control it .. how to spawn  what to do in it  how to start ... then i try my shooting .. when i make 100hours from these editor or co-op mission i start play altis life .. its funny learn you something .. ;) then go play exile mods  epoch mods .. this is best game u ever seen .. 1k Hourd garantee10
Good game loved it didnt mean to get rid of it for good now i have no cash :(
ull of bugsbut pretty funny10
here are the crosshairs on this game? if there are any i must be getting unlucky and picking all the servers without them. i mean yeah ok graphics but bad animation details doesn't really feel like a shooter when you can't aim down the barrel of your gun or even see your gun sometimes. The controls for this game are ridiculous there's no need for all those controls games not hard they just spent alot of their time putting useless stuff in it.-10
if your like shooter game with realism moments. buy it!  wanna felt in war zone? try it!
It's  lol
reat until game tries guilt you into buying guns. There is gun dlc there is helicopter dlc and there is even go-kart dlc. You need to pay 16 dollars to not get popups about buying the dlc.-10
ON'T READ THIS. YOU WILL BE KISSED ON THE NEAREST POSSIBLE FRIDAY BY THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.TOMORROW WILL BE THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. NOW YOU'VE STARTED READING THIS. DON'T STOP. THIS IS SO FREAKY.1. say your name ten times.2. say your mom's name five times.3. say your crushes three times.4. paste this to four other games.If you do this your crush will kiss you on the nearest Friday.But if you read this and do not paste this then you will have very bad luck.SEND THIS TO 4 GAMES IN 143 MINUTES.

best military simulation game ever
The reqirments are WAY too high and too good for my Pc to handle
ey guys lets make a game and then expect the community to fix it for us. Oh yeah they already did that it's called ARMA.-10
the game is ok-ish  6.5 for nearly being DAYZ standalone
....... the helicopters...... were the only reason i played....... now they are too hard to fly......XD
This game was pretty fun at first doing training missions. Then my friends and I decided to play together. Until I realized you had to pay another $30 to actually play the game. So do not buy this game is .
1) Download on free trial weekend 2) Plays tutorial 3) Feels good man. 4) plays next day. 5) Game wont work cuz errors 6) uninstall. 7) 10/10 would buy a game that offed itself on me again
Arma3 is so bad you get kicked for nothing dont buy it
Buy for the game stay for the mods gg
the game sucks
is the successor to ArmA 2. It is a pretty decent Mil-Sim that seems pretty realistic but not too overly realistic. I originally purchased the game in Alpha and have had the privilege of watching the develop of the game over the past year. The early game was very raw and buggy with bad AI and questionable engine capability. This progressed in the Beta and it is only after the full release that  is actually getting up to the same level as ArmA 2. Don't get me wrong I play  way more than ArmA 2 only switching back for the occasional DayZ day. The game has a nice multi-level feel where you can fight with a magnitude of different styles and as of Beta a variety of war machines. The in game mission maker as well as mods such as MCC allow the player to make dynamic and fun mission for single player co-op or multiplier. This game is still lacking though as each new campaign update brings more content for players to use. In short  is a good game but still needs some work. If you are used to CoD or Battlefield this may not be the game for you. The online community is very team based and lone wolf tactics may not fly when attacking a town or launching an invasion of the massive Altis map. If I hadn't purchased the game in beta and I was looking to purchase it now I would advise to buy it either on sale or when most of the content has been added or a larger variety of mods are available. Though the game is in full release treat it like a beta and report bugs and glitches as there are still a few.   In short: * Medium level Mil-Sim * Heavy on teamwork * Allows for a magnitude of play sets * Allows for creative mission making * HUGE modding and map making community (You will never run out of missions to play) * Promising campaign * Seems like Bohemia listens to their community * AI have some issues * Engine is still not the best * Still missing a lot of content (NATO/ CSAT jets other NATO forces guns etc.) * May not appeal to more casual players (CoD and BF3/4 players)10
This game is just amazing. you have it all. mission editors multiplayer campaigns theres lots of weapons transport all around
o you remember operation flashpoint ?  if you do  you will buy  !:10
 prefer arma 2 the current day wepaons not bug eyes yawnsville.-10
his game is one of the best i have ever played.. if your into games about stealth combat shooting and driving tanks and helicopters this is one for you! Get it now while it's cheap!10
I had a life. Then I downloaded . Haven't seen the daylight for 3 months.
oo much like Arma 2 except Arma 2 mods are way better.10
 have had this game since Alpha and i have now loged over 300 hours in it.  The amount of Things there is to do inside of this game is unreal. There are loads of server hosting diffrent mission. The arma comunity is very good bring out mods that make the game alot better and adding in some cool stuff.   The campaign in this game is one of the best ones i have played in years. How it is planed and and playes out is amazing The start of the campaign you walk to a helicopter and then it flys you around telling you what you are doing. Then you have a little bit between mission where you can walk around and get given mission. when you are walking around you can listen to what the other soliders think about what is happing.   Some of there Server that are out there are: 1. Altis Life (RolePlaying) 2. Domination (PvE with Missions and side Missions) 3. Invade &amp; Annex (PvE with Missions and Side Missions) 4. King of The Hill (TvT 3-Teams) 5. Blitzkrieg (TvT Caputer and Hold) 5. Wasteland (Survival PvP) 6. Coop Player made mission 7. Some ofther fun game modes.  Some of the cool thing to do in : 1. Play around in the editor and make missions and use diffrent scripts 2. Use diffrent Mods Like the DayZ breakingpoint and F18 3. Play The Campaign. 4. Play the little mission Made by the comunity. 5. Fly around the massive map and see what there  They are all the good points about the game and there is some bad ones but they are not that bad There is some anoying little bugs and a little bit of a lack of content but somtimes it can matter on what server you are playing. The game is new and missions are still getting made so some of them are alittle bit buggy but noting that would really effect yoru gameplay that much.10
I very much enjoy the modding community in this game 10/10
orst game I've played in a long time way too complex for a game.-10
ood game. mod support is great and the devs are constantly releasing new updates.  The only problem with the game is it's 32bit engine and cpu issues. This doesn't mean you need a beast of a pc to run it. What it means is that you will be held back by the limitations of the engine regardless of your hardware. This is the case with me.  The server will hold your fps back. For example. Running a server with 90 people on it and explosions going on anywhere WILL drop your fps into the sub 60 zone. servers upto say 60 people are fine. Once you get above the and they are all clustered around the fps drops.  Don't buy the game on the steam sale. Buy it on their website so you get a better discount as you get the upcoming APEX dlc also.  gg10

 Very fun very realistic. All round an amazing game an military simulator.10
i want a refund but not sure where to get it
errible game not at all optimized Can't run the game without a computer made by god himself and servers can ruin your fps if they are not at the perfect specs to join.-10
Really good game. If you are looking for realistic fps . Take Arma.You wont regret it !
lain and simple.   ~Do not buy this game at full price.   ~Do not buy this game unless you want to buy the $70 DLC.  Or  ~Buy it and waste $35 on half of a game where people can pay to get better content than you!   Conclusion?  Don't buy this game unless you are a masochist who enjoys spending their time playing critically acclaimed half broken half DLC barred games.-10
i got the game for free on a steam sale and bc of an update i have buy thte game again.
Great fun. Lag and glitch simulator!
it sucks
bsolutely great game One of my favourite Arma titles 10/10 has great graphics. Also has some great mods Really enjoying Takistan Life mod at the moment having fun with the suicide vests in the game (In the least dodgy way possible) But definately a great game i would reccomend it :)10
hopper shot down drug off to be executed 10/1010
efunded. After 4-hours of playing online I refunded the game. Spent the vast majority of my time shooting at what I was told was AI on an adjacent hill.  20-30 minute firefights with trees that just lead to heli' rides back to the DMZ to re-stock on ammo.  Smokey the bear wouldn't approve.-10
This game gave me PTSD.
ery slow moving not a very friendly multiplayer environment very disappointed by the gameplay.-10
 this game 11/10 piece of niv manyak
he PC Exclusive Title '' is a perfect example of a gaming masterpiece. Set in the later 2030s in the fictional island nations of Altis and Stratis.  boasts a map a little smaller than twice the size of Washington D.C..  also has an extraordinarily large and challenging campaign which I am still struggling to complete. Also the game is known to be extremely graphically demanding but I can still run it on my Macbook Pro 13' on low settings on 60fps. Also  boasts a variety of wonderful fictional vehicles ranging from civillian vehicles to army transport. One of the best traits about  is the fact that is has so many free mods supported on it the most popular being  Life (Real-Life Roleplaying Mod). The only con for  is the demanding price as a game that costs $60 is pretty expensive. Otherwise I highly recommend  due to it's great contribution to PC Gaming.10
reat game fairly easy to mod... Plenty of possibilities come with this game.10
rma3 (needs permanence optimization) THIS GAME IS TRASH WITHOUT THE COMMUNITY ... GIVE BIZ NO MORE MONEY TILL THIS GAME IS OPTIMIZED AND PERFORMANCE IS INCREASED (to the standards expected by pc gamers or at least whats stated on the box preferred specifications)  Many games RELEASED UPDATEs THAT INCREASED PERFORMANCE ON PC WHY CANT BIS GET OFF THEIR MONEY HUNGRY LAZY ASSES AND DO THE SAME ....  ARMA runs like   why is a a game of this scale and this demanding 32 bit ? why does it only use half of system Ram? why does it only runs on 1 core  plus the recommended requirements ON THE BOX SAY   3.10 GHz for cpu   and even on the lowest settings thats not enough (Unless Bis lied about whats needed to run this game or this game runs like dodo)  its been 2 years  OPTIMIZE GAME PERFORMANCE IN SINGLE PLAYER AND MULTIPALAYER NOW TO MAKE USE OF OUR COMPUTERS.... HOLD OFF ON DLC AND TRAILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!?  how bout fix the single player bugs overhaul the unresponsiveness AI increase the game performance integrate AGM mod as default in the game engine integrate K.E.Y.S mod as the defualt in the games engine .. ?  AND YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO CHARGE US FOR DLC WHEN COMMUNITY MODS DO ALOT MORE FOR FREE SMH SHAME ON YOU IN 2015 BOHIEMIA ?  IMHO best solution would be not to buy their products in future. I lost all respect I ever had for BIS because of  and DayZ. Neither has improved the #1 problem with their games;  poor performance. They gained large following with ArmA 2 and Dayz mod and choose to blatantly exploit it and sell subpar products with no intent to fix them.10
wesome game looks nice10
his game is a MilSim that lost it's identity to Battle Royale Exile and Arma Life.  When people told me that Arma 2 was the better game I thought to myself 'that game's buggy as  even if it doesn't have the exact same features it can't possibly be worse!'  And here we are.   I would probably enjoy this game more if I downloaded exile but that mod is the size of a whole new game that just piggybacks on the core of this unfinished mess.   All of the guns feel and sound the exact same which makes determining DDD impossible.   All of the scopes seem to have this weird blue lense effect that doesn't held when trying to figure out if that thing you're looking at is a player or an oddly shaped bush.  The DLC for this game is a joke what the  do you even use Zues for?  Save your money and buy Insurgency or Squad or even Call of Duty because that's even cheaper than this game AND more balanced.   I expected more from Bohemia Interactive 2 years ago when I first picked up Arma 2 but it seems every game they've sponsored or put forward has just turned into a mess. Lookin' at you DZS-10
upposedly super fit soldiers can't run 100 yards before passing out from exhaustion. Poorly funded terrorist troops have better armour 7-10 hits to kill. Supremely overfunded US troops use cardboard for armour. 2-3 hits to die.  Highly trained US Marine/Ranger/Seal/whatever can't keep the reticle on target.   this game.-10
is a mil-sim that is very refined yet buggy at times. Overall I wouldn't recommend because the bugs are bad and only break the game half of the time. They released DLC's purely to make money and make the game play to win. They have a 7.62mm machine gun for free yet the pay to win people get a 9.3mm machine gun that shoots down any helicopter in 2 shots. Not fun. Do not buy for multiplayer this game is only usefull for it's editor function which allows you to make your own missions without pay-to-win guns. Since it's 60$ you have to commit so hard just to be disappointed by all the hype for a decent game that got ruined by the game breaking bugs and pay to win DLC's.  Can't play the most popular gamemode (king of the hill) with a gtx 760 and 3.3 Ghz...game drops framerate to ONE frame per second when an A-10 does a CAS run. Singleplayer still ok but multiplayer is useless. Here's a good example of my problem that 99% of page viewers can replicate:  http://feedback.arma3.com/view.php?id=1264   That feedback was made in 2013. It's 2016 and it has only been 'reviewed' Fix your game-10
 played it a little bit but my computer had problems but from the footage that I have seen it is a great game and if you can run it you should get it.10
Mods Mods Mods Mods Mods Mods and more Mods
o not over saturate this review im just going to cover the fundamentals of how i would like to describe my game expeirence aside from my 700+ hours in  Id like to touch up on how I feel about it.  The world of  is extremely diverse not your average shooter. In the game  you have many different roles you can play as a charecter from very realistic fighter jets to infantry to even sea attack boats hell even mini submarines!!!   also invites a ton of ability to mod the game with thier editor to scripting to full blown modding which has given the game so many different tastes. Some of my favrote modded/scripted versions of  are Wasteland and Altis life. By all means im not dissing the vanilla game that deserves its own review in its self. But i feel i should cover what most people would want to do(at least me) other then play vanilla all the time.   The standard of this game i guess is give the community this tool which also encompasses a game and let them mod the  out of it and they have so much support to help you do so. Ah but i hear you through the monitor asking Well what about bohimea interactive? are they just sitting on thier asses letting the community do the work? To that i say NIEN! the developers are working tirelessly fixing bugs and adding new content to the game which i highly appreciate As of now within this month there should be a new map expansion and a ton of new content added to the game!  All in all this game is super amazing as iv been playing it for around the past 3 years and have racked up over 700 genuine hours in it and i dont plan on stopping anytime soon10
The game looks pretty good but just don't try to run it with an AMD cpu.
Be me Playing on RP server Decided to make coke with a friend Start driving all over altis find out we need 15k to buy a licence to make it spend an hour looking for an ATM (we had about 200 unprocessed cocaine on us) Get shot at Freak out Almost hit a tree Get to a city Get the money Leave city Hit a tree Get to the processing plant Cops come Down us Handcuffed Police pilot crashes heli Comes back with new heli Run us over with heli Medic was 5000 metres away  10/10 would make coke again
toReal4me 3/10
illed my friend with a stolen go-kart while robbing the Federal bank in Altis life so did'nt have to split the money.  I only recieved 10000  10/10 would kill again.10
This game wouldn't even pass as a beta for most studios... Not happy.
t seems enjoyable.. but it crashes every five to ten minutes. And yes mt pc is WAY more than capable to run this game. Itll be running on good settings at a nice framerate no bugs nothing then... the picture freezes the sound repeats like a damaged vinyl record and even my task manager freezes. My pc is virus free I scan after every download and once a week. No viruses just a poor game.-10
 don't know what I expected to be honest but it's slow boring and has a terribly steep learning curve. Luckily I can still get a refund. :^)-10
ot the best graphics but a very good game awesome 'world' huge maps.10
Doesn't get much better than this. If the developer would just quit ripping us off with lame DLC.
Bryliant Super Computer Recommended
his game is fun for Altis life in my opinion. I was driving down the road and this guy ran up to my car screaming and i lost control flipped over and blew up. I lost all the peaches i had picked. 9.5/10 would pick peaches again.10
/10 Arma 2 + more graphics = .10
ont buy this game ArmA 2/AO is way better.-10
why can i write a review don't even have the game lol
mazing time and effort went into making this game. However I am not willing to put as much time and effort into playing it. As far as I'm concerned it's a SNAFU Simulator 2016. I understand the goal of the game is to achieve authenticity but it is too hard to survive.-10
dont own the game but can write a review 10/10
the game wont even run i want a refund
ust finished the main campaign it was pretty fun and challenging.10
