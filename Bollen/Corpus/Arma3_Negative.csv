It looks sweet runs good but the controller layout is all over the place and you cant change it :/;-1;0
When I first played Arma 1 I barely enjoyed the game nor did I stay for too long simply because I didn't like it. Coming to ArmA 3 I felt a whole different experience a new environment like never before. Something attracted me to this game when I first played it during a free weekend; a feeling of excitement fear and all sorts of emotions of that nature. I felt like a real soldier in an actual militaristic environment. Months later when I actually bought it I got hooked again with the same elements as before. Here are some of the pros and cons after a good 15 hours on the game:  Pros: -Somewhat real life experience (i.e. running (actual stamina system based on how much weight you carry) driving aiming and firing etc.) -Weaponry (Different types of ammo explosives range from mines to grenades Launchers etc). -Amazing Teamwork -Vehicles -Both a Third Person Shooter AND a First Person Shooter  Cons: -Unstable FPS issues (literally stay away from this game if you don't have a strong CPU since this game mainly focuses on more CPU power than GPU) that vary depending on either campaign or multiplayer. I seem to run better on multiplayer for some odd reason but sometimes it's the same as single player on certain occasions such as driving. You literally have to deal with it. The lowest FPS I get on Ultra Settings with a Nvidia GTX 770 and i7 4770k is around 30 tops maybe a good 25 sometimes (like I said when doing various tasks).  -Unreal Physics at certain times. So basically let's say you climb a 5 foot ladder inside a building and fall or you leap from a 1.5 foot distance from a flight of stair in general. Picture the size of 5 feet. That's 60 inches. Jumping from this distance= death. Yup. And even a slight bump from the rear of a car can kill a player (around a 10-15 mph car can kill a player in this). These are some small things to overlook by BI but still I face palm sometimes at the unreality of the physics. -Difficult controls. It took me some time to learn all of the controls and almost 5 minutes to figure out how to aim down the sights. Simple things like these can easily be overlooked but are for sure some of the things to know when coming into ArmA. It ain't easy to get into like Call of Duty or Battlefield.  Neutral Comments: -One last thing to say is that this game can be a running simulator at times. Although you have to travel far distances sometimes on foot (and waste a good amount of time) the game provides a lush realistic environment that contributes the beauty of nature. It compensates for all the running that has to be done but allows you to explore the wilderness of a massive island.  All in all this is my review for the game.   TL;DR: Good military sim one of the best out there. Gives you good feels but lacks on certain parts. A 'deal with the graphical issues' game. ;1;0
So you're laying behind a rock listening to bullets crack by and looking out a few feet to your side at the body of your buddy wondering if he's just passed out or if he's been killed like the rest of your squad was. Suddenly all you can hear is the roar of the A-164 cannon as it screams overhead and the sky goes red with the fire from explosions. You peek out at the burning remains of the enemy forces and breathe a sigh of relief for the first time in the last hour. Those moments are why you play Arma.;1;0
 This game is simply amazing.   I know the FPS may be bad at stages and the bugs and glitches may be annoying but hey it's ARMA. A3 is an amazing game and even more amazing with mods. Never can I say I have seen another game where I can screech in my F-18 Super Hornet over a bunch of ISIS Militants in a fictional town in the middle east. The multiplayer is simply amazing as well however buggy at times. I did not enjoy the gameplay very much at the start but when I added the necessary mods it was a master piece.   9.8/10    TLDR -   PRO: Amazing game with great core gameplay  CON: Minor and Major bugs and FPS Issue Tip: Accompanied with right mods it is a master piece;-1;0
Do i recommend this game? Yes. Do i recommend it if your not on a powerful pc? HELL NO. This is a great game with big ideas and lots of potential.....the only thing holding it down is the down right terrible optimization...This game randomly lags whenever it pleases. Most if not all Bohimia Interactive games have similar problems to just keep this in mind if your looking to buy this or DayZ. Then again great ideas alot of fun and great graphics. (If you have a PC that costs more than your car.);-1;0
it dosent let me play i when i get on it says no entry?;-1;0
fps drops in multiplayer and nobody cares about it i can say its still on beta version;-1;0
just noticed i had never written a comment down here so let's write.  so i'll good points bad points.  good ones:  It's an arma game. It was made by bohemia interactive. there are guns. God damn CHOPPERS Dev care about the community The community is freaking good well... most of the time DLC don't penalyze anyone and the features of these are free  Dev still add new things (for instance DLC marksmen tomorrow adding working bipods resting on objects new guns and all this kind of ) they're currently working on a new map they'll surely add many unknown things.  The freacking mods i mean in this game if you want a ing private jet riding a horse with a sword there's probably someone who made it and if not you can do it yourself (it's a long  work but you can).  now bad points:  Physics you make a vehicle explode by driving 3mph towards a rock but you won't explode if you make a 180 landing on a spruce tree from a god damn ac-130 which comes from a mod...  Some people in the community especially the ones who complains about DLC's that add free content..  Not enough planes there are several choppers civilians and military but there are only fighter jets and drones as fixed-wings.  And finally hellicopter advanced physics which is some kind of weird crossing between the arma 3 style and some kind of reallistic but not too much physics i find it pretty weird but meh..   So buy this game this was an order .;1;0
Its like sex If you get with the right people you'll be hooked;-1;1
8/10 for being a one of a kind game. It is a massive scale realistic military game with a developer that generally listens to its community and embraces mods. Also Tanoa is flippin awesome.  -1 for the action menu not being replaced  -1 for no ability to play as female player model in vanilla game. It's 2035 Bohemia!;-1;0
Made an ac-130 with tanks and a small plane... 11/10 -ign;1;0
I pre-ordered arma 3 deluxe almost as soon as it was available i was hyped for arma 3 and despite what my hours reflect (steam is weird with offline hours) i have played the crap out of this game; i want no i NEED to love this game day 1 i convinced 3 of my friends to buy arma 3 so we could play co op together and i'm regretting doing that.   The Game:  The game plays just how you’d expect from an arma game some bugs it's weird quirks like you can vault into a wall and kill yourself despite walking 10 feet and laying idle for half an hour my trained military professional can't stop from shaking around like a heroin addict. Still its arma and i enjoy the game i would recommend it it’s really fun.   Unfortunately the one thing i was super excited for was under water combat water infiltration etc i was sooo hyped for it and then i played the diving showcase and i was miserably disappointed. First off there's only 3 positions you can be in standing straight up and down on your back or on your stomach is there a guy directly above you you want to shoot? well that sucks embrace your impending death. you can't move 360 in the water which is just terrible the underwater combat and movement is miserably disappointing. A massive massive massive let down.  Still there's hope!!! who doesn't love helicopters in arma right? i'll just wait for it to be released… oh cool! just got a notification that helicopters have been released let's just jump in a- wait what? i need a dlc? to fly a helicopter? well that’s weird but okay it's probably like 99 cents or 2 dollars nothing maj- 16 DOLLARS!!!!!!!!! WHAT!!!! okay maybe it's justified there's probably like at least 15-20 helicopters right? 2 helicopters for 15 dollars? are you kidding me? what the hell is this no discount for deluxe owners? so i payed all that money for a map and an easily stolen mp3 files great.   alright there’s still one thing i like in arma sniping! it’s so much fun to sniper in arma we all know it soon they’ll add sniper rifles and i'll be able to run around ghilling it up picking off opfor. alright! marksmen weapons added 5 marksmen weapons added too!! sweet i was worried they would add one rifle at a time. let’s just load up a game and get sniping away 16 DOLLARS AGAIN ARE YOU KIDDING ME 16 DOLLARS FOR 5 RIFLES 2 MACHINEGUNS AND A GHILLIE SUIT!!!!!!!!!!!  oh also they added a go kart dlc which is really fun and worth the 2 dollars it costs like all dlc for this game should but doesn’t.  In conclusion it could have been a great game murdered by dlc preventing you from using things in the game i can’t wait for the bullet DLC to let you use Bullets. it would be different if it was something not crucial to game play who wants to do a mission on a massive island without helicopters? who wants to stealth around or take out targets without marksmen rifles? go karts? yeah it's nice cheap DLC not crucial to game play. so so game mechanics if you like arma you'll like it disappointing diving and be prepared to spend at least 32 dollars extra just to play the game. also thanks for charging us extra for trusting you and pre-ordering the game if i had waited and bought the game now it would've cost me less. thanks.   oh yeah and good luck getting more than 30 fps on your thousands of dollars in hardware this game has about as much optimization was windows 10.;-1;0
The first person shooter for those who dislike the far fetched things in games like call of duty and halo and who want the expansive enviroments that put battlefield to shame. While the Arma franchise prides its self on being a simulator it still has it's gimicks and comedic hickups be it some very interesting animations ragdolling or just physics occasionally breaking (  see here for example  [embed.gyazo.com]  ).   Don't be put off by that if you're looking for the ultimate military simulator however as when it works (which is does more often than not) arma offers some intense fighting with a range of weaponry and veichles. Arma allows you to operate ( with multiple people) veichles such as the standard civilian cars trucks and jeeps as well as the more traditional viechles seen in warfare games tanks APCs AA viehcles and artillery. Arma also offers a range of aircraft veichles ( be it more helicopters than jets) like the A-10 warthog bomber and the huron heavy lift chopper. Each veichle type follows its own set of physics which are relativley accurate to that of the real thing.  Weapons are o'plenty in arma 3 but I see little point in detailing every weapon in the game. In short theirs everything you'd expect to find soldiers armed with. The weapons in arma 3 offer different fire modes and caliber of round different calibers doing specific penetration and damage for example the 5.63mm Katibla rifle hardly scratches anything armored where as a well placed shot from the 12.7mm GMB Lynx sniper rifle can disable a chopper or jet.  there are a variety of game modes to suit your liking and mods if those are your thing. The three most common game modes you'll see on the server browser are     Wasteland    Altis life    Warfare  They are all distinctly different. Wasteland offers you a choice of 3 teams to join with preset load outs. You then scavange veichles and weapons from the veichles and attempt to do missions on the map to raise fun for better gear to wage war on other players. In short its sandbox survival. Some servers also include a base building function.  Altis life is something a lot of new players seem to enjoy both playing and watching people stream. Personally I hate it but thats just my opinion. Altis life is a role playing community that aims to represent some form of normality. Civilian players work to earn money and Police players enforce the laws. Civilians can make money through illicit activities as well as legal ones the illcit ones paying more. Each server is different so I won't go in to too much detail.  Warfare is what it says on the tin. 3 factions battling for contorl of strategic points across altis. OPFOR BLUFOR and Independant. These servers tend to be a lot more formal and require much more teamwork than the prior two baisically you have to know what you're doing on the game before venturing on to one of these servers as Armas combat system is like no other first person shooter.  I reccomend this game as something to play with friends and enjoy discovering it together as playing it alone (at least I find) is incredibly dull.  The dlc for this game is not essential to play on servers that have the dlc enabled. However you will not be able to pilot DLC viechles or use DLC weapons ( you can still enter DLC veichles as passangers) . In comparison to Arma 2 the DLC for Arma 3 is very lackluster.  Currently Arma 3 needs a pretty decent computer to run and even then you're likely not going to hit above 60fps. The game is very poorly optimized  My other fued with arma 3 is that manually dropping bombs from a jet is a task that is near impossible. The only way to drop unguided bombs is dive bomb. Using a strafe approach is difficult because the interface on the jets no matter what type they are is configured to that of a fighter jet.   These are all small disadvantages to a game that is so fun with friends  However due to the game only having two maps that are pretty similar it can get repetive very quickly  Over all I say 7/10;-1;0
Stephen Hawking runs better than this game. If you have some seriously beefy hardware you can run this game 60+ fps. But for us simple plebs we get solid 30's and 20's. Fun otherwise :);-1;0
Low flying UH-1 listening to jefferson Airplane - White Rabbit Sudden AK Fire begins shooting out the crew chief. Crash landing as we drag crew chief away trying to fight off enemy everyone is shot wounded screaming for medics sudden silence as 2 F4 phantoms fly over and bomb us 10/10 will go through hell again.;-1;0
So of my short time with ARMA the past few days since it went on sale. I tried for a refund. Ill be honest I did not like this game. I tried MP and I got such bad performance I may have thrown up a little. I did not get the refund after 3 days of waiting. So I decided I should try doing it again.   The reason I wanted a refund was because it seemed to tactical and needed alot of 3rd party software. I gave up on trying to install teamspeak (YES teamspeak...how noobish) when I decided to redownload this game. I asked the community how to use and operate teamspeak as well as how to improve performance. I was directed to a really good guide on steam to increase performacne (Gained about 5-10 frames) and another one on how to use teamspeak.   Since I got everything situated...I have had a complete blast. Sure the performacne is garbage on bigger servers. But I found that this game taught me in my 19 hours 1) 20 FPS is playable 2)This game has a great and helpful community  If you are like me and debating whether to get this because it seems to tactical or whatever...dont hesitate. Get in some of this action. The community is great the gameplay is slower paced and still a blast.   Ill leave with this. the youtube videos make everyone seem like they must have a mic or else you will be screwed on regular multiplayer. That is not the case. You just need to show up and be a good teammate. Never go alone. I would suggest buying this while its on sale. Full price is stretching it.;1;0
Perpetually broken Horribly optimized and at times unplayable. Arma 3 is a game for wannabe operators that are too out of shape and cowardly to actually fight. Don't worry though you can expect plenty of cashgrab DLC like Arma 3 Karts or the Arma 3 Two Helicopters and the rest is free DLC or the upcoming Arma 3 Seven Guns and a bipod feature that has been missing since release DLC.   You can't blame BIS though it's not their fault the game runs poorly the real problem is the toxic community and their poorly ported mods that cause the game to  itself.   If you buy this half-game you can expect 100s of Altis Life RP servers populated by 13 year old and 20 somethings that failed to launch. You could also try out one of the many KOTH servers for some low FPS deathmatches with people that can't fly shoot drive or communicate worth . Don't forget the DayZ knockoff servers too or it's tired older brother wasteland.  If you are too hardcore an operator for that though you could join one of the many 'Realism Groups'. It's like being in a real army man! Some of them even give you assigned roles and make you adress eachother by rank. If you are lucky you will find one that makes you do a virtual obsticle course or bootcamp before you can join. It's like the authentic bootcamp experience only your drill sargeant is a socially  teenager on such a powertrip that you would think he actually believes what he is doing isn't completely  and unnecessary. Once you are in you can look forward to a mission once a week that they will restart if something goes slightly wrong in their supremely tactical plan.  3/10;-1;0
Alright I gave this game a thorough try but did not like it. I went through some training and played some of the campaign. Because of the ballistics it was hard to tell how much to elevate my sights to hit something. I kept getting shot from people I could not see and when I did see them I couldn't hit them before I died. I think the controls are way overly complex. I never could figure out how to use the medical kit on myself. I think the interface was not intuitive for using inventory. I think this is a full on simulator with clunky interface and too many controls and not enough clear training or instructions. If you want to spend hours and hours mastering a complex game this is it. If you are an FPS guy like myself and want some moderate controls and be able to play quickly without mastering an interface or controls I recommend avoiding this game. It's just too complex. I had high hopes. I would like a simulator but this is just too complex. I play games for fun and I don't feel the need to spend hours learning and training to be able to use a game. Also be careful of graphics settings to get a good framerate. It can be taxing on your graphics card.;-1;0
Those low FPS will make your eyes burn... It is a really good game but poorly optimised/made.;-1;0
It gets a bad reputation for being overly complicated but it honestly doesn't take that long to learn how play the game especially if you have friends who already play. The complexity of the game also depends on what you are doing playing as an AT Rifleman is going to be significantly easier to learn than learning to fly an A-10D with AFM (Advanced Flight Model) on. I will say that I much prefer playing with mods than 'vanilla ArmA' because it adds sooooooo much content and possibility. Honestly ArmA III is very much like a sandbox game because you can find all kinds of different stuff to do from racing go karts to doing mil-sim OPs with a A3 community.  If anyone is getting this game and wants to join a community to do light mil-sim than check out  http://ddca3.com/ ;-1;0
oMg so realistic even the grases moves unlike cod lol buy the premium edition for your special skull camo and ac-130 killstreak (Srsly tho it is a good game get if you think your graphics card wont melt on ultra lul);1;0
Arma 3 is awesome and sucked at the same time. Here is why I think so. Arma 3 basically nailed it when it comes to the new map edit. Making a battle is way more easy. The graphics are way better. I have not even ajusted anything because it looks great so maybe later. But the lack of vehicles is a major let down. Arma 2 was $20. It came with a vast amount of different vehicles and aircraft. For $20. The new $50 comes with basically nothing. There is like one gunship chopper an A-10 and one Fighter Jet. No vtol at all. No cargo plane or MV-22. There is one tank for NATO. NATO is all I can pick. The plane selection is gone and the chopper selection is vastly limited. One truck per a side and I don't like how models that you don't own are intergrated into the game. Features are all locked so its like....What did the $50 price tag cover? At the very least I would of expected them to port over the vehicles and armies from Arma 2. If you put the files from arma 2 into arma 3 they work but the sound don't match and all the features don't work but arma 2 vehicles do drive and fly so they could of spent the time they used to make DLC to port over Arma 2 stuff to Arma 3 so that we could at least make a proper battle. As it stands now.....after paying $50.....you still have to buy DLC to even make a good war. I am disapointed and feel like I waisted money because Arma 2 was totally better. If Arma 2 had Arma 3 graphics.......it would be dramatically better than Arma 3 hands down. Yea....you can download mods to add things to Arma 3. But after $50.....I should of been able to make a full scale war with Arma 3 right out of the box. But I can't....Not untill I buy enough DLC to fill the void left in Arma 3 by the lack of Vehicles and other stuff. Not enough puzzle peices. There are times that you and the enemy you place are using the same weapon systems cause its the only one to use at all. Untill I buy enough DLC to fill the void left in Arma 3 by the lack of Vehicles and other stuff I can't really do full scale war like in basic non moded Arma 2 without any expantions. Arma 2 out the box gives you enough Lego's to build something with. Arma 3 makes you buy every peice. Why didn't they port over the vast amount of stuff in the previous game? Why would you not do that but charge me more for the new game....Weird;-1-0
Ok where too start the game is fun and if you have a group of friends even better now with that said the game is laggy and when i say laggy i mean very laggy. I'm running a 290x with an 8320 asrock mobo and it still can't run this game you want too know why they don't give a  you got it now your stuck with it they don't fix anything just save your money and get something else maybe if you have an intel it may run better but my brother have intel and you know what he can't run it either so don't get it i'm telling you right now you will be sorry. And what's sad is i love the game when i can play it it's a good game but oh man does it suck;-1;0
Just hasnt got the magic. cant really explain but the game has lost the fun.;-1;0
DONT BUY IF YOU WANT TO GO MULTIPLAYER. UNLESS YOU HAVE AT LEAST A 3.5GHZ INTEL i5   The game itself is a very nice realistc game with many weapons and attachments many vehicles many unique features and 2 GIGANTIC maps (about 300km²).  BUT:  -Multiplayer FPS still not optimized (was promised) -Collision-Detection still not improved (its obvious that something is wrong with a 3d game where you cant jump) -AMD Hardware optimization not even began.... (15-30 FPS in multiplayer...they couldnt care less bout AMD users) -AI is a not-so funny joke -Ground-vehicle behaiviour is far away from being realistic or enjoyable (they obvious tried both and failed) -Official Servers????? NOPE!!!!! -Matchmaking????? NOPE!!!!!  -CoOp play singleplay campaign?????? NOPE!!!!!!  RV engine 'Features':  -bad collision detection (the most essential part of a shooter) walking on rocks = falling through them and die. walking on stairs = get stuck and die. walking towards a wall = glitch through and die  -switch weapon while walking = standing still to switch weapon (finally solved in arma3)  -no free movement i.e. jumping climbing etc.  -massive desync between server and clients  -extremely slow server browser that you cant stop from refreshing  -extremeley clunky vehicle physiks  -undynamic sound engine (sounds cant move with their source)  -massive FPS problems on multiplayer and large scale ai missions  -non dynamic lightning (flashlights throw light through walls etc.)  -several crashes  -non effective memory allocator  -no multi cpu/gpu support  -no 64bit support  -poor ingame voice chat quality   +realistic ballistic  +good sound effects  +nice graphics with huge viewdistance  +extremely huge maps  +nice 'stances' feature  +huge possible amount of players on 1 server    This list would be endless.   they should REALLY outsource the engine development due NO PROGRAMMING SKILLS.  DayZ SA is the same  but even crappier (10-15 FPS in Towns while arma 3 gets around 20-30 FPS on a 50 Player Server).  They should have learned form ofp and arma1&amp;2 that they are unable to programm a stable and performant game engine. So why dont spend some of the earned money to the development process  (as promised in the EA phase) and buy a decent engine from someone who is able to programm such an engine (UE4 Cryengine 3 Unity)????????????  they set the wrong priorities and ignore the simplest rule of programming: ______________________________ *****KEEP YOUR CODE CLEAN AND FAST***** -----------------------------------------------  they earned at least 200million$ with dayz(&gt;10mil. copies sold)  and about 30million$ with arma 3(&gt;1mil. copie sold)  what are they doing with the money?  the development team is &lt;100 persons  its not personal costs. its not sound recording. its not the mocap sessions. its not engine optimization. its not even design or modelling. its their ING OWN POCKET where the money goes.  They are taking our money with hands WIDE OPEN (spend about 50€ for arma 3 and about 23€ for DayZ) promise to use it for the game and dont spend it in the development process as promised.  Bohemia Interactive has great artists and designers + a good know of realistic weapon behaviour but the dev-team leaders and programmers are even stupid as hell or only want your money for no effort....  i really hope that they are opening their eyes and start optimizing their company or no one will ever buy another arma or dayz. i wouldnt. i made my experiences with Early Access and Bohemia Interactive and must tell: THEY ARE LAZY AND MERCENARY. Update Cycles from DayZ are a bad joke. take a look at H1Z1. It was released over a year later with a MUCH smaller budget and has updates AT LEAST EVERY 2 Weeks...;-1;0
this game is glitch;-1;0
Arma 3Now Arma 3 is a awesome game but were here to talk about more than the fact its awesome  Graphics are amazing well the way i can run it Arma 3 can bring someone's FPS to -100 depending on your comp. so if it is lagging i highly suggest you lower the settings down ALOT.  What can you do on Arma 3: You can do Atlis Life (Alot of Role play it has a bank and cops so there you go) Battle Royale (Hunger Games but in Arma 3) Dayz Brecking point (Arma 3 Dayz Mod) Now about brecking point its a pain just to login to it so i suggest you play Atlis life and Battle Royale And it is a 1rst/3rd person shooter i rather allways be in 3rd person for certin reason's that im not gonna disscuss. There is alot more gamemodes but those are my things. Is it worth the money Depending on your comp. Yes As allways my rateing for this game is 10/10 REMEMBER THIS IS ALL MY OPION SO DO NOT THINK ITS ALL HERE. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME10
I robed someone in my underwear then another guy in an underware came and arrested me.  -10/10;1;1
Really nice game make sure that you do have the. Recommended specs since if you dont your disk percentage goes 0-100 real quick. no pun intended nice game 100% love it;1;1
Is Bohemie Interactive under EA control now? seems like it with the rip off dlc.;-1;1
Arma 3Great game tons of possibilities and modability although lacking serious realism factors at its current state such as weapon sway (said to be fixed t) which in real-life being a gun owner say i ran a quarter mile as fast as possible I stop and aim my gun you hold your breath as much as possible since its necessary but in this holding your breath is nothing and it is the exact opposite of what real life is like... your gun will be bouncing literally side to side on your screen after a long walk when you actually need it youll be hitting 5-10 feet left and right of a target 30 yards in front of you... ing rediculous.. And the fact that the DLCs even exist is  imagine getting into a wasteland server seeing a heli and you want to fly off in it then you scroll wheel up to it get in yeah all gud in tha hood rite? wrong without paying $15.99 for TWO HELICOPTERS you will be kicked out and not able to fly it. Is it just me or is $16 rediculous to fly 2 new helicopters? Yes i own it because i bought the DLC bundle. Im not saying dont buy arma but think about the stupidity running through their heads about these ideas... Might I also mention that the helicopter physics in the AFM (Advanced flight model) is somewhat exagerated in some areas. Speaking of the AFM its optional.. which is stupid because like 1/200 people are actually using it now which makes the dlc a god awful waste of time..11
Arma 3The focal point of Arma 3 is the infantryman. You get the feeling that you are a cog in a massive military machine. Armor rolls in behind you to support the assault helicopters scream by with cannon blazing to keep the enemy’s head down. It is a game about visibility finding your target and fixing them in place while teammates move in for the kill. You will spend as much time looking at a map as you will firing at enemies you can barely see.  But Arma 3 goes a step farther and allows for you to take every role on the battlefield. You can be the tanker on the front line the helicopter pilot ferrying ammunition and men or the mortar team dropping rounds on a target from a kilometer away.  You can even be the commander and lead the assault via radio turning the entire game into an RTS. It scales incredibly well and has an AI capable of filling every role.  It wants to tell a futuristic story set in the 2030s where Arab countries leap-frog the West technologically. It's a daring choice. NATO infantry resemble today's special operators like the SEALS or Army Rangers. Against the lizard-like helmets integrated binocular heads-up displays and futuristic ammunition of the Arab CSAT faction western forces look decidedly old-school. It's an interesting role reversal.  But without a plot Arma 3's daring bits of speculative futurism are reduced to mere graphical pastiche. As it has been released without a single-player campaign it’s just a collection of vehicles and weapons. When playing NATO you don't feel overmatched and when playing CSAT you don't feel superior. You’re just there.  Next to the gaping hole where the campaign should have been Bohemia Interactive has placed a set of showcase missions. These are largely the same missions that were available during the beta phase. And the alpha phase. Some of these missions feel like vertical slices that could have been presented to the press at conventions years ago.  The showcase missions serve a function in showing off the game’s tech at least. I was impressed by the lighting and particle effects pleased to find that ground vehicles handled better than in past versions and that the AI for allies and enemies has been beefed up. My roughly 2 year-old gaming PC ran Arma 3 successfully at very high settings though not always at desirable framerates.  My puny mind however with its limited processing capacity was not able to divine how to fly attack helicopters without multiple trips to Bohemia Interactive's forums and out to YouTube for several fan-made tutorials.  That’s because the game that Bohemia Interactive is selling right now does nothing to effectively teach you how to play it. Help screens flash up during showcase missions so quickly that they’re nearly useless. There’s an in-game instruction manual of sorts but it feels unfinished. Some of the commands — switching optics on the tank’s periscope for example — are listed as 'undefined.' It was on me to go deep into the menu systems and assign a key to make them work.  These showcase missions move unrelenting fast at times. The allied AI makes few attempts to let you catch up when you fall behind and that leads to a vicious cycle of learning by dying. This made the glitches all the more frustrating. Small hiccups saw allied soldiers sucked inside rocks or enemy AI who would lay on the ground as if to sun themselves while I carefully zeroed my rifle and walked rounds in on their head.  What I would call large errors ranged from the improbable (landing a jet upside down on a mountainside) to the incomprehensible (a low-speed collision of two tanks which catapulted them both 30 feet into the air) to the downright creepy (a seated infantryman lengthening his neck by a foot T-1000 style).  Joining public multiplayer servers was a crapshoot and there are no Bohemia Interactive servers to play on. The majority of my pick-up games were hosted peer-to-peer. Players looking for regular stable experiences on hardware capable of hosting more than a few dozen players without serious performance issues are left on their own to roam the wilds of the internet searching for clans.  But the searching was worth it because when I found a good server the experience was incredible. Most of those experiences came from fan-made modifications like Wasteland and Domination — not from anything that Bohemia Interactive shipped with the game. It’s as if the game’s community has ignored the content that Bohemia Interactive made out of spite.  Where Arma 3 shines is when you have 6 or more players working with you in a multiplayer session. A set-piece cooperative mission called Escape from Stratis stands out. Here a NATO platoon of 10 is stranded somewhere on the massive hand-made map. The goal is to find a boat or a helicopter and escape alive.  The few times I've been able to play it with a complement of 8-10 friends have been nothing short of incredible. Simply making it safely from one hilltop to the next has been exhilarating. How I know the game is succeeding is that it is teaching us how to operate as a cohesive fighting unit by forcing us to survive in a hostile environment.  Once while moving over open ground our platoon was pinned down by multiple enemy infantry formations. We formed a perimeter called out coordinates and together returned fire and destroyed the enemies allowing us to move to better cover. While we were looting the corpses for ammunition an armored personnel carrier (APC) crested a hill. We hunkered down and gave covering fire while two players carefully brought anti-tank rounds to bear. Then we repaired the APC ourselves and drove off into the sunset.11

Arma 3'Picture yourself standing in the middle of ing nowhere then having to run 60 miles to get home you picturing that? Well the game should really be called Arma 3 the real jogging simulator or dream smasher because let me tell ya you run for that long and get some cool gear you're probably gonna get killed'- Righteous goaler 2013-1511
Arma 3I've spent so much time(yes 200 hours are actually a lot for me) with this game and it is still fun. Why is it still fun? The community especially the right community is the reason for it. Playing KotH CTI and Coop. If you need an air strike then call one nothing is more epic then an A-10 fly-by while shootings its guns and rockets at some pesky tanks. And with all these mods out there you can actually always find something new. There is also a mod called ALive which creates missions for you. You decide which scale you decide which side and you decide everything. I can only recommend this game to every military simulator lover even though it isn't as serious as DCS as example. But there is already A.C.E.3 in development. See you on the battlefield.10
Arma 3Worked multiplayer for 80 hours now everytime i join a server i get a message 'Battleeye client not responding'. I have tried updating batleeye manually updated router firmware and tried everything else in the help forums. Good game but it is broken by a 3rd party anti-cheat software.-10
I personally dont like it becuase out of 13 hours of game play 10 of it was trying to fix errors popping up in the game. I have tryed EVERYTHING and some of them are not fixable. It has made me lose my mind.;-1;0
Arma 3Arma is love Arma is life. No better simulation on the market. Taking down 5-10 in a single engagement can feel more rewarding than an entire playthrough of any other military game. CoDF*gs need not apply. As the saying goes: Wussies play CoD boys play Battlefield ARMA is for men ;)10
AI bugged out and wouldn't let me carry on with the campaign. 0/10 would play.;-1;1
Arma 3Call of Duty? Battlefield? What are those? ArmA is a simulator game compared to those pesky arcade games. Nobody can 360 you here nobody can quickscope you either. This is the real MLG.   Try to go on a rush and see yourself getting shot. It's all about tactics how good your teamwork is and how efficient you play.  Pros *Unimaginably good UI. Game gets every command as I want to transfer. No problem. *Good netcode. Even with 200ms you hardly feel the lag. Most match lookups have no problem at all. *Stunning graphics. Yes it can use a better thing or two but it is a simulator game and gives you the simulating graphics too. Not to mention a large variety of adjustables for graphics. *Total realism. Okay well maybe except the magical first aid kits rest is pretty much correct. *Brilliant single player campaign. Unique for me. *Multiplayer with mod support. Let it be EPoch or Altis Life Zeus or whatever you can think of there's a mod related to military. *I can count these up to infinite but just get the game and see for yourself.  Cons *Bad low graphic performance. or I have a really ancient GPU. Ge-Force 610M gets ~30fps with everything at lowest 100% scaling with 768p. Drops down to 17-18 on really hammering areas. *Game's way too CPU intensive. I can go for a CPU stress test with this game. Maybe I should type this as a Pro. 2 in 1 program :P *Way too costly. 124TRY for vanilla version and 159TRY for Extended. Even with 50% discount it felt like it was a full priced game to me. If you're not fan of ArmA series or really want to get this game I can't recommend it without a discount. *A bit complex commands. Takes a few hours to get used to it hell it can even be days. Also not everyone can play this game. Takes a bit of extra buttons or few macros for quick responding to situations.  Go and do your thing private!10
Arma 3If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if your looking for an outstanding lemon bars recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1) 2 cups Flour 2) 1/2 cup Sugar 3) 1/4 teaspoon Salt 4) 2 sticks (1 Cup) Salted Butter Cut Into Small Cubes 5) Filling 6) 1-1/2 cup Sugar 7) 1/4 cup Flour 8) 4 whole Large Eggs 9) Zest And Juice Of 4 Medium-sized Lemons 10) Powdered Sugar For Sifting  Directions:  1. For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch pan with butter.  2. Stir together the flour sugar and salt. Add the butter to the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut it all together until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press into the prepared pan and bake until golden around the edges about 20 minutes.  3. For the filling: Stir together the sugar and flour. Crack in the eggs and whisk to combine. Add the lemon zest and juice and mix until combined. Pour over the crust and bake about 20 minutes.  4. Allow to cool in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours then sift powdered sugar over the top before cutting into squares.  (Use an 8 x 10 pan if you'd like the layers to be a little thicker.)

Arma 3Fun if you like hearing the F word over and over and over and over again. lol I miss the days when games where about great graphics great stories and amazing sounds. now it seems like all game developers do is build there games around the bad language. not worth my time or money. deleted it after the first 10 min.-10
Arma 3As much as I wish that BI would add more modern weapons I know they added the AR-15 platform to the game with the Apex DLC and there are mods but this game is pretty damn good even without them.10

Arma 3Have had the game since 1st round of Alpha &amp; had Arma 2 OA before that. Intially I liked ARMA due tot he Milsim but only played Arma 2 Free which wasn't that good.   ARMA 3 was a revolutionary step forward especially with many of the server lag fixes &amp; better movement.   The DLC has been a bit of a disappointment as between RHS &amp; CUP I don't see anything that I need missing.   I did buy APex forgetting that RHS has the AK 104 which is essentially the same as the AK-12.   I'm putting in a refund as no mil sim I play with uses Tanoa &amp; no servers really do either.   I would rate the base game a 5/5 &amp; the DLC a 3/5 so overall 4/5.   I would buy the base game &amp; download   CBA  CUP  RHS  &amp;  Enhanced Movement.10

Arma 3Played a couple of hours... It was alright I guess.11;-1;0
Arma 3This game is good for a time being. I played it long enough to know the uptades &amp; changes and this devolopers is the one you should be avoid. All they think is how can we make more money from this game ! What they do is NOT fixing THE BUGS AND GLITCHES NO... They want to release new dlc which is almost same price as the game and has no realism in it's contents (Tags Simulation Millitary and Tactical) There is no realistic thing in apex that is just pay to win you can get friking THERMAL+NVG HELMET ON YOUR DUDE AND SEE EVERYTHING ! I did buy this game because of those titles and simulation feeling it gave me when I first played it let me tell you it is good ! But after some point when I see things like ; Devolopers giving support to mod called 'Altis Life' FFS THIS AINT ARMA THIS IS NOT WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BUY THE GAME FOR ! People should buy this game because of it's titles and devolopers should focus on those titles. If you will buy this game because you want to play simulation OK but don't expect devolopers to fix bugs and glitches WHICH IS %100 of the game they will think how we can make more money out of this game believe me I played this game for 2 years and never seen devolopers fix any bug that is really makes impact on gameplay just the ones they can fix within an hour. I don't recommend this game for anyone wants to play simulation and expects devolopers to make it more realistic no this AIN'T THE GAME FOR YOU DEFINITELY NOT !-10
I've played the game during the free weekend and it is extremely laggy even in standart settings my pc has all the recomended features.unless it is a temporary bug that everyone deals with i dont suggest it to anyone.;-1;0
Input lag on all controls makes you feel as though you're running around with a block of concrete strapped to your head. The new Go Karts have what feels like a 100ms delay in single player from me pressing the D or A key to the wheels actually starting to turn.;-1;0
altis life sucks and its so hard to run its stupid;-1;0
Arma 3-10/10 Got killed 200000 times in 5 mins by ex militaries finest and when i got 1 kill he said 'What the  did you just ing say about me you little ? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the  out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth mark my ing words. You think you can get away with saying that  to me over the Internet? Think again er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re ing dead kid. I can be anywhere anytime and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable  off the face of the continent you little .

But you couldn’t you didn’t and now you’re paying the price you  idiot. I will  fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re ing dead kiddo.' and now im fearing for my life...11
Arma 3I'd like to say I like the game and i'm a fan would i recommend this game to people 'nope' not until they fix the 'sway' down sight you run 3 feet you sway you crawl you sway....you fart you sway...people are going to say it's 'realistic' that is bull....I hope no one in our armed forces are that wimpy and get tired that fast. if you want to know what it is like for michael j fox in his daily life buy this game...because that is what you'll be getting a michael j fox shooting game.-10
Arma 3Fun times to be had. Ignore all the issues and play the game. When you get down to it killing hapless peasants at range with a 50 cal and thermal optics is just as fun as gunning them down from across the street with a LMG. This game is at its best when you are on your own behind enemy lines with nothing but Abdul the condenscending Persian and your T-100. You can fire from behind a house or in a hull down position at the backs of unsuspecting armor infantry or the occasional aircraft. Fall back and repeat while the smoke fills the sky and peasants burn to their horrid deaths. In the end the game has some flaws but thats to be expected in a game this size regardles of that; I love this game. 9/10 Would use as trophy wife.10
Arma 3I bought this game day 1 of steam release it was pretty barebones stuff a few guns even less vehicles 1/3 a campaign.  They said more weapons would come (if you know arma 2 they had dozens of weapons arma 3 however had less than 10)  well more weapons did come in the form of paid DLC.  More vehicles more paid DLC.  Scumbag moves-10
Arma 3dont buy this game. its not finished. there is no story there are bugs ai is stupid........ bohemia doesn´t give a  about releases they promised. we are still waiting for the 2nd part of the campaign that should have been released - as promised - in december. now the tell us it will be february. its a sanbox and without community developers this game would worth 0.- I highly recomment to wait a few months.-10
Arma 3Terrible multiplayer optimization with those who have AMD chips. Running an 8 core bulldozer AMD CPU with 8GB of DDR3 and a R9 270x and I cant get over 15-20Fps tops while online (no matter the server). Terrible. Its a known issue with this game engine but it looks like there isnt any hope in site in the near future. Otherwise I think id like this game. I really have no use for the single player so im not sure about it. I do know its playable on most rigs even AMD ones. But I bought this one for the MP and I cant play it so....not sure how good it is gameplay wise really. (PS-its not just my setup that causes these issues either. I couldnt run it any better with my AMD FX-6100 6 core with samsung DDR3 and a HD 7770 GPU).-10
Arma 3This game is definitely a direct improvement over Arma 2. If you are familiar with that game it is very easy to transition over to this game. I especially enjoy the mission editor. The mission editor has a pretty steep learning curve but enough tutorials and trial and error will get you competent with the editor's logic. The game is much better optimized than Arma 2 was but it still runs pretty awful on multiplayer even with a high spec PC. I ended up having to turn down my view distance to a pretty low amount to consistently get 40 fps on multiplayer because the fps largely relies on the server's power. On single player or a small server of 5-10 people I could just about max out the game with a steady 60 fps. I am disappointed with the DLC though as it really doesn't add much at all to the game at this point and it retails at $25. I would recommend picking this game up even if you have never played the other Arma games because it seems like it has a much smaller learning curve than previous titles but is still just as in-depth. This game is a good purchase especially on sale the DLC on the other hand is not currently worth it.10
Arma 3In reality this is a pretty bad game rife with glitches and problems. The only saving graces that managed to make this popular were the mods and the fact that there was really no game like this. Until Squad anyways.-10

Arma 3I have this PC: AMD FX-8350 4.2GHz ZOTAC 960 AMP! 2GB Corsair Vengeace 8GB 1600MHz CM Storm Scout 2 Advanced  So let's say it's a decent PC every game I play works great had no problems. But when it comes to ARMA III... Basically I can only play this game on singleplayer multiplayer works at a top of 25 FPS I guess 25 FPS it's low. I tried numerous settings and stuff no way can someone explain to me what kind of computer you must have to actually have decent framerate?-10
And so with the dlc's the game is now Pay 2 Win how great!;-1;1
Arma 3Game's price has reduced which is good! Although they're dumb money grabbing s.  The normal game is fine just don't throw them your money by buying their awful overpriced DLC just use mods.   http://www.armaholic.com/index.php?c=news_arma3_mods   I saved you 60USD$ or 77.16CAD$.-10

Arma 3ARMA III has been valued at $60 (€4958) for over two years now and heres why. If you are a fan of FPS or TPS games you have probably been playing COD CS or BF ten hours a day but ARMA III is not a FPS or TPS games its a Military Simulator. Unlike COD CS or BF ARMA III is meant to simulate war making it VERY realistic. Which means its very hard to get any kills when you first start out and unlike in COD CS or BF ARMA III is set in a HUGE sandbox map meaning: no invisible walls almost everything is accesible and snipers are everywhere ;). In order to enjoy ARMA III you have to like VERY slow paced shooters and have a ENORMUS amount of patience. You also must be ready to be killed by that level two sniper hiding in the bushes 1000 ft. (304 meters) away. Even though I said it is VERY slow paced when you do happen to land yourself in a firefight it is heart racing and very intense. In order for you to capture a objective in ARMA III you have to do these five things: A: Get a group of 10-15 people together. B: Carefully plan out minute by minute whats going to happen where it is gonna happen who its gonna happen to and why its gonna happen. C: Aquire transportation to the objective and exit your vehicle about 500 ft. (152 meters) away from the obective. D: Approach with caution because you have no clue where their security is. E: Excute with full pride and confidence. PRO TIP: Always be sure to keep in communication with your team and use a compass to give cordinantes on an enemy. ARMA III is a BEATIFUL game which means it has some heavy system requirments I run it on an Alienware m17 and still get an occasional lag spike. ARMA III is not for everyone or everyones computer but for those who can run it and enjoy this type of shooter it deserves a 9.5/10 (because of high system requirments I took off half a point which is why its 9.5 not 10)10
Arma 3lol...I don't understand how it got such high reviews. people say mods make the game....well that's not the way it should be imo. If the game sucks without mods...well...it just sucks.   First 10 minutes of playing the game 2 major bugs. 1 invisible mobs..2 I got stuck going into the next campaign with no ammo for my weapons...I could not go to the ammo stockpile and do a damn thing about it...don't know why don't care done playing. Where are all these weapons they talk about? Maybe I didn't get far enough through the game but having only 2 or 3 guns to choose from was just boring...and damn the AI is badass...picking me off a mile away with a gun that in reality you couldn't hit a person with from 3 blocks away....absurd.  I don't know maybe the multiplayer is awesome....sounds like that's why people like it...single player? beh...save your cash imo.-10
Arma 3I could not recommend this game even if I wanted to. Download is horrible way too many gigs of space used for a game that is pretty choppy decent graphics and just a mess over all. The tutorial is fair enough and the prologue is fine. But the campaign is horribly tedious and that's if you don't keep dying at it and having to respawn from autosave because they don't allow you to save for yourself after a certain point. Be prepared to die so many times your fingers will feel it. I'm glad to not be buying this and uninstalling it after I finish typing.-10
Arma 3First and foremost the graphics and realism is very very very good. I'd say exceptional.  The controls however are severely lacking as they are in no way fluid. Using the ASWD + mouse for control with half of your controls on the other side of the keyboard does not make this all that fun to do.   Again don't misunderstand me. The game's realism and graphics are exceptional and the storyline was intriguing but the controls are simply horrible and it severely detracts from the game when you're having to remove hands from your movement controls or from the mouse to hit Backspace to clear the squad command windows. In combat this is NOT something you want to have to do but there it is.  Take it as you will.  If you're after a game with good graphics and realism and a decent storyline check out ARMA III.   If however you want something that you can play fluidly and not want to bash your keyboard after ten minutes of dealing with the akward controls move on.-10
Arma 3I approached this like any other game though I have played Operation Flashpoint ARMA 1 &amp; 2 before.   Played the campaign first flaw I noticed is that once the fighting starts in earnest the game's checkpoint just stops and it won't even let you quicksave for long periods of time. As a result you'll be playing the same sections over and over again unless you're really good at spotting enemies in janky terrain and shooting them through inaccurate terrain hitboxes.  Really most rocks early on in the 'Survive' campaign seem to need about an extra foot of clearance so if you use them as cover you're just wasting your very limited bullets and I grimly suspect they would have screwed up just as many collision boxes if not more later on in the game. The enemies you are fighting in that mission also have some pretty good body armor so you need to accurately put a bunch of 6.5mm bullets on target against targets that are running using terrain and don't have any problem injuring you.   Even having played the prelude I wasn't ready for the long stretch of running with occasional dicey battles and no opportunity to save your progress for a good 10 - 30 minutes fairly early in the Survive campaign. It would have been sensible to maintain flow for the game to at least ALLOW me to manually save before or after each of the firefights that are about 5 minutes apart of just running (or 20 minutes of stumbling along if you take a shot in the leg).   Requiring a marathon jog through fighting 3 - 4 decent enemy squads including snipers and machinegunners with only one ally without even the option of saving let alone automatic saves anywhere in there amongst all the scripted chatter and setpieces that you do encounter would be fine as an optional challenge but not the start of a campaign where you have to get through it before anything cool happens. You don't even start with a single first aid kit to patch up your leg if you take a round through it so one unlucky hit and you'll be staggering between checkpoints instead of a 2-minute sprint.  For my money I'd rather buy either something a whole lot more interesting and deep than ARMA 3 or something just as simple in theme but with tight controls and good flow. For me ARMA 3 sits in that uncomfortable spot between a simulator and an action game where I'm going to be frustrated by the intricacies and slowness of getting to the action and then the battles themselves aren't any fun either especially not with bad checkpointing.  That said this sort of game really lives or dies on its multiplayer. Which I can't be bothered with. So as a singleplayer game no I wouldn't recommend it. If a game's singleplayer campaign can't hold up to scrutiny then it shouldn't have one.-10

Arma 3I bought Arma 3 Extended edition for 50% off at 40$ CAD. I regret my purchase because the multiplayer is a piece of . It takes forever to get to an objective and most of all the FPS is TERRIBLE compared to the single player. I get 45-60 fps on ultra in single player with view distance of about 3000 or 4000 but i get 20 fps in multiplayer.  I have a core i5 2500k and a gtx 970 ssc. During multiplayer gpuz reports my gpu usage at 30% and windows 7 resource monitor shows cpu usage at 50%   Unless I can get this mess sorted out I will not support Bohemia Interactive anymore.  Edit: After trying different video settings there is still no fix. From low to high i still get 24 fps at 500 view distance unplayable.   This is the worst multiplayer experience I have ever had and really wish I could get a refund. The only good part about this game is the single player which wasnt even completed when this game was released. Edit: The single player missions are very small and sometimes force you into a single path. they were decent but not as good as ARMA I missions. The multiplayer part of this game is a piece of .  Edit: as of June 8 2015 the game no longer works for me. I am trying to reinstall this piece of trash game to see if it will work.  The game now works but still crashes and is PLAGUED with other bugs.   Hilarious list of bugs from the morons at Bohemia Interactive:  -Helicopter spontaneously explodes upon entry.  -Computer terminal for purchasing vehicles sinks beneath the earth thereby making it innaccessible.  -Sniper rifle is able to explode an APC.  -Really  framte rates on multiplayer at all times.  and the list really does go on. It seems this game is the steaming pile of  that they have been trying to create...-10
Arma 3This is actually a really goodinnovativeand realistic game.But I give this a 'No' due to the lack of server with good pings.I live in Indonesia and the nearest available server in my country is China with 200-350 ping.Uninstalled it after I realized I won't be able to play a single multiplayer game from Indonesia. Pros : + Super realistic in almost every single content main positive side of this game. + Stunning graphics + Fun multiplayer games (never plays it but saw it at YouTube) + Lots of cool mods from the community + You can use vehicles rather than just being an infantry like in other games + You can create your own levels Cons : - Extremely confusing controls. This is the main downside of the game. - The single player campaign is really difficult to beat.I got killed over and over by stepping on mines which are invisible. Yes it is realistic to be invisible but it would also be realistic to have mine detector if you know there's a massive minefield in front of you. With the lack of ability to save frustration builds up pretty quickly when you always had to start back from the minefield. - It seems the devs ignores the difficulty of the campaign and only allows us to save ONCE every level. It is one of those games where the difficulty outweigh the fun like Dark Souls and The Impossible Game - Lack of soundtrack makes this game very hard to 'feel'  I don't get any fun from playing this game.Only frustration.My multiplayer's dead and my single player's impossible to beat.If you're from Asiadon't waste your money on this game.-10
Arma 3This game has serious playability issues starting with trying to see something to shoot at.   Something is wrong with the zoom functionality. It says there is a target to shoot out there I affix a scope and even at maximum zoom I see nothing. Just more white green and brown blobs. On top of that everything looks bad and walking gives me motion sickness after 20min. My solution was to get up and walk 300meters to the target so it would become visible and then shoot it so I could progress. My AI companions did all the shooting when the fighting started. The objective markers virtually disappear and are hard to see against the textures used by the game.   The training starts with an NPC talking about Greenbacks and AAF's and I have no clue who these people are. I started the campaign and that just made things even worse. It explains that NATO peacekeepers are pulling out of Altis (fictional mediterranean island) to fight CSAT in the Pacific.   There are a lot of hanging plot threads that make no sense what's with the earthquakes why do some of the bases get attacked who is this dead guy I find on the road what happens to the guys on the bases?  Finally you get to the shooting part and it just doesn't work. After the first dozen deaths I end up having to put my face a few inches from the screen to try and see any bad guys and that only causes eye strain. You do not see anything to shoot. They see you even prone but you will not see them. No tutorial is given to explain how to nullify the bad guys ability to sense your presence.   I quick view of let's plays on youtube shows they are playing a game that actually displays the enemy.   Moving on to multiplayer would be nice. If there were actually multiplayer games. Don't be fooled by youtube or the tab that says multiplayer in the menu. There is no multiplayer. There is only multiplayer if you join a community through the forums. And they will have a list of mods to play and generally are about playing with people who already know how to play ARMA3.-10
Arma 3Pros:  - ....  Cons:  -Horrible. Constant crashing -Cant play ANY mod at all when ALL I EVER WHANTED was to play Epoch  Battel Royal and Wasteland Chernarus. -60$ game + 30$ for 2 chopper ? ... -100 Gig (Arma 3 + few mod install )   Wish i have some good words to the game but i Cant get a single match to function and yes i watch youtube video and all but after 3 days i still unable to run any mod.   This game only remind me my experience on DayZ.Crash after crash and bug after bug.  I made a huge mistake buying DayZ and ARMA I will not support Bohemia Interactive anymore.-10
Arma 3Great idea good controls etc...........but the bugs are horrific. Almost 2 years on and you can still die from clipping through walls missions can't be completed or the AI breaks is just not acceptable.-10
Arma 3I wish i could both recommend and not recommend... but ultimately i hate it.. it has such potential... if you like single player shooters this game is pretty good. the campaign is pretty neat.. that's about it.. i got this game cause i prefer sims over arcadey type games (CoD)... and the sim level is there... the problems start at online play. you need to be a member of a secret society to actually get any war play going on online. and neither have the desire for that nor the time or dedication.. this was evident almost immediately. all the online servers are really stupid GTA meets 2nd life meets the sims mod crap. its insanely stupid and boring.. unless you hunt down some online community of people who actually want to play a war game you wont get that online from this game.. no official servers or official game modes (that i could find).. its highly annoying.. within an hour i wanted a refund but at the time i had a baby and he started crying and i left the game open and it went past the 2 hour limit (5hours it claimed) i repeatedly email steam trying to explain the situation and all i got was the same auto response... a complete waste of money.. so i uninstalled... then with news stirring that it was going to get a dx12 update i thought i would give another shot since i was stuck with this piece of crap anyway.. multiplayer is still absolute garbage if you don;t want to be active in a community.. so i played the campaign it was ok till the second chapter where the first mission is solo stealth with no guns garbage and i lost interest again... up until that point it was enjoyable.. about a 7 out of 10..   i dunno.. mixed emotions.. if you want to play a slower more boring versions of gta online with better physics.. this might be your game.. if you want to deal with online forums and locked private servers to get a battle in this might be your game...if you like single player campaigns might be your game.. if you like single player target practice might be your game.. it has all the potential in the world... with absolutely no delivery to anyone who just wants to hop into a battle and shoot.. (wasn't expecting a run and gun but i was expecting to play a war game not a run around grinding gold with stupid rules and having to have a job rpg) i would say avoid it.. i tried so hard to get a refund but steam sucks and i couldn't even get a real response from a human being.. now im stuck with this useless single player game.. i keep trying to force myself to find something fun to do with it and it can't be done... on the other hand technically and graphically it;s amazing and the attention to details is great... it was just squandered on a community with terrible terrible terrible ideas on how it should be played... the addition of official servers wih official game modes would make this game a 10 out of 10... until then its like a 2.. unless you like pretending to be an under paid truck driver that gets harrasse by lame people who think they are digital police..  i personally wish i never spent a dime on this game...-10
Arma 3I bought Arma 3 Extended edition for 50% off at 40$ CAD. I regret my purchase because the multiplayer is a piece of . It takes forever to get to an objective and most of all the FPS is TERRIBLE compared to the single player. I get 45-60 fps on ultra in single player with view distance of about 3000 or 4000 but i get 20 fps in multiplayer.  I have a core i5 2500k and a gtx 970 ssc. During multiplayer gpuz reports my gpu usage at 30% and windows 7 resource monitor shows cpu usage at 50%   Unless I can get this mess sorted out I will not support Bohemia Interactive anymore.  Edit: After trying different video settings there is still no fix. From low to high i still get 24 fps at 500 view distance unplayable.   This is the worst multiplayer experience I have ever had and really wish I could get a refund. The only good part about this game is the single player which wasnt even completed when this game was released. Edit: The single player missions are very small and sometimes force you into a single path. they were decent but not as good as ARMA I missions. The multiplayer part of this game is a piece of .  Edit: as of June 8 2015 the game no longer works for me. I am trying to reinstall this piece of trash game to see if it will work.  The game now works but still crashes and is PLAGUED with other bugs.   Hilarious list of bugs from the morons at Bohemia Interactive:  -Helicopter spontaneously explodes upon entry.  -Computer terminal for purchasing vehicles sinks beneath the earth thereby making it innaccessible.  -Sniper rifle is able to explode an APC.  -Really  framte rates on multiplayer at all times.  and the list really does go on. It seems this game is the steaming pile of  that they have been trying to create...-10

Arma 3People who mostly are in the military or wanna be military jerk off to this game all the time. You need a decent PC to run this or you will die a lot. I don't know why I was excited to get this when it was coming out. I don't care about the single player at all in this. I wanted it for the 'Hope' for better game play than Arma 2 which has some great things online. Honestly if you like to be with people who mostly do what they want even in teams OR if you actually have friends who play games at all any more then give it a try. If not just watch others on youtube who make money from it and enjoy it that way. I recommend Frankiein1080p.-11
Why is my game crashing so much Why do I only get 20fps no matter what I do Why does none of this game make sense Why are we using 1980-1990's tech in 2035 Why are all the tanks the same Why is everything so boring Why is the MX so  Why is the editor so  Why  Why Whyyyyy  Overall 10/10 would buy 2 copies of again with the hope that my game doesn't crash anymore.;1;0
this game suck;-1;0
Arma 3I just want to say what I must but I'll say it here becouse ing Bohemia Interactive  don't let me write on their forum. This game is a money rip off you buy Arma III game and end up with no multiplayer game why becouse you must buy bunch of dlc crap so you can play on servers or you can't play on 99% of servers or you must download ton of mods that gonna  up your game ending your shity/crapy/ multi with total annalliation. Now after I tryed to mod this  of a game I can't even join to thouse 2 servers where I could before. So it all ends where I brought shity game for 35 euros and they wan't to take another 30-40 euros on dlc and apex .  No way Bohemia Interactive you pice of  go drop dead you hear me never ever again!!!-11
it no work for me;-1;1
Runs like . I want to recommend this but this game has been out for long enough and it still doesn't run well.;-1;1
Arma 3Bad game I do not recommend it so much time and the game looks like Beta enormous memory and cpu leaks with no fix. on the other hand steam does not refund policy is worthless as you need for at least 5 hours to fully test a game.-11
Arma 3Not a simulator its a pseudo-simulator.  It wouldn't be 50% playable if it wasn't for the community based addons.  Bohemia SEMI true sim is sold ONLY to the military.  I'm playing since Flash Point i got a milsim corp since Armed Assault we gave up since we couldn't play due to BIS patches ( that always ended ing up the addons versions ) bugs crashes and glitches.  It has a MASTER PIECE concept of 'Make your own scenario and mission' this is the best concept in a game and what gripped me into the series to be true. I've lost more time making missions than playing then the editor was actually very fun and easy to operate.   However ARMA 3 doesn't even have a proper armor system for the armored vehicles you can shoot them with a .50 to death within a minute physichs will always be below average due to the engine and as a great vehicle enthusiast this is a major fact while driving them ( Very wierd to hear a tank lowering it's sound when it's going uphill when the torque is at maximum so the engine sound should be at the loudest point )   Another major fact is that ARMA is not made for CQB you will never see good CQB fights or even decent urban fights you can even see some semi-urban firefights but you will never experiment a true close quarters firefight simulation in ARMA.  I wish we could have some alternative to it bohemia must chage this engine and make the game MORE realistic or it will lose it's fanbase year after year just as Codemasters with that 'cool' Operation Flash Point DR  And finally. it's 2015 and this ing game can make your 10m away surroundings looks awesome but you can see even the back-bush hidden enemy because of the way that the game process the LODs so the farther the enemy the easier to spot him amd think that his a vampire..-10
Arma 3the campaign in this game is by far one of the absolute worst games i have ever played in my life if not it is THE absolute worst game ever horrible hit detection cheap deaths and terrible weapon sway make the campaign virtualy unplayable. I am a soldier in real life not a reservist a full time reg force soldier and with my experience in the army i can seriously tell you that this game is faaaaaaaaar from being realistic i hate this game i cant beleive i spent 70 bucks on it it worth about 2 dollars in my opinion. dont buy this game you WILL be dissapointed.  LMFAO ive played every mode of this game now and its sooooooo broken its hilariouse i cant beleive this game sells and that people actually play it WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!-11
Arma 3Compared to Arma 2? This game is horrible. Now don't get me wrong I love the hell out of Arma 2 a game which I've put more than 460 hours into. I've played everything from Wasteland Takistan Life Domination to DayZ. But this game...   Cons:  - The bugs. The desyncs. The clunky gameplay. One would think we'd have a smooth game after all these years but no. It's the same clunky mechanics and awful netcode (expect those close combat 'But I just put an ENTIRE clip into that guy and he still killed me before I killed him!')  - The recoil mechanics aren't 'realistic' they are so bad that with many guns you simply empty entire magazines regardless of shot number (single or burts) and you will still miss. Where in Arma 2 at least the first shot will generally hit the guns here are inaccurate as all hell which kills a large portion of the game for me  - The stamina system is even worse it runs out extremely fast and there's barely any indicator besides a faint darkening vignette around the edges of the screen to tell you that you're essentially ed if you meet any adversaries. In Arma 2 you can hear your guy gasp for breath and your crosshairs fly all over the screen if you've tried to pull an Usain Bolt.   - Where in Arma 2 a single bullet can take you out they seem to have appealed to the more mainstream gaming community and implemented some form of 'Oh look Bob I'm a bullet sponge.'    Pros:  - The graphics are amazing. Don't expect a well-oiled game experience to match.  - The intro story is good.   I will still not recommend this game. I've tried to play it and enjoy it but it's a waste of money. But what am I saying? Go listen to those 'crashed car into pole 10/10 would do again' children.-11
Made me appreciate that DayZ isnt actually that bad;-1;1

Arma 3Sorry but this game doesen't seem to be too friendly to new players. I just can't seem to get in to it. And i've tried it all including the milsim servers. I just don't understand the appeal. Most servers are very boring OR way too intense for a new player to feel comfortable. The mechanics are wonderful. But Arma seems like a very closed community. And that's ok. More power to ya I know where I'm not welcome. I'll go play something else. Just wish I could get my $15 back. But hey I tried. It's a beautiful game by the way some of the best graphics I've ever seen.-11
so i want to play online however most need apex so im like ok lets see how much it is but i come to find out it cost a little less than the game its self.If you are looking to play online only get this if you are willing to buy both apex and the games its self and not to mention alot of the severs also need some of the other ones.;-1;0
Arma 3The game barely runs don't bother. GTX680 i7 2600k  EDIT: There have been minor performance enhancements to make this game playable.-10
Game is poorly optimized. Don't buy it. Waste of your money!!!;-1;0
Arma 3I would never recommended this game becouse their trade policy is so aggressive. After releasing a new DLC (Apex) which is more expensive than a whole game they are adding a new content which is everywhere and if you try to use it your game will crash or on the entire screen i can only see some icons of this new purchesable addons. So i cannot see nothing else and it is unplayable. Not everyone has so much money to buy every new DLC. Whitout this you cannot play other mods which are the reason why i bought this game.-10
Arma 3I found this game to be extremely underwhelming. It is extremely short on content with very few factions a small amount of weapons that are re-used over and over for different roles and no variety in the selection of vehicles. The DLC for this game is also worhtless and with a high price tag I wouldn't recommend for anyone to buy it. More weapon attachments? A few new helicopters? ing go-karts? Was Bohemia even trying when they developed this game? The maps are beautiful but the under water areas leave much to be desired as very few objects are even attached to the floor. The screenshots for this game are extremely misleading as it shows factions that aren't even included in the game! Overall it offers very little compared to Arma 2 the only thing it improves on is the graphics. If you want a better Military Simulator than this buy Arma 2. As it stands this game was rushed and WAY under-developed. SInce steam now gives refunds I can't sit in my chair and be upset about losing $59.99 which is always good. I give this a 5/10-10
Arma 3Really boring.. Not engaging very glitchy doesnt feel like a proper FPS game to me. Action is 2/10 due to all the action being from far range online 3/10 dont buy this game not worth paying for. Even Call Of Duty is better...-11
arma 2 is infinitely better than this 'game';-1;0
Great game when it will actually be ready for release.;-1;0
Arma 3It's like Arma 2 but with less content poorly optimised and cash grab DLC (Loadmasters anyone?).  Was hoping it would get better but it's still worse than Arma 2 in almost every way except graphics I think I'll stick to operating in Chernarus and Takistan instead of a Greek Island that has anti-framerate technology.-10
Arma 3 All I can really say is that I've played this game since it's Alpha days partly on an impulse buy and a minor interest into some more hardcore experiences. My time playing this game usually consisted of short gaming sessions maybe an hour or so at most just to sate any cravings I had for what the game offered. Gameplay wise it's alright but can be a little finnicky with the amount of controls there are to learn with what feels like an extremely long time to kill when it comes to taking out infantry men. Performance wise it's pretty badly optimized depending on what server you go on the majority of the servers will tank your fps unless you have a pretty robust rig to deal with it. Community? Well if you've encountered Star Citizen's community then I can guarantee you that the playerbase here seems to worse much worse. I don't know if they have issues in real life or have an unfulfilled social life but the majority of them seem to be awkward and edgy cursing after every word. I don't know maybe this is how they take their frustrations out on the world by pretending to be super cool military personnel? No beef with them I just think they need a chill out and talk to someone about whatever issues are getting them so ansty.    Anyway there's a free game called Project Reality. A stand alone mod using.. Battlefield 2 I believe? I've had better experiences on that game involving convoys through war torn cities with insurgents jumping out from the alleways. And the community is slightly more chilled and the game is free so there's no loss in funds. I'd recommend it over this title if you're looking for an enjoyable experience.-11
 dont buy if u dont want to waste 30€;-1;0
Arma 3Shallow and pretty much devoid of built-in content you'll find yourself playing  public high ping servers or best case scenario maybe Battle Royale. Can't speak on the single player bits as I have no reason to play a multiplayer game alone.-10
Arma 3Gunplay and fighting mechanics were a major turnoff. The speed drills on the firing range are the perfect example of this.  The campaign was really lacking. The end misssion was what the whole of the campaign should have been (or at least much more of it).   Online is hit and miss even with friends. Again the handling mechanics hold this one back but that's Arma I suppose.-10

Arma 3Well am an Arma 2 Veteran i was skeptical on getting the 3rd game of the series and man am I sad to say this game is a blow to the series while there are many new things that do look and feel rather amazing most of the content was cut out by the DEVS due to unknown reasonslack of weaponsvehiclesmaps and general content makes the game feel rushed and unfinished.  I have been there since alpha and yet not much honestly has changed I think the creators let this game slip with intention since little information is given about new content from the community managers and DEVS themselfs making this just another generic OCD/ADD combat shooter.  It may best to say wait 5 years until most of the content will be added by the fanbase and community modders . . .-10
Arma 3I was an arma franchise fan i played Arma 2 and even with it's faults i decided to buy arma 3 while it was in alpha. Initally i was impressed the game looked decent for such a big map and all of the changes were progress in my mind but that was in alpha and there is till was a lot of development to be done or so i thought.  Cut to 8 months after full release and little progress was made. The game still runs terrible when in multiplayer the game has constant lag spikes on nearly any server over 40 ppl in it. The content is still lower than arma 2 content on release and very basic thing are still missing.  Much of the content the game does have is also not impressive the 3 teams basically all of the same small arms and vechiles especially blufor and opfor teams with only small differences. Perhaps the biggest tragedy is that arma 3 doesnt even have simple 'sim' features that many of its competiors have been using for years like weapon resting and delpolying bipods on lmg (ex Red Orchastra 2/RO2 and BF 2 and 3). Then to makes thing even worse and as a big srcrew you to the fans and customers BI decides to simatanously start developing Dayz while Arma 3 is no where near ready certaintly not for $60. If the fans of the franchise are honest with themseleves they will release that BI has simply done a cash grab on the consumer's wallet by launching an Alpha then not developing on it. While simatanously dividing their dev teams to work on the failed Dayz which most likley will have a similar fate of arma 3.  Overall Arma is not an absoulty terrible game i have over 500h+ in but i can not in honesty say its worth over $20 $30 tops the bottom line is the game feels like a BETA now 8 months after release its just unexceptable and goes to show this 'Early access' craze is more lilkey than not a way for unethical companies to profit off of empty promises and slow + lazy development.-10
This game could be so much better if they fixed the ai. Was the same in arma 2 and unfortunately nothing has changed. Stealth is dead enemies will spot you in the dark 200 meters away or from a moving helicopter while your underwater. It is so inconsistant and really kills the immersion when concealment is moot.  Instead of enemies getting smarter on higher difficulties they just get aim bots. Got to the point where even sticking my head out of cover for a split second meant death from a distant machinegun headshot. Thats not more challenging its just cheap.  Best thing about this game is the editor.;-1;0
Arma 3This is the worst optimised game I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only does the frame rate stick around 25 and BELOW but even when I put the graphics on LOW Windowed 1024 x 768 it stays the same. Around 25 FPS. I have a great gaming rig and I just can not enjoy this game. Sometimes I joined a game and it stuck around 10fps. Don't waste your money-10
Arma 3Never played an ARMA game but I really liked BF2 Project reality and Early Tom Clancy FPS games. The pre-order was half of the future retail price and included Alpha and Beta access--so I thought I would give this a try. What I found was a half baked game that was overly reliant on expected croud sourcing assets. The game was bare bones with almost no missions the engine was sub-par controls not thought through and gameplay generally uninspired.   If I'd bought a physical copy I would be selling it right now.  Huge dissapointment. If you aren't already a fan of the franchise you may want to pass or at least wait until it goes on sale for &lt;$10.-10
i love the game but i had to get a new computter and when i downloaded t to the new one it says ' GAME LAUNCH ERROR GAME EXECUTEABLE NOT FOUND. PLEASE RPAIR THE GAME THROUGH THE STEAM CLIENT.' i have done everything i could find and nothing works...this is BS and a wast of my money.....;-1;1
Arma 3DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! For a $60 game this is one of the buggiest games I have ever played. I'm talking about game breaking bugs too. The recent stamina update has completely ruined this game. You walk 2 feet and you're breathing harder than you would after finishing a 5 hour fap session its horrendously stupid. It makes it impossible to aim down sights. DO NOT BUY ARMA 3-11
Arma 3The Singleplayer CAN be fun. The graphics Options are pretty good if you have a bad PC you can edit it very well. But Multiplayer is Very bad i got the game for Multiplayer and its a Disaster i cant even connect and when i join it says: Mission failed... I might be a noob. But i dont recommend the game.-10
Arma 3No i won't recommend this game. I'm sorry but i'm spend more time trying to fix the game to get workshop scenarios to work because steam can't update a game properly and you have to redownload it again. Because every dev update breaks mods compatibilities because mods get corrupted because steam is unstable because mods gets corrupted when the game crash... I barely spend time playing the game too busy trying to get everything to work. What a farce.-10
Arma 3I have only played this a half hour but that half hour it has been horrible. It's nothing like a good shooter in my opinion. I expected this to be like ... better.  This game really had alot of potential to me and i do not recommend it at all. I simply hate this game.  Pros : - Good Graphics - Refunding  Cons : - You can get kicked for no reason - Bad AI - Nearly every server is Epoch (dayz) - Every other server is some weird mods as well  Please do not hate me i just saw so much potential in this game. I'm sad they made this game like it is.-10
Terrible 1st impressions FPS is huge on almost every server if theres ppl its impossible to play because of the fps if the fps is low theres like 3 ppl on the server. Impossible to find a normal sever I get handcuffed for doing nothing and a lot of other boring ... I WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMEND BUYING OR EVEN WASTING YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME;-1;0
Arma 3Problems all around.  Every update creates new BUGS.  Trying to run anything other than the boring Vanilla is problematic at best.  Dev relied on community to build gameplay without instructions then Dev come out with updates to ruin everything that made the game actually enjoyable.  BOTTOM LINE  Potentially an awesome game but Devs keep finding a way to screw you.-11
Its been 3 years and im still waiting for my fps to go above 20 with a titan.;-1;1
game bad from commies to nazis this game does not have you covered sad sad i am sad this game is bad bad this game is bad!;-1;0
Really boring game with bad graphics;-1;0
Arma 3I have almost over 3000 hours on this game and I can tell you this........  The gameplay is great but the game mp sucks  is unplayable with out a 5th gen CPU and 4gb GPU.  Until I can play this game with a 2gb card and a 3rd gen cpu.........    this game I will just play Dayz standalone when a want to play arma :)-10
Arma 3It took them far too long to polish this turd for me to recomend anything BIS is involved with. Yeah the game is ok now that they have finally added the features that should have been there from day dot but I bought a physical copy of the DELUXE EDITION from EB and as such i expected a FINISHED GAME not the Alpha/Beta i was confronted with. It should never have been on shelves 6 months ago let alone when i bought it back in 2013. And you would think DELUXE EDITION implies that at least *some* of the DLC would be included. Nope. Not so'DELUXE' then is it?  Imagine buying a new car and on your way out of the dealership the shady salesman casualy states 'Oh just so you know even though you have a dashboard none of the dials or switches work. But as soon as we get some in we can install them for a nominal fee'. Seems a bit rude dosen't it? paying for something and realizing it dosen't even come close to expectations.   And the excuse 'why not just use mods' is just a sad way of admiting the game isn't finished and/or it isn't any good on its own. And even though i may pick it back up and try again i really don't see myself spending anywhere near the time i had intended to as the experience has left a VERY bitter taste in my mouth.  YEARS Later............  2016 and it's still an unoptimized hot mess with the dubious choice of overpriced pointless DLC like go karts or constant ads to buy said DLC should you pick up or use the wrong item. And now most people would rather role play as 'cops and robbers' (d1ckhe@ds and dealers) than play the game as a mil sim. This isn't arma it's the bloody sims with guns and as fun as that sounds it is not. It's still a big 'nah i'll be right' to this game from me.-10
Arma 3Simple cannot recommend a game that filles your screen with dlc adds if you happen to use something that is part of a dlc you as a user don't own.  I do NOT say that I want it for free I rather it was disabled then having commercials that destroys my gameplay experience.   To simply annoy the consumer until they give you the money to get rid of the adds is something I expect when trying a app on my mobile divices not when I spend 45€ on a high budget game.  Just because they give it for free doesn't mean they get away with it scoot free aspecially when this wasn't part of the product when it launched.  (Sorry for any grammatical errors)-10
Arma 3 DLC the game;-1;1

Arma 3A few months back... Found an excellent wepon dropped from my enemy and 'You cannot use this weapon because its part of a DLC. Please purchase to be able to use it' - What the hell? 59$ on a game and not able to pick up a weapon? Wel.. I guess we can let this one pass...  Today I was joining a server and 'This mission takes part on a non-owned Apex DLC please purchase it to be able to join server.' &gt;&gt; A F*KIN 50$ DLC. &lt;&lt;  This game it's not Pay2win it's pay2play. It would be better to have a wow-similar subscription instead.. if I am to pay 50$ on a regular basis to continue playing the game... (without mentioning all the bugs the poor performance and all that sheet)-10
Arma 3I ran a few different programs to give me a idea of what settings I could run it at and all of them told me ultra. Started it up and tried running it on ultra; couldn't even break 10FPS. I then worked my way down on settings all combos and still didn't break 25-30 FPS. Tried looking up performance tweaks and still no improvement. The game itself could be great but it can't seem to run on some high-end pcs so it was just a clossal waste of $ for me. It seems that 2yrs post-release that Bohemia would have resolved some if not all the performance issues by now....-10
Arma 3UNREFINED AND JERKY -- describes every aspect of this game. Even with the settings turned down the animations are horrible and the guns are garbage - I cant even hit a window on the side of a building. Bohemia needs to take some pointers from other shooters refine the animations fix the guns so they actually can shoot someone and fix the jerky animations and lag so that whopever you shoot at is not ghosting and jerking around like someone having a seaizure. I wouldnt even call this and Alpha build and this game has been out for years -- NO EXCUSES AT THIS POINT. I want my money back this game is garbage.-10
Arma 3High price low fps overall bad game-10
Arma 3Performance sucks gameplay is ok if you can find it overall it sucks. Running simulator at its best.-10
Shot the floor only to have the bullet bounce from the ground and hit my friend in the head This feature is heavily overlooked But beacuse of this we arent friends anymore thanks Arma 3;-1;1
Arma 3Part of the appeal of this game is the realism (i.e. ballistics stamina environment) which positive reviewers rave about. The realism makes this the most exciting and action-packed pc game I've ever played. The majority of the game is sprinting for five seconds to a badly rendered bush or maybe a tree with three sides then having to pause for 30 seconds so that your aim will calm itself. How did the game know I have Parkinson's? You'll unload three clips trying to shoot one contact 100 yards away in an open field and feel ecstatic after staring and shooting at one another for a good minute. It's almost like playing tag with good friends except for the part where someone gets tagged. I did enjoy the sounds of bullets whizzing by and I'm sure the AI experienced the same bliss since we did nothing but lie on the ground and fire seemingly randomly at one another. Ironically when well- hidden behind a tree or rock (or other random cover) and peek around the corner the AI suddenly becomes an expert marksman and kills you with one shot. That'll teach me for trying to be tactical.  Save points are set within the game and waypoints are even more predictable leading to non-frustrating replays and non-existent monotony. There's no real way to be stealthy or use environmental advantages because the AI has Xray and auto-aim so that's a relief. Your squad will most likely make all the kills and leave you in the dust since stamina does not affect them the way it affects you. Also certain characters have infinite health so there's no real urgency in helping with firefights. Time to kick back and let everyone else have fun.  Then there's the weird controls which will have you rolling on the floor (literally) out of cover right into incoming fire. That's the last thing the enemy expects! You'll try to scavenge weapons and ammo from fallen soldiers only to be shot dead while trying to navigate the extremely simple and intuitive equipment interface. I guess that's my fault for not being able to perform 400 actions per minute. As a plus you can steal clothing and make yourself wear glasses or bandanas which have no real tactical advantage besides trolling a fallen soldier.   I forgot to mention that you'll bleed out and die if you don't bandage your arm with a first aid kit after being shot anywhere on your body. That's actually pretty realistic since it's a medical fact that your arm is the hub of all your blood circulation and health. As you're wounded aim and mobility decrease to the point that's so real you won't be able to contribute in any positive way except to be cannon fodder for the enemy. It's ok though when you die you'll get to respawn with full health. But then when you restart the checkpoint you can't fire your gun because there's apparently a glitch in programming (or is it?) which doesn't allow reloading. This is great since the game already saved your progress and you're stuck with one bullet you can't fire anyways. The realism is scary.   I would not recommend this game for $60 or even on sale for $30. I would wait till the price increases to at least $99.99 so that way you'll maximize your regret for spending so much money on a game that's so realistic you could go outside with an airsoft gun and have the exact same experience. Just make sure you're terrible at everything and the illusion will be complete. Sorry not illusion; simulation.-11
Arma 3The game was released with very little content. Except for multiplayer it's not worth it and even that is empty because of the lack of content they release the game with.  Good points would be the graphics if your computer runs it ok. Even very powerful machines will have some issues with it. Community is great modding is highly supported and the modding community is extremely active.  My conclusion would be to wait. Basically the game is in beta. The game WILL be amazing however the state it's in now it's barren. Buy it when it's on sale or in a year or so.-10
Arma 3After playing this for a very long time I have come to the conclusion that the community has completely ruined this game.  This game is great and it has had a lot of attention put to it but the community is unbelievably stupid when it comes to gamemodes. There are only four gamemodes available in multiplayer and they're all flawed up the . ================================================= Gamemode 1: Survival (Zombies and Wasteland)  Zombie modes are boring and Wasteland is extremely boring. ================================================= Gamemode 2: King of the Hill  This is the closest thing you'll get to proper PVP action but the leveling system is beyond awful! Newer players are utterly crushed by higher level players who are all wearing ghillie suits holding high powered sniper rifles and flying around in jets with unlimited missles.  New players are given a starter weapon which is totally useless and you don't get anything good until you reach level 13 which wouldn't be a problem if the leveling didn't take FOREVER! Then you have the massive problem with team stacking because players are given a big XP reward if they win the game so they all stack on one team making it impossible for other teams to win.  Overall King of the Hills leveling and cash system is awful and the best way to beat it is to camp in the cap zone until you reach level 13 but that will take you a good ten hours. ================================================= Gamemode 3: Roleplay  Its just like DarkRP in Garry's Mod except its super laggy to the point where its unplayable and the servers are all ran by teenagers with serious issues because they setup these convoluted Police recruitment systems then they have there police force act like the KGB.  Overall Atlis Roleplay is a waste of time because of lag and an endless stream of trolls who do everything in there power to make the game unplayable. ================================================= Gamemode 4: Battle Royale  I hope you like waiting in spectate or waiting for the server to unlock. ================================================= OVERALL  Community: The community ruined this game with flawed and boring gamemodes. If you're looking for the real Arma experince you have to join a clan but clans are really strict only play at set times and don't like people who are new to the Arma series.   Game: I could go on for hours about the awful bugs UI DLC and price of the DLC but instead I'm going to talk about serious connection problems and the System Requirements.  Connection Problems: Even if you find a server thats in your country and you have a ping of 20 you'll still lag like crazy making the already broken hitboxes even harder to hit.  System Requirements: Thankfully I have a super computer and I can run this game on Ultra settings but this game will go to war with your CPU and Graphics card!  I miss Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead because people used to play cooperative gamemodes like Insurgency...I miss Insurgency....It almost brings a tear to my eye.  EDIT: After searching for countless hours I finally found a co-op Arma mission people play called Annex its pretty good but this game is still NOT worth your money!-11
Arma 3More of an engine than an actual game.  Even if you disregard the absolutely horrid control scheme and terribly unoptimized engine as well as the stiff animations One of the if not The most complicated game ever to start playing.  It's impossible to just pick up and play. You have to download a gorillion mods and other tools that the community considers 'essential'. Once you do get into a game expect 2 hours to fly by where you do nothing but walk around.  Some people swear by the game and have put hundreds even thousands of hours into it. These people have my respect as they have put aside enough time to allow the academic research that this game requires before it becomes fun. I just can't set aside that time.  -10
Arma 3This game is on the opposite side of most of the games that are simply too afraid to make things too hard. I normally don't like these types of games because they seem to create their own version of reality that makes the game even less realistic. For instance: Enemy troops who have just been established as being too dumb to find their  on a map of their own homeland are now able to hit you without scopes in heavy cover at 300 meters. In contrast a veteran marine gets tired from walking up a gentle slope for two minutes. However the single player is meant to train you for multiplayer and it succeeds in doing this. Or you would think.  The multiplayer allows for plenty of roles so if you are new you can always stick to support. Unfortunately the FPS is going to be around 25 on standard gfx. I also get this feeling that 80% of the people have NO CLUE what is going on. This is usually a sign of scattered game design.  Optimization is kinda bad depite being almost indistinguishable from a game from 2006 with a ton of AA modded in but how else are you going to move those newly rebranded Nvidia cards off the shelves every year?  The keyboard bindings are a tragic mess. Double right clicking to use the iron sites? Five different buttons to use all the menus and submenus? Various key combinations to draw a LINE ON A MAP?? Using a layout standard that does not resemble anything ANY OTHER WELL KNOWN GAME uses? It does not help that there seems to be a .75 second delay to all commands.  This is the Crusader Kings II of FPSs except where Crusader Kings is ed because of random events that cause your King/Duke/Whatever to grow a nipple out of his forehead totally trashed mechanics that allow for an army of 14 archers to defeat your army of 1240 because it was raining and they felt kind of down and AI that seems to really hate you especially for no clear reason other than that they want to capture you and cut out your eyes and testicles ARMA III has controls that make no sense and optimization that makes Company of Heroes 2 look like it could run on a TI-83 calculator.   Buy for the (extremely short) single player on sale. The idea is novel but not so much the implementation.  I feel sorry for those poor designers who got arrested by the Greek Armed forces during this game's production. Not worth it.-10
Arma 3Review date: 21.06.2014  This game would be great but without its horrible body armor system or how you wanna call it. In short as you see in this video at 11:06  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mal2CMf_PjE  You take 5x56 mm rifle point it at the soldiers chest and it takes 5 hits to kill him when he is wearing bulletproof vest. If wearing stronger vest it takes 11 hits. Yeah you read it right. And there is even more!  When you are trying to kill AI controlled soldier situation usually looks like this: You approach your enemy from back take your rifle shoot him once in second he turns to you you try to shoot him for a second time he gives you instant headshot and kills you. After a while of playing you will start to feel like your weapons cant kill anyone and that you are absolutely harmless to your enemy. And shooting from greater distance? Its just saying hi to them.-10
Arma 3A broken unfinished mess made by some hilariously incompetent developers. Runs like  on any machine and will never get any better thanks to the brain dead decision to stick with a decades old engine and 32 bit code. Despite arma being positioned as a simulator it is nothing of the sort it is just as much of an arcade shooter as Battlefield of CoD with the only saving grace being a greater freedom of gameplay variety and depth.  Despite all this Arma 3 is still the most worthwile game to have been released on PC for the past five years and even if it is still effectively in a beta state I can't help but waste more and more time on it.  Any sane person will stay the  away and find something more useful to do with their time.-10
It's a great game and I love it and you can put so many hours into it. But what makes me not want to play it is that the game runs so poorly on MP. How am I suppose to enjoy a realistic shooter if i'm getting like 20 frames? I get it buy a new cpu but im not spending 600 dollars to just play one game i'm sorry until they fix this then I can't give it a postive review. Please fix this it will be wonderful;-1;1
Arma 3Filled with unfixable crashes regarding memory error I have around 8 gigs of ram and a OP GPU so this shouldn't be a ing problem but it is. Absolutely unplayable theres no fix for this memory error as it stands right now. I've been trying three days to get this working (-Malloc=system Delete files Verifing game cache reinstalling etc) and none of them worked at all. Games is buggy beyond belief and the few times I did join a server the community was absolute cancer. Avoid.-11
Arma 3this game runs a over 10 years old engine back from OFP days and still no 64bit proper multi-threading &amp; proper multi-core support. this means your FPS is  no matter what specs you have. if you tell that to the fanboys in the official BI forum they will claim that you play multiplayer bad scripted servers even if you write in huge letters that you play SP. anyway here a list of why i do NOT recommend this game:  - all of its features are not properly added like physx etc. - no ponds/rivers/inland water and that for a game which was release in 2013 but in arma 2 ponds were supported ?! - very bad performance in SP aswell as in MP. - Low CPU usage some parts of the engine are very outdated like the CPU usage. This Game runs mostly on one Core. - Its a sandbox game but its more limited than most people know for example: this game can not run huge battles with many AI. this game is more made for small spec ops missions or zombie survival missions where you are alone as survivor fighting zombie AI. one of the reason for that is that the CPU usage of this engine is ****. so its a very limited sandbox game which does not let you make things what you want only if you accept huge FPS problems. - the engine itself is very limited in many terms: modeling is very limited some modder who made buildings for arma 3 abadoned theyr project due to the limitations. same for terrain in terms of object placement and size and and and.. - NO proper multi-core / multi-threading and 64bit support and that in 2013 and for a large scale game like this multi-core / multi-threading &amp; 64bit is a MUST! - Alot of problems with the AI  now to the devs why they are one of the worstest out there: - the devs are only fixing minor bugs and making small optimizations but giving the game a great FPS boost by adding proper multi-core / multi-threading support does not happen. - the devs didnt fixed many AI problems and now the guy who works on VCOM AI fixed the AI driving which was not fixed by any BI dev for 13 years! i cant believe that a modder has to fix what BI didnt fixed in such long time. - BI dont care when people steal and selling mods and i will explain why in the community part:  why the arma community is one of the worstest: - people start to steal mods and selling as theyr own for money. especially after arma 3 life when arma 3 life got away with it and BI took no action. now more and more people start to steal mods or models from other games and sell them. last time a french life mod was found that they stole models from other arma 3 modders and sold them same for a mission which can be found at the BI forum and that all after they saw BI took no action against arma 3 life. - alot of fanboys are out there who cant accept critism against BI or arma 3. alot of community members cant deal with it when you speak about the problems of arma 3 (especially when it comes to the CPU problem). most members in the forum are buttsniffer who has theyr head in bohemias ***.   oh and the moderators in the BI forum are stupid cunts. There is a offtopic section where they discuss about religions politics etc and when you write there your own political view which oppose the western politics for example you dislike the NATO or if you believe that the ukraine uprising was planned from outside and that EU support nazis or if you dislike syrian 'rebels' then they give you a warn or they ban you immediatly. so you have two choices: write only good things about U.S government &amp; NATO organization (and never criticize them) or you are silent if you oppose them (otherwise you will face infractions and/or a ban)-11
Arma 3I have been playing this since Alpha and have vouched never to play it again. Here's why:  Pros:  Some of the best graphics I've ever seen.  Overall physics vastly improved over Arma 2 (especially the vehicle physics).  The land vehicles can finally reach speeds past 60 mph (100kph).  The ability to mix and match clothing/uniforms and what not.  Now here come the cons:  EXTREMELY poor optimization. People with Titans STILL get less than 30fps on this game. And to top it off I get more frames on ULTRA (30) than I do on LOW (25). My PC is pretty good I'd say 4GB GTX 670 Overclocked i7-3770k 32GB RAM I mean come on....The optimization is beyond horrid on this game.  Bland and unfinished maps: While the maps are graphically amazing and have SOME finished areas overall however the maps feel very bland and unfinished. Fly over one in an aerial vehicle and you'll see what I mean.  Stamina: Run five feet and you're character is gasping for air as if he was nearly suffocated to death. This also screws up your aim severely and will probably get you killed (it has got me killed countless times).  The DEVELOPER: Bohemia Interactive really just doesn't care. The game is overpriced and lacks severly in content (I'll get to this later in the review). They rushed this game out and look what happened. Aside from that you can be globally banned (rendering you unable to play online thus rendering the game useless) for no reason and they will NOT help you. There is no way to contact them and BattlEye (the anticheat program) will refuse to accept any excuse for your global ban and blame it on you entirely. They're basically saying that their anticheat is perfect and doesn't screw up. If you get banned than you ed up. If you try emailing them they will NEVER and I mean NEVER get back to you. This whole developer/anticheat service and GAME is basically a HUGE SCAM.  Poor gunplay: There is windage on the bullets in the game but no way to measure wind speed or direction.  STILL no bipods. (I mean COME ON this is a mil sim).  All 7 guns in the game feel the same and are very bland.   You still cant freaking jump over a fence.  This game somehow manages to be more clunky than its predecessor.  The recoil on the weapons is overexaggerated.  The game modes: This game carries over the game modes of its predecessor except they poorly executed in Arma 3. The game modes feel lacking and are no longer fun like they were in Arma 2. This has much to do with the large lack of content.   And that leads us to my main problem with the game: LACK OF CONTENT:  Since day one there has been little content in this game. There's not many guns in the game and most of them are just basically variants of each other. Same story for the vehicles and just about everything else in the game. I mean for s sake they released a GO KART DLC for this game. A GO KART DLC for a ing military simulator. The go karts are in the game you just can't get in them if you don't have the DLC. ing jews.  Overall I'd say buy this game's predecessor Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead. I have countless hours on that game and let me tell you Arma 3 was a big let down. Arma 2/Arrowhead has a vastly large amount of content the gameplay is better and less clunky and just about everything else is better. Don't get me wrong I really wanted to like Arma 3 but I can't. I just cant.  Do not buy this game.  Stay away at all costs.-11
This game is f***ing aids. Its HIV positive if you have an AMD system. 8350 @ 4.6GHz and a r9 280 OC and I get 15 FPS on LOW F***ING SETTINGS.   RIP in Intel HD 3000 graphics :-(;-1;1
bad optimization;-1;1
Arma 3Bruh Optimize the ing game more! You need a ing nasa computer to play this .-11
Arma 3INSTANT BUYER'S REMORSE  I want to like this game. I really do. I've watched soooo many Frankie youtube videos of various Arma2/3/DayZ antics and I thought to myself 'boy despite the billion graphical glitches there seem to be present and the staggering amount of complete aholes in servers and the really really clunky looking UI/inventory system.... this looks like it could be fun!'  Team based objectives mods that have huge open world survival based gameplay vehicles realistic (seemingly) weaponry military tactics....at a glance looks like a pretty decent game  So free weekend 50% off... 30 bucks for a game that has singleplayer AND multiplayer? infinite modding possibilities?  SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY SIR!  4.2 hourrs on my record I would say AT LEAST HALF was spend alt-tabbed googling various 'how do I do this' or 'arma 3 tutorial' since the in-game help/instructions/interface - is . I don't know if it is because I've never played any ARMA installment or I'm mentally  or the game is simply an unintuitive cobbled together sack of confusing and unhelpful  but either way prepare for a heavy learning curve. Some enjoy this aspect some people PREFER a game with 400 keybinds to take advantage of their expensive gaming keyboards and mice.... I am not one of them. It's a first/3rd person shooter with sim aspects - there should be no need for you to be a contortionist or have a 2nd monitor with a keybind list up at all times. Honestly a lot of the keybinds are whacky and frustratingly unintuitive. I get it new things take time to learn. Like learning a new language. Like piloting a jet. Like learning how to script. For me playing a game and learning the controls should be remotely similar to any of these things. I do not want to dedicated 20+ hours just to be able to navigate gameplay. It's not a MMO. Hell I HAVE PLAYED MMOS WITH LESS BINDS. Not only that but for the life of me I could not get my extra mouse buttons to perform the way I wanted them to. Arma3 is the only game I've ever played where that has been the case.   Get ready to spend hours scouring the web for 'FPS ISSUES' or 'FPS TWEAK GUIDES' for a game that really isn't incredibly impressive graphically. All the same it will make you wonder what your $700 video card and top notch processor 16 gigs ram SSD HD etc are ING DOING. You'll notice if you have monitors up on your PC that they aren't being taxed all that much (20%?) yet performance is still AWFUL. Guides will have you downloading CPU parking/unparking software entering a billion command line switches sacrificing goats to the Bohemian pagan gods but alas very little you do will change the fact that this game is optimized like a bag of bloody . Don't bother searching through forums 95% of people that don't recognize there is in fact a massive persistent issue with FPS in this game (so maybe 20 people on all the internet) will just ridicule your computer or setup and tell you to 'get a guhd computer I get 60 fps must be a problem with your setup    !!!!!' etc.  The campaign is horrendous. The AI is bad. Like mind blowingly bad. Your teammates will just charge in and either kill everything in sight while you're playing 'realistically' (taking your time scouting moving from cover to cover etc) or they will charge in and get annihilated. Either way prepare to be a spectator for a lot of the action simply because your character is bound by the 'realism' parameters that both friendly and enemy AI is NOT.   Examples of this include the enemy have clairvoyant abilities to spot you behind that tree rock building etc and the SECOND you pop your melon out for a little lookie-loo boom headshot. From 300+M. From an enemy who ISNT EVEN RENDERED. Oh okay I thought I was fighting human beings not Terminators with cloaking shields. Woops.  The enemy AI will have astonishing accuracy. Unbelievable and certainly not realistic accuracy. Accuracy that you simply cannot pray to match if you have been moving at all in the last few minutes before you raise your gun. Try drinking 10-15 beers then playing that stupid game we did as kids where you get a baseball bat and put your forehead to the pommel and jam it into the ground and spin around and around and around for a minute. Then pick up an assault rifle and try to aim at something 10 M away let alone 300M away. (I'm not American so as kids we didn't have the assault rifles but the baseball bat spinny thing WAS a thing its not just the 15 beers talking) This is what its like to try to aim down at an enemy after running 15 feet. For a game striving for realism.... yeah. This amazing and ultra realisitic military sim mechanic only affects you in case you were wondering.   Besides the game breaking AI and mechanics and horrid control system and clunky AI and awful on screen instructions - the campaign itself is a lot of 'ho-hum lets traverse the country side for 15 mins listening to horrid voice acting (to be fair its not AS bad as what some people are saying but its still not good and considering its the only god damn thing to take your mind off HOW BAD THIS GAME IS PERFORMING ON YOUR GAMING RIG it just grates on your nerves). Literally a mission starts and they have you run from one in game cut sceen to another with zero action in between with a few fadeouts and 15 minutes of walking... is this deliberate to bore you to  death so that when action takes place you don't notice HOW  the AI acts? Perhaps so. Prepare to traverse the same stretch of not so pretty landscape over and over as the save system is another baffling part of Bohemia's design. I understand not allowing you to save whenever you damn well please (wait..no I don't) but making me listen to same uninspired boring and inane voice acting while running up the same god forsaken hill for 3 minutes over and over and over because the AI consists of super soldiers who can no scope you .5 seconds after a full out sprint to prone is just infuriating after a while.  Even during firefights I did not get an overwhelming sense of 'holy shieeeeet war is scurry man this is so realistic only supreme tactics and skill and will have me come out on top in this conflict.' It was more like why the fk am I druken soldier with asthma who can't run 5M and raise his weapon without swaying so bad it's amazing he's even still standing upright? More often than not you find yourself letting your AI teammates do everything while you cower in a bush hoping you might get to shoot 1 or 2 enemy soldiers OR you allow your teammates to cannon fodder themselves and you mop up while the enemy is busy annihilating them. Either way you barely feel engrossed in the action and never really feel like a main player in the game.  Don't even get me started on the UAV mission.   To be fair this is the single player part of the game.   I have yet to really delve into multiplayer - I'm afraid to. People state (numerous times I might add) that single player FPS is fine but MULTIPLAYER is where it REALLY goes downhill. Oh goodie.   When the game is made so inaccessible it makes it real difficult to start it up again let alone try playing with other people and getting into the lovely world of Arma Community friendliness.  Better make another run to the beer store.  Even if you're not a drinker spend $30 on booze. You will get way more entertainment out of it. Hell if you're really not a drinker give the booze to a bunch of teenagers or your little brother or something. You will be better off for it trust me.-11
Barely a decent game to say the least  -NUMEROUS rediculous animations that will get you killed while exiting/entering anything -Dont try to hide because players only see grass a few feet infront of them -A small shrub blew up my tank -Walk 10 miles just to get shot by a 5 star general of an ai -Not very fluid combat  Just stick to arma2;-1;0
So why is this still $59.99 USD? Stop being money hungry Bohemia Interactive please..;-1;1
this games is really messed up and honesly if you are new to the game you have no idea what your are doing. once you find out the game becomes boring and long.  this game is onloy alive because of mods which also are a pain to install..  dont waste your time.  steam support &lt; request refund&lt; thx gaben got my money back for this crap;-1;1
The best 30 FPS simulator I have ever played. Game is so good that user mods are better than the actual game. My personal favorite part about this game is the desync where you see people in tanks flying across the map raining down shells across the map.;-1;1
The worse Arma ever - cannot connect and play co-op with a friend. Always get a response on game invite 'Server is not responding.' when trying to connect and play with a friend. They are just ripping off people by taking so much money for the poor quality. That's so devastating and sad. Do not spend your money on this game. Buy something which works instead.;-1;1
Arma 3NOT an AMD friendly engine!!   I have played this game since it first showed up on early access. I also had an Intel setup most of the time (2600 3770K and 4770K). It ran flawless with those CPU's (average FPS of about 70-80). I had to make a downgrade a few months back and i went to a 6800K from AMD. Using the same GFX card the CPU has become UNUSABLE for this game. Average FPS of about 17 and even lower in bigger towns. I know im not the only one and i do know that this engine LOVES hyper threading. But you would think by now it would have some sort of optimization of the AMD side of things.-10
Are you kidding me? I spend so much time trying to keep up with the AI's that I'm always so fatigued when we come into contact that I cant shoot? Half the time I cant even see them. Its either that or never get into a fire fight and spend the whole time running around a forest listening to panting sounds! Its utterly ridiculous. There's some great features and I would really like to play the game but at this point I'm so frustrated that I'm over it.;-1;0
Arma 3Bad performance it has.. Great graphics it does. Recommend I do not.-11
Arma 3I have now been playing ARMA3 for a few weeks or months (Time flies when you're having fun) and it is one of my favourite purchases on Steam. I had ARAM2 and AO (then modded Dayz) so i figured Why the hell not.  For the past 5-10 years i have been more so a fan of multi-player gaming over single-player thought i thought to myself i will try this one single first mainly due to the fact i wanted to know how smooth it ran. Graphics up pretty much full played it and had an average framerate more than 30FPS so all is good. I have a little play of single player and start to pick it up. Game looks great. Few Km of open sandbox.Can't complain.  I try joining a server. Stratis Wasteland. 70 players smaller map then the main one. (19.3km or something i think). Spawn in and streight away i head some explosions and firing. Luckily enough on my first go online i managed to take out the two guys firing and loot a vehicle. Nice rifle and a nightstalker scope. I just sat in a bush my sights scimming around and taking out the odd players 1 by 1. Night time comes Change scope to thermals. Beautiful. Hiding up a hill sat in a bush with a thermal scope and another 2 clips if ammo to use. I felt how sadistic i had become. Beautiful.  This was just wasteland mode. However there are many other modes. Altis RP i would say is the most populated. A role play island where a player will need to gain licenses buy weapons vehicles. Basically it's what GTA online would be like. I reccomend picking up some scenarios from the workshop such as Whole lotta altis and whole lotta stratis. as we as some of the mission generators.  If you're amazing at CoD. Don't expect to be amazing at this. This is a real game and does require a lot of skill and thought. No running in expecting to kill 30 in a row.10
Arma 3I can barely go into any server and event then i get kicked from the very start without doing nothing. Host your own vanilla servers bohemia! That game is unplayable!-10
Buggy and not even worth the discounted price. I wish I could get a refund.;-1;0
Arma 3Didn't even launch multiplayer once and I am banned. Battleye - The Anticheat Gold Standard-10
Arma 3The game has the weirdest control setup. Just a small thing like chosing which sight to use requires you to press or double tap a modifier key then the aim key in a special order. Why not just do it like every other game that uses guns? It's also horribly optimized. I can play Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline with 120+ fps but this game struggles to get over 50 fps in the cities with all settings on low/off. And running it on those settings makes it about as pretty as Quake 2 from 1997. I don't understand the hype about this game. Seems the exact same game as Americas Army that I played 8-10 years ago and with low settings it pretty much also looks the same. Avoid unless you really know that you want it for some odd reason.-10
Arma 3you know the funny thing is This game is becoming a money horder. Apex is 34 Dollars. Orignal game is 40 Dollars. Apex isent half of the game... Yet it is more than half of the price. *Facepalm* Dont reccomend buying this OR Apex till a sale...-10
Arma 3 is an awesome game! Players are young self serving short fused millenials but its still A must buy! but dont speak your mind on chat or you will be phantomly banned by men with no boezack to tell you there thoughts b4 doing so. there will be 5000000000000 servers but only 3 to join since latency sucks and everyone is a sheeple and plays some life role play mod garbage. i have 25mb a sec consistant download speeds and run it on minimal settings so internet and graphics is not the issue. so be wary of the bans is all i can say since there is no forgive policy on any server that i know. Dont be as mad as i am right now when ur banned for not installing some garbage communication software the admins want you to download from 3rd party insecure site! or for not lining up with the rest of the tools with no life on 1 of you 3 possible servers your able to play the vannilla game in! Happy Gaming :);-1;1
Arma 3Ok so I got this game for the free weekend been interested a while and was in the mood to buy it if I liked it as a few of my friends have it.  Visually very nice. Except the frame rate. I am familiar with computers so I tweaked a little and gained a few frames but still 17-21. Poor. I find the gameplay a bit clunky for a FPS it almost feels like Space Engineers :/ There is very little visual information and rather a lot of buttons to remember. Ok no problem. Ill work it out? Still cant work out how to jump (if its even possible).  Constantly plagued by slow loading times and awkward playstyle (this is just on the Prologue missions) im really not impressed. Driving. What the actual F* is going on there? Ok so WASD is accel/steer. But you need to press a button for free look press a button to go faster or slower...while the mouse does nothing. I have a controller thought 'this must be better' but its set up for left handers by default? I couldnt find where to change it either. Left stick to Accel/brake? Right stick to steer? For crying out loud.   I finished the prologue and tried to play...but play what? Navigation for starting a free server so I could just get used to the game is awful dont even know how I ended up in some empty world with 'Zeus' and NOTHING! Nothing. A gun grenades but no objective waypoint map reference vehicle or even building nearby. Just a frustrating experience overall.   Not even considering buying this game even for the reduced price. It is advertised to be able to run on my Rig although it is just above the reccomended specs so i didnt expect 60+fps all the time but barely 20 is frankly unplayable considering that is Idle listening to the prologue instructions.   AMD Phenom II x4 955 BE @ 3.8Ghz GTX 560 Ti 1GB OCII 8GB RAM Dont laugh I get 60 on high on GTAV 60 on ultra on Elder scrolls space and medieval engineers Truck Sim Stranded Deep...hell even ARK: Survival Evolved plays better. That is a very low standard to be compared with let alone be worse than.   For those about to tell me to tweak my this and that...I already have my computer tweaked to the absolute pinnacle of optimisation AFAIK and im not too keen on having to write parts of the game myself unless im going to be getting royalties? Or maybe just a hefty discount. This isnt even Early Access but boy it feels like it.   Will I play it again? Maybe I might give it another whirl before the free weekend passes but as I said before I am not likely to be buying this unfinished under optimised terribly interfaced game. Looks fun but its not worth buying in this state. It wasnt even worth the 2 hours it took to download at this point.  Sorry Bohemia but poor show. Anything with a 3 after its name should be better optimised at the very least.-11
Arma 3Paintball simulator  I make shooting in real life and I can tell you this game is not realistic at all. The accuracy of guns here is so ridiculous it is like paintball. Seems like devs have not understand that the first bullet of a gun is always accurate but it's the next (when it get heat and make expansion of the metal) that become less and less accurate the more you continue the burst of gun fire. The breathing control is also totally wtf. In real life the longer you stop your breathing the more your aim is moving (because your muscle get less oxygen and start to shiver). In the game this is totally the reverse of reality the more you stop your breathing the less your aim move... Well ok let's just say the character you control is kind of robotic stuff different as a human.   Then there is the sound. Did some one just threw gravel ? Nop this is some body who've just shoot in your direction with a fire rifle :o The last crazy thing is bullets are so slow you can see them!!! Ahahah made my day!!! But this will not restrain me to unsinstall the game. The driving of engine is pretty realistic I've to admit. Angry military screaming on you is also.-11
Arma 3&gt;Buy game &gt;Play Altis Life RPG &gt;Buy Car &gt;Buy Gun &gt;Park at the front of the PD' &gt;Oink rapidly &gt;Get chased &gt;Pull over &gt;Get tased &gt;Picking up soap for 5-10mins  I play most the game modes the modding on this game is great. If you have good interwebs buy this game.11
Banned from battleye for no reason DONT BUY THIS GAME U GONNA WASTE YOUR MONEY;-1;1
Arma 3Need a pretty damn good computer to run and there is alot of mods that take a on of time to download. Plus steam will not let you get a refund this is ing stupid. Wasted $60 on a game that runs like . Dont get this game its not worth it.-11
Can't run on Intel HD 4600 with i7 4 cores haswell at all with 8gb.;-1;1
Arma 3Likes: scale graphics visual realism detail immersion Dislikes: poorly optimized tacky script and cliche dialogue awkward soldier controls price for a two year old game  -11
ing  terribly unoptimised like 20 fps with gtx970;-1;1
Arma 3It's a great game. It looks beautiful.   But I can't use a sniper rifle unless I pay another 12 dollars.  Helicopters? 12 dollars.  Apex? 35 more dollars there.   I like the game but I wanted to be a sniper and I hate being nickled and dimed.  If you got the money and don't mind that get it.   I however mind.    -11
Arma 3Despite the great eye for detail the animated character and the beautiful landscape this game definately does not earn a 'thumbs up'. The main reason for this is because the game is full of crashes. This evening is as one of the many others where I wanted to join arma but I couldn't all I did was just scavenge the weirdest websites in order to find ways to get around the crashes that I stumble upon while joining servers. I am at the point of thinking Bohemia doesn't even care about how well arma 3 runs anymore: even on high-end game pc's fps never reaches higher than 50 in cities it keeps on crashing and there is a lot of other weird stuff such as sudden deaths due to rocks in-game or hostile stairs while walking over them.  I love to play the game but the game just won't let me. -1-11
Arma 3It's not been easy to come to a final solution whether this review should be positive or negative.  First of all I'd like to say that the game itself is really awesome. You get the real feel of combat with a good amount of realism and so on.  Pros: - Catchy gameplay - Tons of different gamemodes (Community servers ect.) - Improving your skills takes time but you learn as the time flies by. - Really fun with others  Cons: Well with all the pros being said there's only one thing that makes me downvote this game. The DLCs. Yep there are DLCs and there are many of them. With only the base game I often find myself unable to use half the helicopters since I need the DLC for that and the DLC for that. 3/4 of the weapons in the game are also DLC. You can however still use them but your screen gets overlayed with notifications that you're using premium content. Call me cheap but as a person with a fairly big collection of games on Steam I feel like the DLCs for this game are too expensive.-11
Arma 3APEX DLC BROKE THE GAME....  BASICLY YOU BETTER BUY WHAT DLC COMES OUT OR YOUR GAME BREAKS  DAYZ ISNT WORTH IT DON'T DO IT!!-11
This game is crap similar to the steam refund support!;-1;1
Arma 3The game is absolute garbage. I thought it would be fun I guess not. Stick with Arma 2: Operation Arrow Head if you want better experience!-11
Arma 3They did some cool things in this game dont get me wrong. (2000+ hours ARMA 2)  The MASSIVE ISSUE that I have with this game is they have put in DLC (go figure more band wagon devs). But its not so much that they are charging an outrageous price for the DLC its the fact that they water mark your screen to the point that its not fun to play. As if that didnt get their point across before you can quit the game your in you are forced to look at an advertisement for their DLCs that you cant skip and will be unable to leave your game until its finished.  Very very poor model for doing business and I will never buy another game from this company.  The mods make this game what it actually is. Which are developed for FREE from the community.-11
Arma 3cant recommend this game. you'd think bohemia would of learnt from arma 2 but its still just as buggy poorly optimized and probs wont get fixed. they will just release an arma 4.    game is great dont get me wrong. but the game is ruined by the completely poor performance!-11
Arma 3Don't buy this piece of .   The campaign is still bugged years after the game got out. Too many bugs and just annoying little things to be bothered playing it through. There is still a bug in place that prevents you from entering a boat and thus advancing with the campaign. The NPCs are often slow and hinder your progress. I found myself waiting for 15 minutes just for the idiots to catch up with me. I've restarted missions at least 5 times because some events just wouldn't trigger making me stuck.  The optimization is a joke. It's laggy as . Especially in multiplayer where changing your settings doesn't mean jack  because the server bottlenecks the fps (??!!).  You're basically forced to buy the DLCs. Most of the servers have DLC guns which you can't use unless you buy the said DLC which makes the game kinda pay to win. Being forced to buy DLCs when you've already paid the full price is a ing disgrace.  you Bohemia-11
Arma 3You can go through an entire firefight use all your ammo and not once see the enemy   -11/10 would desync again11
Arma 3buggy annoying and laggy  srry but its to much :/-11
Have that Steam Error 81 and something with Q:00000... I can launch the game but not when I click on play. It pops up a error. Help? anyone? Maby refund next?;-1;1
runs as well as a dead kid in a wheelchair;-1;1
Arma 3Perfect for people looking forward to achieving high fps counters. If you were happy about the performance of Windows 98 this game will blow your mind (or your cpu).-11
Arma 3 Arma 3 should you buy it?  I bought Arma 3 when it was still in alpha even then it was obviously superior to it's predecessor in critical areas. As of now Arma 3 has passed both Alpha and beta stages and is still being actively refined and rewarded with new content of witch some is free.  As opposed to Arma 2 this game has a noticeable lack of content such as weapons and vehicles but this is something that will change drastically with time be it with DLC from BI or free add-ons created by the community.  The things that have improved from A2 are most noticeably the animations -you no longer move as if you had a refrigerator on your head- as-well as physics and graphics.   -Animation improvements  The movement finally feels similar to other FPS shooters in terms of responsiveness and smoothness but is taken to a new level of control and options with the addition on new stances. Previously in A2 the only stance options available to the players were stand crouch and prone In A3 these stances have been expanded upon.  You can now Lean left and right in 2 different ways in all 3 base stances you can also adjust you height in 6 (or 7) increments. You can also throw items without having to pause for half a minute finally.   -Physics improvements  The addition of improved vehicle driving mechanics and rag-dolls (no more awkward death animations) as-well as some recently added particle effects by Nvidia's PhysX. (Although I am not 100% certain that those come from the base game as opposed to a certain add-on)   -Graphics improvements  A completely new lighting system superior in every way to the one in A2 (no more spotlights or mounted suns through mountains). There have also been some basic texture quality improvements but those are quite minor in comparison.   -Things to come  As of now A3 doesn't have bullet physics comparable to what ACE brought to A2 by default (some add-ons but each varies from another). The basic bullet drop penetration and ricochet are already in but wind is not yet a factor I believe that this will chance with the addition of the 'Marksman DLC' that has already been promised. The same applies to proper flight mechanics the long awaited mechanics from Take on helicopters will come with the addition of another DLC In the future you can expect allot more high quality weapons vehicles and islands by both BI and the community.   -Things to consider  Even though A3 is already fully released it does lack some content that should have been there already this being the Marksman DLC and improved flight mechanics. Minor bugs appear regularly fazing trough walls and stairs is still present to a degree.  Optimization in multi-player needs more work having more than ~200 AI in a server will drop anyone's FPS to near 20 regardless of their HW completely (Your CPU and GPU usage will drop accordingly the game will simply not use the resources if the server is making it wait). I don't know of any server powerful enough to counter this. You need to learn how to utilize add-ons if you want to have the best experience (not a massive learning curve just know what you are dragging and where). Still a bit of a work in progress if you want everything right now in on DL you may be disappointed. Some aspects require you to learn them in time flying requires practice editing require practice and memorization and Zeus requires you to be strategic spamming T-100's is not a key to success.   Conclusion  This is not just a simple arcade FPS it is a game that requires more than twitch reflexes and marksman accuracy. Those will get you somewhere but you will most likely not like the place you end up in.  Teamwork strategy and tactics play a large role. Finding a group to play with has been a key to certain success across the entire ARMA series you wont get much from playing alone.  If you are here from DayZ and want something similar or want to be the anti-armor CQC sniper warrior in a jet you may have a hard time finding servers that will tolerate your existence they exist but not everywhere.   TLDR: Buy this game 10
If you like to DIE play this game......;-1;1
Arma 3Oh so you are soldier ready for some action ? Avid sniper ready to take souls of your enemies from kilometer away ? Helicopter pilot inbound to support your troops ? Nope you have to buy DLC for that an overpriced one.   Bloody Bohemia you own best milsim franchise out there one of the most popular survival games and you are telling me I need to support you with these DLCs which are just basic content ripped of game. Don't take the path of Ubisoft or EA you can do better. I think 45€ is more than enough for full content of game.  Game 10/10 DLCs ripoff 0/10  Get your margeting together.-11
hmmm where to begin ... (not gonna mention altis after this as 90% of that game is scrolling menu with no animations not even at FB levels ... and the are many other survival games that are just flat out better i could put my time into.)  pros. the feeling of the guns and shooting is incredible the mod community is amazing  sounds are really good map is huge  cons. movment feels sloppy sometimes no jump (not even able to atempt unless on a modded server) textures are par for the course  deal breakers. extreme fps drops  poorly optimized ... very poorly 65$ for a game that alot of the time feels like pre alpha CRASH ALL THE TIME !!!!!!!!  i have come back to this game over and over and each time i just dont wanna epoch is really the semi good mod it just feels super empty as the buildins are mostly literally empty. it's crashes sooooo much it's embarassing the dev's just left this game in such a poor state the should be ashamed ... i just can't justify recommending spending 65$ for a game i might spend 20$ on ... people rant a ravve about how good arma 3 is but i personally just don't see it when i have other games that just do everything better ... save your money.;-1;1
worst optimised game ever. fun with friends sometimes but my god;-1;0
Arma 3[UPDATE]  Arma 3 is a great military sandbox game that consists of: •Campaign •User-made scenarios •Multiplayer •MANY different game modes •DLCs that aren't too pricy (DLC buyers get items while at the same time supporting the development of arma 3 ____________________________________________________________ Arma 3 in my opinion is a very realistic military simulator. You have a lot of weapons to choose from and a lot of attachments. There are: •5 pistols •3 Sub-machine guns •10 different types of assault rifles •3 Designated marksman rifles •2 sniper rifles •3 LMGs  That's not it though! Leave it to the developers to make even more guns coming up in the marksman DLC.  Vehicles consist of: •AFV-4 Gorgon •AMV-7 Marshal •Ifrit •Hatchback •HEMTT •Hunter •MSE-3 Marid •Strider •SUV •Tempest •Truck •Quadbike •UGV Stomper •Zamak •Go kart [Was added in as a joke but people wanted it in the game as DLC content!] •2S9 Sochor •BTR-K Kamysh •CRV-6e Bobcat •FV-720 Mora •IFV-6a Cheetah •AH-9 Pawnee •AH-99 Blackfoot •CH-49 Mohawk •MH-9 Hummingbird •PO-30 Orca •UH-80 Ghost Hawk •Mi-48 Kajman •A-143 Buzzard •A-164 Wipeout •To-199 Neophron •Speedboat •Swimmer delivery vehicle [Submarine] •Assault boat  Think that's a long list? That's a lot but not all! Each of the vehicles have their own unique features. ____________________________________________ I bought Arma 3 during the alpha stage when it wasn't too great however Arma 3 has improved so much and the developers have made a lot of tweaks/fixes.10
Arma 3 Not fun how buggy the game still is =(   The game wants to be realistic but in reality there are no bugs. Some bugs which still exist: - falling out of a tower because of switching the view and then die - seeing enemys through walls - when you go crouched through doors you get stuck every time - if you are robbing and some obstacles are blocking you the character is sometimes standing up  - one time i wantet to climb over a rock but then i was inside the rock. I could see out of it and shoot but people didn't see me and the bullets didn't go out of the rock i had to respawn   Not fun seeing Bohemia forcing us to buy DLC =(   - i want to loot someone i killed can't take weapon because DLC needed - i want to play without add everytime i see a DLC vehicle weapon... DLC advertisement is popping up - Bohemia selling a season pass (including all dlc) and now you have to buy 'Apex' extra   The game is still fun to play but it could be greater. I wouldn't recommend buying it for the normal price. Wait for sale or buy a cheap key. In my opinion the bugs are existing since ARMA 1 ARMA 2 and now still persist in ARMA 3. If only were the Bugs i would give a thumbs up. But the DLC politcs of Bohemia are really not fair!  -11
Arma 33.5/10   If you are a passive and slow in playing game this is the right game for you. It is too slow and has SOO MANY GLITCHES YOU HAVE NO IDEA!! I will give it credit becase it is like skyrim free roaming type but the controls are too much and in general it sucks i would recomend no getting thi sgame and not wasting your 60 bucks keeps it for something better. Please don't buy this game.-10
I couldn't get fps to playable level in multiplayer and I have new 1000e desktop pc. Fps below 20 with low settings wtf?;-1;0
Arma 3Disappointing on several levels. Essentially you're paying $60+ for an engine that mods run off. The mods that currently exist are pretty underwhelming and aren't made by the studio. They have universally low production value and there are only a couple that are played. The insulting part is the engine isnt even good. It's pretty slow no matter what settings it's on and this is with pretty decent hardware. Maybe if you can get this game on super sale it would be worth it but the amount of content in this game in NO way justifies the price-10
Arma 3To start off this game is AMAZING. There is so much you can do in this game. I would call it basicly Garry's Mod with its own engine amazing graphics and a even better gameplay experience. There is multiple ways you can play this game. One being its singleplay (Its 'okay' not the best very good to learn the basics). Two mission gamemodes these can range from being 'Wasteland' to 'Altis Life' which are all fun and you can put tons of hours into them. And lastely Mods the PC community is known to make mods for popular games you can play mods like 'Epoch' or 'Breaking Point' which are mods that are made to be like DayZ. Then there is the popular mod 'A3L' which has brought a lot of attention to mods and arma 3 it self. Sometimes at night with the light setting on Ultra it was the best looking lights that I have ever seen in video games EVER. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate this game 9/10.10
Arma 3fantastic game...but fowck the people in the game bunch of fowkin d1ckheads-10
Arma 3Great Single player FPS isn't too good even with good computer Needs patch badly. Multiplayer isn't good as the FPS drops 1-20 FPS not good at all Needs patch asap since it has been out for a long time I guess they don't want to fix it at all..   Making packs without patching the FPS problem is a problem.  Other than this is good graphics and good game.  Will not recommend till they fix the FPS problem seems like a waste of money..-10
Arma 3Hands down the best military simulator I've played to date. Player content is a bit rough to get working and large explosions on one side of the map can make a whole server lag out but for a community editable game platform it more than beats out almost every shooter I can think of.   If they could make player created content ratable and downloadable after they check it over to make sure it does not crash the whole thing it would be just about perfect. An additional service i would pay 10-15 US dollars a month to have up and running.10
If you want a realistic multiplayer shooter Arma 3 might be a good game but the campaign is complete  the story is average the allied AI is complete  and makes some missions close to impossible cause they love to run strange ways into the enemy line of fire and they dont know how doors or stairs work the AI regularly drives over you or your troop members if you are not really really carefull I have never seen such a bad AI;-1;0
No tutorial and no easy way to figure out how to play this game. A case of trying to make a simulator but not realizing it still needs to be a fun game. Not fun at all.;-1;0
Arma 3I bough this game and was thinking how cool it was gonna be by watching videos. Sadly the game nees to have a a buffy computer to have great experience and you need to download/pay for a ton of stuff to be able to play on most servers because it seems like vanilla servers are dead. I don't konw.. On the search system I tried to find TDM DM CPTF but couldn't find any and if I browsed for one I would need to pay for the apex dlc :/ Honestly this might be just me who doesn't quite have enough experience to know how this game works and stuff you can do :P I'll update this if I feel like this might be a good game after all. I have to say that if you like realistic military games then this is the perfect one it has almost everything that you would have in the army! Hopefully for my future playings I might be able to enjoy it as my wish was to since the start.-10
Do people REALLY accept the price of that DLC??? I can't accept that price not what so ever until I'm provided more than enough reason to.  Love the game though. Bugs suck so much but meh whats given is pretty awesome.;-1;0
Arma 3Ambitious but still ugly to the core just like the last Arma. Feels like you're in the world's greatest terrain sandbox but playing with G.I Joe figures instead of any realistically resembled soldiers.-10
Arma 3Over 1000 hours in arma 3 and 2000ish in arma 2 This games performance ruins all gameplay mechanics no matter how amazing they are. while somedays fps is at 40-60 others (Now) 3-15 quite frankly its pathetic if i could refund it i would HOWEVER lets say u have a solid 60FPS ALLL the time then this game is 100% ing amazing and i love it when its like that the pure nature of the game is unlike all other militarys u will ever find and even though the performance sucks and makes this amazing game unplayable for the few times ive had where i go a full day on 60FPS they have been the best gaming days of my LIFE. In conclusion if u can run this game at 30FPS and beyond 100000000)% get itif you cannot get CSGO :P10
Arma 3Well after a short time in this game i could instantly see that it's rubbish tho i gave it a couple of minutes of more testing and while it was enjoyable.. i can't find a single reason to give this game even one more minute of my time.-10
This sucks balls compared to A2.;-1;0
I regret buying this game. It reminds me of the sensation you get after stepping in wet puppy  while walking to the bathroom in the morning.;-1;0
Arma 3First i want to start off with the graphics... AMAZING!!! Next it is a fun game many many many game modes to play. I think there is some gamemodes that seem nerdy like RPG but give it a try it is fun. This game with the graphics it is hard to run but you can also optimize it a bit and when i mean a bit you can increase the fps 10-15 with easy steps. Sum it up GET IT!!10
Arma 3Pros:  Better Graphics Better Controls Better Sound  Cons:  Same laggy multiplayer as Arma 2 Same terrible interaction system Still using outdated Arma 2 mod tools (All mods are just ports) Most vehicles and weapons are the same between factions just different textures Still uses 2004 Netcode Its trying to be more casual  As of right now I do not feel as if this game is worth the $60 it still plays like it's in Alpha. Unless they release proper mod tools I would not buy until it drops atleast 50% in price.-10
Does not contain traces of nuts.   0/10;-1;0
yes i red rconnend it but its not working on my computer it was a waste of money;-1;0
This game was so fun until this new Apex DLC came out and completely ruined the game and play style and the new UI is cancer. I just wanted to play it i opened it then realized it has the Apex DLC and i slowly moved my cursor over to the X in the top right and clicked... RIP Arma 3;-1;0
its gay you idiot why make a game which is gay;-1;0
Arma 3I will not be recommending this game to my gaming group for two reasons:  1. The interface is not intuitive. During the tutorial I was unable to find and install a scope onto my rifle. The tutorial could not go on even though I had a scope mounted on my weapon.  2. The designers chose to have the characters use unprofessional language.-10
Arma 3Just dont buy it......it needs a NASA pc to play (no 30fps is not playable in this game....dev why u do this??? then you can have 35fps in solo but 4 fps in multiplayer!!!??? again why? (while in multi we have lesser players/aircraft e.t.c.) most servers are rpg's....almost no coop server. its VERY HARD to find real strategy/realism/gameplay here.....the vids you see on youtube do happens but its very rare....dont buy it. Arma 3 is maybe the worst game i have ever bought after shogun 2..... and i really wanted to buy it....-10
Arma 3Take me back to the better days or Arma 2. :(  The mods were better the movement was better the controls were better the optimisation was better there was even less hacking.  Not sure if I'm bias because I've had such a crappy time with Arma 3 and such a great time with Arma 2 but I would honestly recommend Arma 2 over Arma 3 in a heartbeat.-10
Bad game. Horrible game engine. System requirements for what? Nope company. Few models. Multiplayer always glitches. Waste of money.;-1;0
Terribly optimized and leaves you wondering what the difference is between this and Arma 2. The entire arma series needs an overhaul. The only keeping these games alive are player made mods. Wish Novalogic still made games.;-1;0
Arma 3If you like buggy  that doesn't work this is the game for you. Thank you Bohemia for another glorious crapfest.-10
Back In Highschool I ran Track. This one kid...lets call him 'Ray' was overweight and very slow. Near the end of my highschool experience he got stronger and thinner...but at the end of the day he was still slow..Way to slow he just ran slow...he wasn't ment to run.  This game has little content. FPS problems will occur on most high populated servers...sometimes regardless of hardware. Not worth 60 bones.;-1;0
Arma 3the game is very fun to play with if you have a team or a squad of friends to play with HOWEVER this game is not worth (what it currently is) to buy. You still got the bugs like walking down steps and dying dying from walking into a door getting launched by rocks. The AI is still pretty  compared to arma 2. Plus the damage system is ING HORRIBLE. The fact that you have to PAY to get marksman stuff is disgusting. Is bohemia turning into the next EA? Probably. Altough its a leap from arma 2 in graphics Arma 2 was actually better IMO.   Basically it still has the same game breaking glitches that should have been fixed a long time ago. AI is still . Damage system is . And the only things that they did right this time seems to be the ZEUS addition and the graphics.   TLDR: Bugs suck p2w sucks too much focus on graphics zeus is probably the best thing-10
Arma 3Would be nice if not every server uses the new dlc map. I've spent money on the game but it's not worth it since I keep getting kicked off of every server I try to join 'cause it uses dlc. And €30- for dlc is a bit much. just €5- from the game itself. But don't worry. once you've found a server that you can join It's extremely fun....if you can speak german 'cause that's what 99% of the servers are.-10
I ING CANT BE A COP BECAUSE IM NOT ING WHITE LISTED AND I CANT BUY A CAR;-1;0
this game is good and all.. but its complete garbage. first of all its fun..... when it actually works... i bought the game for 40 bucks. had fun... but now i cant even ing connect to stupid piece of  server without the game ing about how its stopped working. if it worked 10/10. but its so  i have to give it a 0/10;-1;0
Arma 3Gameplay is perfect the idea is perfect. But expect low fps ( even on high end pc's ) Some times my gpu load drops below 20% this happens on low to ultra settings. My friends have the same problem. It happens in the city;s. Not in the open. Looks like this game can't be fixed cause the problem ik the engine were the game is build on. The only fix is a entire new engine. Like they are going to do with dayz standalone. I get 75 fps average but drops which are like in the 20's  If you can live with fps drops to 25 buy it. The gameplay is the best part of arma 3. The sound is below average. Not the quality but direction of the sound is coming from-10
Arma 3When I launch it it just comes up with the thing with Parameters and the other three options HOW DO I GET INTO A MISSION OR MULTIPLAYER!!!!-10
Game performance is far too horrible to even play this game past the introduction. You want to look at all the benchmarks online before you decide to buy this.;-1;0
Arma 3Arma 3 is a really great game. I loved Arma 2 and I love this game too. It's really awsome and fun to play the graphics just look amazing the gameplay mechanics are better then in Arma 2 ( a lot better ). I don't like the DLC thing that they are doing I mean Arma 3 got so much less weapons and vehicles then Arma 2 + expansions and the idea of charging us 10-20€ for simple dlc like marksmen or helicopters that should be part of the main game ( beacuse there ain't much weapons in the game atleast compared to Arma 2 ) I understand that you want to make money but atleast make the DLC 3-10€ MAX! It's just not worth spending 13€ on a simple dlc that adds few guns and a full ghillie or few new helicopters or if you are going to make expensive DLC's make them atleast bring much new content with them.  ~Ratings~ - Gameplay: 9/10 - Graphics: 10/10 - Story: 7/10 - Multiplayer ( best part ): 9.5/10 - Price: 6/10 ( beacuse of the expensive dlc but if i had to rate the price of the game without the annoying dlc: 8/10 )  ~~My overall rating is~~ 8.5/10... why?  - The game is worth buying but as I said above it has expensive DLC with not much content in it and it makes it hard to play the game without it ( mostly if you play mp you won't be able to acces the new weapons / vehicles and you are kinda in a disadvantage ).  - Sorry for my english it's not perfect but I'm doing my best :) -10
Arma 3Very little content. Cant be compared to Arma 2 when it comes to the amount of maps vehicles and weapons that came with the original game. But of course you can spend like $100 on all the DLCs if thats your thing.-10
hint 'BIS sucks donkey balls';;-1;0
10 -10 Full paced action packed real good graphics military simulation deffinatly would recommed for people to play  :);1;0
Arma 3Not worth $60 constantly bombarded me with DLC notifications modifying is extremely unorganized. A super fun and well made game besides my complaints. I recommend only buying if you like multiplayer and if it was cheaper than $60.-10
Crap..the gun shots and movment sux ... cost too much for how the game plays..;-1;0
Arma 3I was under the impression that by preordering and purchasing the Alpha The DLC would be free as stated in the initial sale.   How dare!-10
Arma 3Arma 3 is basically arma 2 engine tiny bit improved here and there but suffers from the same problems as arma 2.  - game runs like crap - user interface is as clunky as in arma 2 - charachter movement is still horrendus like in arma 2. When you change your gun your charachter stops and stands still so you can get shot easily. If you want to climb over a fence charachter stops. When you change stance charachter stops. Etc... - servers are really bad. For some reason they can't run for more than few hours. Common connectifity issues etc etc.  If you liked Arma 2 despite It's issues you will be satisfied with Arma 3. If your hopping for better experience you won't really get it. Arma 3 is mosty content upgrade over arma 2.-10
Arma 3game is fun but to many bugs/hackers glitching trough walls and floors people shooting you trough walls i mean do they even test games before they publish?-10
Arma 3At first I realized that my gaming PC could not run Armo 3. I spent years becoming a doctorate graduate in theoretical physics to have access to a supercomputer. The supercomputer was able to achieve an astonoshing -1 fps something I didn't think was possible. As a result it divided by zero and the universe collapsed.  6.9/10 would play again.11
Arma 3I purchased the Delux Edition expecting the DLC to be included.. Well its NOT inluded OK fine its 2 helicopters and the carts suck i can live without them..  BUT !!!!! WHY THE HELL do i have to see adds for the DLC while I am in game...????????? The ADD's are big massive translucent helmets tilled across my game screen with a large popup window in the centre of my screen that appear every 5 odd min and you cant get rid of em unless you select L/+P..    -11
Arma 3poorly optimised piece of  game pretty good gameplay if you can get past the 10fps tho.-10
Arma 3If you played BF1942 you've played this.-11
I found solitaire more fun  1. scopes dont zoom propely 2. multiplayer games are boring and have no point to them.. If you enjoy running around empty land gettin randomly shot by nothing and getting kicked out for no reason its great 3. No way to communicate with others in multiplayer and single player would be better if controls worked  Jus glad i did the free weekend and not wasted 30 bucks like i was going to;-1;0
Arma 3Was a fantastic game at one point. It has been ruined hard by power creep. Bohemia made the weapons in each DLC pack more and more powerful to basically force people into buying them and we are to the point where laser accurate AK-12 7.62x39 rifles can one hit kill people through MRAP armoured windows.  A pile of garbage at this point.   Oh and by the way did you enjoy being able to hide behind things like walls and smoke? Well then congratulations you cant anymore. They changed the way the renderer works so things fade in and out when they're supposed to be drawn or when LODs change. This has had the side effect of making it so that you can see through walls. This isnt even a thing you have to exploit just being near something else (ie the window that you are shooting out of) can glitch out the renderer and make walls no longer draw which means you can see enemies (who do not fade in and out).  Its something you personally can avoid but all the guys shooting you through buildings with AMRs wont.  Wonderful...-10
Arma 3Dont buy this trash game Looks good on streams looks and sounds fun as F! but the game is trash! FPS chop all servers in games with 1-24 players i got like 100fps + all max settings games with 70-100 people i got like 20-40 fps chopping also the game lags alot the mic chat is GODAWFUL annoying! people in global chat with there mics lagging bad due to severs. The game is worth 10-20$ tops until they fix the problem they never fixed in arma 2 or never will fix cuz they suck at scam money from people. Worst game of the year No joke10
I love this game a lot. it's sad to see that it's poorly unoptimized. DLC is pretty much mandatory;-1;0
Arma 3Can't open the game but the launcher. If I want to start the game there is:  Application Load Error Q:0000065432. Already verified Game Cache Reinstalled tried everything but no changes. If anyone got a solution pls contact me on my profile.-10
Still runs like a big pile of poopydoodoo. Single player campaign is not finished. Feels like a beta but it is the 'official release'.;-1;0
Arma 3Greedy DLC The game is 'still in Beta'. The funnest thing to do by far is KOTH online but good luck getting in a server randomly the server broswer will flip out and report 0 servers. At which time the only solution is to completely restart the game. Every time hearing that STUPID theme when it starts up DUH DUH DUNNN DUH! Server broswer reports 0 servers restart.... DUH DUH DUNNN DUH! 15 bucks for a couple of rifles and diffrent color guillie suits &lt;.&lt; helicopter pack 15 bucks still in Beta my . Money Grab Poorly optimized  6/10 DUH DUH DUNNN DUH! ....... 5/10-10
Arma 3Lemme tell you what i think about arma 3.   ARMA 3 is a fantastic military sim game. The physics are great the graphics are awesome and everything about it i enjoy especially the addons. It's a great improvement and i don't know why dayz isn't running on this amazing engine. The zoombies mod that i enjoyed is gone now thanks to bohemia and dayz. I hope you guys rot in hell.  What i hate about this game comes from a deep part of my soul and also a very external part of me too. The amount of dip and try hards and ing posers i come across rattle me bones like no other. Going into a server with 'Spec ops' as your slot to choose to be makes me want to shoot my brains out. The moment i went into these servers felt all i heard was 'SPEC OPS READY FOR PICK UP' 'THIS IS SPEC OPS GOING INTO FIRE' 'THIS IS SPEC OPS SUCKING  FOR CRACK MONEY' that last one was a joke but you can see my anger in this. So i ask in the chat bar that doesn't have a scroll up option for some ing reason 'are you guys in the military or have any of you served' and with a gust of wind that screams oh  here we go it came 'no we have never served luckily we have this game' my wtf face was not big enough to show how i felt. These  heads have no idea what it's like to be in combat i don't know yet my self but i plan on knowing very soon nor military tactics nor anything of particular military from anyone not just these 'spec op' dumbasses.   anyway i get out of this server cause at this point i am growing a giant vein on my temple because i am holding back my self tearing these guys a new one. 'Alright' i tell my self as i decide to browse through servers. 'ah this one must be great seal team 8' OKAY seriously i get that you're a ing  and don't want to actually serve but naming your ing server seal team # doesn't make you look cool. It pisses people off. I go into this server and ask if any served or serving. Noopee seriously. what the  do you think you're doing? what part of being in a seal team do you ing know besides call of duty or some stupid ?   okay well there's alot of that. let me get to my closing statement.  arma 3 is fun i love the game graphics are nice but the mulitplayer is so un-optimized it drives me insane. Having a nice pc and trying to enjoy games but without devs optimizing their games or using 64bit gaming EVEN THOUGH THE GAME YOU RELEASED IS A PRETTY HEFTY GAME TO PLAY baffles me. The physics engine is great physx engine it's called from nvidia it's some cool  too bad it doesn't look cool at 20fps and i am trying to drive but go right into a ing rock. physics are working though that some good . anyway. also the game feels stripped like there's nothing compared to arma 2 regarding weapons and vehicles.   I would not recommend this game if you have ever served/serving in the Military or you want something casual. If you have served or serving you will want to gut everyone. There's no point in playing a game where no one knows what they are doing and pretends to be some badass that they will never be except maybe online but the pre pubescent or going through puberty voice doesn't sound like you want to follow them. The amount of posers and wanna be's ruin this game for me. oh and especially the '15th MEU' oh pretends to be a real marine MEU. LIke seriously these guys think they are Marines. Their website says how much of they follow Marines. they even pretend to have medals and shadow boxes. what the  is this .   As someone working his  off to join a special group of people i can no longer play this game without getting rage. singleplayer is fun though. i like the single player. mods are nice and i really can't say much else. I would and wouldn't recommend this game. It's up to you.-10
Arma 3Arma 3? More like Ar-this  is not fun. I played Arma 2 a fair bit and it was 'fun' but this game just didn't peak any of my interests.  the people who forced me to buy this -ma 3-11
Arma 3I loved this game and had a great time with it playing with my friends (king of the hill) untill my account and all progress was wiped when i merly looked at my in game profile. I lost a level 25 character with a katiba MX 338 MG Cyrus Four Five pistol MK 14 and i had optics on all of them. From what i have found there is no fix for this so i guess im just not gona play anymore.   Cheers Bohemia-11
I would reccommend this game to anyone who wants to play arma life or wasteland however if you want to play for the millitary simulator aspect of the game i wouldnt recommend it you will find the majority of the servers are arma life wastland and epoch ect. there are a few servers and if you want to play for the realism i would recommend invade and annex as you work together as a team to accoplish objectives against the AI. also it is pay to win there is content in the game which you can not use in multiplayer matches such as sniper rifles and helicopters without purchasing the DLC i understand they need to make money however i beleive they should develop the game to make more maps and encourage people to buy the game as there is only two maps in the game (without spending £25 on the expansion and getting one map and some extra content) and the terrian is quite simular. also infantry is more obsolete due to most vecheials having thermal vision and being able to spot infantry much easier however if you want to play life ect. i would recommend however from my point of view this game is a waste of money (i have also brought the marksmen DLC at first to invest in the company to hope they might bring out some more maps and more content however my funding has gone towards APEX which i would have to buy for £25) remember this is not a rant this is just to help people decide on the purchase on this game.;-1;0
Arma 3The framerate is an utter disaster. I couldn't even get through the training missions and that was after I'd aplied every documented optimization trick.-11
Arma 3this game is slowly dying along with its servers very hard to get into and just not worth the price  refunded-11
The Sims of fps-me A good concept ruined by dlc that should been in the game since launch or free.;-1;0
Arma 3I want to like this but I just can't. The controls aren't nearly intuitive enough especially switching through the aiming modes which seem to only work half the time with no explanation? The campain starts by putting red squares around the enemy then without explanation completely drops this behavior leaving you to have to visually locate and identify the enemy that are camo'ed and prone all around you all while they can spot you from miles away and snipe you to death without you even knowing where they were. I gave up after the guy I was following was blown up and have no desire to return to this mess of a game. Maybe the mods/multiplayer are better but the campain start is such utter crap I can't even bring myself to keep this installed.-11
Arma 3This game is a HUGE improvement over ARMA 2 in terms of the engine and its looks graphically. The game works much better than the second installment of the series and is much easier to use. But the game's setting has completely ruined it for me I really dont appreciate what bohemia did moving the setting to 2034/2035. I really loved the setting of 1990-early 2000s ARMA 2 provided and i dont feel that ARMA 3 provides a very immersive feel (For me anyways) I'm sure there are mods to change the game for the more cold war 'feel'. But i havnt found many that are what i want.-11
this game needs work on some of its finer functions such as difficulty aiming and lag time as well as sensitivity.;-1;0
Arma 3Don't buy this game unless you're willing to pay more money for a game you already payed for.  The game has the est marketing system I have ever seen you have to pay $70 just to get it and an extra $20 to be able to use half the guns in the game you would have thought its original hefty price tag would have been enough.  Other than that it's a good game.-10
Arma 3The last of the 'Arma''s series...  What to say? A great 'technical' game a really poor overall display.  Not fun: buggy AI dull mission difficult controlling of vehicles not so many vehicles not so many good (and bug free) mod...  It's Arma 2 with some improvments and better graphic...  Really disappointing.-10

Arma 3dlc that should be free or 1/5 the price I used to love this game but the price of dlc and the size of what you get back to the drawing board you ruin this game by taking to long to release new content and over charge for it I'll buy another 4 pack of terraria at least their content updates are free and don't get kicked from every second match because you refuse to pay for over priced extra content-10
Arma 3this game has constant DLC in order to play Bohemia Interactive is becoming like EA. I could play with certain mods and now this Apex DLC came out I cannot use certain mods without buying the DLC. Please dont support Bohemia Interactive as they just strive for money and not customer satisfaction-10
Graphics are pretty shocking and the tutorial is very simplistic but when you begin the first mission there is little help regarding what to do. As a soldier you're left to your own devices and to complete goals solo. Yet some of the goals aren't clear.  Not sure if it's just my old PC but if you're running windows 7 you may have a rough time as I found myself constantly lagging which heightened my annoyance.   I personally would not recomend this game to anyone and I can 100% guarantee I will not be buying the full version of this game.;-1;1
Arma 3This game is hands down the best shooter ever made. It is a very immersive game that has features that make it feel like real life. You get injured and if you heal you will walk slower carry too much and you won't be able to move realistic stamina etc. The amount of weapons and vehicles is nice but nowhere near the competitors. Yet those few weapons have the most realistic damage and ballistics of any game I've played.  Now after seeing that you are probably asking why I didn't suggest this game to others. Well the game has a lot of cool features and is very promising in all the different ways you can play. But the game is unplayable at times and is very unreliable. In single player a $2000 dollar computer will run at 40-50 fps on all maxed out video settings. (That being one of the major faults of the game itself; a game shouldn't require two to three thousand dollars for a computer to run single player at subpar frame rates.) That same single player also has one of the worst AI systems in a game. If you're in the line of fire prone with your group of guys they will shoot you to get to the enemy. This happens more often than you would think and it’s such a problem your squad mates will often kill each other. The enemy AI is far superior in combat and you will find yourself leaving your AI squad behind so you can actually accomplish missions because they tend to get the attention of the enemy AI which seems to target you first no matter what. The enemy AI can see you through bushes 800m away crawling through the 3ft tall grass. So if you want a stealth shooter go somewhere else. In fact if you want a better AI and squad experience go buy the original Ghost Recon because it had a better AI and squad system than this game.   WHO CARES ABOUT SINGLE PLAYER JOHN!   Ok then so you give up on the single player and you go to multiplayer expecting a similar experience without having to worry about the AI. You'll start up a moderate sized 40 man server that has a ping of 30 when you join that is about full and your system will bog down to 10-15 fps. You go around a corner checking for enemies in a town and you won't be able to move your gun fast enough and you'll get owned over and over. If you try to be in a vehicle with a person who has a junk computer good luck seeing anything.  All in all great features on a horrible performance platform and to make up for it you need a server for a computer. -11
AI is still ;-1;0
Arma 3Arma 3 is a big fail.Not in Alpha state but definitely not completed. Game changes from update to updatealso addons stop working with new version.You might say it's normal because new version has fixed the bugs.Wrong again.New version go on conflict with addons that worked very well from day 1as for bugs...stil not solvedvery often fps drops and connection issues between client and server. Gameplay...LAME...for 2015 Arma 2 was a big hit. Arma 3 is another version on Arma 2 with 'new' tweaks. Annoying DLC screen while flying in vehicles from DLC.-11

Arma 3Bad controls buggy as hell. You get to 'step over' objects which is stupid because half the time it glitches out and ing kills you. Why is there no jumping? The physics suck you run into a car from behind as it's going 70 mph and you're going 80 and you ing explode and die in a fire but if you run into a wall at 40 mph you're fine just a scratch. I like the vehicles and I like how I can swim and shoot the editor is really fun and a lot of other things. I can't imagine how I have over a 130 hours in this game.-10
Dont buy apex. Tanoa is way too big and widespread. Not worth the money;-1;1
Arma 3Where to start............ CONS   the engine is total  !!!!.  multiplayer server perfomance is poor the ammount of content isnt much at all (needs MORE WEAPONS) no shotgun............WTF no support for ballstics and wind ASSLOADS of bugs. some that are gamebreaking little to no support for errors most of all (steam ticket check fail) WTF IS THAT??? its been in the game since alpha why hasnt it been fixed. why does this game continue to crash randomly???   PROS..........  the community mods (better than BI could make IMO) VERY VERY VERY slow improvements flexability     if you are considering this game PLEASE think it through it can be fun but there are MANY problems.  i wish i could get a refund honestly-10
Arma 3Coming from someone that played A1 and A2 when they came out away before it Dayz Mod.  Arma 3 is a big ing cluster crap. There are some improvemnts on the gameplay but the problem in the game is the engine. I have a high-end PC i can't play it with more than 30 FPS ( singleplayer i can max 50 fps without any AI spawned) with the last updates i am now unable to enter any multiplayer server. I have search for solutions everywhere and nothing. The game is more like a bug that you have to deal with if you want to have fun a bug that was present in the other Armas but not as bad.  Don't buy this game unless its really really cheap the DEVS don't care about the game as a long long long time fan of the series this is certanly the last Arma or product i will buy from this company.-11
Arma 3BE CAREFUL YOU ARE PAYING FOR A BETA GAME!  this  has release in 2013 and is bugged as  crashers glitches all the  you meet at Arma 2 this game does not seems to be finished and the devs aren't really trying to  the content of this is laughable is lower than Arma 2 with that half futuristic   mods and the comunity are the only thing that save this franchise other wise it will be dead quick mod are not flawless the are very buggy more than the main game but still wort to get  so if you will buy for the vanilla GET OFF this is not a good game but if you want to play with mods you can give it a try i recommend you to buy on a steam sale to not be too painful for your pocket.-10
Arma 3Well the game seams to run. Other than a few dozen deaths from exiting exiting boats in water or crouching on a rocks. FPS with Dual Titans is a slow as 20FPS at times. With updates come the new waves of hackers (literally scipt kiddies here) there are as may cheaters as legitimate players on the best servers.   Sadly the hackers seam to stay while the honest players sick of team killers and friendly looters get Battle Eye banned accros the board by Kids somehow running Official servers. Yes you buy the game connect to a server have bad blood and some joe shmo can ban you accross the board on all Arma games while whitelisting themselves. Any of the unchecked self appointed Admins can literally shut down your game permanantly. The is no control Bohemia is ok with this happening to you as they already made their money and expect you to rebuy the game each time this happens.   There are tools if you get sick of playing on the smaller map Stratis Atlis is a big map with towns and forests but only Role PLaying Servers run that map? So back to the Tools there are Arma 3 Tools to build maps but it doesn't work even after 60+ hours put in the editors still throw constant erors and crash befor booting.   This is by far the Best 'Alpha Release' I have ever played but is also a game that in a mere week has become a bore with broken editors and a 'Single' Multiplayer Map. Blah.  It should be called ARMA GUN STORE SIMULATOR as the majourity time in game your not even fighting your just running for hours to a gun store but are being artillery spammed to death 30 times before you can even get a gun.  FPS where the game is designed to facilitate farming.-10
Arma 3Not recommended even for people who like a good military simulation game.  Good: - Lots of potential for realism and immersion - Massive variety of ways to interact with game elements  Bad: - Lack of variety in terms of gear (three colours don't make three different items) - Lack of any real weapons: it's all near-future stuff - Gunshots sound too mechanical or like movie sound effects - Weapon animations are loose: effects don't sync up right (two gunshots when you shoot three bullets etc.) - Vehicles are very difficult to control without dedicated joystick/wheel  VERY Bad: - Needlessly complicated control scheme which will take hours on hours to get used to (literally) - To say the learning curve is steep implies that there is a learning curve - Many functions of the game are hidden unexplained unintuitive or poorly implemented - Potential for realism is destroyed when each mission becomes a sprint between ambushes  There are several different tutorials - some in the 'virtual reality' some on the islands some as text-only and none of which are adequate. Each tutorial is about ten-thirty seconds long and involves no actual help assuming that because you pressed the right buttons once you now know how to do it in combat. The team seems to have put zero effort into making the game intuitive: you will spend much of your time looking up various controls and reading about methods of interaction.  This game is not finished. If you're looking for a good intuitive fun military simulator to get away from the Call of Duty bullcrap pick up Operation Flashpoint: Red River. It might not be as extensive and it suffers from a lack of replayability but it isn't nearly as frustrating as Arma.-10
Arma 3Awesome and pretty realistic game.  If you have an AMD setup do NOT buy this game ! If you have a 800$ pc do NOT buy this game because even on lowest settings you can't get more than 30fps other than the first 10 minuts of game then it drops half way down.  If you are ok with games that run at 20 fps then you will be happy with arma 3.. since it sometimes run at 25fps.  The amount of desync is insane so if you have the battlefield 4 getting killed gehind walls don't buy this game because it's even worse literally . The huge FPS drops when there is an explosion is insane and the sound crackling and making you drop to 5 fps is constant.  The amount of times where you empty a mag on an enemy that just turns around and 1 shot you is prety common.  If you have +1000$ build a intel setup with nvidia gpu and buy this game. Then buy a streaming pc if you want to stream. well if you have +1800$ actually and not 1000$  If you have +1000$ build a amd setup with ati gpu and DO NOT buy this game. Then buy any other game and play with +60 fps on ultra while streaming.  The graphics and the resources this game demands makes no sense at all. Arma 2 looks as good if not better. Oh yeah there's ragdoll in arma 3 woohoo. No seriously. Do NOT buy this game constant DLC that you have to pay for optimization updates followed by lower performance... unless you have intel/nvidia setup.  This game is based on x87... the most  thing to do. 3 years of dev and yeah... you get the picture.  Just deleted the game myself will never reinstall will never recommend it and will never buy a game from Bohemia interactive in my life and will beat my kids uo if they buy one! JK or am i?   game is at 50$ on steam and then you can spend 50$ on DLC (probably 50$ more when future DLC will be released) and 1400$ on a PC just to play this game. Isnt that just great?!  Oh if you have some spare money after all this feel free to donate some to me so i can play a game that i bought 2 years ago when i had the same performance (~25fps) on my old dual core pc with gts 260 that i have on my 8350 with r9 270x setup.-11
Even someone with a tricked out PC can't play this smoothly. Otherwise it would be awesome.;-1;0
Arma 3This is a waste of money. You'd think it would be good but it isn't. It has all the pieces of a good game but lacks emotion even for a sandbox.-10
The most boring game ever!;-1;0

I like the hardcore nature of it but it is just inaccessable. You wait ages for something to happen and when it does you are often killed quickly and have to start alll over. Arma 3 I want to like you!!;-1;1
Arma 3Possibly the worst game created so far even compared to really  indie titles. This game was never optimized for a computer from the look of things. If you run intel anything you'll be fine but god forbid that you run AMD you'll get 0-20 fps no matter what situation. The developers for this game are autistic  who have clearly never cared for gameplay in anything sure you can argue 'It's a simulator not a game' but it's still a 'Military Simulator'. There is no effort for gunplay whatsoever in this torm of a simulator. All the guns feel the same bullets never connect where they're supposed to you run around feeling clunky as  shooting nerf guns at nothing.   TL;DR Pros: It's a game  Cons: It's a really  game Low/nonexistant FPS  gunplay Models are ugly Server list sucks  Just about every game out there is better than this  and that's terrible seeing as there's a full dev team that made this.  Just take your $60 and spend it elsewhere that's all there is to it.-10
Arma 3This game runs poorly on new state of the art systems. I honestly wish I didn't even buy it. I spent hours trying to get the game to run on my 6700k and gtx 1080 and in the end requested a refund that was denied because I spent more than two hours trying to make it work. Gpu boosting is terribly implemented with underclocking in game unless zoomed in. People will tell you that the framerate depends on your cpu but while zoomed in and the gpu boosts the framerate is almost playable. As far as the game get use to getting shot at and killed by people you never see. The game is a frustrating technical mess that the programmers optimized with the proficiency of a potato.-10
Used to be a good game. dont even get me started on the  dlc that they basically force on you if you wanna play the game right.  you bohemia;-1;0
I have really enjoyed this game for a long time but the new DLC is way overpriced. I don't mind spending a bit here and there but $34.99 for some new weapons and a few vehicles is a bit much. With 5 more dlcs planned in the future. If prices stay the same thats another $174.95  Lets be honest this game isnt worth potentially $200+ for all the game content.;-1;1

https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Analytics   Opt-out and not Opt-in. There is no prompt to inform the user of this while launching the game.  PSA: 'Anonymous Data' doesn't exist.    UPDATE 07/11/2016;-1;0
Arma 3Awesome graphics and plot but game's playability is very low. Controls are very hard to use. You can not change them in the way you choose. It is the worst game I ever played for 4-5 years. Really annoying just because of controls. There are universal keys like 'T' for chat or 'Y' for team chat they are totally different. And another problem is that Bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like DayZ. Another not recommended game for me.-10
Arma 3Having spent about 1000 hours on Arma2/OA (between D2D/Disk Version/Steam) and 70 hours in Arma 3 it's no contest in anything but graphics. Arma2/OA is much better in terms of realism. The bullet sponge AI in Arma3 (sorry body armor doesn't let you just keep trucking like it was a bee sting) just kill any immersion whatsoever along with the ridiculous fantasy Iranian units. Also simple things like the 'flying' drop down when placing units are gone in the new editor for no apparent reason.  Overall Arma 3 does look a lot better but still runs pretty poorly regardless of high end hardware (i7 960@4.1Ghz+STRIX R9 390X/ 3930K@4.2Ghz+STRIX GTX 1060/ i7 4770K@4.3Ghz+780Ti MATRIX SLI (previously 290X MATRIX CF and 390X STRIX CF) / i7 6700@stock+GTX 1070FE / i7 5930K@4.5Ghz+STRIX 980Ti SLI (previously 780Ti MATRIX SLI).   Rather than wasting time on a dubious futuristic setting it would have been far better for the developers to focus on quashing performance issues and providing a believable simulation with realistic damage based on impact point+round+angle. Also AI is still very dumb and STILL unable to haul @$$ with a sense of urgency.   I see Arma 3 as a downhill slide for the series being far more casual than previous iterations in terms of attempted realism compounded by unwillingness to expand the core mechanics for realism that had been laid down since OPFP. In a way it's more like the Battlefield version of the series.  Also on the campaigns; they are straight up trash. Resistance and Red Hammer have not been bested to date although the Arma 2 campaign was pretty fun. Arma 3 is just a slog of monotony; APEX is a waste of money.-11
i am  off so bad right now i cant connect to any servers in arma i am really !!!!!!!!!!;-1;0
Arma 3Where do I begin...  Well Arma III seems really fun hints the reason I bought the game however the game is really really really really poorly optimized. Im only getting 20-30 fps on both SP and MP however I have an awsome system. Im going to show you the recommended specs you need to run the game then im going to show you my specs here they are...

I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone to me its just a waste of $60. This game needs to be optimized waaaaaaaaaaay more before I play this crap again. : (-11
Arma 3I've gotten this game out of spite from many youtube videos and mods. I've paid money so you can save yours. This is why ArmA 3 Armed Assault 3/Armed Assault III isn't so great.  BattlEye: *shiver* don't even get me started on this false positive piece of  lol.  Optimization: Warframe = Max settings runtime tesselation on my AMD Athlon II X3 455 and Radeon HD 7770 Factory OC 60 - 75 fps ArmA 3 = Lowest settings possible same specs as above 13-*20-30* depending on map level and the server  * mostly Also graphics don't affect  if you don't have a 'perfect build'  Gameplay: Could fix a few things like standing up when crawling over rocks. Overall not too shabby.  Mods: Prepare your HDD/SSD space gentlemen. Half the 'realism' or 'USA/RU' content is 500 - 3000 MB Oh yeah remember optimization? You'll love it with mod optimization too.  Community: Everyone plays Altis Life or Island Life or basically RP those who don't play it play insurgency/ctf stuff but there's a small percent who play 'realism' squads.

Warframe is free and it runs better than this  and I can max it. 'b00t teh warframe is missions not open wurld' I mean Warframe has a pretty big ing view distance (I so think) Warframe would probably still run better than ArmA if it was open world.      I'm still gonna play this game every now and then though.-11
now i really want to thumbs up this game but i just cant unless u have an amazing pc most game modes especially king of the hill will run at 10-20 fps i dont have a bad computer it rund far cry 4 on ultra at 40-50 fps but this game will only frustrate u if u dont have a really expensive pc ....... i loved it personaly with its team based tatics and damage model yet whn ur in the war zone it lags so much so thts y i dont thumbs up this game;-1;0
Not worth 60$;-1;1
Arma 3This game has pretty good looking graphics. The options or configure menu could be hard to understand to some players. The controls are overcomplicated. Ragdoll physics is horrible. But the game is trying to be more tactical likewell its not tactical at all most of you enemies run out in the open like 'Hey! Look at me! Shoot me!'. Playing alone isn't to great but with friends you capture the whole experience of Arma 3. The maps are huge so you have to do lots of exploringpretty cool if you enjoy exploring. The vehicles have their own controls maybe except the land vehicles and some other type of vehicles. The air vehicles are hard to control unless you played the rest of the Armas.(BTW still don't know how to use air vehicles). Is this a full release or a beta? I do not know it has plenty after plenty of bugs to fix. Like when that time I shot some one his body had an oversized neck the body itself had its body armor turned into a size of a pea. This game is 4/10 hard to recommend.-10

Arma 3It seems the nice folks at Bohemia took a step back when making Arma 3. Theres no armory mode like in Arma 2 there's actually not much of anything. It seems Bohemia slacked off in order to make the end user finish the game through modding-10

Arma 3I have to say that I enjoyed Arma 2 and Arma2:OA better than I enjoy Arma 3. They should reimplement CTI which was literally the most played Original Game Mode And I say original because the only thing the game was other recognized for was DayZ. Which I always prefered Regular Arma 2. There were so many vehicles in Arma 2 like literally a few hundred different varients or different vehicles. Where this new Arma you see many of the same things. Lack of Base Game Multiplayer gamemodes. 'CTI....' I have literally over 1000 hours on Arma 2 and 400 or so on Arma 3. I have to say I was happier on Arma 2.-11
I have really enjoyed this game in the past. I would have even written a positive review. The game has some flaws in actual gameplay but its something you can't really find anywhere else. However I am giving a negative review not because of gameplay issues but due to the ridiculousness that is the multiplayer system. I just attemped for half an hour mind you to get into a game. This is the process in which you have to attempt to get into a game.  Launch Arma Multiplayer Wait 5 min for all grazzilion servers to load Find a server without any restrictions such as on locked games or full games because that fuction doesn't work Join server Get an error Sent back to multiplayer list Doesn't load any servers Restart arma Repeat for half an hour to get into a game  The system is ing broken and ridiculous. Favorite servers? Doesn't work. Limit servers based on certain criteria? Doesn't work. Refresh list? Doesn't work. Great game except you can't actually play it when you want because of the server situation. Instead of fixing this what do the devs do? Release new ing helicopters and bipods. Whoopie Thanks Bohemia.;-1;1

Arma 3I've played Arma for a long time. But when mod developers ban you from their mod because of a VAC ban more than three or four years ago that is absolutely stupid.

Arma 3This game was released in September 2013 without a single player campaign. Part 1 of 3 DLC s to add it was released in October. Its now Christmas and and whilst there has been other updates for multiplayer the final 2 DLCs that add the missing single player campaign are no where in sight....  It will probably be years before we see them and the fan boys will consider that good service.... Personally I do not.... My advice... save your money for something else.-10

Arma 3I realize the Army's unofficial slogan is hurry up and wait. I didn't think developers would create a game completely embodying that statement.  I have never been so bored trying to play a game before. Keyword trying as once you actually get to the combat area (15-20 minutes after loading up this un-optimized mess) you get shot and have to redo the same process again.  0/10   Would not wait in a Humvee again.-10

Arma 3The Dlc is Often the same price as the game. Base Game does not include missions other than a few tutorials.  Most tanks and weapons and features including sniper rifles are only in the DLC. Life this is an Awful Cash grab of a game that was poorly put together with recycled A.i from Im pretty sure The original Operation flashpoint only dumbed down to save money im sure. Do not get this game unless you like the MOD Community who have saved this game for the creators.-10
Arma 3The sole purpose of Arma 3 is the advertisement of overpriced DLC´s - and therefore beside the singleplayer campaign the embodiment of 'pay to win' in PvP. You want a decent weapon? To bad - you don´t have the DLC. Ran out of ammo on the battlefield? To bad your opponent has the DLC - no weapon for you...   The performance of Arma 3 is sub-par. 30 players on an online-server work fine. Every player added to that will drop your framerate - even on a killer-rig you might end up with 20 fps. The bugs in the game are plenty and sometimes beyond funny. The game has its moments. Yet those are rare.   If you can grab it in Steam-sale... do it. If not... well - I warned you.-10
Unoptimized POS. low frames even with highest end computer. Put an entire clip into an ai and they just turn around and 2 shot me.  The ai can shoot at you perfectly while injured standing up in the distance 700+ meters away. Paid DLC made by devs that 3rd party mods solve anyways and are usually better.   No Thanks.;-1;0
Game is still broken after all these years... The guys are Bohemia Interactive are bunchve ing cokeheads selling a few helo dlc's to get more coke.;-1;0
Runs like  on everything.;-1;0
Bohemia engine.... enough said.;-1;0
Outright unoptimised;-1;0
Arma 3Fun game but the poor fps across the board hurts it its more of a game engine problem than optimization. I have a gtx 1060 and i7-6700 (non k) and i get poor fps in multiplayer and generally 60 fps in singleplayer. Fun game but i wish it ran better i would recomend the game if your looking for single player only due to multiplayer running so poorly. I love the idea but dont like the bad performance i feel they could have done better.-11
Arma 3'New weapons new equipment'  t AK's and the RPG are ripped straight from a mod.  other weapons are just the same weapons with new spray paint...  Only One weapon is new thats it.  Uniform. only some uniforms are new rest just re-coloured.  One new backpack one Ripped Backpack from a mod. (Bergan Heavy Backpack.)  Basicly it's just reusing old stuff and make them look different.  Now for the big part.  I am a admin for a server I can no longer connect to monitor the server. I have family that play this game thats shares the same IP. We can no longer play together on a server we get kicked out.  Dissapointment BI The only things they did not rip or reused are the Heli and Car's. THATS ALL.-11
Arma 3One of the buggiest and most unfinished game I've ever played.  Starts game on medium settings 20 fps sets to ultra 50 fps. That's also a very bad framerate for having 2 r9 280x  Firstly none of the sound is working. Sound is working everywhere else except for Arma 3.  Then I got into a multiplayer game which takes a few restarts btw. I couldn't find a single server so I had to end up just joining my friend through Steam and it worked.  Then I got into a server and after waiting for all textures to load I noticed the bad framerate.  Then we started driving around for a while and even the driving is really bugged. If I start going forward I can't stop going forward and the same for going backwards. Then I decided to go out of it. I got thrown out high up in the air and landed so I died.  Also a small little thing the cursor is still visible. It flies over all monitors but the game doesn't tab out or click anywhere so no big deal just a little bit annoying...  One of the buggiest games I've played in a while. :/-11

Arma 3Optimisation is absolutely terrible. Even if you meet and exceed the requirements prepare for it never to exceed 20 fps.-10
Broken multiplayer + horrible singleplayer campaign = Bohemia Interactive.  Thanks guys.;-1;1
Arma 3Poorly optimize and Bad DRM  It feels like it’s rushed to the market and still in the alpha phase of developing-11
Arma 3Yes this is the fanciest milsim(actually it's mostly a walking/driving/looking for only-god-and-thermal-scopes-know-where-they-are enemies simulator) you can find out there but -  AI can't get more stupid vanilla weapons can't get uglier dlcs can't get more expensive the new running animation can't get more awful. 'please exit arma 3 to manage your mods'. yeah can't even check out what mods i have loaded - i have to either exit the game or use the clunky mod list at main menu. Recently the game starts getting random crashes and black screens. But to be fair it could be caused by mods. Annnd... BI probably found it was a good idea to charge a few extra bucks for some more ugly guns and the bipods which should be implemented years ago. Some mods already had functional bipods/weapon resting way before the official bipod update. Not to mention there are plenty of weapon mods holding a higher quality standard than vanilla and dlc weapons.  So this game only have got worse after all these years? Good job duh.-10
Arma 3I'm going to be honest here. I bought this for tactical military simulation. (Back when it was new)  It was great so many servers and people that were actually pretty fun to play with. Heck there were so many tactical milsim servers!  but as time moved on Game got ravaged with Life Roleplay servers. And then got invaded by Zombie s.  And the currenty stage?  Well Real Life Roleplay or Zombie/DayZ clone mods.  hard to find tactical servers anymore  The core game itself is dead.  Only 2-7 servers exist if you wish to enjoy true arma experience. Other than that.  Feel free to purchase this Zombie raided title.-11

Arma 3This game is beyond disappointing. It has so many elements to make it the best... whatever the  it wants to be but it's too buggy and unoptimized. There really is no excuse for Arma 3 to run this bad at this stage of development. Honestly this game is in alpha whether it says 'full release' or not. There is a huge lack of content compared to the previous Arma. Arma 3 has just about 1/4 of what arma 2 had. The saddest thing overall is the fact that there has been no effort to fix this game in quite sometime. I am fairly certain that Bohemia has the resources but they refuse to even bother with it.  THEY SERIOUSLY USED RESOURCES TO MAKE ING KARTS (a presumably broken waste of money) INSTEAD OF FIXING THEIR  ING GAME.-10
Arma 3Another day another ArmA game another load of bugs and lags. Don't expect this game to run well if you want a solid 60 FPS it will always find a way to ruin your performance. I'm constanlty monitoring hardware usage and ArmA III lags even while not loading my CPU or GPU above 70% (I'm running the game on a 6 Gb/s SSD). I cannot help but compare this game with Battlefield 4 that runs almost perfectly well. I do realize that BF4 isn't running a whole load of AI and scripts plus its maps and object count are much lower but somehow I feel DICE could do optimization much better than BIS. Seriously what excuse would you have for a game that lags without hardware bottlenecks (so it seems)? I'm definitely not recommending this game as I'm absolutely convinced that steady performance is above fancy visuals. I've tried all kinds of performance tweaks for this game - launch parameters custom memory allocators edits in the .cfg and .ini files unparking the CPU cores changing process priority messing with settings &amp; etc. All they do is give you a tad of extra FPS and nothing more. No tweak will change the fact that ArmA III uses a 32-bit executable and obsolete overcoded engine with no proper multicore support.  On the other note I don't really like the pseudo-futuristic setting of this game. It's indeed pseudo-futuristic as most all present equipment is denied prototypes or current tech that has nothing futuristic about it except being exotic. Mid-2030s? Even while not being a mil expert I understand that realistic portrayal (isn't this what a tactical shooter is about?) of this age is not possible as we have no idea of technology that's going to be used at the time. Scopes with built-in rangefinders and auto adjustment? That's something already created greatly promising and not even present in this bogus - same as triton oxygen mask google glasses smart bullets thermal goggles and even real time active spectral matching camouflage (EDIT: The current version now includes Nightstalker Scope that has a built-in rangefinder). A3 setting ended up on the side of cheap pulp fiction. That's not really a major problem since I'm looking forward to mods like ACE 3 and RHS Escalation that should reintroduce the modern stuff by adding new or converting old assets and it's really good to note that EULA and A3 engine allow this.  The game wields many improvements over ArmA II. The inventory system is marvellous radio comms sound much more like live chat visuals animations and sounds are vastly enhanced but is that really enough when the game often lags like hell because it's purely unoptimised?  A3 is too expensive for its content quality but I may change my mind if devs manage to improve its performance. However it's unlikely they ever will. The way I see it in order for ArmA III not to lag BIS will have to code a new but reverse compatible engine on the basis of DirectX 12 with proper multicore support and a 64-bit executable.    http://img.leprosorium.com/2096814  Pathetic performance: core usage RAM usage GPU usage and video memory usage. The game barely used 50% of availiable computing power horrific 22 FPS are of course the result. The only solution is to lower the viewdistance and object distance to the point where whole world turns into a permanent hazy  like your Silent Hill. Needless to say that flying aerial vehicles becomes a questionable undertaking.-10
WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY 15 DOLLARS FOR 2 CHOPPERS WHEN THE GAME ALREADY COSTS $45?????? SO STUPID;-1;0
Arma 3UPDATE 07/06/2014  I was a big fan of OFP. I am playing 'this' game since literally 2002. I was hoping that developers will take it to a completely new level not only graphics wise but also improve and sophisticate its Simulation part.  That didn't happen. Instead what we have now as ArmA III is simply an OFP converted to COD/BF/CS:GO. This game is dead and not worth spending a dime on it.   PROS + Improved graphics soldier equipment is detailed + Improved movement features leaning several sitting positions etc. + Bullet ballistics + Big areas available for play as an Islands  CONS - Horrible and non realistic human damage system (aka CS-like) - Fictional and not practically realistic weapons - Helicopter can lift and carry a heavy MBT while it is using its main gun in the air... - Sniper can shoot a person sitting inside armed IFV... - Aircraft/Helicopter simulation is at the PS2 arcade flying sim level... - Tank/Vehicle control is simply W A S D + Mouse click horribly simplified - Vehicle movement on a terrain is a joke totally screwed up physics - Helicopter can lift 5 ton truck drop it from 10m and truck continues to drive normally... - Flying physics for Aircrafts/helicopters is a laughable joke - Shooting enemy Aircraft with AA Vehicle is all about 'button-press-hold-click' - TONS of bugs without attention.  I do not see a value in this game.  Developers should have been fixing the above issues and improving our gaming experience instead those clowns spend time on releasing trash like KARTS in order to suck additional buck from us!   KISS MY A$$ BOHEMIA!-10
Arma 3I was a fan of the ArmA series. I really played ArmA II totally grey.. But I had high hopes for ArmA III buying the alpha  promising us more stuff will be added later...  Yes that part is true.. ArmA III on itself is totally empty... You have to get Mods and Payable DLC content to make the game interesting... It is like they gave you the engine of the car only.. You have to pay for the wheels  chassis  doors  windows  lights yourself.  It is suppose to be MilSim  in order to have that label  it should give us also.   What made me being so disappointed about ArmA III... It is that the Helicopter DLC costs 12 euro.. Like WTF-10
Arma 3meh.  i have a couple of issues with the game.  1. you need a fantastic cpu and decent gpu to handle this game. otherwise you will be constantly playing at 20 fps 2. for how much processing they take up the ai is downright stupid. they are still too slow and hardly use enough cover to blend in with players. -to make up for difficulty the ai is incredibly accurate and good at detecting. 3. the vanilla campaigns are set so your teams are at poor odds with the ai. this is supposed to be realistic where real world tactics are used. why is my team running into an enemy town through a valley? 4. the armor system is awful. it takes 5-6 shots to kill with the medium caliber assault rifles. i know they say its because of plate carriers. plates don't necessarily stop bullets they take a lot of energy out of them so you don't die immediately. getting shot is still going to put you out of a fight. anything past .243 or 6.5 is going to start breaking bones; it would be amazing if you could even still move on your own let alone shoot back accurately. 5. the campaign is mediocre with missions that take too long and put too much responsiblity on the player trying to have fun. arma2 also had bad voice actors with bad lines but this is a little better. its stilll not much of an improvement.  6.wonky user interface. this have improved on a lot over time and there are mods to make it more intuitive. it still takes a while to do anything in your inventory though; maybe because in real life it would take time to rummage through your pockets and ruck sack to find anything. it still sucks though 7. no tutorial. yes i know there is a 'boot camp' thing now. that hardly explains how to use anything. it still missed subjects like actual fighting flying helicopters and jets taking cover.  8. mission editor. how do you use it? i don't really know. ive been messing with it for years i still dont think i know much about how it all works. 9. multiplayer. it doesnt happen. at least from what ive seen. just about all the servers are locked clan servers or empty public matches. the server browser is cluttered and confusing with no explanation of what it all means. i mean call of duty was so successful partly because of its join a random lobby feature.  i know i mentioned all the bad stuff. there is much good to this game and im sure other reviewers will point it out. i played this game franchise until i got sick of it. now i play insurgency because its much more fluid and refined with the same idea of critical dammage and little hud.-10
Arma 3This isn't really a game it's more like a dev tool kit for a military shooter. Soldier movement is dated probably the only negative comment related to graphics/physics. There are a couple missions made by arma...and a couple 'showcases' that show you what their vehicles/weapons/drones can do. The training in this game is below average..and the keyboard mapping is  poor overly complicated and hard to reference. No built in multiplayer like it suggests. Players host their own servers but it's not like BF4 these servers most are locked others if you d/l this workshop item you can't get in or if you didn't download another workshop item you can't get in. If you do get in there's weird rules and no one to tell you what to do.   Conclusion Great platform/developer kit but i paid good money for a 'game' and as such there's a handful of single player missions no fmv cut scenes the 'multiplayer' is not supported through arma only through community no mission types or user friendly options. soldier animations are oddly dated for an advanced military shooter.-11
Arma 3At first this game was a lot of fun to play. But with the time it rather got worse than good.  - The game does not go above 29 FPS for me (on i7 4770k GTX 770 SSD) - It easily drops under 20 FPS when there is a bit of vehicle movement around the map - The AI is programmed really bad. Not finding paths. Not moving at all when told to.  The game is just as good without AI as it is with them. Maybe some dummy targets for your enemies. Which again are overly OP compared to your AI... - Since the shutdown of GameSpy it is completely unavailable for Coop missions with friends. Hosting Steam servers was not working since the games release  And last but not least the price is way too high for a game said to be 'still under development'  I regret every Cent of the 45 Euros which I payed for this game.-10
I'd rather stab myself with a rusty pair of pliers repeatedly until death than endure this buggy mess.;-1;1
The game seems to be ambandoned from the developers... Has bugs and i cant find a multiplayer season with serious players to play. Also a hell of the lag;-1;0
Arma 3ARMA III is one of those games that is really cool in it's own unique way. Unfortunately ARMA can't stay out of it's own way long enough to remain cool. Before I start I should mention that this review is based only on my experiences of single player and the editors with the deal-breaking focus on the editors themselves. That said I'm expecting the dislikes to rain.  This is a difficult one to review. As of writing I've played about 40 hours of almost exclusively single player/editor use. In some ways I really enjoy this game. The biggest draw for me was the editor(s) in this game. The ability to create my own skirmishes anywhere on this giant island and watch them unfold is awesome. You can basically make up any scenario you can imagine and play it out. This alone has kept me entertained for at least 30 hours by itself. I got past the extremely unintuitive user interface and AI quirks and genuinely had a good time hiking around and blowing stuff up.  But if ARMA is anything it's a shining example of why documentation is so important in software development. The documentation for ARMA's editors both 2D and 3D is bad. And when it's not bad it's non-existent. What does the Game Logic object actually do in the editor when it seemingly has no inputs or outputs? Why do some modules need to be synced to each other when others don't? How are you supposed to figure out what to sync to what and when?   Usually there is no answer. Or the answer is outdated or inconsistent between the different editors. Or you'll find other people asking the same questions with the responses basically shrugging. The answers I did find always came down to a 'copy paste this script' or 'follow these exact steps' with no further explanation as to why I was doing these things. That's great for getting something working instantly not so great for learning how to use the systems and building the intuition needed to take things further.   I don't think this is about the complexity of the editor I think this is about bad design decisions and lack of consistent clear documentation. I've worked with Garry's Mod coding for at least a thousand hours and have developed software for many different languages from Python to assembly. The only reason I was able to accomplish these things was from the comprehensive documentation on how things worked and _why_ they worked. And even if they didn't have those things they at least gave a brief snippit on what is required for the function/module to actually work. Something that the ARMA amazingly doesn't have for the vast majority of it's objects. Just looking at the MP editor modules on ARMA's own wiki page only about 3% of the listed modules have documentation. The game TIS-100 is more approachable than the depths of these editors.   So I've had fun with ARMA for the most part. But this well is running dry for me quickly. I wish it wasn't because this feels like the kind of game I would enjoy if ARMA didn't tie its own hands behind its back. For the reasons that I bought this game I wouldn't recommend it. If you play it for multiplayer your experience will probably be completely different. So take this for what it's worth.-10
Arma 3unoptimized has  game modes i can get in garrys mod all game modes require you to suck the admins male sexual organ just to get in and good luck if you can find your friends because this piece of  doesnt even tell you no it's not ing unrealistic to show you where your friends are and it doesnt make the game more realistic it makes it annoying and stupid. Overall im glad i didnt spend 30 or 60 bucks on this astraphy because this game sucks major monkey caca 2/10 id rather play duke nukem forever-10
Arma 3I had really high hopes for this game when I was told about it. But I can officially warn you that this game is piece of sh*t. The only functional part of the game is the uninstall option. The physics are none existent and the animations are about as smooth as a man in a wheelchair trying to climb a spiral staircase. Not only that but the people who play the game are tight f*cks who couldn't make it in the army so they play Arma 3.  There is one positive aspect to this game however and that is joining high pop servers and team killing all of unbelievably sweaty players who all seem to be consecutively on their periods. It makes DayZ look amazing. D*ckhead simulator 2015-11
Arma 3I really can't recommend this game in the state that its in. Bare bones content. Nowhere near the value for money or content that ARMA2:OA alone has. Stupid awkward release schedule and lifeless world and content. I wish I could get a refund.-10
Arma 3this game is not realistic at all really. recoil is garbage the weapon sway is way to much the damage you do to enemies is way to low it shouldn't take more than 1 shot to the head to kill someone but in this game it does at times when you fire a weapon fire doesn't come out of the barrel like how it does in this game Also 90 percent of everything in this game is fake and the rest are prototypes/in use. the only things that i can think of in this game that are real are the 556 weapons which do barley any damage so you don't every use them anyways... this game would be better if it wasn't called arma 3 because it ruined the arma name...-10
Arma 3BUY Battlefield COD or anything else.  I saw this game on sale and watched the awesome videos. you will not be able to do any of the stuff in the videos. I read several of the reviews and saw people giving this game great rewiews with 100's if not 1000's of hours played so i got the game.  First off the single palyer is nice graphics are awesome ect but you will spend alot of time figuring out how to achually look through your scope and other anowing things like changing cramera view ect.  Once you have had enough of that you will try the multiplayer which is why you got the game and this is where your fun ends. You might think you can pick a server and go kill something wrong. First off most servers are locked. most of the ones that are not locked are doing RPG like this is the sims or something. A lot of them do not even give you a gun. Once you figure out to filter you search to team death match you will find 50% of them locked and 45% of them using some mod you dont have. this will leave you with about 5 people to play with. To fix this you might spend 2 or 3 hours trying to find what mod the other servers are using and what required mods the first one needs. Once you get done waitng to download all this you find out the mods you got will get some error trying to login to these servers. Even though you tried both the one off steam and other websites. finally you will have spent several hours and never experence anything like the videos.  P.S. this is the only game that has upset me enough to give a negative review. Its not worth the 50% sale price you might have more fun burning your money.-11
Arma 3Not a bad game per-se but not worth the price tag either. Not by a long shot. Buy it when it's on sale or something.-10
I keep trying to play this game but I just can't enjoy it because I get 9-20 fps with a i5 cpu and gtx 970 gpu... The game is horrible because of this... When Arma fixes their fps issues then the game will be the best fps and 3rd person shooter ever to exist. I beg them to fix their game... I as well as many others desperately want to play this with a managable framerate.;-1;0
Arma 3As a previous ArmA player i couldn't wait to see the new technologies that were going to be used in ArmA 3. Then i played it. From a personal point of view this game is a complete let down to the ArmA series. Yes it is enjoyable in some aspects but it is nothing compared to ArmA 2 / OA. If you're looking for a more arcade type military game you've found it.-10

Arma 3I'm gonna get slammed for this review but you know me:  Arma 3 was recommended to me by a mutual friend at the time so I looked into it as well as insisting to pay $60 'the price of a full game' for a shooter that was released over 2 years ago.   I thought I would be amazed with Arma 3... I wasn't.  First strike I was met with poor optimization and horrendous frame rate issues even with the terrible looking standard graphics the maximum frames I could only achieve 27. I can already hear everyone shouting 'You're PC is trash! Git gud Stealth...Poorass.' I will have you know that this is quite the machine I have with an AMD Radeon R7 370 Graphics.  Arma 3's single player offering is a joke. It's worse than Star Wars Battlefront EA singleplayer. After the first mission I just stopped. But then I tried Arma's multiplayer what the game is praised for. Now I do respect that Arma 3 is supposed to be one of the most realistic military shooters on the market. But perhaps its a bit... too realistic... You're going to spend more time walking with your squad from point A to point B getting lost and checking your map and compass often alot more than actually fighting in the game.- I've only been in 1 firefight. I would take Battlefield over Arma any day.   I was going to rate Arma 3 a 5. But gets held back to a 4/10 due to it's poor optimization terrible AI and dull gameplay.  This was my first refund on Steam and I couldn't be happier to get my full $60 back.  That's gonna do it for Arma 3 and I will see you on the next review. Let's form up! ~Stealth 1548-11
Arma 3Great game But if you plan on playing multiplayer. Expect to get banned by Battleye. Played this franchise since Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis back in 2001 up to the split between Codemasters and Bohemia Interactive. Onto the ARMA franchise. Never cheated and now it's completely unplayable on multiplayer. Battleye has ruined this game for me. They even ban your steam account. Can't just rebuy the game...-10
I only enjoyed the campaign. It's a great realistic military simulation game but people in the multiplayers are not cooperative. Play it if you want to try campaign and co-op. I Do recommend this game.;-1;1
Arma 3I really want to love Arma but I just cant bring myself to. It's the most realistic game ever and it has probably a lifetimes worth of content. Beautiful graphics and the complexity of the gameplay isn't actually all that daunting once you get used to it. But thats not the problem. The problem is the dog-dirt AI. Its seriously the worst AI I have ever seen in a video game EVER. I actually cannot describe how awful it is.   Should you attempt to use AI to help you drive a vehicle God have mercy on your soul. Try and be the gunner? The driver is going to do his best to run into walls and flip the tank in a ditch. See an enemy? Well then he is going to turn the tank around expose the weak rear armor and stop in an open field. Tell him to move? Nope suddenly they forgot how to obey commands and do a weird back and forth jerking roll thing. Try and be the driver? The gunner in a tank with thermal optics will somehow miss a tank sitting 3 feet in front of him. Your infantry teammates will engage the enemy by breaking cover running into the middle of the street and spraying on full auto. Vehicles constantly get stuck on rocks lampposts trees ditches ect. Sometimes they won't spot an enemy in the open while they are being used as target practice and other times they pull of aimbot level first-shot headshots from 500m while standing upright. Helicopters and planes are more effective as kamikaze weapons and single enemies with rifles can easily take out a wing of attack helos.   I really really want to love this game but its virtually impossible to enjoy with AI teammates. I have every AI enhancement mod I can find nothing helps. Every time I come back to it I get so mad. Whether its my M1 driver stopping in an open field and then un-learning how to drive so we can be RPG fodder or my gunner in an apache refusing to engage enemy infantry in the open leading to an early demise the AI in this game is insanely poor. It makes the AI out of battlefield 2 look like rocket science. AI able to take the initiative and get in a technicals .50 without being specifically ordered to approach the vehicle and then you having to get in and switch spots for 10 minutes to finagle them out of a passenger seat into the obviously useful position is a pipe dream in this game. Its super enjoyable to walk around and play in Zeus mode but unless you have great internet you are going to get very very very upset.-11
?????;-1;1
Arma 3 developers who add DLC into the game which you cant use untill you buy them. Such a foul move to get players to have to buy their dlcs..   Back in my days dlc were for free. :(-10
Arma 365/100  Pro's Very good scale and detail in the world allows you to see things miles away.  A large selection of well modeled weapons gear vehicles.  Multiplayer if done right can be epic and quite a bit of fun. These servers are extremely hard to find though.  Cons Very poor AI - I'm talking drop dead liberal half baked hippie 2nd grade education type of stupid.  NO CONTENT - took almost 2 months just to release a few single player missions No Multiplayer Support - no real official missions or servers to help keep the population high.  BUGS BUGS BUGS Performance issues Missing a lot of must have vehicles and aircraft that would really add to the simulation.  I would NOT recommend buying this game until about a year of patches and they complete the game. It is UNFINISHED as of right now.-10
Arma 3This game crashes constantly. I have yet to play a full multiplayer match because it freezes within 10 minutes of playing every time. I have a high spec computer and play other games on highest settings. When I try to play Arma 3 on lowest settings it crashes. This game is what we call a complete failure. Save your money for a game that actually works.-10
Arma 3Some background: I first started playing Bohemia Interactive games in 2001 when I played the demo for Operation Flashpoint from a Computer Gaming World disk. I owned all of the Operation Flashpoint expansions as well as ARMA II and now ARMA III.  This game sucks sh*t. All of them have and all of them have depended on the addons to make the game playable. BI Has never made a decent game only a platform with promise that modders/mission makers polish up.  -I don't know why BI continues to make storylines they've always been awful at them. -AI sucks. I just fired up a mission and was told to plant explosives on some mobile artillery. The Platoon Leader said 'and everyone else take cover'.. apparently a couple AI thought it best to run towards the mobile artillery so I accidently killed them ---leading to a mission failure and them shooting at me.  -Before that two soldiers got killed running off on their own (funny never saw that in the Ranger Handbook) -Most multiplayer servers with a decent ping are either RPG or DM... I should not have to explain why this is stupid.  +Voice acting gets slightly less terrible each game. +Graphics are decent  I don't recommend getting this unless it's like 75% off and you understand what you're getting. -10

Its seriously the worst AI I have ever seen in a video game EVER. I actually cannot describe how awful it is.   Should you attempt to use AI to help you drive a vehicle God have mercy on your soul. Try and be the gunner? The driver is going to do his best to run into walls and flip the tank in a ditch. See an enemy? Well then he is going to turn the tank around expose the weak rear armor and stop in an open field. Tell him to move? Nope suddenly they forgot how to obey commands and do a weird back and forth jerking roll thing. Try and be the driver? The gunner in a tank with thermal optics will somehow miss a tank sitting 3 feet in front of him. Your infantry teammates will engage the enemy by breaking cover running into the middle of the street and spraying on full auto. Vehicles constantly get stuck on rocks lampposts trees ditches ect. Sometimes they won't spot an enemy in the open while they are being used as target practice and other times they pull of aimbot level first-shot headshots from 500m while standing upright. Helicopters and planes are more effective as kamikaze weapons and single enemies with rifles can easily take out a wing of attack helos.   I really really want to love this game but its virtually impossible to enjoy with AI teammates. I have every AI enhancement mod I can find nothing helps. Every time I come back to it I get so mad. Whether its my M1 driver stopping in an open field and then un-learning how to drive so we can be RPG fodder or my gunner in an apache refusing to engage enemy infantry in the open leading to an early demise the AI in this game is insanely poor. It makes the AI out of battlefield 2 look like rocket science. AI able to take the initiative and get in a technicals .50 without being specifically ordered to approach the vehicle and then you having to get in and switch spots for 10 minutes to finagle them out of a passenger seat into the obviously useful position is a pipe dream in this game. Its super enjoyable to walk around and play in Zeus mode but unless you have great internet you are going to get very very very upset.-11
Arma 3This is not a good game.   The engine is a mess. I don't think any computer on earth can run this game at 60FPS with a lot of scripts in the background or if there is a lot going on. Everybody knows this yet it seems to be shrugged off by the community or even laughed at. The game plays awfully as well it's very clunky and unresponsive. You have to play to understand of course. It all has to do with a broken and unoptimized engine. I question how they got away with it.  The multiplayer is awful as nobody plays it for the Arma experience. This game blew up and 'life'servers dominate the multiplayer. You'll either be playing king of the hill 'life'roleplays or zombie servers. You also can't forget the awful performance you'll get in multiplayer as there are usually scripts in the background. Enjoy playing at low FPS.   If you want a military simulator look elsewhere.-10
Trailer explain this is game actually is still under devellopment. They are basically looking for players to play this game to actually test the game and server stability and more. Buy game? Not yet.;-1;0
waste of 40$  you.spend more time trying to play then actually playing;-1;0
Arma 3Unless you plan to play offline prepare to buy this game a few more times.  Thanks Bohemia-11
Arma 3Good game for patient players.  Giving it a thumb down for unbelievable DLC marketing.  I just payed 35 euro for this game and I am getting popups over the screen while in the action if I do not pay additional 30 euro for Apex DLC? Seriously? How is this not regulated by law? False marketing?  Also the community is horror. I am new to game and tried asking simple questions but received only mocking or nothing at all. E.g.   Q: 'are there a vehicles for travel in this mission?'  A: 'lol'  Seriously in over 30 hours of playing I haven't met a single player willing to help in any way.-11
Played A lot game broke contacted support they didnt help contacted google didnt help broken game waste of 60 dollars. *EDIT* The three hours in the last two weeks is literally me sitting on the launcher trying to fix the game.;-1;1
That awkward moment when you get a more realalistic combat experence playing with little green army men on the living room floor than you do playing the 'most realalistic combat simulator ever'.;-1;1
WHERE ARE THE JETS. I BOUGHT THIS SOLEY FOR THE JETS;-1;0
Arma 3First off i have to say i HATE Multiplayer games. they are not fun for me in the slightest. just a bunch of idiots modding to win. so i never tried the multiplayer.  I got this for the Singleplayer and i have to say it sucks. its far too scripted. i cant do any thing my way i have to stand here.. stand there... listen to some idoit talk and curse for half a hour when he could just say it over the radio whilst i walk or drive so i am not so bored with the crappy dialogue but no... It's BORRING.  Even when i actually got to shoot half a hour later... the gun physics are so lame i laughed and shortley after quit and uninstalled it. If you shoot a rifle at 50 metres square at a target the size of a torso the bullet will hit it but in this so called SIM it won't most of the time. Guns just are not that unaccrate. shotguns have spread not rifles. a rifle at 50 metres will be 1 cm each way tops not 50 cm. that alone is enough for me to quit and uninstall it and NEVER play it again.-10
Arma 3The engine looks nice but based on the older operation flashpoint engine still. Entering houses feels 'iffy' and like walking around on honey - god forbid going prone in one... it's like the house knows judo.-10
Arma 3This isn't a bad game but it's not worth the price and it's mostly a template for mods and set in the future. If you want a true military experience i would strongly reccomend arma 2 co its worth the price not this template.-10
Arma 3Worst FPS ever if you have AMD. 15-22fps in most of the online modes. (AMD FX 6300 8GB RAM Radeon R9 270 etc.)-10
Arma 3This game is probably the least fun game I've played in a long time. It tries to sell itself as a military sim but it's as much a military sim as minecraft. Wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. Also 60 dollar price tag? Games like Red Orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. You're money is better spent elsewhere.-10
Arma 3Could be good but riddled with bugs and people that are elitist . I spent hours watching videos and reading web pages and as soon as I came across a problem that I could not find a solution for online all you get in any chat channel is a bunch of jerks that accuse you of not looking  up. WHAT A MASSIVE WASTE OF MY MONEY!! The technology is there the game is ok looking but all the time textures pop in and out and there is a lot of glitches and problems. I run this on a great machine that has never had a problem running anything but this game even after 3 years has a ton of visual issues. PASS!-10
Worst game ever i seen. You are just running. The game is about running. Don't buy !;-1;0
Arma 3Worst controls in a game ever... Really want to like this game but it's hard to enjoy without spending hours learning their painfully unintuitive controls-10
Arma 3This game looked promising in alpha but has been patched to a worse and worse state ever since. Don't let any of the pretty screenshots or clips fool you. It's practically still an alpha game and will probably never leave this state. If you're the type of person who finds fun in playing scenarios against extremely stupid bots this might serve. For anyone else don't waste your money. The netcode is absolutely horrible - the game is full of lagging rubberbanding and anything else you might expect from a game that hasn't been finished at all. No matter how fast of a hellmachine you have below your desk the game will almost always run at max. ~35fps in multiplayer a lot less if in action. So aiming and hitting someone is rather a game of luck than anything else. Further the gun and aiming mechanics are absolutely cumbersome and just annoy the crap out of you in combination with the weak engine. Right now you just aim at someone fire and very often absolutely nothing happens. No hit no blood nothing even after firing a whole magazine at the enemy while keeping the crosshairs exactly at him from a distance of say 50-100m. Does actually happen. In multiplayer the enemy you try to eliminate then starts running around like a rabbit (because they know exactly how it looks on your screen - it makes it even harder to hit him because he starts teleporting from one point to another) and tries to spot you while doing so. Yes that's right. In a 'military simulation' it has proven to be more effective to run around like a crazy ape right in the open field than to look for cover and continue from there. The structures look mostly the same and are full of bugs aswell. You can't go through a door without getting stuck in some way in like 50% of cases you get stuck right at the bottom of stairs and have to take a step back and try again (no need to mention how much it's going to trigger you if you get killed because of this stupid sh..). So stairs and doors are to be considered extremely risky to use - just like in real life right? Right it's a simulation it has to be realistic!  In spite of everything the developer of this game absolutely avoids improving the engine or the netcode since release in any way they rather design some new weapons they can wrap into a dlc and sell for 10 bucks. Since alpha the game has used cpu power in an absolutely unoptimized manner has therefore extremely poor performance on even newer machines and just makes it impossible to have a nearly fluid aiming experience. There is always some lag or stutter that often will decide about the outcome of a confrontation.  Like I said in the beginning there was a lot of hope and potential for this game when alpha released but this is now more than 3 years ago and not many of the relevant aspects and weaknesses of this game were actually improved. It might actually have gotten worse since then. I bought it for like 20€ back then and even for this price I would definitely not buy it again. Do not buy this crippled piece of software.-11
Terrible 2/10 such lag the lack of everything in this game gives it the 2/10 save you're 60$;-1;1
Arma 3If you came here because saw some youtube of great playz and got hyped on this game go and watch some longplay footage without editing or watch live-stream. Then you may change your mind. Because regular gameplay is way different from carefully edited best-ofs. This game has these nice moments separated by long periods of struggling with interface and trying not to die from glitches.  Is is not kind of game you can grab on sale and have fun with. You can't start playing this game without having someone to introduce you to it because singleplayer is really limited and multiplayer is quite inaccessible to uninitiated newbie. So if you wonder if you could just take it and play for some hours having fun then forget about it - you wont. And if some of your friends told you to play with them then sure by all means take it - even fighting with sticks with friends is fun so Arma3 can be too ;).  You can read negative reviews about game optimization. These are reviews from somebody who probably never played actual Arma3 - game runs great looks great works smooth with hi-rez and hi-fps. But then who buys Arma to play Arma? Not many. Obviously. People install Arma to play mods. But mods that are lifeblood of gaming and salvation of the industry [sarcasm!] are usually made by wannabe-pros-script-kids who plant hack over hack in mod in attempt to implement anything. Constant loops designed to eat cpu cycles photo-quality textures for sexy female models shiny new guns with more polygons than whole aircraft. Then couple of these are bunched together on one server with possible conflicts and no concern about limitations of average user's hardware. People cry that their powerful pcs can't handle it but it is terrible quality mods that kill it and slow your game to crawl. Game is optimized but mods are not curated so every piece of random hacks are allowed and people who run mods expect the game engine to somehow detect bad code and optimize it. Want high fps? Dont install poor mods. Refuse to play unoptimized mods and encourage others to stop playing them - maybe this way you will tell mod-devs to start thinking about their work [hint: they will just stop making mods].  The problem is that beside vehicle and bullet mechanics things go wrong in this production. Physics is bad - you will make backflips with your APC or die from touching dynamic object. Infantry controls are terrible - probably infantry unit is not required in simulator for army so what you receive here is human character that is controled like a tank. Nobody cared to plan and hone useful user interface to provide smooth control system for player character. You get avatar to control and whole keyboard of buttons to make him move. You can customize it to your will you can use all external devices you like - but it is up to you to make it work. And even when you make it work as you want you will still have game with unfinished mechanic for infantry:  - your gear doesn't limit your movement so you can carry kgs of equimpent and you will crawl crouch and stand up at the same speed.  - you cannot even cancel action - you started doing something you are sitting duck.  - missing animations and movement options you would expect from combat-sim. If you can think about doing something you can't do it. Numerous games accustomed us to make quick combat movements sliding under/over obstacles hiding behind cover or jumping over walls entering through the windows and so on so it is painful to be unable to do it here. You cannot even pull out weapon while walking or switch to binoculars while lying down.  - carrying heavier weapon in your hands feels like holding a handgun - you can run around with it feeling no inertia or being slowed down. Some arcade games feel more realistic than Arma.  Game wasn't built around infantry it is not FPS by heart this is vehicular combat sim with driver/pilot and gun operator. Infantry units are implemented as VR training for rookies - learning the bullet behavior for long distance shooting practicing mildot ranging operating launchers working with map and team communication.  You won't have smooth close-mid range combat with guns.  This part of the engine was hacked into the existing system and barely works.  Unfortunately.-10

Arma 3DO NOT BUY IF YOU PLAY ON YOUR OWN!!!  This is a fantstic game. Lots of things to try but it must be done with friends who can revive you. Otherwise you will fall victim to little boys with snipers overlooking helicopter shops gun shops etc taking either you out or the helicoper engine immediately as it spawns.  To summarise: Game = Great. Player Base = People who were bullied at school and / or got socks for christmas-11
THIS GAME IS A ING PIECE OF A BUGGED !! NEVER BUY IT!! TOTALY FAKE-SCREENSHOTS BUGGED  JUNK...JUNK...JUNK....---- NEVER BUY IT!! NEVER.... U CANT PLAY THIS PIECE OF  CRAP...WORSE THAN EVERY GAMEE GO AND REPAIR THIS !!!  YOU BOHEMIAN-INTERASSDICKS ''DEINSTALLING'' !!;-1;0
its not what i thought;-1;1
Can't play with my brother if play in same network. Kuyyyyyyyy!!!.;-1;1
Arma 3Game is cancer devs are cancer  Heres why it sucks: DLC  Nothing but money dev's putting adware DLC ingame that breaks multiplayers for all those people who paid 30-60 ing dollars for ads ingame what a ing disgrace meanwhile the game is buggy and unoptimized as ing hell. I did not drop 60 dollars for this crap.  Nothing like being in multiplayer and finding a weapons and getting ' you buy apex'.-10
Rubbish game With great good graphics and an exciable ending to the story where meaty m8 blaze tryes to take over europe to save his family and enilate all minoritys. all in all i rate this 8/8 m8;-1;0
They like to choke people down with there dlc and It's just become to much.;-1;0
Game is pretty cool and detailed ... but its aparently going down the pay for any extra content road Im a cheapskate ... paying for extra model just make me sick ....  if they would come out with actual add-on Ie wait a year or two finish singling out every issue  with your engine then come out with a dlc adding a bit of everythng + some mission i m on thats fine by me i'd buy  But here the game does not feel finished to me maybe they need to come out with more DLC's .... Just my opinion;-1;0
Arma 3Dear Arma   It's not you... It's me.  A popular positive review by [Fog]Snow elequiently said 'Kids play Call Of Duty Boys play Battlefield Men play Arma.'   I am a man all day doing manly things at my manly job and when I come home I just want to be a boy.   I have no problem getting killed with a single bullet dealing with bullet drop limited amo or stamina effects on aiming. I love all of those things and those are the reasons I started this relationship. But you're high maintinance I can't give you the time you require and I don't have a big enough friend group for you to like me.  Yesterday:  4hrs - Play singleplayer to learn controls loving the game so far.  0.5hrs - Jump into 'Quick Play' try to go into normal FPS game modes like catpure the flag. All but two game modes either told me it couldn't find a server or that I didn't have the DLC. Seems odd to me.  0.5hrs - Playing 'Caputre the Island' spawned in the middle of the ocean. WTF!!? Some guy on mic says you need to install something which will make a carrier ship appear so if you don't have that you just fall into the ocean and can't get to the helicopters. Hmm okay.  1hrs - Same game spawning at the points that are on land. Me and about 15 people are all waiting on a heli to pick us up. Sigh... Bored... Oh look a heli yay!  0.05hrs - Heli gets shot down in route to town I bail the heli like a Jason Bourne bad @ss and go to deploy my parachute to fly in like a tiger ninja raining down bullet hell that could make a grown man cry... but I don't have a parachute. Splat!   0.5hrs - Profanity inanimate objects accelerating accross the room at forces greater than or equal to gravity anger at game dissapointment in purchase hope of reimbursement worry about game time spent in single player sadness at time lost look at clock and it is past bed time tired work tomorrow.  I am a software engineer by day and spend a lot of time figuring out computer related things. Like a TV show watcher I too like to unwind at the end of the day but for me I get that in gaming.   No I'm not 60 I am in my 20's.  WORKING FOR FUN IS NOT FUN WHEN YOU JUST GOT DONE WORKING FOR 8 HOURS.  In conclusion Arma I'm sure there is someone perfect out there for you...but it's not me. I really wanted us to work out I truly did but it wasn't meant to be. I hope we can still be friends....  ps. yes I tried other game modes as you can see from my play time but I didn't have much success. One game I got in and 2 mins later got kicked I wasn't using a mic I was playing the objective so not sure what I did.  yes I know this is a strategic sim not a fly out of a heli 007 game I was really mad that I had to A) spawn and wait close to an hour for another heli or B) quit download software for the carrier and join back in  In that timespan I could have played 2 BF4 games and had loads of fun. I wish Battlefied was more tacticle but I'll take it over Arma because I have more fun overall.-11
Arma 3Broken from the start. Horrible gunplay often crashes laggy  multiplayer. The action menu alone is reason enough to not reccomend this game-10
quite meh to be brutally honest;-1;0
Arma 3 game. They flood the loot tables with DLC weapons attachments ammo varients and clothing and expect you to purchase the DLC on the spot. Hell no. Not recommended unless you love having watermarks on your screen and a constant prompt to waste your money on DLC that in total adds up to the same cost of a triple A title.-10
-Spends 40 bucks on Arma 3 -Looks at server list -All servers require 100 dollar DLC -Finally finds DLC free server -Game does not launch -Refunded  For s Sake;-1;0

Constantly forcing DLC down my throat and its horribly optimized;-1;0
Bad game unless you like getting 20 fps on any setting you put on horrible engine poorly optimized pls fix your garbage game.;-1;0
Arma 3 the worst game of the series.;-1;1
Arma 3Arma 3 is quite easily the worst FPS in the past 5 years. It has a horrific community full of squeaky kids and MLG sounds over teamspeak. It's extremely difficult to have fun with often the main areas (or places of interest - certain villages) are camped by snipers. To get into any kind of combat is a task in itself and is disappointingly unrewarding and the available maps are always  far too big for the amount of players in each battle .  On top of all this the game is poorly optimised and needs a decent computer to run at a playable level on the lowest settings. It'ss unusual for me to write such a negative review but I feel I have to warn people that it's a hit or a miss. If you have a decent computer and like military simulation games then this may be perfect for you. In which case enjoy! But unfortunately most of us do not meet these qualities and will be disappointed with Arma.-11
Arma 3Unable to play on MP servers can't launch campaign battleye doesn't allow game to load in trys to launch game then log says 'Steam online Game ready' but never launches. I'm not to tech savy but I have read through evrything related to this event and no fixes. I enjoyed the startup screen lol.-11
Tried playing on win7 x64/Intel celeron 1037U/4GB ram/HD graphics - 20-30 fps@800x600(everything low/turned off) and pemanent problems with the game UI and mouse - it starts working only after I switch the ui scale. Multiplayer crashes (tried playing some RPG mode);-1;0
is this game fail or what?;-1;0
Arma 3The Game was absolutely beautiful to look at Graphics were on target 100% but if your a first time Arma player the user friendly version is not there. Leaves you completely disoreinted almost immediately. Camera views while inside the vehicle leave you going for the number pad's 0 key a lot. Once outside the vehicle your camera's axis is only in the up down view there is no 360 view here boys/ girls. It does however have the genuine military simulation feel. For the amount of times it use the F-Bomb you'd think you were on a military boat. Hence the term make a sailor blush. All in all I'd give it a 6 out 10.-10
Arma 3Can't just Can't  What can i say. Is it realistic?-yes! But with the laggy connections question graphics and did i mention the laggy connection??? gun fights at close range arent about anything other than whos got the better connection to the server.  Ive shot a guy 3 times at close range with a sniper rifle (point blank in chest). He killed me I asked him how he was still standing his responce? You shot me? ......   This is what you deal with you can shoot people but do to horrible server connections the game simply becomes who can get a bigger gun.... Not what i paid for.-11
worst game ive ever played how about you fix simple mechanics like walking and jumping before releasing this public MORONS........;-1;0
dont buy this game its a great game besides the part of you cant use pretty much any weapon because of the 10$ expansions and the 30$ for a ing map and a few weapon... its a waste of money and time... theres no way to torrent the expansions (get them for free) only buy this game if your willing to spend another 60$ on some weapons cars heli's and other . and a ing map.. amra 2 was 1000x Better and less limited;-1;0
Arma 3If you like singleplayer this is the game for you. If you like playing multiplayer at 30fps with a high end pc. This is the game for you. Worst optimizated engine ever. Try sniping a guy at 1000 meters at 30 fps and with desync thats MP arma 3. Good game but just doesnt use the hardware correctly. My i7 4770k is only running at 20%. The community is not very nice. I wouldnt waste my time. There are alot better games out there.-10
Pros -lots of fun  -two well made maps  -good mod suport -good online play   Cons  - in the two big maps and the manny verations of it i serched and serched and could not find a TURBO MAN doll   final  although it was fun there was no turbo man dolls and for that im out;-1;0
game is dog  needs optimization. 2/10;-1;0
Arma 3It sucks it has the worst campain it crashes all the time the phyics suck it has the worst A.I. and also if your playing on sever that does saves your progress then when you crash which happens all the damn time you have to ing start over-10

Arma 3Waste of money. Nobody in their right mind should purchase this game. When looking at the recommended settings to run the game disregard them. It is all lies and cannot run. Poor game choice for those who may find it fun. Rating: .5-10-10
I love arma 2 but arma 3 is one of the worst games i have ever played. one of the reason i like arma 2 is the warfare game mode but there isint a good warfare mode in arma 3.;-1;0

This game has more bugs than a bug nest.;-1;0
not recommended just buy a BF3 or BF4 you will enjoy for long long looong time.;-1;0
Arma 3It would be a good game if you knew how to work all of the installation of mods and arma 3 sync and ws launcher... But if you dont dont buy the game itll be a waste.-10
Arma 3Boring simulator 2014. Love feeling bored? Is your life not complete without pointless derision? Then Arma 3 is the game for you! You can take long walks with friends and talk about everything from the weather the first time you got laid or how you miss mom's home cooking. If you join a full server and stay in it for 3 hours at a time...you do run the risk of eventually encountering enemy combatants. This occurence is rare but known to happen. Not to worry. You will die instantly and get to start the process all over again. So make sure that you read up on politics sports and current events so that you don't bore your online friends while on your long walks together.  And for those having trouble figuring out the controls...LShift + Tab + R + T will tie your right bootlace should it happen to come untied during one of your walks. Substitute R for L if its the left boot that comes untied first.  On a side note this game has a great online community. If you are new and need help...just ask. You will promptly be addressed and told to 'Go **** yourself.'-11
Arma 3I played 600hrs of this playing: Altis life Dayz knock offs king of the hill  missions from the workshop that each require their own ing mods  10/10 wish i could refund this cancer  Large lack of content in comparison to their other games which they have tried to cover up with their grand 'Mod Support' and their  excuse for dlcs. I bought tanoa its basically is just another mod with dev support. The game has basically no Listening server support so be prepared to get hamachi to play with your friends. there are almost no missions that you can jump straight in and play plus they removed CTI (was in Arma 2 and was revamped in a large STANDALONE DLC; Arrowhead) which was probably the best way to showcase everything about the game. Games basically a kickstarter gone wrong.-10
Arma 3If the engine wasn't so garbage that it vomited fatal errors every 8 seconds I'd reccomend it. The game itself is great but until something gets done about how poorly made the engine is don't get ARMA 3. It doesn't like to run on even the highest end systems. Whenever an update is pooped out onto the playerbase it kills dozens of modded servers with no fix. Do not buy this game at full price ever.-11
After putting around 60 hours into this game i can not recommend it in its current form. The multiplayer performace is horrible at best. (~17fps at 8320 and a gtx970). The game still crashes randomly which resultet in complete profile losses. (So if you game crashes and you play a multiplayer mod with progression like altis or koth everything will be gone)   Overall i would say do not buy into this game unless you are willing to deal with an incredile amoutn of bugs/glitches and a performance which is on the same level as the slaughtering grounds.   DO NOT BUY IT;-1;0
Arma 3ever since i played operation flashpoint and fell in love with the RTS  you could build a base and then send tanks to kill your opponents base or fly a jet or helicopter to do it personally the weapons were realistic damage wise which I never see the idea was amazing but it was buggy I couldnt wait for the sequel that would straighten them out op flash 2 was a dud. then I heard of the first arma and again my hopes were lifted. But again I was disappointed. then I bought arma 2 and again was disapointed mainly by empty servers for both 1 and 2. now I see good reviews on Arma 3 and I cant imagine who is giving them since arma 1 and 2 had hardly a soul actually playing I refuse to be disappointed again.  Also the AA was so overpowered that there was no way you could destroy a base with a jet or helicopter youd be instantly shot down super bummer.-10
AMD buyers beware. This game is horribly optimized for AMD CPU's. I've got an FX 8350 paired with a GTX 980 and I can barely run the game at 30 fps at high 1440p and no filters and for mulitplayer forget it you'll get FPS at single digits on low to standard settings. In fact its so badly opitmized for AMD cpu's I ended up uninstalling the game. Hopefully the devs patch in better opitmization for AMD CPU and make use of more cores then maybe I'll reinstall it.;-1;0
Arma 3It's not very friendly to beginners. The steep learning curve takes away a lot of the fun. Especially because it's a multi player focused game and there are very few game types active at any given time and the ones that are active require paid DLC. So I paid 40 bucks and it's not very fun to play if you can even get into a game.-10
Arma 3Arma 3 is suddenly marked as a complete game and they come out with a big DLC a week later? Better idea how about you suck my  Bohemia?-10

Arma 3Felt like it could have been a very good simulator but it turned out to be poor. Played through the first part of the campaign and it was laggy in parts (which I have researched is down to poor optimization of the game) and I managed to get the vehicle stuck in a barrier and had to reload from an autosave. Clearly not well made.  I also found the way markers really hard to see. Either don't bother with them or make them more vivid. I also found it hard to see the enemy but that's just something I would need to get used to.  To top it all off the landscape is so boring. Nothing but open areas and very little variation or cover.  Overall great potential and if you like spending hours learning to play a more difficult game than CoD/Battlefield then I've read that Arma 2 is a much better choice. With that being the case I cannot recommend this game to anyone.-10
trash game u need to shoot some one about 4-6 times with 7.62 in the head to kill someone trash dont buy;-1;0
Arma 3It's not very friendly to beginners. The steep learning curve takes away a lot of the fun. Especially because it's a multi player focused game and there are very few game types active at any given time and the ones that are active require paid DLC. So I paid 40 bucks and it's not very fun to play if you can even get into a game.-10
When it can hold 60 fps like dayz can now ill make a positive review.  PC - intel i7 16 gb ram and a gtx 980 20-40 fps in not acceptable...;-1;0
Lost of bugs. Crashes a lot and if you cant get it going soon (its a bit complicated and will take you a minute to figure it out) you end up playing 'past your refund time played'. I spent hours trying to research maps i can actually play. Thanks steam.;-1;0
Arma 3Game can't use more 1 core realy 1 core it's very important aspect. 42 fps in kavala by ultra settings on my i7 4770k 4.6 ghz gpu gtx titan use 70%... But now recolor kill the game! i can't to play arma 3 more my glass me important-10
AMD buyers beware. This game is horribly optimized for AMD CPU's. I've got an FX 8350 paired with a GTX 980 and I can barely run the game at 30 fps at high 1440p and no filters and for mulitplayer forget it you'll get FPS at single digits on low to standard settings. In fact its so badly opitmized for AMD cpu's I ended up uninstalling the game. Hopefully the devs patch in better opitmization for AMD CPU and make use of more cores then maybe I'll reinstall it.;-1;0

constantly crashes and lags but that may be the type of laptop I have got I do not reccomend this game!;-1;0
Arma 3The game is poorly optimized. I get around 45 fps on my potato pc in campaign but only 5 fps online for some reason. Moreover you can barely play this game online without buying all the DLCs. Not only do you have to buy a 55 dollar game but have to buy all the DLCs totalling to 77 bucks. That's 130 bucks for this  game where you get destroyed by 9 year olds who've all had sex with your mum. The community is fine actually but some servers are cancerous and I forgot to mention that the game is a bit buggy as well. I'm not made of money nor my parents are rich af so I didn't get all the DLCs and got this game on sale. Even with sale everything would've cost me about 90 bucks which is just way too expensive for this  game. This maybe a great game with strategic gameplay but not worth everything you're throwing into it. Also when I see games like these who divide all their necessary game componets into DLCs and charge you 45 bucks for one of them I feel ashamed to be a gamer. Arma 3 is no different than those pay to win games you get on your phone and .-11
Arma 3I tried playing it sometime ago not long though. Couldn't get a proper grasp on keyboard controls and found it to be difficult soley on that. Haven't put much effort into it since.-10

Arma 3Its a simulator alright..... just not a war simulator. Its more of a walking around/ driving around simulator with occasional shooting. I am going to attack this game.... it won't be pretty.... so if you are faint of heart or have fan boyingitis you might want to not read. Ugh.... but where the  do I start? From the moment you start playing this game it will hit you with 1000s of extremely bizarre design decisions that defy all logic and reason. Like for instance there is THREE buttons for standing crouching and going prone( I may be thinking of dayz so forgive me if I am wrong because they both just kinda melded into a big  pile in my mind). I mean most games manage to only have one button for this WHY THE  WAS THAT SO HARD TO FIGURE OUT THAT THEY ENDED UP WITH THREE ING BUTTONS?!?!?! Just the excessive amount of buttons on your keyboard this game uses is unbearable and requires frequent control checks to even do basic things like ING CROUCHING. Then the game has a third person 'option' but anyone who is anyone knows that if there is an option for third person in a fps that you use it. It lets you ing see around corners so congratz on giving us that option..... Then there for some reason is TWO versions of zooming in one makes your person scope in PURELY WITH HIS OWN EYES LIKE HE IS SOME KIND OF SUPER HERO and the other uses your weapons scope. Then we got the insane fall damage. Do you remember playing on the jungle gym at school and jumping off that  like a boss without even a scratch? Well in arma if you jump from that height as a grown  army man you die. Yeah idk wtf............Its shameful..... truelly and I am only scratching the surface trust me its alot worse then I can put into print.  Alright so lets talk about game modes Its probably got more then I can imagine but lets talk about the three I experienced. First team death match sounds good right? WRONG! Actually it may have been king of the hill but  if I care it still sucked. Well your objective was to go into an area and control it which is perfectly fine untill you take into acount that you spawn LITERALLY 2 MILES away from the area EVERY ING TIME YOU DIE. This isn't like the bf version of spawning far away in there you always have a way to get to the battle faster like spawning on your team here you always spawn in the same stupid field with a couple transports. *Sigh* Ok so you get in the vehicle and start on your way to the hill....... thing... where the team death match happens and everything is going ok(slow and boring but ok). THEN SUDDENLY AN ATOMIC ING BOMB SHOOTS OUT FROM HELL WHEN YOUR ALMOST THERE AND INCINERATES YOUR WHOLE CREW! Then you respawn back in the field(more like purgatory) and wait for the transport to respawn so you can begin the EPIC ride back to the...place?   WAIT A MINUTES IS THAT A ING CHOPPER? OMG IT IS! You quickly run over to it and get in! AW YEAH THIS GAME IS GOING TO FINALLY GET FUN! NOPE! You couldn't have known but the chopper controls in this game UIBUASDHGIUADBGD!!!!!111! Sorry they are bad.....they touched me in my no no place and they were coded into the game by cthulu him self for ONLY HE FROM THE DEPTHS could possibly comprehend this madness! Even 'good pilots'(their words not mine) only manage to make it 10 ft before critcal engine failure occurs. Then the real PRO MLG ARMA pilots that actually can fly them by some miracle don't even try to land the damn things. They tell you to just jump out and parachute because they know damn well it will explode if they even barely tap the ground. The first time I ever even got to the holy hill was from parachuting and it worked suprisingly well so I guess they managed to do something good. I died almost immediately from someone camping in a window but I at least gazed for a brief moment on the promised land.  Then we got this strange free roam game type with factions. I don't have any clue what it was called because I imagine my brain deeply repressed it into my subconcious to be forgotten. It was the best by far of the arma game types I played which puts it at about free flash game levels of quality but at least it was tolerable. Kinda I guess..... Well anyways you spawn on an island and you fight with your other faction members for control of the map. Its got stores and stuff to buy vehicles and guns but mostly you will be getting SNOIPED by people hiding in houses like rabid neck beards. I can't imagine these people having any fun sitting In houses hills or trees all ing day for that ONE KILL but for some reason in every game that uses this  arma engine(such as dayz) these people are all over the place. WTF is it about these games that draw in these campers? Is it because they get kicked out of or mocked for being noobs in every other decent fps? Yeah probably.... Lets go with that.  Then the final game type I played if you can even call it that. RP or atlas life or something who cares. Yeah I tried out a roleplay server because I figured it would be maybe like gmod dark rp where fun is always the most important part. ROFL you bet it wasn't fun! You start out as just a civilian but you can mine and make money! It is literally even more boring and more work then real mining so I promptly gave up on rp. At that point I would just get a real job mining because at least then I would make real money for my hard work. Yeah I wouldn't suggest you ever play this game even if your real life is more boring then working. I would personally reccommend you stare at a concrete wall and try to see shapes before I would tell anyone to play this game.-11
Terrible game Purchased the game on my new comp loggen in said i was Global Ban or something tried contacting steam and bhio'ARMA 3';-1;0
Arma 3I have only played this on the Sp campaign so far so my thoughta are based on this as a solo experience. This is a flipping JANKY (holy mother it is sooo janky) game first of all. i have seen more bugs than a red roof inn it seriously kindof playes like an early access release. The AI is soooo bad. which wouldnt be that big of a deal except you have to constantly micro manage a group of  through an active war zone of aim botted one shot kills. This is made somewhat better through mods but not really. i can say for certain that the SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN is NOT a military sim in any sense. It is a bad COD level story supplemented by an amazingly obtuse control scheme that makes this feel more like a typing simulater than any kind of military game.(Honestly i know people are going to crucify me for this but MGSV in all its rediculous story glory is about 1000x a more competant 'sim' than this) It is probably better in Multiplayer when you dont have to deal with the shokingly bad AI but it basically puts you through a bunch of bad story beats on par with the worst military action game but with flight sim controls. I am very VERY suprised at my reaction to this game so far. im hoping the excellent MOD community and hopefully good multiplayer community will change my opinion moving foreword. i want a good milsim that encourages smart tactics and careful controlled action. I hope i find that game in here soon.-10
Arma 3Poor Optimization...for the graphics card...  I have a i7-6700k with a closed loop liquid cooler HyperX 8GB Ram and an AMD R9 380. Yet I can't play this game with decent fps on medium settings...going lower makes it about 15fps...which is still unplayable.  Please Bohemia Interactive you need to optimize this game somehow... :'(-10
Arma 3Not good don't waste $40 on this game I can't get my money back because I afk'd for 2 hours because I didnt close the game. I regret this purchase.-10
Arma 3I payed 30 bucks for this game. The Apex DLC is $34. It isn't a new game and I refuse to pay again for a game I already own. Its made worse because many servers have switched to the new map which has carved the playerbase in half. The game is pretty poorly performing which is forgivable at 30 or 40 dollars but at full AAA game price I expect a stable platform and a more intuitive control set and UI. Bohemia seem to have ripped a page out of the EA handbook here only Battlefield Premium gives you 4 DLC with new maps vehicles and weapons. So until they axe the price to something respectable Bohemia can get ed ;)-11
Arma 3Before we start I want to note that I did not have any optimization issues with this game. (GTX 750 I3 6100 8GB DDR4)  Arma is a game that tries very hard in some aspects It tries hard to be gritty and realistic It tries hard to push hardware to the limit It tries hard to make the player feel like what they have bought is worth it.   Arma 3 contains a simple campaign with an uninteresting story that is simply there for solo players who want to go through structured missions. A lot of people slate call of duty and battlefield for having bad campaigns but my God the Arma 3 campaign is poor compared to any call of duty or bettlefield game I have played. The campaign is full of 2 Dimensional characters and it really takes some time to get going. I like the freedom the campaign gives but this brief freedom soon grows boring and stale.   Arma contains a variety of gamemodes on the multiplayer side Most just feel unstructured and boring. It is a very long and soul crushing task finding a decent server or let alone any server playing certain gamemodes like deathmach and it is an even longer task trying to force yourself to enjoy the game. The Role playing (Altis life ETC) servers in particular are extremely boring and you are SERIOUSLY better off playing garrys mod roleplay servers if you enjoy those gamemodes.   I GUARENTEE you will get more enjoyment on a darkRP server....   Arma 3 just feels like a waste of time I regret buying this game I wouldnt of bought it if I wasnt pushed into buying it by my friends who dont even play this anymore.  Arma 3 Play for 9 hours and then leave it alone. -11
Arma 3nice graphics good mechanics fun setting powerful real-time editor wide variety of things to do large modding community workshop support.  can't jump 1/10-11
How can a game of recent years have so bugs?;-1;1
The performance of this game does not match the recommended specs. It simply performs horribly.;-1;1
if you like a game full of bugs and major server lag then this game is for you! no matter how good your pc is do not expect anything above 30fps. This is another very poorly optimized pc game. Also its another one of those games that you HAVE to buy DLCs or you will not find anyone to play with.;-1;1
This review is part of the non-owned Apex expansion. Please purchase it to read this review;-1;1
Arma 3arma is good ill give it that but thats all ill give. The game is good runs smoothly and for the most aprt without any hiccups. There is only one thing i see wrong Price of dlc i mean seriously 30 something dollars for a couple of helis the community can make in five minutes? they do really need to rethink this whole marketing thing not all gamers are rich people-11
very bad optimization not recommanded;-1;0
This game is lacking lots of features that other popular RTS games like Call of Duty have and it also has hours of extremely boring gameplay. The helicopters dont even land right either with the engines always exploding I honestly can't stand playing this game for more than 30 minutes especially with how the multiplayer community is filled with little kids who can't even shoot a gun properly.;-1;0
Arma 3This game is a really clunky boring running simulator with a lot of pretentious self-important kids who wish they could've joined the army but had to settle for ordering people around in a video game for no reason. The controls are awful the graphics are mediocre and the gameplay is boring because there isn't any. It's mostly just a running sim.-10
Arma 3I bought this game when it was still in alpha and honestly I was pretty excited. It looked good and I was ready for more to come. Of course the only changes from alpha to release were very minor bug fixes. The rest of the game was released as ing DLC. Entire portions are currently locked away and sold as DLC this is entirely ing awful. The game even allows online interaction with people using DLC items that you cannot use because you do not have the DLC. Arma 2 was incredible and I have some amazing memories from that game but Bohemia has taken a HUGE step in the wrong direction and is turning into Ubisoft.  Don't waste a single ing penny on this piece of . Torrent it and the DLC so you can have the full product instead of a third for full price and then the rest for double.-10
Arma 3If you can find a server that works the that is rare if you can find a server with decent human beings then you have found a pot of gold. Then the servers ping will kick you and the applacation will screw up your PC untill you have to  it down manually because you cannot alt+tab out.-10
Arma 3Arma 3 is like a sandbox but instead of sand it's full of heavy rocks and sharp objects. The game runs poorly on most computers and is needlessly complex. Unless you want to read an encyclopedia's worth of information and install mods the online is dreadfully boring. However if you're willing to put anywhere between 2-10 hours learning how the game works and experimenting you can have a  of a fun. With the money you're spending there's no reason you should not give it that opportunity. Stop being lazy.10
waste of ing money;-1;0
Arma 3This game is one of the greatest multiplayer experience i ever had in a video game. Except one thing:  Performance of the game in multiplayer. It is terrible no matter what your specs are prepare to face 25-40 fps all the time in multiplayer. I'm glad that developer supporting this game through patches dlc etc. But i simply cannot enjoy a game when framerate is all over the place. Low framerate=biger input lag in a game when every second matters it is unnaceptable.   Besides bad performance it's a great milsim with focus on teamwork tactics etc.-10
Arma 3A great game from the start and later dying. The community is filled with quiet people with little to no communication.-10
Arma 3So the majority of players populate RPG servers like Atlis Life instead of servers that host military maps such as CTi Warfare. That is proof enough that the game is a massive failure for what it is intended.   IMO the failure is down to lack of content first and foremost. Lack of guns lack of everything  not even a BRDM ATGM or 'futuristic' equivilent that I feel is essential for any battlefield.... just one example nevermind the rest of the stuff that is missing.   Oh and charging relativelty big money for two helicopters and a flight model that nobody even asked for... Ridiculous. Operation Arrowhead/Resistance etc... cost just a little more and had massive content.   People bleat on (especially the stepford wives on the BIS forums) about 'supporting the devs' and buy the overpriced DLC. I bought the game therefore I am supporting the devs. If you want more money from me then release an OA style addon and not low content DLC BS.   What in gods name have the devs been doing all this time if these simple DLC packs are all they have to release? Every game since CWC has a major addon released within a year give or take a few months..... except Arma 3  And the weapon sway... By all means make the shooting mechanics unique and difficult to master (I dont want a COD clone here) But when I play I like to play CTI maps. That includes killing vast amounts of infantry. Before it was no problem. Now I have to play a stupid minigame everytime I want to line up my sights with a target meaning the game is impossibly long and infuriating. There is not even a server setting to customise the game for a particular game mode. WTF is that about? If you just put that in then that would make it a whole lot less tiresome for a lot of people.   I had high hopes for the game when I bought it but I just cannot recommend it. Buy Arma 2 and all the addons for very cheap and just play that. Arma 2 is a vastly superior game and that makes me very sad indeed.-10

Arma 3worst arma game in history. it feels more like COD or Battlefield due to when you run you can see your wepon on the screen. the graphics are amazing but the graphics dont make the game. the realism is there due to the new stamina system and in vehicles you need more than one person to make it effective but they really didn't do what they promised like putting the take on helicopters flight model in so the helis feel like VTOL planes when you fly really fast. i also dont like how it is set in the future because it cant be a simulation if it is in a era we have no clue about. and the weapons sound like your firing marsh mellows at people the 50. cal machine gun on the pickup trucks sound so quite when i fire a mounted gun i want to have the feeling that im shooting a 27mm gun with my hands not that im just firing another LMG. finally the NATO forces dont have any jets in the vanilla game but the OPFOR and indpendents do it should be the other way around and also the lack of planes helis and IFVs is terrible there should be more IFVs than tanks and thats not the case if i want to take a patrol out im not going to take 2 MBTs and a IFV im more likely to take a MBT and 2 IFVs im patroling not trying to take an airbase. those are the reasons you should not waste 60 dollers on arma 3.-10
Don't buy BI games. You will regret it.;-1;0
Arma 3This game is very poorly put together. Feels like the developers did a half-effort job putting it together and figured if a world existed well maybe mods can make it a playable game. 3 hours of playing it was enough for me. What a terrible 'game'.-10
3/5  I just don't have the stamina for this anymore.  Humble Time.;-1;0
Arma 3The worst game i played  On the highest settings 20FPS on the lowest 20FPS i dont know what i did wrong  i did FPS fix from youtube  it did something -10 FPS so from 20FPS i had 10FPS Bohemia interactive is good studio but they should finish their games  -10
Arma 3This game is ambitious. Probably too ambitious. And very BROKEN.  On 5960x @ 4.4 ghz 32 gb ram Crossfire 390's  it still runs like crap. And it freezes way too often. And when it freezes it freezes hard. Can't Alt-Tab Alt-F4 or Ctrl-Alt-Dlt out of it have to hard reset my computer.   I mean I can get 90 fps on single player but barely reach 60 fps multiplayer even when turning down the graphics. But the most frustrating part is the constant fps drops.   If it wasn't for the performance issues I would give a great review here because the game itself is pretty spectacular. It looks incredible still after 3 years.   Don't buy this game thinking 'Oh I'll just turn down the settings and deal with it' or 'Oh my rig is powerful enough I'll be fine' Because this game is broken it will probably never be fixed the engine itself needs a total overhaul.-10
Arma 3Could've been a much better game but the engine is way too bad. moving/shooting/aiming is delayed even on the client's computer and everything in it is just too laggy the same problems were in ArmA 2 and even though they saw everyone was complaining about ArmA 2's engine being bad.. they still made this game with the same engine but improved graphics.     worth trying yet not worth buying.-10
i liked it its just The FPS is so ed up though i have a Strong PC and a Strong Moniter that even supports G-Sync;-1;0

Wish I could tell you how this graphics looked at least. After almost 2 days downloading 13 gb's of files. I can't run this thing on a fresh install of Windows no matter what I set the parameters to.

Way to go...-11
Arma 3Optimize your  game Bohemia Interactive there is no reason I can play BF4 completely maxed at an average 80 FPS yet have issues running this game smoothly at all.-10
Arma 3This game is just a piece of crap it looks great but that's about it big multiplayer games over 80 player's lag's on nasa's super computer. This is one of the best combat shooter's on the market but this game need's a new engine as it run's off 32bit game engine this dramatically affect's multiplayer performance nothing in my knowledge can fix this.  This game is a piece of crap with more technical hours spent trying to adjust the settings or figuring out hey the server your trying to log out on is glitched that is why your gettng technical error's this game is crap.   Under no circumstance should you be trouble shooting a game more then you get to play it this is crazy stupid and I hate this game for being so techinically incapable of playing multiplayer game's which it was made to do is beyond my comprehension.  Why would bohemia release a multiplayer game that can accomidate 120 players so you can get 20 fps on Nasa's super computer in game is beyond my comprehension Bohemia is really out to lunch when they did this.  Let's be clear I can play this game in 4k ultra settings DSR with 60 fps in single player with an SSD hard drive. Soon as I hit the multiplayer with over 80 players to 120 kiss all that fps goodbuy.    It does have a lot of content but the game is poorly optimized hands down one of the worst optimized games in my life. Fps randomly drop's in the game for no reason at all no matter what settings you have it is server sided nothing you can do about this multiplayer game. The learning curve you need to play this game is astronimical becuase the bugs and glitch's are about 50 percent of your death. Falling off a stair case from 5 feet instant death unless you get revived.   Glitch's and mod's make this game the most technical to play I wouldn't even think of it as a competitive game for this reason.  The mod's in this game are extensive RPGSector controlking of the hill and many more.  RPG mod's are server sided and moderated by admin's you can banned from these mod's if you don't conform with each server's rule's and read them clearly this mod is filled with griefer's. Example your mining something for money you have ot mine it without getting shot then you have to proccess it without getting shot then you have to sell it without getting shot. Each of these distinations on the map are mile's away and if someone see's you mining they just camp the buyer untill you arrive then they engage in RPG but telling you to put your hands up while instantly shooting you.  King of the hill this is fun under 80 player's but over that lag lag lag. Also if you change your profile by 1 letter all your  get's deleted back to level one trying to get to level 60 against people with tanks and aircraft who have the xp to get the equipment. So griding if painful.  Wasteland on a populated server is a instant spawn kill but this can be fun if youu play on a low population server for your first time. This is like survial but guess what if someone doesn't kill you garunteed the glitch's will kill you.  DLC this game turned to  with the DLC you can't use the gun's on the DLC chopper's becuase you gotta pay say if you kill the last guy with you last clip in your gun making an epic run to him only to find you cant loot his gun because it's DLC so your hooped unless you pay.   The DLC's are in the game you cannot take them out this is forced payment to its costumer's who only wanna use what is in front of them.   This game pisses me off after all the hour's I put into it trying to figure out bug's and glitch's only to avoid them  Literally hundred's of anooying one's and guess what you think you learned them all  go play another game and see how much you remember.   Overall if the game kills you with bugs and glitch's 50 percent of the time or you find yourself being spawned killed in wasteland or banned off and RPG server after hundred's of hours of gameplay I would say stay away from this game if you hate technical problem's and techinical game's this is hand's down the worst game for it.   One good thing about this game it looks the best in 4k out of all the game's in the planet this game show's off 4k like no other enabling this give you a clearer shoot in the distance as it has more pixel's per square inch but only in monitors over 36 inche's.  DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME TO RUN SMOOTHLY AND PREPARE FOR THE GRIEF AND THE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS AND THE  DLC.   I have not listed all of the problem's but I hope this help's with my honest opinion I love this game but the grief that comes with it is unberable at time's and the amount of money you need to build your computer to make it run at an ok level is nothing less then stupid and pointless.-10
It's fun when you start playing for the first 10 to 15 hours but then it gets repetitive and if you don't play with friends it gets incredibly boring and its even worst if you dont fully know what you are doing.;-1;0

Arma 3+ Great single-player missions. Realistic combat.  - No co-op in compaign in standard game.  Shame on DLC's price. Played random online game I respawn at a fence-captured area and wait for 15 mins but no  happend. Other players were moving around inside the area. Joined another match it was saying in programming language words way that something is missing.  Summary: Elementary level online military game with Dr. Degree single-player..  Advice: Buy it If you find it cheaper than 5 double size Mc burgers. Oh and stop laughing!-10
Runs like absolute garbage - seriously - look up benchmarks - everyone loves to say this game is cpu bound - look at benchmarks of server cpus - this game runs like hell  I have dual 970's and a i7 3770k clocked at 4.2 and can't get 60 fps;-1;0

Arma 3There's a famous World War I quote that says warfare is 'Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme terror.' Replace 'terror' with 'frustration' and this game does indeed give you the True Combat experience written on the tin.  From the description and tutorial missions I was expecting a military simulation with experiences like 'The commander ordered my squad over the radio to go to grid point 134-190 and hold the bridge so we mounted up in an APC and fought out way there to hold the line against the enemy advance.' Basically I expected a much deeper and more realistic version of Battlefield -- like the Falcon 3.0 and Gunship 2000 military sims I played when I was a teenager but with infantry and tanks and tactics and whatnot.  What I got is... nothing like that.  The single-player is more like what I would call a 'walking forward simulator.' Seriously my left middle finger started going numb from holding down W while following the squad leader character across a field for 15 minutes while only encountering two enemies. Of course when I DID encounter enemies I tended to get shot in the head pretty quickly because the AI can see right through the oh-so-realistic scrub brush that covers the landscape whereas all I could see was the tangle of bushes in front of my face with a big red 'TARGET' box floating in the middle of them. Then the squad leader guy stepped on a landmine (the only one in the world apparently -- of all the luck!) and I started following some other guys across another field for even longer only this time with an ambush of several lethal bushes a few minutes out from the save point.  After snoozing my way all across the field and then getting killed in the same spot about a dozen times I thought 'Okay maybe the real draw here is the realistic chain-of-command combined arms multiplayer scenarios let me try that.' So I popped into multiplayer... and didn't see any of that either.   There were scads of 'RPG' servers where I could play as a random villager AKA playing Walking Foward Simulator toward the corn field at the edge of town and trying to earn a bit of money to buy food at the market and not starve. True combat gameplay right?  There were 'Wasteland' servers where you spawn in the middle of the continent somewhere with nobody around and only a vague suggestion of what you'r supposed to be doing ('fortify a base gather supplies and hoard them') and of course a half-hour walk to the nearest point of interest. I wandered around the airport for 10 minutes looking for supplies or a vehicle found nothing shrugged and disconnected.  There were also 'King of the Hill' servers which at least featured combat. Well actually they mostly featured waiting for helicopters to respawn. The objective was to go from my team's base to occupy a town about 1.5 kilometers away which equated to a half-hour walk a ten-minute drive (assuming you didn't run over a bush which would pop your tire and then it's back to the half-hour walk) or a one-minute helicopter ride. So helicopter was the obvious choice but those only spawn every few minutes. Half the time some jerk would crash his truck into the helicopter and destroy it so we'd have to wait again. On the occasions I actually got to the airspace over the town I would jump out of the helicopter open my parachute and generally be shot to death while dangling in the air. The one time I parachuted out early and walked for a minute to get to the town I survived for a good while sneaking into the town but didn't run into any enemies to fight... eventually I got bored of that and ran to a tower to see if I could snipe people from the top but as soon as I peeked out over the railing I got shot in the head.  So was it realistic? You bet. Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme frustration. Was it fun? Not really. I had a lot more fun playing LUFTRAUSERS while waiting for it to download. Overall a colossal disappointment. I'm so glad it was a 'free trial weekend' -- I would have cried tears of rage if I had actually paid for this thing.-11
Arma 3The DLC policy of todays game developers is the worst possible thing that might ever come.   Arma 3 has limited content but guess what? If you pay extra you get extra content. Why sell full game once when you can divide it into pieces and sell in parts?  I do not recommend.-10
Good Game. Game Good. Price-Not good. Dont buy it yet.;-1;0
Arma 3Over-priced Over-hyped Lacking in content - NOT WORTH IT. The developers re-use broken code from their earlier hits like Arma 2 Arma 1 Operation Flashpoint etc from 2001. The netcode is a DISASTER! Servers can barely handle more than 50 people and even then it's super laggy rubber-banding and warping all over the place. The developers are now beginning to start releasing over-priced DLCs - 1. because they were too lazy to release the same content WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE ANYWAY in the game initial release 2. without fixing the basic game typical money-grabbing tactic.-10
If your looking for a Good Mil Sim game then I suggest sticking with Arma2..Arma3 has seemed to have turned into a Role Playing game much like world of warcraft...mil sim servers are few and far between altis life dayz and the other role play aspects of arma3 have destroyed what the Arma series was meant to be..but I suppose BI needs to appeal to the masses. Its a well executed game..needs some tweaking but I am sure BI will update just as they did in Arma 2..just dont expect too much in the way of mil sim for what your going to pay for arma 3. Would I recommend this game? Depends..for someone who likes to role play like dayz and life games sure..but for anyone expecting what Arma 2 was..dont bother.;-1;0
this is a good game but it is so ing bad its just horrible falling out of buildings cant aim and walk out a door way sometimes you will just randomly died will just say you died its just a ing  take dont buy.;-1;0
Arma 3Its a simulation but the AI is trash so that leaves you playing with other players. Unfortunately people as a group are absurdly uncoordinated the only exception to this is when they have leadership. My generation the one after me and apparently the one before me (if voice-chat is any indicator) are the COD generations This means they do not respond to authority or leadership well. For the groups of friends who join a server squad up and play like a team I truly commend you. To the brainless swarms who waste days upon days of time accruing fake money on wasteland servers venturing out into competetive servers only to hop into and immediately crash the helicopter... **** you. If youre lucky enough to have a group of 20 or so friends to play a game of ZEUS with the game can really shine failing that.... Just download a wasteland mod and pretend to be a lone wolf internet badass because thats the future of this game.-10
Arma 3There's a famous World War I quote that says warfare is 'Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme terror.' Replace 'terror' with 'frustration' and this game does indeed give you the True Combat experience written on the tin.  From the description and tutorial missions I was expecting a military simulation with experiences like 'The commander ordered my squad over the radio to go to grid point 134-190 and hold the bridge so we mounted up in an APC and fought out way there to hold the line against the enemy advance.' Basically I expected a much deeper and more realistic version of Battlefield -- like the Falcon 3.0 and Gunship 2000 military sims I played when I was a teenager but with infantry and tanks and tactics and whatnot.  What I got is... nothing like that.  The single-player is more like what I would call a 'walking forward simulator.' Seriously my left middle finger started going numb from holding down W while following the squad leader character across a field for 15 minutes while only encountering two enemies. Of course when I DID encounter enemies I tended to get shot in the head pretty quickly because the AI can see right through the oh-so-realistic scrub brush that covers the landscape whereas all I could see was the tangle of bushes in front of my face with a big red 'TARGET' box floating in the middle of them. Then the squad leader guy stepped on a landmine (the only one in the world apparently -- of all the luck!) and I started following some other guys across another field for even longer only this time with an ambush of several lethal bushes a few minutes out from the save point.  After snoozing my way all across the field and then getting killed in the same spot about a dozen times I thought 'Okay maybe the real draw here is the realistic chain-of-command combined arms multiplayer scenarios let me try that.' So I popped into multiplayer... and didn't see any of that either.   There were scads of 'RPG' servers where I could play as a random villager AKA playing Walking Foward Simulator toward the corn field at the edge of town and trying to earn a bit of money to buy food at the market and not starve.

GTX 970 OC + i7 4790K OC get no more than 40FPS on reccommended settings  this is enjoy;-1;0
this game is cool! dont get me wrong but the fps are bad and the laggs are bad to and i got 90k ^^ if someone wants to play this game buy squad! more fps and u get more action   ps: altis life is total  only apex!;-1;0
Arma 3You need all the DLCs or at least APEX DLC to be able to actually play arma 3 because the servers require the last DLC. You basically have to pay much more to be able to play. Hardly you'll find servers that dont require you to have APEX DLC. So instead of 35 Euros for the game you gotta pay 60Euros. Enjoy.  by the way they didnt fix their fps drops problems yet and they probably wont.-10
Arma 3SP or anything that isnt a mod is a no go wish i could have given my cash to a few mod devs instead! If you do have it you should definately get the Breaking Point mod plays better than the rest of the game.  *Update as of 1/13/15* Still a better flight sim than a tactical shooter by far...-10
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. THIS GAME HAS BEEN GOING DOWNHILL EVER SINCE IT CAME OUT OF BETA AND IS STILL BARELY EVEN PLAYABLE.;-1;0
Arma 3A game that only exists because of a mod that hardly works for a game that also hardly works This game also hardly works. Overloads most routers-10
Not worth buying it. Runs like crap even with better Systems as Recommandet.   Sry. BI but u ed it up again and after 2 years now its still a bloody mess...;-1;0
the multiplayer is awesome but laggy as hell. the Singleplayer is the worse ever...the NPC as dumb as  not helping at all and CSAT just got billions of soldiers. For me as a beginner it is just rubbish...they give you tasks and you have absolutlty NOW in idea what you have to do.;-1;1
hard to start playing;-1;0
Arma 3DO NOT BUY THIS ABISMAL ATTEMPT AT A GAME! It is by far the buggiest crappiest attempt at a game ive ever come across theres pre-release software on steam that works better you have been warned!-10

Arma 3This game was nothing like I expected it to be. When I purchased this game I believed I was getting a military simulator that was nicely polished contained a good backstory a good multiplayer and a nicely explained tutorial considering the price of $69.99 I paid for it. I was completly wrong.  Backstory: One of the most ridiculous things about this game is that it claims to be a military simulator. I can tell you it's not even close. First off it takes place in the future not a couple years but far in the future. So far in the future where for some reason todays weapons no longer exsists. Yes that's right there are no M4's Scar's HKs Ak's ACR's etc in this game. Just this shows how this game fails. How can you claim to be a military simulator and not even include weapons that our forces use around the world to not be in this game. And even the weapons that they do include are very limited. I'm talking like maybe 20 weapons. That's just one example. I could go on about how just sticking a needle or wrapping a bandage on your teammate revives them or how the campaign doesn't make any sense but lets just move on.   Controls: The controls are the most confusing thing I've ever had to use. The placement of them are confusing and hard to remember. I tried changing them but instead of swapping them it just tells you that the key is already being used so then you have to figure what key is already using that. That wouldn't be so hard if it wasn't for the fact that there are like 100's of different key combinations.  Tutorial: Honestly why is it even here? It is so bad I can't understand it. It does nothing to explain the confusing controls as mentioned above. Instead the majority of it will have you run around to points yes run around. And I'm not over exaggerating that either. It's like the developers couldn't even start on how to explain everything so they decided to teach you common knowledge that you would already know from any other FPS like how to run walk move your screen etc. Even when it did get into something useful like using the map it still wasn't even properly explained.  Movement: I figured that movement and aiming would be different from other FPS games. But come on the movement is so sluggish on this game. Aiming is the same way. Everything feels so cumbersome especially with the funky key placement. Maybe eventually I would get used to it but it truely destroys any immersion that game could have.  Graphics/Optimization: First off graphics don't make a game but they certainly help with immersion. And the graphics were ok at first but then I realized that it was eating my computer resources that I had to scale everything back. Even at poor graphic setting I still had a low framerate issue. That is truely unbelievable considering the graphics are disgusting at this level yet at the same time I can manage high-ultra settings on Battlefield 4 at 60 FPS. So the game just fails so hard here and really this shows that no effort was put into optimization. I mean come on Rust has better optimization and that game is indie and still in early access.  Multiplayer: So this is supposed to be Arma's big thing. Yet I hated this more than anything else. I constantly had to look up servers to join. If I found a server it would launch the game load the server load everything in and then tell me that I was kicked and I need to reserve a spot at some stupid website. When I finally get into a server that you don't need to be whitelisted or reserve a spot I still had problems. There're no explainations on what to do and the community just expects you to know everything. I litterally kept getting 'hit Alt + F4' or 'call an admin' to my questions from other players. When I did figure things out on my own it seems like I can never do anything. On king of the hill gamemode I would have to travel miles to get into the battlefield. Sometimes I was luckily enough to get in a helicopter. Of course as soon as I got out I would get killed instantly by players who have a ton of money and can buy the best weapons. Then I tried alatis life and I would just keep spawning on a stupid small island with no way to get to the mainland with no explaintion on what to do. And Arma life you can't even join without paying a monthly payment. That's where I gave up on multiplayer litterally a true disappointment just alot of confusion and time wasted.  Overall from what I learned: It seems that these developers are those type of people that rush a unfinished game with loads of issues and expect the community to mod it to be playable. So if this game was $10 that might be acceptable depending on certain conditions. But I litterally paid $69.99 for this game and expect nothing less the AAA quality. I got none of that. I had to check and see if this game was still in early development but nope it was released OVER 3 YEARS AGO. Seriously I can't imagine what it was like when it came out. And I'm not a very critical person I usually enjoy most video games. And I really wanted to like this game but from the limited weapons confusing controls and a letdown of a multiplayer I just couldn't do it. I gave it two chances and if I played this game any longer then I couldn't get a refund. And I have NEVER made a refund for any of my games before. But this this is unacceptable and I am getting a refund for this game right away.  Edit: I forgot to add that the A.I. is incredibly stupid when it comes to custom missions released by the community. Another reason why this game was a big let down. Also if you think any of this review is just me ranting then you can buy the game and see for yourself. As long as you don't go over 2 hours or so of gameplay then you should be able to get a refund. Edit #2: Don't take my word of the refund though do it at your own risk because I don't know how steam desides whether or not you're eligible for a refund. In this case I was may not be the same for you.-10

Arma 3'failed to start' (no license)  really??? I have 10 hours left to play this game for a test run and cant play it?!?!?-10

Arma 3horrible worst 40$ i have ever spent in my life!! never getting my money back...smh. first of all the game itself didn't work when i went into campaign mode. it froze on basic training mode right at the beginning and game me a white screen with building like blocks And second when i tried downloading the 'arma 3: exile mode' (that was supposed to be like DAYZ but better) didnt even load into a server. kept telling me that i need to delete or find the missing keys or some ! the whole reason i spent $40 was to play the ing exile mod! and that doesnt even work smh so now happy. if anyone can help me out and tell me what to do to play exile that would be greatly appreciated. thank you-10
Arma 3I was half way into a mission. Driving a truck. I was told to stop at a check point. I don't know how to stop so I hit the 'S' key. Apparently that's reverse. I was still moving forward but the INSTANT I hit the S key the truck changed from going forward to going backwards about a foot which defies physics a bit and it said I failed the mission for failing to follow orders (I guess going backwards 1 foot instead of 'stopping' at checkpoint). Have to start the whole mission over. Not sure if I'll play the game anymore.-10
Arma 3This game is cancer.  First off you have to buy additional DLC's to play it. Second off you have to download twice as much mods for the game to work properly. When you download the mods the game is heavy ~50gb After you install the mods its pain in the  to connect to the actual server After you connect you get a game crash/servers have bad connection/ no people playing When you actually connect to a game server the game lags as hell and with a new computer you have to play with a settings to actually have fps drops only to 60 fps.  If you dont mind any of these above the game is fun.-10
Arma 3If you expect to run this game at good framerates on nvidia cards it is more than likely you will be tweaking the settings to almost nothing before getting at least 30FPS in campaign matches!-10
Arma 3REVIEW FOR 'WIN' CAMPAIGN EPISODE  This Campaign Episode was unfortunatly shorter than the rest I finished it in 3 Hours and 24 Minutes. While throughout the short time you are presented with Interesting Scenarios and Action Sequences These are overshadowed by Short Length and a Lackluster Ending. I guess we're waiting for ArmA 4 to continue this story.  + Action Packed and Well Acted and Scripted + Update has Improved and Added Features - Unacceptably short length - Lackluster Ending-10

Arma 3  I played the free trial period for the weekend when the game was put on sale. I'm glad it was a free trial period. The first thing I personally didn't like was the time that this is supposed to be taking place. I'm sure that twenty years from now the weapons systems aircraft gear etc. will be more advanced than those portrayed in the game. The game's weapons systems gear etc. are obselete and are the currently utilitzed systems. Why not have the game take place in a more recent time?  Secondly I wasn't too impressed with the movement especially for vehicles. Seemed 'clunky' and a little old-school. I tried that mouse maneuvering of a vehicle which wasn't much better. I'm sure it would take practice but my initial impressions weren't what I expected from a game that seems to receive a good rating.  Lastly even though I palyed through the 'tutuorial' there was still way too much guessing involved as to what keys or combination of keys were required to do whatever it was that needed to get done. Many of which could have been easily implemented into the tutorial so you could start off playing the game and know what keys do what. Very frustrating to say the least.  However I like the idea of the game and the open environment. The graphics aren't the best but certainly acceptable. Sure I only played this game for a few hours but my first impressions didn't live up to the expectations I thought I would see with a game rated the way it is. This in my own opinion is a game that should be on the $10 clearance rack at Walmart. Thank you for the free trial but I'm going to pass on this one.-10
 this game  my life im killing myself! ps this game always freezes!  *died*;-1;0
Arma 3Game can be fun But after DLC still 20FPS online in the game sucks... The engine is too limited and relies heavy on CPU witch is ing stupid because people spend $1000 for GPUs Really hope they get their  together for Arma4 do not make it rely on a CPU. I feel like my 970 is a $350 paper weight playing this game.  Refined explanation: AMD 8320oc 4.1ghz with 16gb ram and GTX 970ftw+ EVGA Super Nova 750. Runs horrible online with  fps. On everything but breaking point and altis life. There is also a memory leak in the game that has not been fixed in over a year.-10
Arma 3DONT BUY THIS GAME!  Now i have your attention.  Not optimized unless you have a really good pc at best i get 70 - 80 fps with my GTX 960 and I7 6700K at medium.  It is either this or Squad if you want a realistic shooter there differences in gameplay See more about that here:  {LINK REMOVED}  https://goo.gl/09Euwc  (NOT MY VIDEO)   And there are alot of other gamemodes. Fx: Altis Life Battle Royale Zeus Apex (DLC Bought) DayZ Mods and more.  Optimization is bad but gameplay is good and modding is good.  6/10-10
Game is Trash. Cant do something as simple as play a regular coop mission ever since update. 1 out 10;-1;0
Arma 3Playing on gtx 970 and i7-4790k and this game always finds a way to crash or bug. (Also i am not playing at maxed out settings but on medium)-10
Arma 3Really wished i could recommend this but i can't. I've been on the ArmA train since Operation Flashpoints release and while ArmA II had a few things to wish for ArmA 3 feels like a neverending Open Beta. The AI is godawfully dumb unable to perform the simplest tasks without messing entirely up the map itself is about as bland and boring as it can get the 2035 theme is new but equally useless since most weapons and the entire scenario feel randomly thrown together with a few real life references.  Long story short awful optimization looks awful feels bad leaves a LOT to wish for and it feels like the Community that once made Flashpoint the amazing thing it was has grown tired. Modding teams vanished with noone to replace them most missions are coop with no care for atmospheric SP missions as it was with OFP... all in all it is far more of a techdemo than an actual game.-10
dont buy this game really if you dont have a awesome gaming computer i have  cpu: amd fx 6300 gpu: r9 270x ram: 2x4 1600 and i get in this game 30 fps at all low and 1600x900 in System Requirements recommened it reads  Processor: Intel Core i5-2300 or AMD Phenom II X4 940 or better  Memory: 4 GB RAM  Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 or AMD Radeon HD 7750 with 1 GB VRAM or better   if your specs are lower do not buy this  game you need in mulitiplayer  at least  intel core i7 4790k and gtx 970;-1;0
Arma 3Played this over a free access weekend I have a high-end gaming rig so no problems there - liked what I saw.  I really wanted this game but decided to do some research before I pulled the trigger.  I really wanted a game that would let me play with modern vehicles. I couldn't wait to jump in an Abrams or Apache or a Leopard 2 or a T-90... or jump in a Tunguska to try and shoot down a A-10.  I had visions of massive armored battles with supporting infantry artillery and drones oh my! All with badass graphics and realism only a simulator can give - beyond the laughable dumbed down versions found in the likes of Battlefield and CoD.  THEN I came across screenshots of what initally looked like a Russian Mi-28 Havoc (Sweet!) With... the dual contra-rotating main rotor blades of a Ka-50 Hokum?!  Apparently Arma III much vaunted 'hardcore military simulator' doesn't even have real-world vehicles in it.  Fantasy island nations with ficitious governments to battle in I can handle. Completely made-up armored vehicles tanks and helicopters in a supposed high-end military 'simulator'?  No Thanks.-10
Arma 3This game is a waste of money.... It's the buggiest game I ever played sounds are late like Mexican movie... Player gets tired like he has a hangover and the AI its on speed its almost impossible to catch up... Man just don't buy this game I wasted 40 bucks on this terrible game....-10

Arma 3Do Not Buy this game  If you're in to getting a half finished game of which half of the items require a second purchase of DLC then this game is perfect for you if not then you may want to avoid this game. It is inevitable that more and more of what should have been in the original game will be charged for.   Some basic visuals such as the way roads link together are still not fixed along with some vehicles having animations which result in a poorer gameplay experience. If you backed them during the Alpha you will have been completely ripped off by this company and even if you did not you will be in some form. The game is still playable without the DLC but guns and helicopters should have definitely been included in the price especially for the people who have backed the company from the start.   You will find that unlike arma 2 servers are already starting to die down with great numbers of servers being taken down due to insufficient funding. Arma 2 servers never had this issue due to the large number of players on servers and the replayability of the game yes I have a lot of hours on this game however it does not make up for the fact that it is meerely designed to squeeze money out of you. I refuse to pay for DLC which is not fairly priced for their supporters. Companies such as this one should re-evaluate their stance to the market before the PC Gaming community heavily turn against companies proposing to release large amounts of DLC. This has already been demonstrated by fans of the upcoming title 'Total War: Warhammer' where thousands disliked a video of a planned DLC in order to get their point across.   Companies will continue to take the P*ss until we take a stand against them.   -10
 this game unreal how you always die and there is nothing to do;-1;0
 hard game...;-1;0
runs like a piece of  thats been dragged through the fattest mans ;-1;0
Arma 3Don't be deceived by the trailers Arma 3 gives you the impression its a more tactical Battlefield shooter. It is that by all means but it's centered around the tactical aspect. Missions can take up to 3 hours to complete and just the training is enough to throw a seasoned shooter off. Training will have you snipping targets with an assault riffle. I get that most ex soldiers in the US today enjoy this game because it's very similar to real life hostile engagements but I honestly felt like I was having to camp like I see bad players doing in Call of Duty. More power to you if that's what you like to do but I for one enjoy Halo Gears of War Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon. So I didn't get that close ranged tactical cover to cover neck snapping stealth urge I needed satisfied. I don't recommend this game quite simply because the type of game it is not so much it being bad because it's surely not a bad game. I play Warframe way too much so I wanted something a bit slower and more tactical. This game seems to be nothing but that. Too much so for me. Just download and try it. The first 40 minutes should give you enough to decide rather or not its for you.-10
Arma 3omg noob game no cod players no need mam's camera cant 360 and no mlg player s talking about teamwork and . 10/10 i liked it-11
Bohemia should just give up;-1;1
Do not waste your money on this game. too many glitches and you need a super computer to run it. plus the controls are way to messed up this game is a BROKE game;-1;1
Arma 3If you enjoy walking this game is for you. If you feel like wasting time and effort this game is for you. By far the most unfriendly FPS game in the history of FPS. I have more fun spinning quarters than this game. This game is just too much going on for an fps game. For example it takes 3 or 4 commands to choose weapons change optics and its not very reposive. If you want an FPS game with the momentum of watching paint dry this game is it. Its not fast paced. I know its a simulation.   If they can make a simple FPS simulation game with the feel of battlefield or bad company 2 it would be so much easier. Honestly. Its just damn too slow. This game caters to smaller more simulated kind of community. Its not for gamers who play fast paced shooters. Its just ridiculous how slow things are.   Good luck finding an enemy. I only see team mates at spawn doing asbolutely nothing. And for the creators seriously don't mask the fact that this game is for EVERYONE. Its not. I was conned into thinking this game is relative to other shooters but on a big big scale.   I can't stand this 1999 interface. Too many clicks for radio commands too many clicks to change weapons. Hud sucks I want faster faster faster more reponsive interface. Its too much going on for such little thing. Just make things easier man. Single player is ehhh I wanted to play the multi. Looks good.   And anything you see on youtube those players they just are so involved the average gamer/player is not going to have that kind of game play. Too many options when all you have to do is make it simple.   JUST KEEP THE DAMN GAME SIMPLE MAN stop with the X CROUCH Z PRONE BS or if its the other way keep it one button for all and who the hell still uses the number pad enter button to change camera views. Your interface bindings should be universal.   Visualy this game is nice looking. But everything else just forget it. I love simulations games and it does not have to be so complex.-11
Arma 3fist $60 game I ever wanted to undownload. It remined me of E.T. on the atari but E.T. was better. negative 1337/420 would uninstall again-11
terrible optimization;-1;1
Its okay...... Campaign... its okay...... multiplayer....... well........ i guess its okay....... game in general........... let me think......... its okay........ I recommend Arma 2 and OA Thats a good game..... Thanks for reading.... bye i guess.......         I SAID BYE NOW LEAVE!;-1;1
Arma 3Software is buggy I'll get stuck between water and land and have to restart the level. Also I can do 2 direct head shots and nothing happens but the character can take a single hit anywhere and die; this is on novice. If I take a differnt path the level gets hung and nothing will progress unless the level....again has to be restarted. My team members will have super human powers and they take off leaving me in the dust while my character never recovers from exhaustion. I understand they try to make this a realistic as possible to being a foot soldier but I spend most of the time 'walking' from one end of the map and back. I wish they did more R&amp;D before releasing this and spent more on combat; I wish I could have my $ back.-10
Arma 3Bought the game ran it for about 15 minutes and then requested a refund. Why? Because even with me having the recommended specs (gtx 660 2gb i7 860 2.8ghz and 8gb ram) I got a annoying 20 fps on everything set on lowest (Reselution scale on 50%). Sure the game might be fun but I hate that they lie about that the RECOMMENDED specs are gtx 660 2gb 6gb ram and i5 4460 which I basically have! DO NOT BUY if you have about the same specs as me or even lower. Only buy if you have a gtx 900 series or amd r[-] 300 series graphics card or better and the recommended cpu and ram or better.-11
Arma 3This game is a waste of $60 Bad Graphics barely any multiplayer firefights (which is why i bought this game). I could relate this game to GTA 5 because a good percent of the players play RPG servers and you go around like feel life. I thought this game would be sorta like Battle Field 4 but nope it did not meet any of my expectaions. 2/10 stars-11
Arma 3If you have a Extremely high end pc i advice you to get it But if your running a Gtx 970 or anything below it runs like . like seriously.-10
44839;-1;0
Arma 3Wish I could get a refund it crashes everytime I try to play. Even after following guides to fix all the problems I even factory reset my computer twice and asked support for help. Yet nothing.  GG.  Maybe stop breaking the game with every update it'd be nice.-10
Arma 3Such a great military simulator you can't turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... A Z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be StarCraft. I don't play an FPS to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. Don't buy this game. For a strategy game there's only horribly-done strategy elements and for an FPS there's horribly done FPS elements in it. For squads and commanders buy Battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter this game is just bad.-10
multiplayer is a broken mess!;-1;0
the game is supper glichy;-1;0
Arma 3waste of freaking money. the game runs like crap the aiming freaking sucks and theres freaking invisible enemies that can kill you even though yoju cant see them. worst game ever i regret buying this piece of crap!-10
Arma 3Very realistic but doesn't run multiplayer at high frames.-10
i7/16g memory everything on low or turned off - MAX 20fps. Nuff said.;-1;0
Arma 3If u gonna buy this  buy everything. All the DLC's etc. Because I bought the vanilla game and thought i was gonna play some multiplayer but u cant use the quick join function. Because the game searches for DLC servers.. WTF man.-10
Arma 3HOW TO KILL TANKS THE SIMULATION WAY: Walk against them and they will flip.  The game where you can't even play the tutorial mission because of broken scripts (restarted 3 times the third time my character even had a different voice)  Want a game where you can survive more headshots than in Call of Duty? Then this game is for you. It's the future. Your helicopter can actually land on enemy soldiers without them seeing it! That's the stealth we need. Enemy AI only shoots you since it knows the game is won for them then.   What's the difference between glass windows and mountains? We will never know. AI will shoot right through it. Oh well you can't kill them trough glass windows! Just like in real life.   This is actually the least realistic game I have ever played in my whole life. But no one plays it for it's military aspects anyway - Arma 3 Altis Life is where all the players sit. (because this military sim is oh-so-realistic.)  Fanbase in this game or should I say fanboys are incapable of understanding what this game is supposed to be anyway. Do you believe all the 12 year old veterans? Hell yeah.   I do like the fact that this game has an editor even if it's quite horrible compared to the other games featuring an editor.  The developer also doesn't care anything about this game. My tank literally explodes from driving against a fence at 5 kp/h. Just like in real life!   The other only positive aspect I can think of are the graphics which are very nice. And no my friends the graphics aren't badly optimized it's the scripts which basically are the only things that this game has.  1/10. Can't rate it better for what it's supposed to be especially not when compared to other games.-10
Arma 3If you wanna play life RPG's this is the game. There are rarely servers for TDM LMS CTF or control. Its not even war. All of the servers are life RPG's. I was expecting way more out of this game. A WASTE OF $40..... Money back would be much appreciated... If this company has any heart..-10
Not worth the price. Not even close. Do not buy this game. Especially if you don't have an organized group to play with.;-1;0
Arma 3BUGS BUGS AND MORE BUGS CANT EVEN LOAD THE CAMPAIGN WITHOUT IT CRASHING. Quite annoyed as i played about 7 hours before the bugs hit me and i cant get a refund.-10
Arma 3Extreme lag needs optimization would not recommend to anyone that can only run minecraft on their computer like me-10
Arma 3i loved the game even tho i suck at it but its not optimized i see fish swimming on land water physics floating on land and the fact i payed 250$ CAD on my headset (7.1 suround sound) and i still cant tell where ppl are shooting from or where footsteps are coming from. AND the fact i have a grphix card thats in the recrierment(cant spell) i cant these damn memory log crashes where my momory cant read the info. i think i got a good modded computer where i can play Fallout 4 in ultra setting minus motion blur but still be able to tell where a bandit is shooting from other than that my settings are MAXED (solid 45fps) and no memory issues at all this game needs more updating i keep crashing cuz of these memory dumps that couldnt be read by my computer. it doesnt stop there it crashes in single player mode and online and the crash reports basiclly told me to update/downgrade my GPU...... OR go to another server. base line if ppl want my opinion if you got mid-line GPU its not worth the price tag these guy need to work on bug fixes big time.-10
this is a great game at its core but horrible optimization and bad players ruins it.;-1;0
Arma 3I'm going to be short on this one. The game is great not a little it is really great. But I am giving it a negative review for I cannot play it properly for a very simple reason: I cannot stand its gunshot sounds. I am not whining over this the thing is that I have an ear sensibility and I cannot stand high pitched sounds period. For me Arma 2 sounds are totally fine I know that people in general gave Arma 2 sounds a bad rating for me they are ok. There are other people over the internet who complain over this gunshot sound issue they are simply too loud. I know that in real life they sound exactly how they sound in Arma 3 but in real life one also wears headphones to muffle the real gunshot sound so no I do not need real gunshot sound in a game (considering that I use headphones for playing) I care for my ear health. I sent a support ticket to Bohemia: maybe they can add a slider for gunshot sound maybe they can add an option to disable this very high sound dynamic range I don't know if they can/want to do this. I was on the verge of buying the Apex expansion but I stopped because of this issue. If they don't do anything then unfortunately I have to stay with Arma 2 or other arcade shooters what can I do. I am really looking forward for the devs to come up with a solution for this issue. If they do then I will change this review.-10
Arma 3Runs like sh*t dont even try playing multiplayer it dosent work for shiz nig refresh is broken cant join a friends game through steam.-10
Arma 3well doneold campaign saves not workingthx .....not buying apex *thumbs up* in more than 20 years wall glitch still possiblewowwell done as wellsorry im done with you behomia! You are just ing kidding and mess around with players Hall had reasons to leave and im quiet confident why... Dayz was a ripp offlike the whole seriesim really sorry to say thatbut i was a big fan ....flashpoint(the raly first one) flashed me so hard and thats you behave over years of loyality.... im done.....im so mad-10
Arma 3Bohemia Interactive jumping on the futuristic shooter ban wagon if they'd stuck to current millitary equipment this would probably be a well deserved chapter of the series but instead if you want that experience you have to mod it also who charges £10.99 for DLC that should have been in the original release as the base vehicles and weapons are shocking. Stick to Arma 2 if you wanna save money.-10
Arma 3All server with big ammount of players and good pings are locked. Every server is run by someone else so u have to register and ask for permision to play on 10 different forums. On KOTH I spend 20 minutes to get to the battle and then I die within few minutes Game graphics lacks of colour intensity Everything looks grey. Vehicle engine sound is incredibly bad.   The biggest problem are the servers. If u dont add some official servers in Arma 4 I will not be buying it.-10
Arma 3Really poor feels like your constantly playing a beta game. Lags like crazy.-10
train simulator with tanks and youll be teamkilled more than you encounter an enemy.;-1;0
Arma 3Uses OFP engine from 10 years ago. Recommends GTX 560 I have 580 and NEVER get more than 20 fps no matter what my settings are. This game was made by dirty slavaboo gopniks who have no ing clue what they're doing.-10
INVALED SCREEN HELP ME PLS.;-1;0
Arma 3So I bought this game on the summer sale it looks really hard in the trailers and in the gamplay reviews but the controles are really messed up and its hard to do anything in the game. I think that when they make arma 4 they should put in normal controles and less controles like E should do more then just one thing. I really think that arma 4 should be a little less hardcore and more user friendly.  thanks-10
Not Fun &amp; setting up controls was almost enough stopping playing instantaneously;-1;0
Absolute garbage. Complete Alpha Crap. Buggy as all . 2/10;-1;0
This game is totaly waste of money for amd owners.  Getting too low fps with poor cpu - gpu usage.   Fps around 15-30 with high settings and it's dramaticly same with low settings too.  Not optimized for amd cpu - apu.  Totaly unplayable for amd owners.  I opened a ticket on steam cs for refund my money.;-1;0
i thought sunday was a weekend day.;-1;0
so meny bugs around. that game.;-1;0
How could this still be this bad.. still playing arma2 witch is much better;-1;0
Arma 3Arma 3 is easy to explain. Imagine arma 2. Now add proper stances to it ALOT better performance alot of fixed bugs (alot more introduced aswell) and on and on. Arma 3 is a good game for what it is. The main problem is: the devs are ing lazy they didn't bother modelling lots of civillian cars like in arma 2 instead 4 or 5 that just have different skins. About 1 tank per faction. 3 or 4 Helicopters and  me only one ing jet. I mean thats ing lazy. The amount of content in arma 3 is ing embarrasing compared to the shear amount of content in arma 2. Bohemia Interactive have done a great job with all the new content etc. but this game should still either be in alpha or very early beta. NOT a finished game. Overall if your reading this to see weather you wanna get this game or not its down to you. If you want a game that runs and plays really well if you can look past the laziness of the devs and the lack of assets then get it. If you can't however just stick with arma 2 until the devs actually do something about the lack of assets etc. Again this game should be in late alpha - early beta. NOT a finished game.-10
Great game. But is showing it's old age. Deleting from my games list for ever. Good riddance to bad rubbish.;-1;0
Arma 3[This is my opinion! you can have your own! I don't care!] This game makes me want to give CoD: Ghosts a five star review why? ... Pros: - Good Graphics - Go-Karts - Day-Z Cons: - Jump? - Every player wants to kick you - There is a point when you stop making a game realilistic - Openworld is not good in a military simulator - Insurgency did this better - Menus are confusing af - Spawn menu?  End note! My first ten minutes was spent throwing a guy's Hunter into the ocean than being banned because of it... I have no regrets. and for the most part I had no idea Wat the  I was supposed to do  +Bonus Disclaimer! Despite my rating I might play it here and there just to get my $60 out of it.-10
Arma 3Step 1: Buy the game after making sure I meet all requirements. Step 2: Install the game. Step 3: Click play. Step 4: Get 'ARMA III has stopped working' Error. Step 5: Try running as administrator. Step 6: Get 'This aplication has failed to start because d3d11.dll was not found' Error. Step 7: Look for DirectX Folder in the ARMA 3 folder as that is a file related to it. Step 8: Find there is no DirectX folder in the ARMA 3 local files. Step 9: Re-install. Step 10: Get same error.  0/10 - A salty person-10
Arma 3too expsensive pls make less exspensive thx game people.-10
Arma 3No Just no....-10
If the apex update will be 5 euros instead of 30 sure. Till that no s given. Anyways. If you want to buy the game keep in mind that it has a  ton of bugs.;-1;0
Arma 3If you like never being able to leave spawn 12 year olds screaming in your ears and  hitler level admins banning you because you called them out for their own rules then buy this game other than that  this and  you arma i tried to love this game but nawh im done same t day in day out peace out and ill be back when you can make this an enjoyable game again.-10
Full of bugs that can be fixed but the company is too lazy to fix it.;-1;0
DONT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE LAG! I have a very high end PC and this piece of trash struggles to get over 40fps in signle player mode.;-1;0
Do you like headaches? this game is headache game;-1;0
Hard to control!;-1;0
Arma 3Well... what to say about this game in two words. Its Bad.   Arma 3 is terribly optimized for PC. Mine isn't the greatest but I saw someone who had two 980s try running it didn't even get over 50 FPS. Never knew you needed a $4000 computer to even get over 60 FPS. The servers are terrible there are rarely any servers that are populated with a &lt;150 ping. Even if I try to connect to any of them it says connection failed. People may have thought I made a bad review because of how difficult and realistic it was. I like games like this. Too bad bohemia interactive didn't put enough effort into making this game run really well and to make the server connection good. Instead of fixing these problems and making announcements about them they decide to release DLC after DLC to add onto this broken game. If you are stupid enough to pay $15 for two helicopters you must not be too wise with your money. I should have mentioned when getting into a server you must either donate or go into ts to fly. Why can't they just use game chat? Guess I will never get my pilot license. They probably sould have fixed arma 2 as well before making this one. I refuse to run this on the LOWEST POSSIBLE settings because there is no reason I should. A game like this you need good view distance and things need to looks some what nice. You can't see an enemy a few thousand meters out but they sure can see you. Please DO NOT buy this game unless it goes on sale. This game is nowhere near worth $60. I would say its worth 20-30 range.-10
Arma 3While I love the Arma series this game was not was I was expecting. When you make a game you have a couple things that need to be set up to make it a game.   1. A setting - They created the island and it was good very large and open with a diverse landscape  2. The Engine - Everything works well even the physics which Arma 2 completely failed at. Movements are fluid you got way better animations so there aren't any complaints....until  3. Weapons and Vehicles - This is one of the most crucial points to add variety to a game and I am sad to say that BI failed miserably. They created virtually nothing for the game's release for what reason I don't know but it aggravates me to no end. You have all the things in place the tools for people to make their own missions but there is no variety same guns same ammo and a couple of vehicles. Look at Arma 2 even without the DLC there was TONS of content to work with and the DLC just added onto that.   My advice? Keep up to date on the status of the game and once the first DLC comes out THEN buy it-10
Arma 3Once again the community doesn't do any justice. Almost all servers are hosted in Brazil mods are galore. Expect no vanilla game at all in the server browser. Expect no one to help you out or work tactically or be approachable at all. Aimbot is inevitable.  5/10-10
Arma 3controls are clunky horribly optimized graphics suck AI sucks and in some missions actively tries to get you killed.   and yet i keep trying out of pure boredom.  -10
This is gonna be est game ever i see you dont make dayz mode for arma 3 But its not gonna happen u create new game for day z u published videos for u are working on arma 3 for dayz You guys said you are going to publish it soon u tricked people;-1;0
Arma 3n3xt g3n load into a server nek m1nn1t crash-10
Arma 3Buggy as hell. They never fixed weird issues like being able to walk through walls.  Hard to tell when you've actually shot someone. No real visual indicator that you've shot someone so you end up shooting them 5 times out of confusion. Single player campaign seems badly thought out. I basically had to save scum to get off of the first island.  AI is awful. No armory mode or quick mission mode.  I regret buying this in alpha.-10
Arma 3I will never ever buy another mistake (Bohemia Interactive game). I trusted this company and purchased this game in Alpha. Not only did they deliver a buggy failure. They have the nerve of releasing expensive DLCs that are meant to be included in the game. And announcing new games when they haven't even finished whats on their plate. This developer should be renamed as EA v2.1  Never again BI never again.-10
Arma 3(free weekend)   GTX 760 intelcore I5 windows 8.1 (64 bit) 8 gigs of ram directX 11 and the game still runs like crap on the lowest setting. do not recommend.-10
Arma 3I played 11 hours on the free weekend and i use to enjoy the flashpoint series but found this game hard to get into and the missions seemed the same most of the time. Only the first episode was available for free but it seemed the same run through some trees shoot a few enemy then go to objective shoot a few more complete objective wait 2 minutes then mission ends.   Couldnt connect to any multiplayer servers so maybe this game is too old now and no one hosts severs for it in the Pacific region?  I might pick it up on the sale again if its 60-70% off but 50% off and I will still hold out on it for now.-10
Arma 3They should really fix this game performace wise performs like one of the first AAA games that were demanding on PC. Cant say i can recommend it due to all the performance issues and i run 2x 970 STRIX in SLI and got a high end Intel CPU and even with those startup commands it doesnt fix much.-10
Why play Arma 3 when you could be putting your genitals into meat mincer which would be a lot more fun. I feel like Ive been robbed! Definitely not worth £35.99 -_-;-1;0
so good to install and unninstal! plz try;-1;0
Arma 3I thought I would love this game but after dealing with sloppy menu systems unoptimized game settings and ridiculously varying quality in gameplay I just wish I never spent the money on this. All the online gameplay shown is under incredibly set terms that you'll almost never see without dedicating a ton of time to a community with a teamspeak.  -10
Awful. Way too complicated and clunky to be fun.;-1;0
Arma 3This game don't deserve much lovebad performancemouse bug at start can't click anythingcontrols are bit weird mostly when you try to aim it zoom...whateverordinary graphics (played Ultra 1080p) with 2009 polygon count.On foot graphics runs better with people shooting and all that good action than flying on helicopter that you only can see ugly ground texture with some trees with no action...weird. Grass looks to much like paper really ugly. Yeah you can make scenarios and yeah the map is huge yeah it's a sandbox but no it's not that great. To many people likes ittakes a hateri rarely hate games but Arma 3...i hate it.-10
The battleye service is absolute ! i got banned for purchasing a vehicle on 'Altis Life' i do not recommend this game!;-1;0
Game is only fun if you have a bunch of mods. And if you dont have apex then good luck trying to play the game;-1;0
Arma 3Pro:  - Very Realistic Simulator - Large amount of User Created Content - Constant Updates and Development of the Game as such - Dedicated PC exclusive Game  Con: - Weak Optimization (AA-AAA CPU+GPU is a must if you dont like Cinematic 8-10 FPS at Mud-Graphics) - As of lately 'weak' Playerbase: Little Teamplay with Random Players Few Use Voice Chat) - Bad/Unresponsive AI to Squad Commands (eg. dont lie down/dismount when you command them and subsequently getting killed) - Rip Off DLC (eg. 2 Helicopters for 6-12 €/$) - AAA Pricetag only justifyable by being the sole decent Milsim-Series on PC - Multiplayer HEAVILY reliant on Mods/Addons (eg.Altis Life) Game would be already dead with Stock Gamemodes - Gameworld Interaction (eg.Opening Doors) very clunky at best - Short/Weak Campaign  6.5/10-10
Arma 3Wow the aiming control set up is clunky as heck. You have to toggle everything and that is a pain. You have to hold mouse 2 and tap L ctrl or L alt to change site views. That gets me killed every time. The only use for the AI team mates is picking through their dead bodies for supplies. Seems like a solid story and the game looks good though so there is that if I can get the controls figured better.-10
Arma 3This game is an interesting concept but is NOT for everyone. It is a modern military 'simulator' and it does this pretty well. Tiny little nuances of the miliary experience show up: leaning around corners to aim having spotters for sniping and switching fire modes on a gun and healthy amounts of bullet drop are all things you will have to get used to. Those things aren't that bad and some can even be fun. ESPECIALLY the artillery targeting computer which has a maximum range well beyond the edge of the map has different types of shells and shows how long the bullets with take to get to their destination (and it will take time if you shoot from one end of the island to another. Sometimes however these nuances can just get annoying. The keyboard is cluttered with keys assigened to different things in places that don't make much sense (let's just say I wasn't expecting to have different buttons for my watch my compass and my very real map.) There is no typical first person shooter radar showing where enemies or self made waypoints are (although mission waypoints do show up.) Long story short this game is incredibely complicated to control and will not be controller friendly.  The big draw for me and for most people after seeing reviews from people like NerdCubed will be the map editor. Appearently this is what the game's developers were expecting as well because the game didn't even come with campaigns at launch (they are being added as DLC over the next few months.) The editor is incredibely detailed to the same extent if not more than the rest of the game. Unfortunately it is even more user-unfriendly. Particularly concerning non-physical items like spawnpoints and mission objectives. Some of these require you to CLOSE THE GAME ENTIRELY AND EDIT THE TEXT FILES FOR THE SCENARIO. Other things like controlling where you want units of the map to go and who they will attack is another mystery entirely. The learning curve is a monstrosity.  I'm not particulary concerned about graphics but this game is pretty underwhelming in that respect. It's textures are uninspiring and driving physics are woeful. Where the game makes up for this is in scale. The game is freaking HUGE. It will take and uncomfortable long time to cross even in a helicopter. I believe the estimates are something like 270 square kilometers of space. In other words very very large and possibly of the largest maps of any game. It is pretty empty but there are some small towns churches and all sorts of terrain to give a lot of creative leeway when designing a scenario. If you can figure out how.  If you know to/are willing to code and have a lot of free time on your hands Arma III could actually be a lot of fun. But for everyone else it's probably best that you don't fork over 60 dollars for something it takes dozens of hours to fully comprehend.-10
Arma 3Feels like I wasted my money. Game looks beautiful but it got too frustrating when it felt like everyone else was going on with the mission and combat and I was left looking around for the enemy.  Outisde of waiting for some tracers to show up and give the enemy away my efforts to eliminate my target were futile 99% of the time. I'd use up all my ammunition and they'd land in a perfect shot every single time. It got to the point that I would end up sitting back while the AI on my team took care of it- after all they knew exactly what to do while I'm just sitting there shrugging my shoulders.   This is not your typical combat FPS. The controle are wonky and I spent a hard-earned $60 on frustration.  I have a Titan video card. It runs all of my games on maximum settings flawlessly. With Arma 3 it seems like all I do to ajust the graphics settings makes no difference as I'm hit with major framerate issues.   After a few days I reinstalled the game to give it another chance but I just couldn't get anything accomplished.  I personally don't recommend the game.-10
Arma 3I HATE THIS! every time I attempt to accses a server or game im always transfared back to the main title server screen due to 'unknown errors'/ error code : 0x0000DEAD- why to I have to deal with this every time I try to connect to a server... £14.99 wasted thanks....!!!!-10
Arma 3I bought this game. Hard to play. Stop playing. I just wish it was easiler no doubt it is a good game but i was just lost in what to do or how to do it.-10
Arma 3Everything about this game improves on Arma II except for one key point. The game simply does not run. Not on high end machines not on anything it is so poorly optimised and coded that no system can run it smoothly (60 fps). Online games lag all the way down to 10-15 fps in cities just because the server code is poorly written and results in server side lag that effects frame rate as well as hit detection. If this game was actually able to run at a decent frame rate that stayed decent online it would be a wonderful game. Until that time i cannot recommend this game.-10
Arma 3This game is  compared to ARMA2. Gear loadout saving process is  and not working optimization is  AI is . In other words it's a downgrade. Keep playing ARMA2 until this game is patched/fixed-10
Arma 3I regret buying the DLC... The karts are ly stupid. The rifles are total BS garbage.... and the helicopters I can get from Armaholic or Play withSIX. Just get Play withSix and download weapons mods vehicles etc... If I could do it over again I wouldn't pay $1 for the DLC that should have been included wiith the game to begin with. The game ARMA 3 is awesome... The DLC is underhanded.-10
This game is not even good enough for a comment;-1;0
poorly running multiplayer :/ my specs are higher than recommended and I still play on 20-30 fps (only in mp);-1;0
It would be a good game if it wasn't such a resource .;-1;0
You just get blown up from a thousand meters away or sniped by people you can't see in single player. Multiplayer is the same just with a lot worse FPS.;-1;0
Terrible performance I have a GTX 970 SSC w/ AMD 6 core @ 3.8Ghz  And I baily get 20 FPS;-1;0
Arma 3This is not a good game  It's still not optimized enough to run over 60fps on KoTH on my rig (8GB 1333mhz RAM GTX760 i5 3570k win10)  -10
Unfinished and lazy;-1;0
Arma 3Would probably be a good game but buggy as hell.crashes all the time.If im lucky i might get to play 10 minutes before it locks upbut most of the time its about 2 minutes. I have a quad core processorRadeon R9 200 HD4 gb ram so i know my cpu is well above requirments.So dont waste your money unless you like hours and and hours of trying to troublshoot the game just so you can play for 5 minutes.-10
If you like sub 20 fps first person shooters this is the game for you!;-1;0
Unoptimized trash. It's not worth $60 and certainly not worth your time.;-1;0
Arma 3In my opinionthis game looks gorgeous. Everything feels realisticthe movement is also great. But I wouldn't recommend to play this game due to bugs that there are in-game. This game doesn't look fixed yet.   PROs: -Great gameplay (The moment when you are driving on A3L feels so good) -Realistic movement(crouchingsprintingand also walking around) -Well builded buildings (Such as cities on A3L or Army Camps) -Good graphics but I expected more coming from Bohemia Interactive. -Fun game to play with your friends.  CONs: -Game is not fixed yetneeds more work to fix the bugs. -Map is loading so hard sometimes -Loading screen makes you punch the keyboard it works so slow -Sometimesit is so hard to crouch and sprint because you are gonna get stuck into surfaces -It is impossible to drive in A3L without having a laughyour feets are visible everytime you are in the passager seat.     I do recommend this game if you wanna have fun some hoursbut I do not recommend to play this game everytime until they will fix the bugs that they have.-10
fix your ing game.... it's 2016. it's about time to get a new ing engine. clunky s;-1;0
Nice game nice mods   SH+T ENGINE PLS CHANGE IT AND DONT USE THIS SH+T ENGINE;-1;0
Price is to much from Alpha by 2x.;-1;0
Arma 3If you own an AMD bassed system do not purchase. My system exceeds the recomended specs to run the game but you end up with unplayable FPS. I have spent a few days trawling the internet trying to find fixes for the problem. They do not work one minute you think you have found the cure only for the frames to drop of either in game or when you restart it. When a game shows you recomended specs you expect it to work the problems have been around for years with no fixes from the Devs so I expect there to be no fixes. From what I could get from the game it is excellent game play and great graphics. But not for AMD systems you have been warned..........................-10
10/10 worst optimised franchise again;-1;0
Arma 3Wouldn't recommend it's a broken game with lots of bugs in it.   Need to mod it up to make it look half decent.   -10
Arma 3Brain damage isn't the word.. If you love walking about hill sides &amp; empty towns for hours on end then by all means knock your self clean out. Really good graphics Half decent engine but just awful gameplay. Trying to even see who is launching nades and rounds at you is a fecking personal nightmare. Could feel myself falling asleep in one game where a guy was flying for an hour with me in the back of a chopper.. and yes.. we met no enemy the entire time. 4/10 just for graphics-10
Arma 3I thought this game was AMAZIING at first since I has seen videos on Youtube but then when I got into the game I realized that it was a rip off for SIXTY DOLLARS! The game is very realistic but maybe a bit TOO realistic. You get tired like every five seconds in the game so you cant sprint for a very long time which makes the game boring because it takes forever to get anywhere. The game is also very hard to understand at first and the turorial is very confusing when you start. If you are buying this game for graphics or/and realism then its a yes but if you are buying this game for fun and lots of action you should pass on this one.-10
All of a sudden I can't join any servers. All it says is 'you were kicked' no matter what server I try.;-1;0
if you like games that crashes all the time and never works then you should get this ;-1;0

What a ing dissapointment.;-1;0
Literally NOT FUN!!!!!! 0/10;-1;0
Arma 3I decided to try Arma 3 as everyone was recommending online.I am going to start out with this game does need some work to be put in not worth to spend full price on this pick up when on a good sale other then that this game isn't for people who like fast paced action now performance issues I apperently run into with other complications. Firstly so I got 20 fps everything maxed to lowered it still some 20fps terrible port needs to be compressed properly controls are also clunky I would say the simulation at the start was 60fps but once it ended fps dropped drasticaly. Secondly I would recommend trying to run with a single GTX 980 &amp; 970 or AMD equevelent never crossfire or SLI not responsible if fps will stay the same usually I get over 60fps maxed out in games but this one you probably should use a controler since it's not K&amp;m friendly. Lastly lets not forget the story you run to point A to B. I know it's supposed to be realistic but we customers need playable material this rant is to prove that servers have connection problems sometimes you get kicked from online most of the time I get messages saying Arma 3 stopped working as I play through don't get this garbage unless this is below $10/7.89 EU or $5/3.95 EU please Bohemia Interactive fix this trash and make it playable.People with 770s780sand 280sand 290s are really dissapointed that this game doesn't run well on their machines an utter dissapointment to people who dedicated their money on powerful pc hardware just to have 20 fps? In summary not worth buying this game since it isn't demanding but more unoptimized unfinished product this is a spit on PC Gamers and their rigs and before you say something to defend early access let me tell you something Valve needs to work on testing this games before letting them be published on steam conclusion don't buy it not worth your time unless you like capped down ports then support the video game monkeys who make video games this bad and horrible.   Final rating 5.5/10 for Walking Simulator-10
Arma 3do you like wandering around in the middle of no where for 2hrs just to get killed one min into combat? do you love admin abuse? well boy do i have a game for you! its called arma 3  if you like a whole lot of walking around and doing nothing  your gonna love this  -10
dumb game got take out of my account.;-1;0
Arma 3Worst experiance I ever had. I constantly get kicked from servers for having a high ping but in reallity my ping is always 80 or below. The game seems fun but i'll never get to find out.-10
Quit looking at the negitive reviews and buy this game.;-1;0
Arma 3*slow clap* nice way to go all EA on us and wait to release half the end game content in dlc get aggressive cancer bohemia devs.-10
Arma 3In my opinion the second game is much more fun. I don't really like the setting and the game is just not Arma. This game is more like 'Arma: Tactical Roleplay Altis Life'.-10
Arma 3The amount of possibilities in this game is very cool the updates destroying your saves however are not.-10
Arma 3To be honest I was very disapointed in this game theres no single player which I expected there to be. No I didnt read all the info on the game first and that was my error. It popped up on the steam recommend window that opens and I in a fluster of idiocy bought it while it was slightly discounted but I regret it.  Online the problems are if you are not on an optical internet cable or if you live a 200 ping or more away from server your going to get owned by people with fast connections and wikid video cards. In an online firefight with guns throwing bullets all over the place 100 thou matters and then the you die with no sound or seeing what happened happens.  Games pretty enough nothing wrong with its graphics but online only just means when there finished making there 800000 bucks they turn the servers off and we all now have a game that can never be played again.  Making games multiplayer online only is basically CHEAP.  There is no real backbone to this game and there are alot of ''online multiplayer only'' games already so I cant recommend this game and I very rarely do reviews on games I dont like they usualy have annoyed me to do so.  I think the last bad review I gave was for that cheap and nasty walking dead production.  Anyway thumbs down on this one.-10
Horrendously buggy...;-1;0
Arma 3DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you select a piece of gear that is part of DLC first of all it doesn't tell you what is DLC and isn't it will let you use it... except it then pastes watermarks all over your screen so you BUY THE DLC which it conveniently guides you to when you exit the battle. Nothing more than a great title taken and abused for every dollar they can squeeze out of it. Don't waste your money unless you are prepared to buy ALL DLC along with the game which is still chock full of performance issues and bugs. No thanks!-11
This game has some twitchy movement and bad controls. The frame rates are buggy and graphics are just 'meh'. Reminds me of a lackluster CounterStrike. Not worth the money in the least.;-1;1
gam is shibt;-1;1
bad optimzation;-1;0
Just no! This game is not even worth the time just to get 10FPS online! Stay away...;-1;0
Arma 3I cant recommend this game to anybody. this expensive crap of a game is only giving me 18 fps no matter what i set my settings on. gta gives me 80fps on max settings and the graphics are 10.000 times better.  the only thing that's great with this game is the war atmosphere and the weapons.-10
If you enjoy getting spawn killed then this is the game for you;-1;0
Arma 3Trash You need to spend 10k $$ for new PC unless you want to play with 10 fps. Totally unrealistic  you basically need to hit someone like 20 times to kill him.-10
Arma 3Yeah this game is a waste of money if you only plan on buying the game without any DLC. Very few servers for people who own only the base game. Wish I could trade it in even for only $10. Disappointing.-10
Arma 3you buying tons of bugs with your money... have fun crouch bug door pass bug jump bug fps bug optimization 0 3 years past still tons of bug and 0 fixes do not buy thats all-10
Not what i expected. What a waste of money.;-1;0
Arma 3the controls are very bad in this game the stamina has to be the worst a gun and a few mags after walking 20ft i have to stop because the guy is tired he's a soldier not a 90 year old man. Not realistic or game realistic tbh....-10
this is a ing  game breaking point does not working for me gayness and you cant alt tab out cuz its ing  gaame.;-1;0
It is too lagy;-1;0
Arma 3The good: 1. The foliage is fantastic. I swear my nose wrinkled and I almost had asthma from all the realistic grass and brush. 2. Uh... did I mention the foliage? If this was 'Foliage Simulator 2013' it would win awards.  If this was made into the next Fallout game and they let Bethesda fix everything I might be interested. I'd perhaps pay $5 to get through the campaign now that I've started it in the free weekend.  The Bad: Too many things to list. Far too many. Many great ideas almost none of them work out for the player. The inventory system is a nightmare. I wouldn't pay the -50% off price of $30 + DLC much less the full price of $60 + DLC.-11
Needs about $30 worth of DLC to even play;-1;0
Arma 3sucks my out of shape soldier can only run like 50m before running out of energy starts crying and huffs and puffs. apparently he needs his 1sg to put a boot in his  during PT.-10
Arma 3I really really wanted to like this game. It has a lot going for it but unlike the previous games they changed the damage model so that enemies take 4 body shots by an assult rifle to die and can take multiple shots to the head. You cannot change this in the options and I couldnt find a good mod to change it. Basically it went from a very realistic FPS to Call of Duty. What a bizzare decision for the devs to make.-10
Arma 3A lot of potential for a good game but alas it is . Terrible campaign Horrible AI More bugs than there are types of insects. Clunky slow interface. Would not recommend getting this game to my worse enemy-10
Arma 3One of the worst games I played evar. Buggy as  online full of  and poorly optimized-10
Arma 3Good for Altis life little else to say thats good.-10

Arma 3Having spend many hours in the buggy but innovative (at the time) Operation Flashpoint I took the opportunity to try Arma 3 weekend deal for free. While being 2 minutes in the tutorial I somehow got my camera stuck I can only walk back and forward and turn my head. How to undo this: no fraking clue! Rage quit uninstalled and never ever going to install another Bohemia product on my PC.-10
Arma 3I really like arma 3 and i think it has potential and it is such a great game!  However...  Pretty none of the servers aren't modded which is such a shame. The servers that aren't that modded require the dlcs...  5/10 Good potential and good base game but the servers are garbage-10
When the arma 3 apex protocol came out my game started crashing;-1;1
Arma 3run in the forest for 3 hours get sniped simulator-10
This game is for people who has a lot of free time. Only training process takes hours and hours. Without training it's very difficult to play. I just start my training and understood that it will take a lot of time.  Not easy. Not so beautiful like on videos and photos.  Will deinstall without playing.;-1;0
Arma 3I did not have fun playing this game. I gave it a fair chance but the gameplay is just so mundane and mediocre that it was an effort to have fun even in the first few hours. There are better games out there to spend $60 on. If you are totally bored and you kind of like shooters or can get this game on sale ($10-$20) then buy it. In any other circumstance just pass it by.-10
This is the most bugged  i ever played. I absolutely don't recommend it.;-1;0

Arma 3Note that I'm a person who is tactical with shooters. I don't play COD because you run around like a chicken with it's head cut off with no regard to getting killed. with that noted please read on.  Yeah I can't say I really enjoy this game. I know I know but seriously. I dumbed down the AI to the lowest possible and they still kill me at a good distance. I don't expect to get close to them like COD (Note I don't play COD much) but this is just Overkill. They can spot you even when your in hiding behind VERY thick shrubs where even YOU can't see them. I'm more of a tactical guy and I enjoy taking my time but this.......I shoot their head flinch. they shoot my head RIP. Simulation my . If I hit your neck or the head or even the face for that matter you are ing DOWN. I've made it pretty far in this game and my patients has just run dry. Even your character is grunting all the damn time as if he was beating off in the battlefield. Even I know that if your in the battlefield by yourself knowing that your pretty much surrounded by enemies you don't grunt even when your laying down. I understand the breathing yes but grunting no.  Guns push back yeah? I fired a rifle before while hunting. It kicked back. note that the recoil for you is kind of understandable. You shoot it recoils adjust etc. The AI don't have a ing recoil. Note that I'm at a good distance. I don't do meters or anything but the Bot I was shooting was at rather a good distance. You aim down sights zoom a bit and you can make out a head. small but visibly noticable. As we engage each other I'd like to point out I have single fire shots. I like to conserve bullets and I need to ajdust a little (very little) for every shot (Full-Auto recoil is rather intense) but nothing to complain about. Why is it that every shot and mind you that the percision for these ers are down to a flat 0 along with skill being at a flat 0 that I still get hit way more often. I shoot the bot three in the head (face) gave up on face and five times in the chest which is where a lot of pading is so I understand a bit more bullets are needed but instead of him dieing and simply flinching I keel over.  Heres my recent situation that I had that made me say  it. I'm crawling in to a camp yeah. Nice slowly not to alarm anyone. Of course no one is in sight I say again NO ONE WAS IN SIGHT. So I decide to lay down and catch some breath so my stamina bar fills so I can run if need be. Theres a large vehicle transport and under it I see a Bot FACING AWAY and the only thing noticable are the legs no waist line. I move back a bit to get some distance but in that moment the bot immediatly faces me no turning is noticable and I'm running at 60frames per second shoots twice and I'm dead. How in the hell do you shoot through a vehicle!? How did the bot hear me laying down that instance and not when I'm sneaking. The bot was close enough to hear anyone walk. How does it not need to kneel down in order to shoot me and HOW DOES IT KNOW MY EXACT LOCATION!!???   This isn't limited to the vehicle people no matter where you hide they see you and will shoot and kill you with persicion. even if their percision is dead smack ing ZERO!!!! none of this  simulates real combat. You aren't required to have experienced field combat to know how  this is. shooting through a vehicle. spotting you even though you can't even ing see them not to mention they don't have recoil.  I have spent the past 4 damn hours trying to complete a single damn side quest. once again I'm a person who is tactical with shooters. I don't play COD because you run around like a chicken with it's head cut off with no regard to getting killed. I always lose in pvp due to the fact that I'm cautious. I'm sure as hell a lot better with Rainbow Six Siege and battlefield I have some moments but not like Rainbow Six. I don't usually complain about shooters and I'm quite competent at shooters I may not a pro or like someone who invests hours upon hours of their life into the game but that doesn't mean I don't know how to play a shooter game. I love how deep this game gets but the level of how unfair and the kind of bugs this game has does NOT make it enjoyable.   Maybe the multiplayer is great but thats something I don't really buy the games for. I don't have time to go against people who are able to spend hours on this game being much more competent at this game than me. So if your looking for a Multiplayer review Your not gonna get it here. If your looking at the game for campaign experience just move on or wait till it gets cheaper Unless you like spending countless hours on a single mission and rarely advance.-10
Arma 3the game is great.  Realism clans are terrible unless you find the perfect one.  In my case i joined a clan everything was going smooth for 2 weeks then out of nowhere i was banned from the clan website all tags and statuses removed from their teamspeak servers and wasnt allowed to appeal my ban (which i still have no idea why I was banned)  TLDR: Great game  community.-10
Arma 3If you like try hard games please by this game you'll be so happy and excited through every playing moment If you're not a try hard avoid this games campaign its anoying and filled with  moment after  moment where you get dropped in the mosted screwed up moment with no help no idea what your doing(If you've never played this series before) and no notice that you are in a silently dangerous area. I understand the issues of not being able to see your enemies or whose shooting at you and even the fact that 1 bullet to the head is insta kill. Things I don't understand...WHY THE HELL CAN I ONLY SAVE ONCE PER MISSION? it makes no sence I'd like to beat the game not get screwed 1000 times before doing so. Yes I understand there are multiple missions where this stuff doesn't happen but no I don't think saving should be restricted.-10
Arma 3Was okay. Since update it won't load. Can't be bothered. It's too slow to get into the game when it does work. Uninstalled. Maybe they will fix it one day.-11
Arma 3I honestly feel kind of ashamed that I have played over 1600 hours in this game and have yet to review it. I was a major fan of Arma 2 and while my steam profile doesn't show it I logged thousands of hours into it and it's expansions. Needless to say when Arma 3 was announced and eventually given an Alpha release I was day one. Even with the performance problems I was experiencing I was having a blast. Once I upgraded (CPU only) my performance increase by more than I could think to measure. That's not to say everything with the game is perfect.  I'll start with the guns. They're not terrible but I'm not a huge fan of the models (Katiba or the MX). The only one I KINDA liked was the MX SW. The Abr is really nice but I was missing my favorite 5.56 models. Like the M4. Or the 416. However with the recent Apex expansion they've added weapons in called the Spar-16 which basically looks just like a 416.   Speaking of Apex I gotta mention that a lot of people have stated they could not play multiplayer with servers running Apex. This is plain false. Bohemia has had a long standing policy of not separating the population with DLC. The only part of Apex that would keep anyone from playing on a server is the map. Considering how many maps exist for Arma 3 you would be hard pressed NOT to find a server running a different map. To an extent you can even use the weapons or attachments from the DLC but this is primarily meant for people to check them out. After a few moments an advert for the DLC will come across the screen.   Now to performance. People do still suffer with frame rate issues and it can be frustrating believe me. There are a lot of guides out there on how to increase it. Those guides have helped a lot of people and there still exists a lot of people it does nothing for. Single player generally runs great for people but on multiplayer it rears its ugly head. The problem being here that performance isn't solely placed on your rig. The servers rig needs to be able to push what it's trying to do while Arma juggles all the things that it does on such large maps. Some game modes will be worse than others and this isn't to say the problems with performance rest solely on the server or your PC. But it's something to take into account as well.  From my own personal experience I was originally running an AMD 8 core processor at like 2.5 ghz I think it was. 8gb of standard ram and a Nvidia 660ti. Regular 3tb hdd. I bought a new motherboard and case with the i7 4770 3.4 ghz. With the AMD I had MAYBE 10-15 fps on Stratis alone or with a handful of people practically doing nothing. The i7 alone I saw an increased gain. On stratis full server at the heart of a battle I was maintaining 30fps on ultra. Lot of people might think that's nothing great but from just upgrading my CPU it was quite an increase. Since then I've moved up to 16gb of Ripjaw (I think that's the name) ram and in November I'm finally upgrading from my 660ti to the 1080. What I currently have I never dip below 30 fps on a full server and often times I see it get up to 40-50.   All that said everyone is going to have a different experience in this game. It's not easy and there's a good learning curve. Tons of keys to remember. Even coming from Battlefield it might be hard for new players to understand just how big Altis is. Hell even Stratis. I've played everything from coop missions on to king of the hill altis life wasteland breaking point epoch Exile and much more. I've spent so much time doing all these different things I still haven't beaten single player yet.  The last thing I gotta mention is the workshop or even armaholic. At either place you can find missions new units weapon packs of all kinds gear packs and the list goes on. There is so much here. I wish I could begin to describe just how much is available from people who poured their time and passions into. Even if you don't own the game you could go look at the workshop just to get an idea of what all is there.   TL;DR This game is fun and frustrating at differing times. If you want something new and challenging I can't recommend this more.10
Arma 3Do not buy this game there are hackers everywhere and the developers will eat your children and they support ISIS. They also don't care about black people.-11

How in the hell do you shoot through a vehicle!? How did the bot hear me laying down that instance and not when I'm sneaking. The bot was close enough to hear anyone walk. How does it not need to kneel down in order to shoot me and HOW DOES IT KNOW MY EXACT LOCATION!!???   This isn't limited to the vehicle people no matter where you hide they see you and will shoot and kill you with persicion. even if their percision is dead smack ing ZERO!!!! none of this  simulates real combat. You aren't required to have experienced field combat to know how  this is. shooting through a vehicle. spotting you even though you can't even ing see them not to mention they don't have recoil.  I have spent the past 4 damn hours trying to complete a single damn side quest. once again I'm a person who is tactical with shooters. I don't play COD because you run around like a chicken with it's head cut off with no regard to getting killed. I always lose in pvp due to the fact that I'm cautious. I'm sure as hell a lot better with Rainbow Six Siege and battlefield I have some moments but not like Rainbow Six. I don't usually complain about shooters and I'm quite competent at shooters I may not a pro or like someone who invests hours upon hours of their life into the game but that doesn't mean I don't know how to play a shooter game. I love how deep this game gets but the level of how unfair and the kind of bugs this game has does NOT make it enjoyable.   Maybe the multiplayer is great but thats something I don't really buy the games for. I don't have time to go against people who are able to spend hours on this game being much more competent at this game than me. So if your looking for a Multiplayer review Your not gonna get it here. If your looking at the game for campaign experience just move on or wait till it gets cheaper Unless you like spending countless hours on a single mission and rarely advance.-10
Arma 3the game is great.  Realism clans are terrible unless you find the perfect one.  In my case i joined a clan everything was going smooth for 2 weeks then out of nowhere i was banned from the clan website all tags and statuses removed from their teamspeak servers and wasnt allowed to appeal my ban (which i still have no idea why I was banned)  TLDR: Great game  community.-10
Arma 3Was okay. Since update it won't load. Can't be bothered. It's too slow to get into the game when it does work. Uninstalled. Maybe they will fix it one day.-11
this game sucks;-1;0
Arma 3Note that I'm a person who is tactical with shooters. I don't play COD because you run around like a chicken with it's head cut off with no regard to getting killed. with that noted please read on.  Yeah I can't say I really enjoy this game. I know I know but seriously. I dumbed down the AI to the lowest possible and they still kill me at a good distance. I don't expect to get close to them like COD (Note I don't play COD much) but this is just Overkill. They can spot you even when your in hiding behind VERY thick shrubs where even YOU can't see them. I'm more of a tactical guy and I enjoy taking my time but this.......I shoot their head flinch. they shoot my head RIP. Simulation my . If I hit your neck or the head or even the face for that matter you are ing DOWN. I've made it pretty far in this game and my patients has just run dry. Even your character is grunting all the damn time as if he was beating off in the battlefield. Even I know that if your in the battlefield by yourself knowing that your pretty much surrounded by enemies you don't grunt even when your laying down. I understand the breathing yes but grunting no.  Guns push back yeah? I fired a rifle before while hunting. It kicked back. note that the recoil for you is kind of understandable. You shoot it recoils adjust etc. The AI don't have a ing recoil. Note that I'm at a good distance. I don't do meters or anything but the Bot I was shooting was at rather a good distance. You aim down sights zoom a bit and you can make out a head. small but visibly noticable. As we engage each other I'd like to point out I have single fire shots. I like to conserve bullets and I need to ajdust a little (very little) for every shot (Full-Auto recoil is rather intense) but nothing to complain about. Why is it that every shot and mind you that the percision for these ers are down to a flat 0 along with skill being at a flat 0 that I still get hit way more often. I shoot the bot three in the head (face) gave up on face and five times in the chest which is where a lot of pading is so I understand a bit more bullets are needed but instead of him dieing and simply flinching I keel over.  Heres my recent situation that I had that made me say  it. I'm crawling in to a camp yeah. Nice slowly not to alarm anyone. Of course no one is in sight I say again NO ONE WAS IN SIGHT. So I decide to lay down and catch some breath so my stamina bar fills so I can run if need be. Theres a large vehicle transport and under it I see a Bot FACING AWAY and the only thing noticable are the legs no waist line. I move back a bit to get some distance but in that moment the bot immediatly faces me no turning is noticable and I'm running at 60frames per second shoots twice and I'm dead. How in the hell do you shoot through a vehicle!? How did the bot hear me laying down that instance and not when I'm sneaking. The bot was close enough to hear anyone walk. How does it not need to kneel down in order to shoot me and HOW DOES IT KNOW MY EXACT LOCATION!!???

Arma 3fun game when played however in the few weeks i owned it due to the largeness of the game its prone to errors. after a bit of delving into the first error i managed to fix it however the second error is inrepairable meaning i have lost 30pounds plus 20 pounds dlc all due to the insecurity of the files. therfore would not reckomend.-10
Arma 3I have only payed for ARMA games since 2001 'operation flash point' ARMA 3 was and will be the last I will ever pay for! All my custom missions' work' for all the other games!   Since ARMA 3 since the updates all older missions I made no longer work in ARMA 3  so the 8- 12 hours spent making every mission I made = a waste of time!  I find this appalling I will never PAY for this gama again!!-10
Arma 3Do not buy this game there are hackers everywhere and the developers will eat your children and they support ISIS. They also don't care about black people.-11
not as good as arma 3;-1;1
Game is not what i expected. Total waste of money.;-1;0
Arma 3DON'T BUY THAT GAME !! Battleye will global ban you for nothing and you will be banned from all server for nothing and you will have to create another account to buy it with 60$ again  only if you throw money from the windows because its the same thing  its disgusting to do that  the game telling us to leave our account and buy the game 2 time  good job Bohemia you introduce this  (Battleye) to your game to ban all player of your game for no reason and win 2x of money for telling to player to buy it again and again ...-10
It was a bad investment you ask why? well the frames per second were below average even when set at low settings maybe they need to optimize the game a little more i don't know. My recommendation is if you don't have a up to par gaming PC don't buy it.;-1;0
ive been playing arma 2 for about 6 years and this game killed the fun for me. great visual and weapon modifications. however its unplayable in this state and has be for some time.;-1;0
really good game lots of cool fetures i think that if i play this to mutch it will get to a point to where i wont stop  i recemend you buy it   i like it;-1;0
just purchased this game on Dec 26 2014  ARMA 3 - Digital Deluxe Edition does not work on my I7 PC and the game keeps crashing I would like my funds returned to my account on steam.;-1;0
Arma 3This game is aiming to be as realistic as possible with everything about war. It tries to concurent Battlefield (which concurents Call of Duty). That's a huge +  What counter's my positive review is the fact that on either default or lowest settings my FPS cannot exceed 20!  You probably should not buy this game unless you have the highest level of the high-end gaming monsters.-10
ITS SO LAGGY!!!! i even have a really good gaming pc and its still laggy i only get like 4 or 5 fps;-1;0
Can't play multiplayer. Many people has the same problem. I just bought this and it doesn't work.. Just freezes when you try to look for servers.. Money WELL SPENT !;-1;0
Arma 3I personally think Arma 3 is a terrible game and a waste of my money. The campaign is dreadful and the multiplayer is worse.  You can never seem to get a game on multiplayer and when you do you're usally kicked from the server. Campaign... you constantly die and the AI do nothing but also die so you're usaally on your own against an enitre army. This game is not what i expected and no where near what i wanted i wasted £25 on this game.-10
t game. It takes a whole mag to kill someone and it takes on bullet to the knee for you to get instantly killed. And evey Altis life server is t.;-1;0
this game is so laggy when i played this game i thought arma 3 life was in the game already  but this game is ed up lol jks peace :P;-1;0
Arma 3I really hate this game because minecraft is better.-10
MAKE THE GAME ING STABLE.;-1;0
I have just bought the game installed it opened the game and was global banned for no reason terribal game;-1;0
Waste of money too complicated for how much it costs.;-1;0
This games interface is horrible it is not intuitive or natural by any means. Would have loved it if the interface was more like Battle Field 4. Also the game feels very choppy and I am not referring to frame rate. I guess you either love this or hate it do not think this is anything like any other shooter game. I am sure the game will appeal to fans of the previous releases but at this stage I feel like I wasted my money;-1;0
Arma 3It's overall not a bad game but for the price I wouldn't recommend it.  Pros:  * Beautifully detailed world spaces teeming with wildlife * Extremely large maps make for fun and challenging combat as well as virtual site seeing * A nice assortment of weapons and equipment to choose from   Cons:  * Poor help system and no tutorial for new players - One was later added but it was not super useful * Overly complicated and over numbered controls with a large portion of the keyboard being used as well as the mouse * Poor sound effects; especially for guns * For as detailed as the world and NPCs are the guns seem to overall be lacking in both function and appearance * Although certainly more realistic than most FPS games the fatigue system is a little troublesome considering how large the world is and how far you often need to travel from objective to objective without a vehicle. Even walking with an average amount of gear can almost completely stop your progress fairly fast forcing you to stop and rest   Overall score from 0 to 10 10 being the best: 5-6-10
cant play free weekend cause a bug .... if i open the game it just open an emty steam window-.-;-1;0
Why can't Arma 3 be simble to play with friends or remotely. This rarely works. I followed step by step with the ports and ip address. The firewall has been turned off.  any advice?;-1;0
I want my money back !;-1;0
Arma 3I cannot recommend this game for it is virtually unplayable. That is multi player is very much broken. It is so badly optimized you only get maybe 20-30 fps playing it even with new nVidia GTX-980 you get low fps. And it doesn't matter if you lower the graphics has no affect. Which is sad 'cause this game has good potentials. I really wish it was playable but it just isn't. Maybe if you have 10 GTX titan cards...-10
Arma 3decent game but rather shabby compared to arma 2 devlopers cud of done much better stuf but decided not to i cud of done much better job-10
Arma 3I will review this in the form of a story and let you decide for yourself whether this seems like the kind of game for you.  I was playing the Dynamic Universal War System a scenario that puts you into either a random spawn zone or a zone you have chosen and then spawns bases for you to assault. (It's installed using the workshop.)  I had a fairly large group of allied soldiers a 'super squad' if you will consisting of me a medic an autorifleman and a sniper. (All units listed in here are AI.) This was a nighttime operation the first assault on a major enemy base I had ever done. We had a task force consisting of about 6-7 soldiers following behind us moving to back us up but they were about a kilometer away (and running) when we reached the hostile zone and disembarked from our truck.  We disembarked and began moving into the zone on foot and before long ran into our first enemy patrol heading in our direction. We saw them before they saw us and I had the idea to ambush them. There was a small shack to our right so I began positioning my troops around one side putting the sniper on the left side of the road so that we would be firing from two different directions and catch the enemy troops in between us.  I had just moved my last soldier into position when I heard the loud  bang  of a sniper round being fired. There went my perfect plan. I had forgotten to tell my troops to hold their fire so now the enemy knew exactly where we were. I took cover behind the shack as my troops continued to lay down fire desperately trying to take out the enemy now that our only advantage the element of surprise was lost. The enemy soldiers outnumbered us by a large amount; there was at least 8 possibly more and I was still new at the game so I was worth about 1/2 of a regular soldier especially since my computer was fairly laggy back then (this game is NOT a game for low end computers.)  My sniper got taken out first. I heard my character call for a sitrep from the sniper which in this game means your AI allies are as good as dead your character just can't see them. The patrol was steadily advancing toward us still fairly numerous and still extremely dangerous. My autorifleman got tagged next and then it was just me and the medic crouching behind a tiny shack. I used one of my supports that I had purchased earlier in the campaign to call in a helicopter but it would still take some time for it to appear and land we just had to hold out until it did.  The patrol was at the other side of the building by the time the medic got taken out. They had been advancing fairly quickly as they fired moving around us encircling us. Once the medic went down it was just me. I heard the helicopter's blades chopping the air in the distance but knew it wouldn't land in time. Many of them were coming around the corner so I sprayed desperately taking two of them down the others being more careful and staying further back. The medic had been guarding the other side of the building and I realized that it was completely unprotected moments before I got a bullet to the back of the head managing to take down one more attacker.  I heard the sound of the helicopter's side door gunners firing and looked up to see the tracer rounds disappearing over the roof of my tiny shack. The helicopter landed almost daintily and I made a mad dash for the open door hoping to get inside tell them where to go and gtfo. During the dash I took a bullet to the leg and became unable to run. So there I was walking towards the helicopter being EXTREMELY lucky that no bullets were hitting me. By some miracle I managed to get to it climb aboard.... and then the world went black as an explosion deafened me.  In a last ditch effort to take me out one of the hostiles had thrown a grenade. The helicopter was unharmed but I was toast. But that didn't matter to me. All of this happened in like ten minutes if that but it felt like longer. I may be playing it up a tad (this happened a while ago and the mind has a tendancy to make things seem more awesome than they actually are) but I do remember the feeling of 'holy hell.... that actually just happened.... That was freaking awesome.' that hit me as I watched the death information appear on screen. It's a feeling I'm not sure I'll ever forget.  This game has its issues like any other but I personally believe it's a good buy. You may not have my exact experience but you'll make your own and they may be twenty times as epic as mine. You may end up clearing a city using just your teeth and a dead rabbit or maybe an A-164 Wipeout jet dispensing freedom down on those evil village dwellers. It's up to you.  Disclaimer: Game does not include using teeth and dead rabbits to kill enemies. Game does however include using A-164 Wipeout jets the most beautiful of the weapons to dispense freedom and democracy upon those (probably) communist pigs. I mean just look at this: (Note: These guys ARE using weapon and armor mods as well as a map mod but the A-164 is pretty much the same)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5d5qAiU1Ww 10
Arma 3When Battlefield gets realistic and Call of duty loses it competitveness you get Arma 3 the loss in potential in the multiplayer make me want to cry unfair severs hosted by randomers; each with its ridulous rank system. Okay the graphics look amazing but not all of us have a intel i10 processor with 10 GB nvidia graphics card.  The controls are over the top and abnoxious; I dont want to remember what every keyboard does I want to play! So the campain nice but not all that enjoyable when its just go from A to B then trying to shoot some guy while your having hyperventilating.  Overall I think this game is over the top and too focus on realism to the point were gameplay sucks.-10
buying this game for $59.99 is literally my biggest regret on a steam purchase to date.    What a complete mess.;-1;0
 this expensive;-1;0
This game can get very repetitive at times and is still needs alot of patches but i would like it more if it had s big updste;-1;0
Arma 3ARMA 3.  a lot of walking tactical etc. fun.  but the ridiculously mind blowingly stupid AI is so stupid that u wont believe it. do i also need to wipe their rear after they take a dump? it's stupid like hell.  when in danger they cant even run they'll just act smart (even though they're stupid as hell) and walk 'tactically' even though they'll be cut down in no time. these stupid crap cant even take cover properly and stand in the middle of the street. never mind about the cover they cant even follow the player properly.  bloody disgustingly stupid. stupid. stupid. stupid. stupid.  as it stands the AI are just virtual meat shields. i have never completed a mission without all of the STUPID AI dead. and they deserve it for being so mindblowingly and disgustingly stupid.  i only wish that the body parts are detachable in ARMA 3 so that i can view their stupid dismembered corpses because they're so bloody disgustingly stupid that make u go WTF all the time. whenever the AI i lead dies i say 'yeah f u u deserve it. i hope u burn in virtual hell and i hope it also hurts like hell.'  leading the AI is worse than babysitting where the player being the babysitter has to resist the temptation of emptying the entire magazine into their stupid faces every single second of the game.  i hope somebody makes a mod to turn all the AI on the player's side into clowns. because that is exactly wat they are.   ---  now that i got that off my chest time for the actual review. as the story goes the year is 2035... but the NATO forces still wear the old school camouflage. damn stupid decision not to give everyone pixelated uniforms.  also year 2035 where's the TALOS suit? where're the high tech gadgetry that u'd expect? FLIR goggles? NOPE. everything's the same as the 80s or 90s except now u have rifles with different names that's all.  the explosives in the game are totally useless against infantry because there's no chance in hell u'll kill the AI with it. the splash damage is too small damage is too little and this is totally stupid because ARMA 3 claims to be a military simulator. i've been to grenade ranges and let me say that the ballistic glass more than 100 metres away is full of marks from the fragmentation of the grenades. wat do u think that'd do to weak flesh and bones? according to ARMA nothing or nothing a simple first aid cant fix.  oh and lets not forget that every injury can be patched up and the character returned to normal function after some first aid. HA. and u call this a military simulator? total nonsense. this is also why i want to be able to blow limbs off in ARMA. the injury system is STUPID just like the AI. well beside the cool factor of seeing somebody cut into half after getting hit or become a red smear on the floor after getting run over by a tank or have his arm hanging by the skin after getting hit etc. u may say that im being graphic but let me just say that this is supposed to be a military simulator and therefore there is absolutely no need for any type of sanitisation. if anything these are features that were overlooked by developers and needlessly accepted by the ARMA community.  and how come the 'war' is fought by so few soldiers? doesnt make any bloody sense... and where the hell are the civilians again? empty template buildings everywhere. wtf. they could at least spawn some civilians dynamically to keep up the pretenses. and the level designer should go and figure out how many soldiers fght in wars coz the numbers are definitely not so damn low.  anyway   if u want to have fun play multiplayer (but then there're concerns with cheating).  if u want future soldier combat stuff as u'd expect in the year 2035 stay the hell away.  if u want to play single player only forget it. it'll only make your blood boil.  if u r into heavy breathing buy it now. u'll love it because the player character runs out of breath quickly.-10
Arma 3Claims to be realistic very far from it. Your guy wields his weapon like he's never used it before he can't seem to control recoil AT ALL. I can understand recoil being in a game and YOU have to control it but after firing your guy doesn't seem to put his crosshairs back to where it was after shooting but instead leaves it up where it left off AFTER the recoil leading your guy to slowly start aiming towards the sky. Even when you tap fire your gun you are lucky to even hit the enemy but apparenlty the enemy has no trouble at all shooting back at you. You will be lucky to land a bullet or two on them but they are capable of shooting you dead on with out much trouble. Difficult to see any enemies at all but of course the enemy can you see with ease regardless of any cover or anything you use. This game claims to be 'realistic' but to me it seems far from that its almost like it tries too hard to be realistic and instead leads to a harder game and does everything harder than it would be in real life. Not saying that I could wield any AR and fire away with 100% accuracy but if I were in a real shoot-out I doubt the enemy will just do a 180 and look straight at me and shoot instantly with high accuracy. I tried to enjoy the game but it has just too many issues with it imo to make it feel like it truly is realistic but instead a game that is just ment to  you off. Too many moments that just don't make sense like I stated before such as enemies noticing you instantly their accuracy vs yours I even fired my gun and saw the bullet hit a boulder near me.....-10
Arma 3Complex Toxic Community IDK-10
Arma 3In the tutorial I couldn't open my compass. And in the first level I died like 3 times at the same spot. It wouldn't let me save my progress.   The graphics really aren't that great and it's a simplistic game very slow paced.   I guess if you want a really realistic experience then yes but you could always just join the military. If you're looking for a FUN game this is not it.-10
Very Boring IMO;-1;0
Arma 3Mostly broken clunky and fully dependent on the modding community.-10
Arma 3Arma 2 is still better even this far after Arma 3's release.-10
personly it was a waste of money. i did not like it what so ever;-1;0
Arma 3So this game runs fine but seriously with the 80% off deal a week after I bought it? What's up with these stupid scams? Steam &amp; these games need to schedule upcoming deals &amp; offers. I've wasted 100$+ on scammed deals.-10
Arma 3cant play itgame execution not found-10
Arma 3bad game first impression in the multiplayer i got into heli with random player so alot lags! the heli fly forward suddenly It flew backwards and it repeats itself after 5 minute pilot committed suicide with me -_- So I decided to play the gameplay story mode... i got i died so many times i could not progress in the game there are moments I could Save and a lot more moments i could not Save the game running 300 m in the forest really?! and die in the process and do it again more 100 m!?!!!! so I quit  I think I'm going back to play Battlefield 4-10
this game is odly boring and the games are always never enough;-1;0
I am not have any Hack tool in my computer But this gmae have banned me. I can't play Arma3 Mods Altis Life now.;-1;0
Arma 3Requires DLC to use some of the guns booo 4.4/10-10
Arma 3Insanely boring. After the first few days of playing I finished the campaign and went into multiplayer. Once you finish the campaign there is absolutely nothing to do because nearly every server on the multiplayer is either broken or the same thing as the last one.-10
Arma 3After the very high paywall for the initial game they try and charge you 16 dollars just for a weapon pack of 7 guns which effectively doubles the amount of the vanilla weapons. This game seems like a cash-in like most triple-A titles.-10
i feel this game should heve included some form of a gta like free roam cause I was kinda expecting to have the oportunity to explore the world I'm aware that there were mods that could make this happen but I dont realy like having mods take up more memory space of a game that is already about ten gigabites;-1;0
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE A MOD TO FIX CONTROLLS SO THAT ITS SIMILAR TO COD OR BATTLEFIELD WHEN USING A CONTROL;ER;-1;0
Do you like ingame ads that make the game unplayable for a few seconds at random? Do you want to explore large environments and find guns you might not be able to use simply because you haven't paid for that particular one yet? I found a ghillie suit! is it the DLC one?! that ones extra!! Fly in helicopters that spam you with ads for DLC and since every server is running it now you'll have no choice but to buy that too to get rid of them.   Effectively the popular mod community servers have been ruined for anyone that does not own the DLC. So count on paying 92 dollars for this game to actually enjoy those and thats really the only reason to play it.;-1;0
Arma 3If you grew up playing call of duty kind of games this isn't for you. I can safely say that because I did grow up on playing fps like call of duty and this game is a little too real. Could never get the aiming right I must have shot at a guy 100000 times and never killed anyone huge map so it takes awhile to even see anyone. But if you want super realisitc this is for you!-10
Arma 3ARMA is still clunky frustrating innaccurate Garbage I like the scale bullet drop and the selection of weapons/vehicles that's it but interface and interaction is recycled Junk the immersion is ruined by the inaccuracies of the game 'cant Jump cant climb fences cant run more than 4 feet without dying of exhaustion etc:' can't effectively interact with your environment AI is the worst i have ever seen in any game since Goldeneye for N64 engine is horribly inefficient and clunky (I can run it at Maximum Settings With 60 FPS No Problem but it dose not look as good as it should for the load it puts on ones pc and it dose not even use all of my cpu/gpu to do it...... it is not a simulator it is a frustrating exercise in lazy coding and very poor interaction the 'Inventory System' is Garbage and ruins immersion. all they did was add new models and up the poly count compared to ARMA 2 they need a smoother feel of interaction in their games and no 3rd person view whats the point in making a game 'realistic' when you can switch to this magical 3D Camera and you spend a lot of time digging through menus rather than playing a game. BF4 with More animations/Timers for actions would be more realistic. and a basic inventory system would smoke ARMAs broken  if EA where ever to make a game world in the Frostbyte engine that is that large. ARMA is a slow clunky bore fest that kills any allure of a tactile feel with the hobbled game play and clunky unrealistic mechanics this game should only be played with a group of friends and w/mods that fix some of this is the only way to go. even still it is pretty bad that the modders and gaming community have to be relied apron to make the game better because obviously Bohimian don't know how to innovate. and the ridiculous aiming sway is beyond the most  and the most inaccurate thing i have ever seen because when i was 13 years old i could reliably hit targets out 150m out with iron sights on a 15 year old 308 and the characters in ARMA have a furious shootout @ 50-100M without hitting  or the sway going crazy! and this is with Bleading edge Tech in both their weapons and sighting systems and a soldier with years of training and experiance..... and I am no expert marksman don't believe me take a trip to the range it isn't that hard to prove me right here.-10
Arma 3I wish i could like this game i really do. but after about three days of trying to get microsoft .net frameworks to install for the game trying over 28 differnet solutions found on the internet and trying to get help on the phone from microsoft them selves i at last wiped my entire computer to factory settings.... finally was this my moment of truth was i gonna be able to play this game? i was sadly wrong after udating windows and my drivers restarting my computer twice i downloaded steam and installed Arma 3 took about a half hour total download and install including the first time start up finally i see the arma start up menu.... im excited at this point 3 days of constant strugle to get this one game working i click campaign and it asks me about the bootcamp tutorial thing i go yah why not ill do it to get used to controls it loads up to something that can be described as an open plane with cubes here and there with a blue soldier with camo gear on it says arma 3 bootcamp i sit there waiting for something to tell me what to do few minutes go by im getting bored of waiting so i start pressing every button trying to move look around some thing anything.... i found only ne button that did anything it was the ESC button. so after about 15 minutes of that non sense i decide to just jump inot the campaign hoping that it will teach me the ropes along the way.... i load up the game it tells me to walk about twenty feet to a heli and hop in so i do. after what seems like a 5 minute heli ride we land and it tells me to go report in after figuring out i had to just walk up to one soldier and have him salute me i wonderd what i did wrong because when i walked up to him it said check point complete and that was it for about 8 minutes where i wonderd around went back to him pressed a bunch of buttons cause no one said anything no text popped up nothing finnaly after those 8 minutes it gave me three objectives right in a row get in a truck drive to outpost/road block and then drive some where else..... i got into the truck drove to the check point/road block and....... i waited and i waited some more and more turned the truck off backed up pulled forward almost hit the guy turned of the truck waited said well maybe im supposed to jusat run the guy over and break through the barricade. nope dont do that you fail and have to restart the whole objective over again from the heli after you all ready waited 20 minutes at the road block..... i tried again three more times i now have 5 hours on record and i have not even started the game yet im gonna give this game a 1/10 because of graphics only cause all i saw was a good looking game that i couldnt do anything in.... 1/10 probably gonna refund waiting simulator 2015-10
I would have recomended this game but now it doesn't really work anymore and like 2 months ago it worked on my computer bu now its well ;-1;0
Unoptimized garbage;-1;0
i hated this it was boring and my multiplayer and campaign do not work five minutes into playing;-1;0
Arma 3The DLCs are disrespectful towards the players.  ArmA mostly deserves a very good reputation due to it's fanbase and community modding content. By adding content you have to pay for they are not only screwing with their loyal customers but spamming you with advertisement if you do not own the DLC for the VEHICLE / whatever you want to use. It's a shame because ArmA 3 is such a great game. Just like ArmA 2. But because of this I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Milking the cow is one thing but forcing you to drink out of it's udder is udderly nauseating.-10
Arma 3I love the Multiplayer But when i play campaign the enemy's shoot me threw the wall-10
Arma 3Arma 3 is an amazing tactical shooter with huge maps and a whole list of game modes. But After the big patch the game crashes every 10-20 minutes. This has gotten me banned from servers for 'combat Logging' even though it isnt my fault.-10
Arma 3This is the most bugged game you will find on Steam. Believe me the amount of frustration it will bring you is so high that you will leave bad feedback on it even if you do not leave feedback for games ever. This game has very nice idea and would be one of the best shooting/simulation games if it was done by any other developer.  Don't buy it if you don't want to suffer constant frustration because of bugs. And obviously buy it if you like to be constantly stuck/crashed/etc.-10
my honest opinion its good it really is but for it price No its not its bugy lagy broken at times with really bad frame issues (ONLINE) campain runs smoth 60+ frames ect but Online dosen't mods are prety awesome and It dosent matter how powerful your computer is your frames will drop but if you can icnore that and tweek your settings just right this game is posibley worth buying and only if you can pick it up for like £10 £15 IS acceptable one the sales so at this price and state hell no it not worth buying;-1;0
Arma 3Features one of the worst aiming systems ever made in a video game (if you manage to kill someone it will be by sheer luck). Combine that with  poor ai an unnecessarily complicated inventory system random deaths to invisible landmines and voice acting which is at the level of X-Rebirth and you get Arma 3. One of the single most unfun experiences of my life and Ive seen Razorlight live.-11
I really need help here! When i startup the game it freezes when i load the bohemia interactive logo and i tried all the standard methods of fixing the issue yet nothing worked. Does anyone else have the same issue and/or know how to fix the issue?;-1;0

Arma 3Arma 3...Don't do it. I would absolutely not recommend that anyone purchase this title especially from Steam. I had so much trouble getting a new button mapping to save properly that by the time I decided to attempt to get a refund from Steam they told me I had exceeded their 6 hour requirement (I hadn’t even completed the tutorial section of the game). As for the game itself it feels incredibly clunky and cumbersome and just overly complicated. Graphically its just so so even on the highest settings. I cant speak as to whether or not the core gameplay is decent since I didn't get that far but what I did see just seemed very disappointing.  Lesion I learned from this title is 1) do more research before purchasing a questionable title and 2) think twice about giving Steam my money in the future. -10
My bro told me to get this game itsawsome i think its just a steming pile of Arma wish i could get my money back o well 20/20 hindsite;-1;0
Arma 3Bad things:  - Very poorly optimized. Unless you can afford a 2000 dollar gaming PC you will play this with constant 15 FPS no matter if you set graphics to High or Low no matter how good your PC is. This game is like pre-alpha it's like it can't detect your system and it will go full r*tard with 15 FPS no matter what you do.  - You must spend hours googling for complicated scripts in order to enjoy Editor mode. You actually can't dress up your soldier and give the items you want. It's like: you want to have 2 medkits on your soldier instead of one? Maybe put your magazines in a different slot on start-up? Too bad. Feel free to browse thousands of forum topics to find the very script you actually need to do these kind of things.  Good things:  - It is actually possible to press Escape Leave game confirm by clicking Yes and enjoy a well-optimized fun game.-10
This game blows.. period.;-1;0
This game is completely a waste of my money... I have all of the minimum and also recommended requirments its says but the game still runs on 20fps-30fps on the lowest settings possible. Dont buy this game unless you are fine with 30fps and lower lol.;-1;0

Arma 3I have deciced to change my review. This is based on me seeing the community of Arma.  It's one of the worst bunch of people you can find. Guys that enjoy harassing others in the games because they can't do it in real life. A bunch of squeekers saying 'hands up' and shooting you in the face after they rob you. Basically a heaven for bullies.  A game where you can rarely find some teamwork unless you join a gang. Then it's way more fun but even when that happens you can't really feel like you can enjoy the game to the fullest if you are not a psychopath that can't stop killing every person in town he/ sees.   I think these people should be hospitalized most of the time. So no if you feel like you like to earn some money be a HELPFUL guy to others do not even bother buying this crap.  I only got one thing from being helpful - bullets. This isn't an army simulator this is a nerve wrecking piece of crap of a game. And not because the game is  but because people are .-10
Do not reccomend this game unless you have a good pc. my pc is twice as good as it needs to be but i get 30FPS SINGELPLAYER... dont even talk about multiplayer...;-1;0
Arma 3Didn't work well with amd fx 8320 amd r9 270x 16GB ram. Only got 15-25fps...-10
Arma 3the controls on this game are ing  you spend 50% of in game time trying to make them less -10
Arma 3Wasn't a fan personally. The graphics are phenomenal the single player is cool as  but I got it wayyyyyy too late in the game to get involved in multiplayer and for that I cannot reccommend this game to new people. Its a tough community to join.-10
what a load of ;-1;0
I'll sum up this game with an arma 3 life experience  Friend buys a car I steal the car I drive the car into the ocean Friend gets  off Friend will never play arma 3  11/10- ing would never play again over *walkie talkie sound*;-1;0
Arma 3Dont waste your money aiming with the crosshair jumping up and down if there right on ur LOS.. Ingame controls are just rubish. Wanna swap Guns ? press ur jump key (space bar) roll mouse wheel select gun... Couldnt just have the guns on 1234567.... rather they have radio comms on 12345... tons of silly stuff like this.  Good engine just poorly thrown together.-10

Arma 3was so happy when i buyed the game! ended up with getting so frustrated on the developers or whoever made this game.. and here is why: cant play multiplayer because name is invalid. tryes to change name: you cannot change name tryes to leave the name changing in arma 3 Invalid name.. please change your name.(and then please go read this again and you will see how iritating it is to force shutdown just to get unstuck from changing name) does it on steam: arma 3 still wont change. tryes other ways. still dosnt work! fix this and il make another review that is actualy posetive. ( sry that im not juging by the things i can do in single player but i only buyed the game cause of playing online... sooo....  happens... )-10
same reason as payday 2  too much DLCs;-1;0
Too many sweaty american ex-veterans. Too little kids to annoy.;-1;0
if you have a GTX 980 the firmware is incompatibale with this game... meaning you can not play it... FPS is insanly low...  and befor anyone yells at me i would like to state  my AVG FPS with my gtx 980 is about 16-20 fps  my AVG FPS with my GTX580... 40-60 FPS...   what i am trying to say is that if you have the newest gen gards they preform worse on this game then older gen cards because both card companys and this dev team just dont give a crap about this game...   with that said the game is ALOT of fun IF you can get over the fact that even with either of thoughs 2 cards and frame rates.... its hard to play because the game engine itself chokes your computer hard;-1;0
Arma 3FOR THE CONDENSED VERSION SEE THE BOTTOM OF THE REVIEW  Arma 3 is an immersive challenging and fun mil-sim in which players can do pretty much whatever they want. There are 2 maps (not counting virtual reality world). These maps are not the tiny arena fps style maps. They are sandbox environments that include multiple towns and cities. First is Stratis a medium sized island that includes 1 main airfield several military camps and towns and 1 medium-large city. Secondly is Altis a HUGE and open yet annoyingly desolate and deserted island. Altis has 4 airfields (if you count the dry lakebed runway) several cities and numerous towns. Altis can be a little boring with less than 50 players on a server as the map is too large for low-population servers. Altis can also seem very empty and frustrating without vehicles which brings me to the next topic. There are less vehicles and weapons available in arma 3 than there were in arma 2 even if you purchased helis karts and marksmen dlc. There is a huge gap in the weapon diversity so far as there being NO shotguns in the game at all (mods can fix this). Speaking of mods Bohemia has done a great job with mod support. There are only 2 problems with modding arma 3. 1: Good luck trying to find a server with all of the mods you want to play with. 2: Some mods a lot of the time not even graphics mods can significantly hurt the already poor performance of the game. Thankfully Arma 3 has an awesome editor that you can use to make any kind of mission you want. Bohemia also made a set of tools for modders to use. Bohemia added weapon attachments a huge step forward for infantry but unfortunately the awful fatigue system will often cause you to not be able to run when running is a huge part of the game especially on altis. The game itself plays much much smoother than arma 2 did. Obviously it being the newer arma game it has much better graphics animations and physics. For performance Inte/Nvidia users should get decent framerates (assuming you aren't running a 480 and an I3) but AMD users particularly those using AMD CPU's/APU's tend to be stuck below 40fps. My GPU is an R9 285 and my CPU/APU is an A-10 7850k and I get 70fps in singleplayer but 40 fps in multiplayer (My internet connection is fine I don't have problems with it in other games or applications). Hopefully Dx12 will help with this but for now AMD users are having trouble getting decent framerates.   Condensed Version  Pros: Satisfying gunplay Open world Amazing editor Good graphics Weapon Attachments  Cons: Terrible optimization expecially for AMD users Not a lot of weapons and vehicles Annoying fatigue system Altis is SO empty and way too large for most servers  Conclusion  Arma 3 is great game and you should try it. However it does have problems that you must know before buying it. FOR AMD 8-CORE FX USERS: I've heard that disabling 4 of the 8 cores seems to help but try it at your own risk.10
Arma 3Arma 3 would be great game (seen my cousin and some streamers play it) looks awesome and stuff completed training too but when I try to play multiplayer cant connect to servers.. every server I try I can't even get to the lobby. Tried everything but nothing. Thanks alot for nothing-11
Do not buy this game untill developers fix this problem! you will be sad a lot... (explaining the reason in following)  shortly demostration whom needs visual proof:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMdzwanxnY   for those whom just wants to read: This game's engine is not using your graphics card &amp; cpu properly to give you a good gameplay. even if you have 3000$ gaming rig the best you can get is 20-40fps.   If i put every single graphics to very low or disabled(shadow etc.) ... i get 22 fps... If i put everything to ultra settings including AA &amp; renders guess how much i get... ... ... 21FPS! ... ... this game is veeeery badly optimized and engine is failing hard on hardware usage. Developers are not caring about the issue since arma 2 its same problem all around!;-1;0
WHY IS YOUR ING GAME BROKEN??!! I TRY TO INSTALL AND IT JUST DELETES ITSELF..;-1;1

Crap performance on perfectly capable AMD system 6core 4Ghz + R9 290.  5 cores sitting idle and the GPU at 70% of clock frequency and half the time idle.;-1;1
BattleEye is ing aids and banned me for no reason.;-1;1
Arma 3i bout the game cause it was on sale for 50% off the orignal price every server i tried to join had DLC included so i could not enjoy the game as it was for almost1 hour i tried to understand why my screen was black after i joined a game and all kinds of weird stuff was happening i could not even join server at first cause of missing DLC it was like 99% of the servers. to even play on DLC server you have to pay like $50 for all the DLC so its 1/2 the game you buying. dudes and gals this game is not worth on its own.-11
Arma 3This game runs like .   I have a good Pc.   8350 black edition 16gb ram windforce 280x.   I spend hours tweaking settings unparking my cpu cores and im lucky to get 30FPS.   Multiplayer is like 15 fps and unplayable.   Skip this game if you don't want to tweak your PC hardcore and still get .   Also apparently this game works much better with intel chips.-11
Arma 3Arma 3 is a game for elite gamers and people that are into military games experienc eor very much traing is needed... this game has a skillgrade of 4/5. it is boring you get easily tired of it and its difficult to get in the community.-11
Arma 3lag even on my dual titan x's-11
its to glitchy;-1;1
Got this game while it was free and it was awesome. Now it says I have to pay for it?!?;-1;1
It would be great if I wasn't locked under 25 fps. Don't buy if you have AMD FX 8350/8320! You get terrible performance no matter what settings you put it on.;-1;1
Its really ing  because no inspect weapon nor knife;-1;1
This was my first experience in arma 3 Spawned in altis life find two guys they shout at me to get on the ground I got on the ground they got my clothes off they  me they put me in their car they made me get out in the forest naked they ran me over 1000000 times   11-10 would get  again;1;1
Piece of crap game;-1;1
My brother doesnt talk to me because he is always playing with his friend andy.;-1;1
Arma 3Okay I have a lot to say about this game.  I LOVE the game - Well In theory. I run the game at medium settings at 1080p and i rarely get above 33FPS on by Radeon R9 280X OC Edition. THIS MUST BE SAID AND HEARD: -THE GAME RUNS LIKE **** Arma devs need to get their poop in the group an dfix this game optomization is Terrible. There are a lot of bugs and glitches. They seem to be adding more features like guns and vehicles but they need to focus on the ISSUES AT HAND.  The only reason i'm giving this 'thumbs down' is becasue it just has too many issues and that's a major problem. The game itself i really love.-11
I was ban in the first week of the game for no reason then the tards at battleye respond to my message with an automated bot!;-1;1
DO NOT GET THIS GAME you will be able to play it for a couple days then battleye will read a false positive and global ban you without a refund or lifting the ban DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY;-1;1
Arma 3BIS has pretty much ruined the game now. Most servers relied on donator perks to get people to donate so they could keep up the good servers they were running. BIS has sent them all nice emails telling them that they would take legal action against them all if they did not stop. So now all the good server have gone to crap as they cannot afford to keep them up. Stay away from this game. Don't give evil companies like this any more cash to fund their greed. Shame on you BIS. What a shame it was a pretty good game despite your lack of any ambition to fix very well known bugs.-11
some money i will always regret.;-1;1
Arma 3In the last 15 years i played a lot of games from every kind of Genre. This game is so far one of the worst games i have ever played. Simply to say it is unfinished. Even when the Game Design is not bad this Shooter is an Bug &amp; Glitch Massacre.  Most of my time playing in Multiplayer i had to relog or to respawn cause of an Bug or Glitch. For an Studio which say that they have hundreds of workers this is a joke. The Map which i played on was mostly Altis and the enviroment was horrible. It Felt like they had a total amount of 100 enviroment assets for the whole map. The Ground you are walking on is painted in green or brown. Even when the Game got a lot of Mods which are repeating with small changes the Game is not worth buying it. This is my first Review because i normally dont have the desire to tell others my opinion but this time i had the intense feeling to warn you guys.   Total Rating: 2/10  Purchase not recommended    Arma 3 it is the Assassins Creed Unity of the Shooters.-11

Arma 3This game is worth way to much for how lazy the Devs Are. This is the Last game I am getting from this Dev Team. Jets are OP in the sense that they can spam explosive Cannons before you can even Render them in. And when you are in the jet it seems like the flares are usless. It seems like I have to pump a full mag into someone sitting still before they die Dsync plays a huge role. Mortors are to damn OP. You can spam the rounds from thousands of meters away and with little sound to find out where they are coming from. This is a Review based without the MODs SO take it as you will.-10
Playing this on ultra=5-10 fps Playing this on high=10-15 fps Playing this on medium=15-20 fps Playing this on low=20-40 fps  IGN= 1000000000000000000/10;1;1
Arma 3Server browser is literally useless and the game runs like crap. The game basicly requires 3rd party software just to play LAN because the built in system doesn't work. I did some googling and I'm not the only one with this problem but they don't even acknowledge the fact that setting up a LAN party without downloading a bunch of malware ridden 3rd party apps is impossible.-11
Arma 3I've had nothing but problems and errors when trying to play this game and it's gotten to the point that I had to come here and rave about it because nobody online has a solution. I can't play the game for more than 10 minutes before my fps suddenly drops to 5 and stays that way until I restart my game or it crashes. I've tried everything I can to fix this and I cannot. Fix your damn game.-11
Arma 3This game is very frustrating and satisfying at the same time. The main reason why I cannot recommend this game is that it is very buggy and full of glitches. The developers have not worked out many issues that are very big game changers that can really ruin the game for you. As a military sim it is pretty accurate and action packed but not very realistic at all. The physics in this game is really garbage. The singleplayer is more aggravating than fun no one really plays it. The vanilla Arma 3 is unplayable the real fun is in the mods. With the amount of hours I have on this game I know much of the ins and outs of this game and I am appalled that it still isn't in alpha/beta with the amount of stuff wrong with it. The developers need to get back on this game and fix all the stuff thats wrong with it instead of coming out with DLCs that ruin the game even more.-11
Arma 3Was banned from dayz since they had battle eye cant play arma because ban was carried over from another game. Dont buy if you were banned on any battle eye server-11
Very complicated game. No one helps you in game they just kill you and tell you to learn to play... how can i learn to play when you keep killing me?  Don't buy this game.;-1;1
Arma 3So I truly love this game its a boots on the ground super realistic Military simulater. I put about 80 hours into it in about 6 dayhs which is a decent ammount even w/ school but there is one flaw... I CANT RUN THIS GAME FOR . Even the the LOWEST setting possible the resolution on 1280 by 720 and 4:3 normal I still can barley clinch 20 fps on a 80 player King Of The HIll server........ AT SPAWN... dont even get me started about the actuall battle. Now part of that problem is the host just being lazy and getting the server files from someone else and not taking the time to optomize the game for everyone not just me. The other half the beefy  engine that the game is on which my make the game stunning yet it nearly crashed my pc. I tried playing single player and it make about a 10fps difference... I just wish Bohemia could make some optimize changes thats all. to back up my claim here is a really good video that goes into alot od depth of my topic.    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cYNcnJvWH4)  THANK YOU TO THE MAKER I DIDNT MAKE THE VIDEO!!!! -10
UI covered with Must-Buy-Apex. No option to remove Apex DLC. /Uninstall;-1;1
Arma 3This game is a beautiful PC exclusive experience which boasts itself to be a openworld sandbox type which it true. But that does not matter if the game can't give me above 25FPS on a modded server with 30 players. Dont get me wrong I was exited about this game and its single player performance is awesome but the mutiplayers preformance is sub par. If you are buying this game for the mutiplayer don't. Its not worth it.  Modable and customizable to the extent that you can turn this game into a dating sim: YES  Get above 30 FPS while doing that: NO  P.S: I have a GTX 970 and a i5-4690 and I played this game on high (25 FPS) then standard (34 FPS but looks very bad) and lowest settings (57 FPS looks like a 2006 game) settings in mutiplayer mode on a  UN MODDED  server with 50 players. -11
Not worth the money. -_-;-1;1
Arma 3What i said below is useful for the single player and MP has playable framesbipodsthough some rock formations arent deployable that look like they should and i should be able to deploy a bipod when leaning on a door or a hallway(dev buildthis could change) in the way you would want.Even on TDM no killing desync but i cant join %90 of the servers and its because i have a later version of this game on accidentit may be battleye client thinking if im afk on multiplayer for too long.In Arma 2 OAi would be just fine after disabling mods though i can join a server in Arma 2 OA and i guesstemp download the mods or maybe permantely though if bohemia is too lazythey can renable if i have them in folder and im joining a server that requires 3rd party mods.Plusabout Arma 3 it dosent matter which profile i use or if its new though if im rightthen bohemia should fix it or scrap it for user punishments (WHEN A ADMIN ISNT AVAILBLE THOUGH THERE CAN BE A VOTE FOR HIM though i think this is in arma 2 OA) were theres a admin chat everyone can use if theres no admin to state why they are voting to ban/kick someone.For the noclippers have beacons with usernames near them that any player can choose who plusbe able to spectate them butsince that can reveal a FOB or a couple of snipersmaybe not.For tkershave auto-slays that end in a day ban if you tk 5 times.Same for spammingsame text 3 times and a day ban.This last one may be a strech because i think cheaters broke this butif a shot hits from 1.5 clicksthat should be a auto MP ban for 2 months or if possiblehave a software search thats connected by playwithsix so theres no false positives say you need to remove from arma 3 folder.Or they can do what the battlefield series does but have you stats stored on your hard drive and use the BIS forums or valves servers and salvage thier stats or auto-ban(obvious) especially when the game can keep track of stats which should be easy to find and have users decide if they feel the need to ban or kick based on ip or key ban which battleye already uses or VAC ban but with the famliy sharing exploit which could likely be solved by using steam id and having games or linking to anti-cheatsgo through and check for kicks/bansuse ip bans for now and if no one comesa admin will get a alertand do the job and last but not leasthave a you were killed by and be able to copy/paste his name on notepad or chat and username automatically get sent to BIS valveoryour MP files called supicious players but then againpeople have to type -nologs to make multiplayer playable.  now lets talk about content.Yes it is a shame bohemia didnt just port thier arma 2 units to A3 standards but the real outrage IMO is no base Shotguns(pump action manual reloadthink over and under) knives and sniper rifles that actually have the model turning the bolt because wef shows it dosent have to eat away at performance and Armor interiors butother dev teams shy away from the idea but againtheres mods for it.

(Gtx750latest driversrefer to day0forum postyoutube and arma launcher options) (this dosent work as well on AMD chipswtf bohemia)  The ai has had a improvement from my last statement by not shooting through the smokesometimes branching off and flanking more but they are still hit or miss on taking good cover(they do so about %60 of the time and thier skill is all the way up and persion is self-explaintory) and even shoot out in the open without running to flank(in squads) or in short bursts only.In the woods(dev buildthis could change)they dont or barely take cover behind rocks but reliably on trees.In urban enviromentsthey dont go up another story unless you tell them to and they need to not see ahead of them and then lean . Previously they did and did not take cover and seems to react to you faster than arma 2 meaning they arent on a slow swivel chair they dont to flank you unless there are more of them or there are many objects in the waythough dead accurate past normal but you can make custom ai settings and there GL5(Group Link 5) which is a arma ai mod that the team has been making since operation flashpoit check armed assualt info and armaholic for mods and check arma 3 then islands and you'll see porting tools and if you dont like altis and stratis there will be maps for itit usualyl takes modders 2-3 years to make a good map though i see 20-30 on armaholic.   last thing about single playerif you like ithate the campaign and zeuseither download the dyamic universal war system which dosent try to build a situation at buildings or thick woods so its as random as can be so it could be plainsor literally 1000+ senarios to be surprised mutiplayer has enough people playing on zeus servers or sector control  and domination though admittedly its mostly altis life and team deathmatch and battle royale(taking weapons on the ground and killing contestants with zones you will be auto killed in).

For the crust: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-by-13-inch pan with butter.  2. Stir together the flour sugar and salt. Add the butter to the bowl and use a pastry cutter to cut it all together until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press into the prepared pan and bake until golden around the edges about 20 minutes.  3. For the filling: Stir together the sugar and flour. Crack in the eggs and whisk to combine. Add the lemon zest and juice and mix until combined. Pour over the crust and bake about 20 minutes.  4. Allow to cool in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours then sift powdered sugar over the top before cutting into squares.  (Use an 8 x 10 pan if you'd like the layers to be a little thicker.)11
I can't play multiplayer it just sits there on the browse server screen without any servers!!!;-1;1
Arma 3games way 2 hard 2 play u need to get a college degree in arma just to be ight in this game.-11
Arma 3GRAPHICS 10/10 GAMEPLAY CONCEPT ATMOSPHERE 0/10 ... Piece o' sh*t waste of money.. ARMA2 was way better!-10
iest game ever when i try to go multiplayer it gives me the ing option for   bootcamp and i can select yes or no and when i select no it doesn't do a singel  and when i select yes it pus me in this mothering bootcamp;-1;1
Arma 3wtf it still says im 1.58 when all the servers are 1.64 how do i make it update ;(-11
Arma 3Don't waste your money. The game has been out for 2 years and there are still bugs and glitches with even the smallest of things in this game. Especially with collision detection. Knowing most will buy this game to play Altis Life the only time you will have good FPS when playing online is if you have a fast connection and a fast PC. Avoid if possible. Would be a good game if it wasn't so broken and badly optimized.-11
just like dayz cant build a game for there life lagg clunk clunk awfull game down to 14 fps at times on any setting and dont give any crap about your pc int up to it  bad port crap;-1;0
game is ok and all but if you expect it to be realistic then you are wrong have fun emptying more than half of your mag into a guy 50m away and he lives;-1;0
Arma 3TL;DR: Bad optimization but amazing graphics Fantastic versatility though lacking in total content a bit lacking on equipment but overall enjoyable 9/10   Lets start with the infantry combat 9.5/10  I LOVE the infantry combat in A3 it is incredibly immersive and intense. One of my biggest issues in shooters is movement it always feels too restrictive in this case the different ways in which I can move and lean in order to stay in cover or provide a good shooting position are fantastic. The recoil and the fatiuge although irritating are very well done the infantry wheight system as a whole is enjoyable and just adds to the experience. The only bad thing I have to say about infantry is the weapons the variety is somewhat lacking. Yes the attatchment system is fantastic and at first it seems like you have alot of guns to choose from but even with apex the majority are just copies of a base gun with different barrell lengths and stocks.  Next Vehicles. 9/10 Driving in Arma 3 is an enjoyable experience the helicopter flight models are great as are the vehciles no real complaints here. My problem is with jets. The flight models feel clunky and are overall just not fitting with the rest of the vehicle models. Another problem with the jets is that each faction only has one NATO: A futuristic A-10 CSAT: An arma version of the Yak - 130 which is a light attack aircraft and AAF: the Buzzard which we all remember as the Albatross from A2. The problem with this is that all of these are mainly ground attack aircraft the buzzard is the only one with an AA configuration and it still sucks you may find yourself wishing for a bit more variety here. Now onto the good things.  Barring jets the vehciles feel solid and are really fun to drive and fly [even the jets with their clunky flight models]. Vehicle mounted guns are just really fun to use the heavier things like tanks especially so with their auto ranging and lock functions.  Finally the engine and game content These are really my biggest problems with Arma 3: AI and Content. Lets start with content. Take away all the DLC that costs money [everything save for zeus] and you are left with some pretty restrictive choice there is almost no variety. Even with all the pricey DLC after a while equipment still feels lacking regardless if its Guns Cars Helicopters or Jets everything is a bit too small of a category.  Next we have AI. The. God. Damn. Proximity. Detection. This AI detection is some of the most irritating stuff ive ever seen especially for ZEUS missions. it makes stealth near impossible sometimes.   Finally I want to talk about versatility This review is recommending you buy Arma 3 I've pointed out the flaws but how I still love most of the systems. Even AI which ive complained about being a pain in the  for ZEUS im still a Zeus fanatic. The biggest selling point to me for A3 is the sheer versatility of the game. You can do things ranging from the most extreme milsim missions to extreme life roleplay to dicking around with zombies. The game is incredibly versetaile in the different ways you can use it and I love this and the sheer beauty of the graphics only adds to this. Yes its lacking in content and optimization and even though I want these fixed they dont stop me from enjoying the hell out of this.  Again overall 9/10 I highly reccomend you buy this if you like simulation regardless if its life or military. It may have a steep learning curve but its worth the time 10
the  devs made this game run off 2 cores. IF YOU HAVE A AMD PROCESSOR DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. csgo=300fps overwatch= 100+fps gta v= 60-90fps arma 3 =25-35 fps mostly around 30 unplayable.;-1;0
I played the ARMA series crazy! hours after hours..  But since ARMA III i don't have the feeling to play it more then 1 hour..  Armed assault and Arma II are the best out of the series   I hope ARMA IIII is not ''futuristic'' but just back to how it is right now.;-1;1
Worst update ever;-1;0
Arma 3Ignoring all the performance and optimization issues I can't really recommend Arma 3. It seems so good on paper but there are just too many issues. Most recent example... progress in the single player campaign is not saved reliably. Even if you remember to manually save your progress you are quite likely to start two or three missions back when you resume. My game is stuck in an unexplained death after a long 'free look cutscene'. Too irritating to deal with right now... Developers may have overshot there ability.-10
dont buy if u dont owna $500 to 600 gpu or it in sucks;-1;0
Arma 3Sucks big time!!! I have a i5 @ 3.0Ghz 250Gb ssd R7 260 ati with 2Gb 4Gb ram 600W power Windows 7 home premium 32bit and the damn thing says that my adapter does not support Direct X 10... It took me 3 days to download from server. I have 50Mbps internet connection and when finaly it was complete it didn't even start!!!  Sucks big time!!!-10
Arma 3Absolutltely NO  big No do not buy this game.  This game is super worked is for geeks that like details to te point that is no fun. To many keys to hard to figure stuff and when you figure it you need to many keys to make it happen. I buy it if i could have the chance again to not bui it i would not buy this game. Grafics = awsome hard worked like i said a game for perfectionists but a common folk will HAVE NO FUN.  NOT RECOMENDED-10
It always glitches out and messes up.;-1;0
Arma 3 optimisation. Similar to ARMA II. Really poor on Bohemia's part after having generated so much revenue from the Day-Z mod you would htink they could afford to spend some of the money working on proper optimisation for AMD builds. However this runs nearly as badly as the standalone. If you have an AMD 8 or 6 Core CPU DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. You will be hoping for 20 fps max. Thats what I get with 2 7770s in crossfire.   In terms of the game itself it takes itself too seriously resulting in boring missions and overly difficult controls and playing style. It wouldn't be a bad thing for ultra realism but the game struggles with basic manouverability moving your character feels clunky and jerky not fluid as it should. The control layout is very strange and adopts a unique style which personally I am not a fan of however the control re-mapping system is solid. Visually the game looks great however it feels more like a ing slideshow with the FPS you recieve on AMD machines. Gameplay wise you find yourself far to often with your nose touchign the screen squinting to see hostile NPCs that are supposed to be kilometres away from you that you are expeced to hit with a seemingly hugely innacurate red dot sight. Perhaps the game is so realistic that as a solidier you aren't given the correct equipmnet for the situation but truthfully it just feels lazily done and not thought out.    6.5/10 Would not reccomend. Pick up Battlefield 3 you will enjoy it more and if you can put up with EAs t servers get battlefield 4 it is visually slightly better. (BF3 servers are still kinda )-10
Arma 3AI is deadly accurate no matter what obstacle trees bushes walls it doesn't matter every helicopter gunner as aim like a crack sniper and with one hit kills. Friendly AI is dumb as a sack of door-knobs controls are VERY complex combine this with poor auto save implementation and this quickly becomes a no-win nightmare which will force you to reload an entire mission most of which take an hour or more to complete.   Unless you have 30 or so buddies to play multi with I recommend you pass.-10
Arma 3ArmA 3 has definitely improved on ArmA 2. The gameplay the engine visuals animations and gunplay are much better. However the resources required to pull this off are extremely high end and despite the ground work being layed. The game offers little single player experience and is still in developement. And to show much content they delivered themselves they just added planes this weekend while being released since 12 sep 2013.   Despite this a man like me could enjoy this game if it didn't carry all the inconsistency problems the other game did. PVP wise the lobbies are really outdated no auto number ballance no skill ballance and all pvp maps can be fully customised. This means the one day there is arty the next time there is not. Then you can't take towns because you need to take the camps first while another map you need to take a flag. There are no hud indications for this to show newer players what to do.  The problem with the game is if you do finally get some guys that know how to play the game they are often on 1 team. While the other team is disorganised so all of a sudden you go from dying by stuff you can't see to slicing through the enemy team like butter. It will take another 2-3 years before players will get a hang on what to do. And by this time ArmA 4 will be released and the shabang restarts.   For coop the game is a lot better. But this is also dependant on how many friends you got playing with you. And since 90% of my steam friends cant run the game and the other 10% got bored because of limited content the coop experience is completely dependant on random people. From which the better players are hard to find through sometimes 50 player rubble of guys that just lay down on a far hill taking popshots.   All in all can I recommend this game to a random player? No unless you are into coop and like large operations and know some people to play with it becomes questionable. There are better games out there though not as unique as ArmA 3.  For PVP players I can only say get out of here while you stil can ;)-10
wait a while before buying. its still pretty much in alpha. so many bugs. bad game play. and hackers galore! good luck &amp; have fun... lol;-1;0
Very boring game!!! The campaign suck!;-1;0
Arma 3Concept and everything else about the game is pretty awesome. Only downside is getting 5-15 fps no matter what your setup is.  If you don't mind playing a game with 5-15 fps then GO FOR IT. Otherwise it's definately not worth the 60 dollars more like 20-30-10
game is sh!t;-1;0
Arma 3Don't buy this if you plan to play with friends. Couldn't join public servers that my friends joined and they couldn't join public servers that I joined. Sad.-10
Runs sooo bad! 24 hours and deleted...:(;-1;0
Hey i was randomly global banned :( can anyone help???;-1;0
Arma 3I liked this game until they added the APEX DLC. Basically they split the game into two. The people with the DLC and the people without. It is absolutly outrageous to charge 35 dollars for 1 new map when you can play breaking point and they have several free maps FREE. Now when you want to connect to a server the community has been so spread out between servers that you can never find a full one anymore. The people who bought APEX connect to nearly empty servers because the majority of people arent going to pay for that. And the people who don't have APEX connect to the old map (Altis) and theyre are so few servers and most of them are empty. How to ruin a good game? Add a map DLC for 35 dollars. They would have made more money over time if they simply did nothing than add this DLC. I would no longer reccomend this game to anyone as I expect most of the community would do the same. RIP Arma 3.-10
Game not playable Without some Raynzombie Mods And Apex Expansion;-1;0
Arma 3When i played only servers with people had dlcs and when i tried to join it wouldnt let me I hope you have better luck-10

Absolute crap in recent updates have always been a loyal ARMA player but Optimization in the last few updates have made the game unplayable on mid-high range systems you need a BEAST of a rig to run this game now i stronlgy reccommend for the averge player dont waste your money on this anymore;-1;0
 u;-1;0
i buy the game and when i start it it says game lauch error and nothing works to fix it;-1;0
Arma 3IF YOU HAVE DIRECTX 11 HAVE FUN TRYING TO GET IT TO RUN. IF ANYONE HAD ANY TIPS ON HOW TO RUN THIS GAME LMK. IT WONT START AT ALLLLLLLLL-10
Arma 3Multiplayer is laggy as . Single player is just ing stupid spend most of your time out of breath in a bush waiting to recover or being shot by the AI who take 5 bullets then still manages to kill you with one bullet. Then just when you think you completed the mission you step on a land mine and die. you then have to restart from an auto save point which is another 500m walk away from where you last was.-10
this is really bugy;-1;0
AIs to op and people frendly killing me. logic sucks shot a guy 4 times to die and you get hit 1s and you die what is this bs the guns are horse  players are horse  and when you get a jet and fly over an AI light armor car with a turret on it and you miss chances to kill it then you use some sec to turn aroud to kill it but the problem is the AI is hitting you even do you are traveling 400 km/h and killes you to OP and battle eye sucks to see who is hacking/cheating battle eye is just banning random people for fun;-1;0
i'm too dumb to play this game. no .;-1;0
Battle eye for arma is not good a hacker join the game and got all the player and me banned for life on DJG the server had to shut down to the lake of admins and moderators its a waste of money getting banned for no reason;-1;0
Arma 3I got the weekend deal and wow... Its messed up that I have ti oay 25$ to get the rest of it and I can't play it ever again until I pay... this is BS I love the game but what the hell?!?!?!?! I'm not paying that -10
Arma 3What exactly improved from Arma II graphics &amp; thats it! Seame exact t get carried over with some bonusses.    Graphic glitches    Invisible walls (geometry glitch)    AI is     AI sees trough foliage u can't even turn it off anymore    Body armor system makes a feel u fight ING T-600s    AI aim iscompletely random it can miss whole clip point blank or insta-kill u from 300m. I can't remember when i managed to insta-kill AI.     optimisation     sounds     scripted events     controlls  It has mod support tough but should the mods be needed to fix basic game mechanics one would expect from a simulator? It's not a simulator it is sanbox game u can mod to make a simulaor.-10
Arma 3i really hate it. the campain sucksthe mutiplayer is unplayable and i didnt even want to try the rest of the features because of how stupid the things i had played-10
Arma 3Terrible game unless you plan on playing it on single player only MAJOR fps lag on multiplayer you will get 3 fps for ever even lowering all settings to low or disabled.-10
Arma 3It doesn't work. You have enormous lag on PC's with quad-PC's. The engine uses only 1 core -_- So if you somehow still use a dual-core PC you can play this game. If you have a really new quad-core processor you can play this game too. That aside the game feels like it's unfinished and just a money grab. They didn't invest in a new engine that actually works you have no story and it totally depends on mods which still doesn't make it any good. You are thrown on an island with a pistol and there are some vehicles on the island. That's pretty much ArmA 3 in a nutshell.-10
Arma 3I buy Arma 3 'on sale' and after the weekend sale they bring out the Helicopter DLC for $15.99. Ok I got bit but remember when things like helicopters in a game were part of the game not a 'here are 2 helicopter for $15.99' DLC money grab?  I didn't know this was a pay for DLCs that really should already be part of the game.  I would not recommend this game to anyboy.-10
The worst game I've ever bought.;-1;0
Truly  game.;-1;0
this game has to mainy glitsjes that the have to pay the players!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;-1;0
Campaign is cool until you have to control your AI team... then it becomes kind of boring since the AI doesn't do quite what you asks of them and they end up dying pretty easily.. Mods seems to be ok although if you are an Arma 3 rookie it's a little hard to play at first.  Cool game but wouldn't recommend it if it's not on sale though.;-1;0
I do not recommend this game unless you have dedicated friends to play with. I would wait for GTA5;-1;0
9/11 would bang;-1;0
What a  pile.;-1;0
Clunky and boring as ever.;-1;0
Arma 3Arma 3.. I just don't like it. It feels incomplete. it's a great military simulation but eh. feels empty and very pointless.-10
Yeah  this game. Buggy as  and increasingly so with every god damn update they release.;-1;0
i havent played arma 3 for a long time but now wen i want to play i start the update and when its done it only says update paused and i have tryed to update it like 10 times but its the same every time.......  game;-1;0
Arma 3Still buggy as previous arma's. A lot of frustrating desync. Not much main content but big mod support. Not worth it.-10
Arma 3Buggy as hell Dlc is basically updates that should have been included in the game for free ? What the hell bohemia I was excited for arma 3 to be released as i thoroughly enjoyed arma 2 Oa When arma 3 was relelase i was very disapointed I don't think i'll be buying another bohemia game due to the amount you ed your customers around.-10
i have a problam with battleye and i need help and i cant figure it out nothing helps i do not recommend the game;-1;0
It is an ok game but i would spend 60$ on this buy fallout 4 instead;-1;0
Arma 3Arma 3 is the biggest pile of  I have ever played. It is the worst game engine on the planet and is not optimized at all. It makes gaming pc explode. Its terrible like its gameplay! Do not buy this game at all for your own safety!-10
Arma 3worst game ever i played  whats this  graphics and  graphics engine ?????!!!! it eats graphics card without give u at least good graphics  note : card is gtx 660 ti sc  ram 16 gb ram and p is core i7 3770 k   laggy graphics low fps high ping and high bandwith u need a super computer and 10 mb connection to play this at high graphics and u will still laggy   go and see battlefield graphics or games which depend on havok engine how graphics is awesome at long range without any lagg att good pcs  -10
Prefer buy the game again than buy the dlc's;-1;0
Arma 3This game runs awful at times. Lag and desync during firefights or rubberbanding while operating a vehicle detract from the experience. The UI and general movement of your character is clunky and not well designed.  This game is lacking in content. It's almost as if BI gave players a map and expected the community to 'finish' it. The DLCs what little they do offer should have been included with the original game.  The graphics are nice however.  I would not recommend unless you're able to deal with the above. Hopefully they'll design a new capable engine instead of rehashing the same old stuff for Arma 4.-10
Great game Great Graphics Good Combat System and stances  Horrible Multiplayer setup. can't play with friends Can't play 90% of the servers online  6/10 would not buy it again.;-1;0
Arma 3I have 500+ hrs on this game as much as the idea is good; the visuals are bad game performance affects how good you are in the game significantly in other words game is biast to better H/W. example: units and objects draw distance; if you dont have a high end PC you will be shot by a ghost that you cannot see; as well sudden events like explosions will result in frame drops.  Servers have bad connections even when u have 100-120 ping; which is not terrible but you should expect a lot of Desync to the point of being kicked off the server.  After the most recent update which was 26 Aug 2015 or so; game performance deteriorated as well as connectivity. I keep getting kiced by battle eye saying that client is not responding. wikis online say its my internet connection and i should simply get a better one; funny coz i never faced this issue before in my life on any multi player game ^^ did i say EVER ;)  2 years after launch and after countless patches the game still struggles to run smoothly....and here i though Rome II had a bad release...  the mods in this game are plenty and all their game play is very similar which can be summerized in spawn gear up shoot die respawn repeat...  RPG mods (altis life): go gather and sell drugs save money; and after your 1st 500k-1mil or so (depending on server) congrats you can buy a rebel license to get weapons. each weapon is for 200k to 600k and when u die you loose it. so more gathering and selling drugs +  loads of driving. Probably the most boring experience i've ever endured. Servers are up to 120 users but with such a mediocre net code performance drops (by up to 15 FPS) the more the server is full of ppl. In All servers you can actually pay (donate) to get startup cash a base for your team/friends special merchents in game reserved spots on the server etc.. but if you are trying to enjoy the mod expecting a role playing mod your out of luck; the way this mod works is unless you are with your firneds and hapen to be a ''donator' you are actually food and you will have the worst gaming experience ever.  Sector Control Mods: 3 teams or 30-40 (total 90-120) king of the hill style while it is a pretty good idea; the amount of units players armored vehicles helicopters and planes is huge to be cramped in such a small area; which drains the server's resources and you will get 50% of the frames you usually get on other mods/servers. Really 50% i get 45-50 FPS on most servers for king of the hill servers i get 20-25 fps no kidding; a horrid gameplay experience. As well; the lack of coordination between the players makes the game try to be like COD but it cant since its a strategic shooter simulation; a hybrid effort gone terribly wrong.  Sand Box mods: such as wasteland probably the most entertaining mod; again u spawn survive look for gear kill and respawn. depending on the server; you get a variety of side missions vs AI which is fun to do (especially when the AI is so DUMB basically bullet spunges + aim bot) however it creates a good way for players to face each other off with ambushing overpowering etc.. This mod however should be played with something like 4-5 firends for it to make any sense or be any fun. anything less dont bother; you'll get stomped and squashed like a fly.  Battleroalye Mods: which is the reason i baught the game; by far teh best performance out of any other mod simply coz the number of players is capped at 48. again spawn survive gear up kill till you are the last man standing to win or die and you are kicked out of the server and have to go wait for another 10-15 mins in the lobby to get into another game. While the idea is brilliant if you play for battle royale for 4 hours you are likely to get an actual gaming time of 1.30-2 hrs. all the other time is waiting for the lobby to fill up and go again or running like forest around the map looking for a gun for the 1st 10 minutes of teh round. Be mindful that this mod is extreemly difficult and frustrating; you can die in the 1st minute of the game or be able to look for gear for abt 15 mins and get sniped while you are unsuspecting you also randomly run into players which comes down to who has the better scope and assult rifle little skill is required if you are familiar with the bullet drop effect in Arma3. In this mod i found that the less bullets i fired and encounters i get a better rank among the lobby; basically you are more likely to reach the top 5 if you know your hiding spots.  there are other mods like epoch which is like DayZ if you know it; while it might be fun for 20 hrs of gameplay its gets extreemly repetetive and boring to the point that you might vomit if you play another hour ;)  They are also plenty of user made servers to play vs AI (like 8 or 10 players); which is a walk in the park if you talk with your team mates and move tactfully to your objective. Again since the AI is basically two things bullet sponge and an aim bot. no work has been done on the enemy AI at all; they dont try to flank they dont push your line they do nothing but stand where they are and keep firing at you with a no scope weapons landing 600m shots... quite broken to overcompensate on such things to cover for the poorly designed AI if any ;)  Really dont buy this game....not worth the money or your time.... unless you get it for 20% of its price then it would make sense to give it a try.-10
meh. Controls are extremely clunky. I only played Altis life though;-1;0
Arma 3Ech. ARMA 2 delivers a richer experience with more variety. I mean come on two maps with similar names and aesthetics? At least ARMA 2 had a variety of differently styled maps.  Although the good things about ARMA 3 are it's realism and.... nope i'm out of ideas.  I waited months and months for this to go on sale and I finally built up my PC so it could run the graphic settings on High. I still think ARMA 2 looks and plays better.  2.5/5-10
its not enough like cod 0/10 good try though;-1;0
Arma 3Arma 3 took a stab at improving upon what Arma 2 had acomplished but they failed heavily  Pros: -Graphics look nice if you have a beefy computer -Zues is a nice addition to play around with -Tactical gameplay is improved over Arma 2 (somewhat) -The attachments are a great addition to save having to sort through 10 different M4A1 varients  Cons: -The main islands that come with the stock game are bland and boring and Altis the larger one isn't optimized well enough so you'll probably rolling around 30-45 FPS -There isn't a lot when it comes to guns. Some of the updates help but having to pay for a few guns and mechanics is pretty  of them -The bipod system is pretty lackluster. You put a bipod on your gun and it hardly helps your aim and doesn't any animation when deploying it -The vehicals leave you wanting more variety -The drones are too inconvenient  - $18 (CAD) dollars for some helicopters and another for some guns? I bought the extreme support version before it came out so I don't have to buy the DLC (because I had hope) but that is rediculous for people to have to pay that  Overall: Unless Bohemia gets their heads out of their asses and makes some content and fixes the damn game don't buy it. Do a lot of research into this before even thinking of buying it. If you plan on pumping it full of mods and fixes then you might be fine. Be warned.-10
Arma 3after many years this game still lags too much Badly designed game engine if the devs havent worked it out after 5 years then they never will.  Trust me.. dont buy this game. devs lack the real telent required to make AAA games.-10
Ive got to admit its a gr8 game m8. But the controls r too s4lty 4 me.;-1;0
Total BS i cant even open the game and steam wont even help me other that that the game is quite buggy but fun untill your game dosent open then you prob have to rebuy it.;-1;0
ABSOLUTLEY ! I CANT JOIN ANY SERVER AND WHEN I LAUNCH ARMA 3 IS LAUNCHES ARMA 3 LAUNCHER!  EVERYONE AT BOHEMIA AND ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH ARMA!;-1;0
This game just doesnt work for me - i was ex forces at frontline and in terms of grahics are the large scale of map is excellent.  However i feel the for one the amount of things you need to do button wise is nonsense - i even tried on a xbox controller and just doesnt satisify me at all - its a shame as this game does look great but i think i will stick with other army based fps;-1;0
Arma 3DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  The singeplayer is not functioning. First time I played it was fine did the tutorials then started the campaign (which looked sweet). Then I had to do some other stuff so I saved my campaign and didn't play for a few days. So now I try to go back and continue the campaign and I can't. There is a content error. I had a mod installed via Steam Workshop (Battle Royale) which I uninstalled and I've verified the game cache with Steam and all files check out. The game is plain BROKEN AND DOES NOT WORK.  Screenshot of error -   http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/352771657374577293/E7D026BD68D57129568F64E427CA2C6D5F8BE72B/ -10
Arma 3This game is terrible. WAYYYYY over-complicated. Just plain dumb. terrible graphics compared to 2 year old titles like battlefield 4. If your new to this game be prepared to sink at least 4 hours in just getting this piece of crap running. The game is useless without mods. Download mods and find out you need MORE mods to play the MODS you just downloaded. Endless file system corrections and disappointing when you finally get everything working. Im suprised this game ranks as well as it does. MOST POSITIVE&gt;?? why?-10
the FPS on this game sucks it stays the same no matter what settings youe put the game on and runs very bad.;-1;0
Do not purchase.;-1;0
Arma 3First of all...  -This game is purposefully designed to NOT work on AMD hardware. And no this is not me complaining because I have a bad pc and I'm butthurt. I have an AMD fx 6300 overclocked at 4.6Ghz and Asus Radeon R9 290x. and 16gb. This PC can easily compete with any Nvidia/Intel setup that is not literally built by the Gods and costs $5000+. If you have anything in your PC by AMD avoid this game like the plague.  So say you buy the game anyway and load it up...  -Game runs at 5fps. Spend 3 hours messing around with settings doing everything humanly possible to get a decent frame rate Finally get it to 45fps without your PC catching on fire. -Still get horrendous screen tearing.  But what if you have Intel/Nvidia and the game runs good? Good f-ing luck. Controls are nearly impossible to use and make no sense at all.  -Spend 2 hours just trying to walk around without the camera randomly locking up and forcing you to walk in a straight line while all your attempts at turning and looking around simply moves the character's head. -Switching aiming modes is hit and miss and about 80% of the time it is impossible to find how to get back to your compass. -Navigation tools are useless. There is no way to tell which dot you are on the map. If you set waypoints on the map you can never remove them and you WILL set them in the wrong place often. -There are simply SO MANY controls that half the time you have no idea what is going to happen when you press buttons. You might press I to try to pull up your inventory and suddenly find yourself laying on your back with your controls locked on head movement only with your gun sights disabled and no way to get out of this possition.  -The menus do not help. If you go to the menu to look at the controls it looks like any other FPS game controls. Only none of it works.  Finally give up let a friend try to figure it out.  -You friend plays around for like a hour trying to figure out how to walk normally. He has no more success than you did and gives up.  -Request a refund. -Denied: More than 2 hours of play time. No  I have more than 2 hours of play time it took longer than that to get it to run at more than 10fps. F-ing piece of trash.  As far as I am concerned this game is flat-out robbery. It is purposely designed to not work in any reasonable way and to purposely take you several hours to figure out that you will not be able to get it to work. So they are basically just taking your money and then making you waste your time to expire the possible refund period.  0/10: This is not even a video game it is malware. Would rather be robbed at gun point in a dark alley.-10
Arma 3There is one thing you need to know about all the Bohemia Interactive games.  Every Bohemia interactive game will have an 'early access' stage. Thats when the company says 'our game is glitchy as hell but don't worry for it will be fixed in the future'. Then the sky starts raining gold on them and they forget about fixing the game.  DayZ Standalone is a live proof.-10
Arma 3Gameplay is great but the Multiplayer is unoptimized as  you'll run at nearly 10-30 fps when you play MP (Only MP) even if you got a beefy computer.-10
-10/10 would waste money again;-1;0
Arma 3Due to the overwhelming amount of mods it's almost impossible to enter a game. You'll receive the message: cannot enter because downloadable content has been removed. Game runs slowly and is not impressive on the graphics. Very very sorry that I spent 44 euros on this.-10
Bugs and bad performanace.;-1;0
Downloading mission file 0 KB/0 KB game en broken would never play again;-1;0
This game is great. The only problem is that the game is not optimized.You need a monster pc to run this over 30 fps. 3/10;-1;0
Wish I had knowen about steam refund at the time XD;-1;0
Globally banned for no reason within first hour after purchase.;-1;1
Arma 3Arma 3 hates me. (Steam free) Every server I join it says there is a battleeye error and kicks me after getting back to the lobby menu arma 3 crashes. This sucks pretty pointless. Every other game that uses battle eye has no problem with me.-10
Arma 3Many Many Many Problems I was falsely banned over a year ago You never did ANYTHING to help resolve YOUR mistake therefor i give this a NEGATIVE review.-10
Arma 3BLOODY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE PERFORMANCE 2 YEARS IN IS STILL  AND THAT REJECTING COMPLAINTS AND CRITCISM FROM THE EXACT SAME ISSUE FROM ARMA 2 IS UNACCETABLE. THIS GAME STINKS  Edit: (My Arma 2 &amp; OA Review)  'You better get used to poopy frame rates because this games enginge is terrible. A few years on - no improvements. Then here comes ArmA 3 - same engine Bohemia Ignorantive decided to ignore the complaints and keep the exact same terrible engine. Enjoy your horrid looking sub par gaming experience.'  New update - Absolutely no changes. Nice. Terrible game.       YAY 30 FPS!!!-10
Arma 3The game is largely unfinished. Its like an early access game but worse in many cases.   - when you try to walk up some stairs you'll be unable to unless you wiggle your mouse back and forth to make your guy seizure his way up onto the first stair.   -You'll get revived but without your gun this happens probably once or twice a day to me.   - Controls make no sense like when driving a car if you accidentally touch your mouse it'll steer your car into the nearest pebble thus causing an explosion killing everyone inside. You need to double tap ALT when you get in your vehicle to stop this then double tap ALT again when you get out to be able to use your mouse in first person.  - Optimization Look I get there is alot going on in this game.. but I have an AMD FX6400 @ 4.2ghz with a R9 280x and I'll get 30fps at best in many servers. My friend has an i7 5820k and 980TI and we have the exact same frames in this game. Which makes zero sense.  - Community Its nice because 'Most' of the time you'll be more likely to have a team in this game than Battlefield or other FPS's but you'll have probably 40% of the community like this and the other 60% varies from 12 year olds trying to fly you into the objective but drive you into a building or flip the chopper onto its head or some other nonsense or you'll get some  yelling military jargin at the top of his lungs demanding CAS at some coordinates and he'll bark orders and if you dont follow he'll try to team kill you. Its a pretty mixed bag to be honest.  Conclusion: I would get a refund if I could but I've put alot of effort into trying to like this game simply because it has so much potential as a concept but they used the iest game engine known to man and have put zero effort into fixing performance issues. In all the time I've had this I've seen various updates with new models guns and vehicles but not a single increase in my FPS.-10
Arma 3I've logged a few hours on this game so i think i can say a thing or two.   First off Arma 3 isn't your normal First person shooter This game takes skill it isn't like Call of duty or Battlefield ther isn't a rank system and there isn't an XP system. This is 100% millsim You will throw out into a map that is massive beyhond any map you've ever seen. The combat is random at times and intense with no limit on 'fair gun play' Depending on what mode you play you and with who- you won't be shooting your gun a lot. this game takes a lot of time. The story mode is fun and gets you into some good basic combat along with a fair story line.   MP is full of mods and game modes set for almost everyone looking for either laid back game modes that you can hang out and play with your friends or 100% tactical millsims that rage on for hours with strict Millitary commands and stratagys.   the editer is another great tool in this game if you wanna try your skills in editing a mission or just playing down soilder to fight it out you can! The editer puts you in the driver seat for what you want to create!     Now lets talk about what you're gonna need for PC specs; first off forget the reccomended specs it's 100% BS   you're gonna wanna an Intel I5 or I7 first off this game doesn't like AMD regadlesss of cores.  8GB of ram at the least! 12-16gb is best. And a GPU that can hold up to Armas insane looking graphics ( did i mention this game looks amazing?)    Sadly lagg and FPS drops are all to common in this game even with my PC specs i get 15 20 frames in towns when small battles are going on.   BI never really optamized this game very well and it's really hurting us players who don't have enough money to dump on a new PC (i've been trying since this game came out toget it to run great still trying)     so last lets do pros and cons     pros   -millsim tactics  -large multiplayter games  -many things to do from flyingboatingdriving   -good story line with easy to get into modes  -realalistic battles with intense firefights    CONS  -poorly optamized   -too many mods on some servers causes issues  -easy to play not easy to get use to/into     Honestly there isn't much i can say bad about this game. I really enjoy it and have a ton of fun playing it with all the freedom it gives you if you got a good PC and wanna try something different. Buy Arma 3!10
Arma 3This game disapoints me as an ArmA fan this game got lots of praise when it came out (which I didn't really understand) then in the last year or so Bohemia Interactive had been moving in the right direction finally and then Bohemia decided to remove the 2D editor recently which basically ruined it for me putting this game in an early grave for creators like myself who loved the 2D editor.-10
cant even get the game to open after unistalling and reinstalling why does it have to be so complex to play a game these days im not trying to write software or unzip a bunch of files...........;-1;0
its ;-1;0
Unplayable. Bugs left and right and vey cluncky;-1;0
server sucks no good but it is a good game;-1;0
Arma 3Runs awful and is full of bugs. Also game has a bunch of fun information about the islands in the loading screens and most of it is made up/ doesn't exist.   The MP is glitchy and frustrating because it's only janky modded game modes or a co-op you need to que up with friends to play. The SSP is terribly voice acted and has awful pacing. Animations are silly and stiff.  The game is pretty when you stand still and look at the scenery though. Must have if you enjoy scenery otherwise pass.-10
Overall a superfun game but the ing battleye client ruins it all:/ 5/10;-1;0
boring all they good servers got shutdown;-1;0
It does not look good enouph for it to run this slowly.;-1;0
Arma 3god end my suffering thank grand master gaben for allowing me to return this beautiful piece of garbage. The game its self is very pretty but good luck being able to enjoy that as you frame rate has a stroke and goes from 50 to 2 in the blink of any eye i by no means have a super computer but i surpass all minimum and some of the recommened requirement. Also if you are new to pc gaming good luck being able to find a server with just the vanilla game cause you won't or if you do itll be you and one guy who doesn't speak english jerking each other off until you Disconnect randomly.  For 40 dollars i would never buy this game maybe for 15 but thats a huge maybe. That being said it is a beautiful game with great maps and visuals   1/plocibo ruski comrade?-10
Arma 3Arma 3 is a very fun game that is when you can find a server that you can play on. i have had this game for two days now and have found 1 server that is playable. I got kicked from that server now every single one is an dlc or mod. i do NOT feel like paying upwards of 50 extra dollars for a already 40 dollar game so i can get into servers that i can play on. The developers really need to look into getting some official servers insteed of random people making a server that no one joins. For gods sake there is a arma addon for every single thing in the game that cost 300 dollars i just wonder how many people has accualy bought that addon that alone would probably pay for some official servers. I would have to say i would not recomend this game due to its por quality of trying to accualy play the game you have just payed 40 dollars for.-10
Arma 3Okay... If you want to buy this game think really good. This game sucks if you dont have anyone else playing it with you... I have a couple of mates who play with me Roleplay stuff and Co-Op specops.  Just my advice Buy this game when some of you mates do Or just get bored. Just to show After 10 hours in my own when i first bought it Ive seen every bit the campaign. Only fun is editing some levels But gets bored. But this still is a great game! I would really recommend it If you do have a mate Or just like editing some missions. Which can be high tech sh*t. So. Lets get to the real deals.  Postives : Good Co-Op. 3D AND 2D Level/Scenerio editor. Great Campaign. 2 Step Server Hosting. LAN () And public if you have portforward Can include your own made mission into a LAN server to play with you mate. Realistic Outfits Vehicles And guns Alot of Guns Vehicles And Costumes.  Negatives : You get each DLC/Pack which u cant use. Waste of Space To get a proper map on this the steam addons will be 15+ GB In your own the game sucks after 10 hours of playing. Getting the editor do what you want is a hard thing to learn. (^Tutorials on YT are best Ofcourse^) This game can have OP A.I. So its quite ragefull.   My personal funny moments : Trying out all of the guns of the Wipeout (JetPlane) on the ground. And dropping a bomb and blow ourselfes up. We didnt know it dropped bombs :) :D  Thought we were pro by giving some aircover to the squad And crash straight into a tree. We laughed for hours  14/15 Km we did fly with chopper Which takes quite long (5-10 minutes) and then we saw the eject button We were like whuuutt.... And we jumped out..... No parachute... No Huron anymore.... Lets restart the mission....  We switched from Nato to CSAT just for a change According i start shooting CSAT.... Which were my team.... And my m8 suicide landen a chopper on me... RIP M8 AND ME INCLUDING CHOPPER    Well... This is a fun game if you play with the right men! I keep enjoying it everyday  And peeps.... Always go for NATO.... Not CSAT... Csat sucks.   10
if you want to play online it is almost impossible to do unless you download a ton of mods and if you do so than you wont be able to play a different game type.;-1;0
Arma 3ArmA 3 is a dissapointment simple as that.   The only real pro of this game is it's ability to host large worlds/maps and that's really where it ends.  The games graphics aren't great Even when put to max it barely exceeds the visual quality of games like Far Cry 2 which was released 5 years before this. The game lacks content copmared to it's predessesors weapons and vehicles are extremely limited in variety. Don't believe this 'over 40 weapons' BS that simply isnt true theres around 20 or so actual weapons and the other supposed 20 are actually just varients with underslung grenade launchers (which are detachable by the way) or even just camo varients. It took a year after the official release of the game before the campaign was even finished although I haven't tried completing it as it bugs out and crashes for me on the first level.  To top it off the game runs like crap My rig can run games like Far Cry 3 and Metro Last light on Ultra settings at over 100fps yet this game on standard fails to achieve a steady 30fps most of the time. You have to mess around with launch paramters and config files to make the game run at a mediocre performance level because the game is not optimised at all which I don't see as acceptable from a fully released title. The game is still a 32-bit application so the game wont take full advantage of your RAM if you have more than 4GB in most cases never using more than 2GB. The developers knew about this probelm when the game was in alpha and plenty of people complained about it and the developers have simply ignored this probelm completely.  The one redeeming factor that might make this game worth buying is the Modding community there's some really great interresting mods out there for ArmA 3. However it's sad to have to say that a game is only worth buying for Mods because that in turn means that the base game is so bad that the only thing making it playable is people actually changing the game itself.-10
Arma 3Summary: I like it but not enough to buy it.  Honestly Arma 3 isn't terrible. Occasionally the objective is unclear and sometimes you have to travel a large distance for a simple task. (Swim 130m to 'disarm' a mine by simply pressing spacebar.) It would seem more rewarding to literally disarm the mine via minigame or something making it worth the travel time. Frame rate could be a little better. Graphics aren't impressive. Audio needs improvement. (Sometimes there is a helicopter above you making it difficult to hear dialogue.) The concept is really cool but I think for a $40 price tag I expect fewer issues. There are better games for your money IMO.  Rating: 3/5-10
Arma 3Overallthis is a good game but I'm really confused about how to play together with my friends even if we are steam friends we cannot find each other in game. I tried to host server but my fiends still cannot find it. There are some guides on the internet that show how to add new port at my router but it's to complicated I don't know if the company develops this game can make it better otherwose I don't want to play it alone.-10
Arma 3If you've ever played a game where you've received an item you've really wanted and you know you probably won't get another chance to get it then suddenly the game crashes and reverts to your last save point then you would understand the anger that this game causes. Except you feel that same anger every single time you play. I've played this game for almost 400 hours and will be the first to admit how stupid I am for playing it this long. Playing online every single thing you do will be met with getting so cloe to your goal then utter failure.   I'll start with the community. I can't say much for other countries but here in australia every single other player is a giant throbing a**hole. Team-mates constantly team-kill on nom-teamkilling servers. Enemies wait to shoot you when you're in the menu when they know you've got no chance to retaliate but worst of all is that they constantly feel the need to abuse you further AFTER THEY'VE ALREADY KILLED YOU by calling you a 'c*nt' 'f*ggot' or telling you how bad you are in the voice chat. Which is something you can't moderate against. So yeah if you like it when the most common thing ever spoken on a server is to call you something derogetory then congratulations you're a masochist and welcome to arma 3. This game has caused me the have utter disrespect for any male gamer between the age of 13 and 29.   But that's not even the most infuriating part. Imagine you worked for many hours to save up enough to but an expensive helicopter then after you take off and are in the air the game chooses that moment to freeze you lose connection to the server and when you re-log you find your burning corpse and a respawn screeen. This happens to me the high majority of anytime I fly. Literaly not my fault not my computer's fault this game was programmed not with people's hands but their a**es. If it's not that then it's a vehicle that literally vanishes as i'm driving it. Explain that one? Just the sheer amount of money and weapons I lose because of how poorly this game runs is pathetic.  If you play on a server ever then you will know that the fps is disguisting pretty much always. And i'm talking like below console levels with a gtx 970 3.5GB. Apparently even 2 great cards in sli isn't enough to run this game at 60 fps or even 30 that is how well optimised it is. The sad thing is that singleplayer isn't bad and the fps is always 60 but singleplayer gets booring the first time you finish it. I expect a little more out of a $70AUD game.  So if you want to pay just so you can play singleplayer by all means go ahead. But if you want to play multiplayer like the many other thousands of people maybe consider spending your time doing something enjiyable or worthwhile otherwise  I'd advise you become a masochist and lose all respect for anyone you come across. Most disgusting game ever.  And I know damn well that the game is in pre-alpha but that doesn't excuse sh*t considering the game has been out for years and is still pathetically buggy. Bohemia releases updates far too slowly for this to look like a respectable title anytime soon. They seem to be more concerned with worrying about the aesthitics than if it can run for more than 3 seconds without crashing.-10
terrible game ... battleeye never stay conected always getting kicked... gather you resources and get kicke all your stuff is gone when you return and car is put back in garage while your in the woods far from anyone collecting resources... car is all so empty to after you spent a hr collecting... games has great idea and runs 60 to 90 fps but in terms of how often it crashes you be better of just rdming people for the fun cuz it might crash before you go to jail lol;-1;0
IT WONT WORK FOR ME;-1;0
this game sucks monkey ;-1;0
don't get me wrong it's an amazing game how ever I have many problems with the pre apex game   1. lack of content. okay 3 armored cars only armored and 1 quad bike also 1 jet per faction also very little guns much little content very disapointing  2. the maps. 1 stratis is to mountainous to use 2 altis is to large not enough of the map will ever be used  3. the factions. N.A.T.O = USA USA USA CSAT= Iran . . . from the fuuuuuuuuuture AAF = we have uhhhh we have tanks yes we have tanks FIA = VIVA LA REVELOUTION  4.the story line of the campaign has many holes why didn't N.A.T.O notice when all units went dark on stratis didn't try to communicate after a few days of no info and why did the AAF feel provoked to attack N.A.T.O were leaveing in a month  5. 60.00 for a game that isn't any good unless you run mods to increase the experince while arma 2 can be played vannila and be fine for a long time  6. want to have fun well do to lack of content if you join a milsim unit then enjoy 10+ gbs of mods (all minor tweaks to)  7. I miss the old dlc form of new map new units new campaign really worth the money well 20 dollars here gets you a new sniper that should have been in since full release carts because we couldn't add it our selves for free must pay for labor and drum roll *drum roll* A CHINOOK yeah and A helicopter that no one uses as it sucks we just want the chinook for 15 dollars 10/10 bohemia GG #prayforapex  hope this helped please bohemia make apex into OA we need it here  *edit* I am an arma fan I have played them all at this point in time so im not a cod kiddie saying how can you no scope if you can't jump and snipe what is this WAAAA I loved arma 2 and I miss it very much but as arma 3 has all the new things oh well  *edit* I forgot to mention the editor which is pretty nice but can get annoying sometimes but still really cool also before I forget there are more servers that are legit arma not zombie mods so +1            now for the apex review  ohh boy here we go i would right this on the apex page but im not going to buy it there for i can just talk about content again well lets see no attack helicopters jsut drones for nato reskined guns and ctrg is the only new thing except for helicopters which is just reskined ghost hawk and lets see csat whats that . . . THEY GOT A NEW GUN SWEET and new a car for both . . . thats it were done uhh yeah and a vtol that sucks nothing else Im just dissapointed will not buy arma 4;-1;0
Arma 31st time arma 3 multiplayer epoch experience:  Joined game chose some gear and clothes  chose a spawn.  parachute deploy there   get shot in mid air   get kicked off the game  Would not play again-10
DLC bundle does not cotain all dlcs... it even said it would contain future dlcs BEFORE! I think the price was even higher! And now there is no APEX DLC in my inventory?!?  I do not hate this game but i hate how bohemia interactive betrays its costumers.;-1;0
Arma 3performance improvements ok dlc´s are very negative singleplayer is unplayable allways mission failiures AI is crap-10
Arma 3This game is good it's just not for me. I'm more into playing action FPS ARMA is more into simulation.  If you love simulation with complex controll you probably gonna love this.-10
Arma 3Game is pretty glitchy. I got an Intel i7 4790 running it but it still managed to freeze. also it has strange controls in the menu and my gun is very innaccurate. Considering in real life i can put bullets inside each other when firing at a target I find that disappointing that a prone position still left me missing a guy by huge amounts. Im never playing another Arma Game. Im glad they gave me a sample so I didnt have to spend 50$ This game has a lot going for it but it isnt for me. Maybe it will work for you   Edit=== I watched a video and found out why my shooting sucked My guy had been running and was tired... I guess thats cool. I wish I could make it work better I was so excited by the game when I first saw it but like every Arma Game I die too easy and too often because I cant figure out how to make my guy effective in combat.-10
Arma 3This game is mediocre. Nothing really stands out. The A.I needs a huge boost to be 'balanced' and make the human player handicap. I've had machine gun A.I snipe me from 800 yards. The music is okay the graphics are okay and the sound effects are good. You never get the feeling you're in a battle. Everything is always clean. I've rarely had an intense firefight. You will spend a lot of time waiting on other players to pick you up via helicopter. Sometimes it takes 10 to 30 mins for pilots to realize there people at base that respawned.-10
The game stopped working for me after an update. Have not been able to play for three months due to Battle Eye Initialisation Failed. I have written a request on the forums for support but nobody has got back to me with a fix. Extremely disappointed as this was a great game when I could play it.  Terrible support from Devs. A waste of £36.99 as I got APEX along with all the other DLC too... which I will not be able to use.;-1;0
Don't Buy if you like battlefield  Its like X-mas without santa and booze and food and air and water   and a toilet  grafics are great but gameplay is a big fat NOPE!;-1;0
Arma 3Bad Animations.  Bugs Died from going down stairs.  And extremely laggy.-10
Finally sat down and played it (summer 2016).;-1;0
Arma 3Have to ammend my recommendation after making it almost enitrely through the campaign.   Why 'almost' and not 'completely'? This game has the most awful AI I have experienced in a long time. It's honestly at a point where the enemy AI are either expert snipers with any weapon at any range or are completely ignorant and stand in the open waiting to die. Realism is entirely gone from the firefighting which is ironic considering this is supposedly an ultra-realisitc 'war simulation'. The customized difficulty controls consist of two sliders 'Precision' and 'Accuracy'. At 40 for example the AI will not let you win a firefight period. At 30 they are so dumb they miss 80% of their shots and are basically waiting to die. The only inbetween is '35' which is much closer to 'professional sniper even when using a 9mm pistol' than 'normal guy who sometimes can hit you.' It's pretty absurd frankly and almost comical when they market this as a simulation.  I won't even go into the friendly AI. It's so bad it's become a joke and meme at this point. There are dozens of modders who have tried to address the issue which is fine but the fact that the team AI is so bad after years of patches says a lot about the developer's priorities. I can no longer recommend this game unless you can tolerate your team standing straight up in the open running in circles firing recklessly into the air or missing every single shot without a SINGLE WAY to control them or help in the middle of a fight. This sounds ridiculous but I was intentionally killing or letting my team die just so I could finish missions. Not sure how this game is so positively reviewed honestly. It's like they did everything right except the important parts.   Cannot recommend.-10
Arma 3A youtube adventure with multiple choices that are about a bunch of toy army men and indians would be a better military simulator than this this is very incomplete full of bugs and hackers tons of servers who have admins that don't do anything but ban people at the snap of a finger. I would of rather pre-ordered sims 4 honestly and I don't even like sims. Biggest waste of 60$ i've ever seen Cannot BELIEVE More than even a thousand people bought this crap. It's just a re-skinned arma 2 with way less content. All hating aside now It does have good graphics. But bad physics. So you're literally paying for graphics.-10
it took forever to download and was a complete waste of seven hours of my life;-1;0
NU LUATI CA DUPA PLATITI DUBLUI FUTAL IN EL;-1;0
Arma 3I bought this after hearing about the multiplayer experience. I get it installed and wait several hours before finally finding a server i can join. I join it and find that for a realistic fps i somehow end up in a small village with nothing but a pistol and a green shirt. No blouse? No helmet? This guy is breaking several rules he learned in basic training already. And was stupid enough to arrive with a pistol alone no less. Where is the rest of his unit? Well it looks like his landing was horribly miscalculated or he must have overslept because they are already across the map camping by an airstrip; leaving him to march many miles crawling through grass to avoid the endless supply of armored transport and hatchbacks that have broken headlights making you a virtual speedbump simulator.  I finally get to the airstrip and meet the merchant a guy with a 50cal berret barrel up his but judging by his posture. you get your **** and dart to a high hill and go prone so you may become grass simulator 2016 until you are rewarded for your hours of patience with a noob running in the open. You calculate your shot placement and hold your breath to take the shot. Buuuuut it looks like an armored unit wanted to turn your target into firework simulator 2016 before your shot can reach him.   after what seems like 3 hours you finally decide it is pointless and leave the server so you can have some sleep. Next day you end up waiting another couple of hours to wait for a server that you can join without any wierd error. Screw your 100mb/s service and 25ping this server says you cannot join even without need for other dlc to be downloaded first. Still salty that I never got my refund I applied for.  If you loving waiting hours for a server to join then this game is for you. they should rename it 'waiting game 2016' or also 'dark souls with guns' and also 'bad luck brian simulator 2016 - military edition'-10
Arma 3i could go on about this games outstanding attention to detail it fun and realistic play style sexy sounds and over all polish but no im going to en flam the  out of it. Why? well you already know the good parts time to bend this er over and smack the  out of it.  first off optimization WTF its 20-en-15 and still preforms like a total en spud server no doubt its much much mcuh better then en arma 2 which was the most  poor effort for 'game optimization' id ever seen whats that is there a building 10km north you cant see better load that in yeah thats a good idea while were at it lets just flop it out and  on the lines of code that might do anything other then  FPS.  now we come to the very very very cluncky general of the game whats that did you just en mag dump those 2 guys over there not even facing you? here let me have a en ciggy break then en load it in for the other guy or did you just want to move with out been some en special diet needy er thats goes ah sorry no i need en no gluten skim low fat hi gi reduced suggar vegan meat taisting halal approved ? ah yes and it needs to be 750ml or under or over kills me. i swear its like all the en guys you play as are like ah  me i outa breath after like 30m ah but their wearing en 30kg of gear yeah the  are you made of en  your trained to en do this its not en hard.  by now this fruit cake is done NO IM EN NOT! what about when you want play the solo campagin yeah i mean the game doesnt have en  en difficulty spikes heres basic en tra- ah  china america russia are here and the other en green  you shoot yeah them their like en aids in the 80's everywhere and not at the same time dafuq!??!?!?! you'll hide behind a rock like yeah finaly they cant shoot me and then bang dead resart how ah yeah some stray  bullet bouced and en domed ya ah cool. AH you dont need to en play the single player dont i i think i en do as most games these days alread come deprived of a solid single player its like ordering a steak and chips and them saying you can have the chips but the steak the chips are good but you didnt order it for the en chips you wanted the en boner giver medium blue steak not for en battered spuds.  ah yeah the games good tho  ya self  10
Arma 3I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone cause its a multiplayers worst nightmare. The engine is old as  the fps on my new alienware pc is 20fps in multiplayer. Un optimized piece of crap people I bought it in beta and it still sucks. If there were a demo i could of saved 44 dollars but got screwed in the ! SAVE YOUR MONEY maybe take a date to a nice resteraunt who knows maybe you'll get laid. Anyways i'm saving you from a bad decision!-10
Arma 3So to bang off this review I'll firstly say that I played Arma 2 when DayZ was pretty much a bang hit such as when huge internet celeb's were playing i.e Frankie Pewds Womble etc. etc. So I know a bit about Arma in itself.  Now the pro's: ~ This game is pretty damn beautiful when it comes down to it. Hell there aren't any graphic mods out there because of that fact. ~ It potentially has one of the best modding communities anyone could ask for with mods coming out every year. ~ It's devolpment team actually listens to people's concerns and they fixed the game accordingly to what bug or what not is going. ~ The differences between this game and Arma 2 have a very vast threshold. ~ It has great immersion for those that play Military Simulator's or Real Life role-player's. ~ Finally it's a game that can enterain the mature audience's for more then a few hundred hour's of playing it.  Now for the con's: ~ To actually play this game and have fun you have to at least have an i-7 CPU and a good graphics card. It's possible to play on a laptop if that laptop is a $500 or above one. ~ Though few there are game breaking bugs. I.e someone moved me while I was on a turret and then I found myself teleported to the farthest reachs of the map underwater. ~ If you play on Public servers for certain game types expect to find people who will plain out ruin the game for you. ~ This one really isn't a con but kind of is. This game is for MATURE audience's and mainly because a mature audience will find it fun not a gaggle of 12-14 year olds.  In conculsion I'd say this game is pretty damn good. If you're looking for the fun of hanging out with a squad and kicking some  or if you're in it for the realism or anything else then this is a great game to play!.

not really a fan.;-1;0
Was awsome game. Was. thats the big word everytime i go to launch the game now it says initializing then crashes had this for couple months now no support at all from bistudios or any resolved solution from other forums it it worked more often i would recommend it;-1;0
Arma 3For the small amount of time that I have played this game I have found it to be extremely boring and monotonous. You might think that it would be fun with zombies or karts or other stuff but no its not. If you want to play a moddable game might as well play Garry's mod which is much much cheaper. The game is full of bugs and the controls are all backwards. Half the time I find myself looking at settings when I'm actually trying to open a door. Overall this game sucks and I reccomend that everyone steer clear from it. I also forgot to mention that it is poorly optimised.  9/10 If you want realistic  0/10 If you want fun-10
Arma 3Extreamly  game not what I expected at all. I want a damn REFUND!-10
Died of ladder bug  10/10 would uninstall again;-1;0
Arma 3Very poor design for new users this is my first Arma game and i found it almost impossible to play there were no clear training missions and any that they did have did NOT give clear instructions. It took me 30mins of mashing buttons to figure out how to crouch :(. Was really looking foward to this game as all reviews and videos looked really good the Multiplayer is very laggy and the players are rude and not helpful i was kicked 45 times i counted for being a newbie. Very dissapointed will hopefully grasp the controls and basics soon just feel like ive wasted fourty-pounds. Do NOT buy this game. I do not reccomend it.-10
-1;0
Arma 3Terrible performance filled with bugs glitches. Price point is far to high for the overall quality to be so low. I would return this if I could.-10
Arma 3Now I actually have a good reason not to recommend this trash game.  Pros: Whats that? (It's arma don't expect any)  Cons: -HORRIBLE Optimization -They are so greedy as a company (ADDING NORMAL GAME PATCHES AS DLC) -(Relates to above) To get better weapons graphics audio and vehicles you must buy the dlc which once again makes no sense considering you already have to spend a huge amount of money on this piece of trash game. -A lot of dead servers because the game is so garbage. -Bohemia mainly ported a lot of the models and graphics from Arma 2 and to make everything look somewhat new they literally reskinned everything and put it in. It's very disappointing to know that Bohemia has to salvage things from the original game just to sell dlc and make more money.-10
This bad update because character easy to trie and before update is better than this update.;-1;0
poop. might be good if it wasnt the laggiest piece of  ever created;-1;0
I bought the extened edition on another account then sent the extended edition to this account. i did not recieve any of the current DLCs with it only Karts. Game is great just has flaws to things like the $15 DLC packs.  Come on Bohemia you're not EA stop being money hungry.;-1;0
If you get the 'STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION' error. Expect not to play the game. I have 12 hours on this and most of it is the game crashing with the same error everytime I start playing on a server. Try doing research on this? No answers at all unless someone knows the answer here then I would change this into a more positive review because I would actually be playing the game.;-1;0
Arma 3you cant even play the campaign without dying on the first ing missions. the multiplayer isnt playable if you dont have dlc and the game is expensive as  without it. the editor is really weird to use and if you do it takes ages to load up a level.-10
Arma 3Tl;DR game is gud DLCs are  unbalanced t. I Have been a Fan of bohemia interactive after the whole Arma 2 Dayz mod craze i purchased and played arma 2 operation arrowhead and played the Dayz mod and base arma 2. year or two later arma 3 came into beta for 29.99. Naturally i purchased it after how much i loved arma 2. it showed so much potential i fell in love with Arma 3. The game came out of beta a year or two later not a whole lot added but the core mechanics were there. April 1st 2014 The Karts DLC came to be offered fun little karts for 4.99 still accessible with out paying that fee. November 4th 2014 the Helicopter DLC came out offered new helicopters which i was very excited about. i did not have the dlc at the time but I was playing king of the hill and someone spawned in one the new helicopters. I was really infactuated with it i went up to it to check it out and all i got was a little window telling me to purchase this DLC to have access to this content. I was a little upset but understandable its DLC. It is now April 11th 2015 the new Marksmen DLC just came out and i played it for the first time in a while. me and my buddy hopped on the new end game ctf game mode everything seemed fine headed out to secure the intel. i hear a lot of distinct gun shots. the new VSS vintorez and the .338 lmg that i fail to remember. I spot an enemy down the street from me near the objective. I take cover and then peek him with my vermin .45 acp submachine gun. i take 3 shots at him he is hit notices my position aims and shoots me once in the body and i am immediately dead. Annoyed i respawn and head back out to gather the objective (Intelligence) the site has been cleared and me and three guys move in. i round by a corner and see an enemy player crouched in a firing position. I switch to fully automatic and spray my whole magazine into him (i mean why not) his player model visibly displays the damage done and yet the man still lives! He turns to look at me with his large lmg (Chambering the new .338 Caliber round) and puts a round straight into my chest once again im put to the respawn screen. yatatata shoot more dudes kill a guy (Miraculously :]) and attempt to retrive his fire arm. A little window pops up telling me to purchase the DLC to have access to this weapon. At this point i was rather upset learning i cant use the new weapons without purchase of DLC The devs even stated the game was lacking something in terms of weapons so this was created. So for something that should have been a free update (Kind of like the weapon resting and face paint etc;) i am quite livid these weapons completely change the dynamics of fire fights and weapons in general. with these weapons chambering such large caliber rounds every kill requires 1 or two rounds to kill an enemy. How is it fair that because someone paid 15.99 they can decimate infantry as well as vehicles one of the new DLC LMG's that chambers .338 can destroy almost 3 stryders with one 'belt' so thats really fair. that people who bought the dlc have access to weapons capable of destroying the planet while im here with my  on my hand.-10
Half the content of Arma 2 for many times the price...;-1;0
Arma 3Hands down the best combat sim out on the market!! On a scale of 1-10... I give it an 11!!10
Arma 3theres no multiplayer and the control scheme is confusing and the campaign is super ing hard but it looks good though-10
Found out how dlc=money Previous one actually did something better with dlc.;-1;0
it has wierd controls but nice graphics;-1;0
Locked me out of DLC I paid for.;-1;0
Arma 3Right from the git-go you are in a virtual reality which is basicly training you get familiar with the controls and play it a few good 3 or 5 mins Then you get farther in the game and you realize the entire game is about driving around a basicly endless map that has a few houses and such Pros and Cons  Pros Fun multiplayer shooter even eithout the multiplayer great level design  Cons Really terrible graphics it haunts me to this day like those targets AFTER the vitrtual reality looked like tan pieces of plastic The controls were so sencetive I couldn't go down a simple flight of stairs.   My overall rating? 3/10 still better than cod though  -10
Arma 3After years of intense warfare against Eastern armies Europe has become the last stand for the battered NATO forces. On the verge of being driven into the sea NATO command embarks upon a most desperate measure.  In the hope of seizing what seems to be a well-guarded military secret Operation Magnitude is launched. A small group of Special Forces and Researchers are sent to a Mediterranean island deep behind enemy lines. However the mission is compromised and the task force destroyed leaving Cpt. Scott Miller washed ashore upon the hostile island. In his effort to carry out the mission he will face the dangers of modern warfare an unforgiving environment and the consequences of his own decisions...   Altis Life is a mod for Arma 3 where players take on the role of paramedics police officers taxi drivers salt miners and many other ordinary occupations. You start with a wad of cash and try to make your own way in the world. Maybe you start running minerals and metal between mines and refineries. Maybe you become a humble fruit picker and spend all your money on a sweet new scarf. Or maybe one day you’ll have an interview to become a medical helicopter pilot conducted by other players. It’s all possible.   Nice MODS and full of good RP BUT many BUGS and PROBLEMS with this game ..   I wont buy the game because y have in deathmatch 2 much bugs and in altis life y have 2 invest 2 much time to find a good server .. BUGS and other PROBLEMS are ruin the game ..-10

Arma 3Poorly optimised couldnt get more than 20fps no matter what settings i tried. Tried enabling hyperthreading through shortcut perameter and that didnt help. A lot of people online with high end hardware also report low frames.-10
Terrable UI really overly complicated controls which ruin the experence also game runs really badly low FPS.  Boring clearly for train spotters and virgins only.   1/10 utter rubbish.;-1;0

Terrible PC customization. FPS drops on multiplayer make it almost unplayable.;-1;0
This should be titled running simulator. The combat is shallow and is not good. The vehicle combat is terrible compared to battlefield. And onece again u run and run and run not to mention all the bugs and glitches u encounter. dont buy this;-1;0
 game extremely boring. Don't play unless you have a deticated group of friends.;-1;0
Arma 3This game is terrible. I bought this MULTIPLAYER game thinking I could connect with my MULTIPLE friends but no not happening unless you want to spend hours setting up your router to forward every port known to man or pay for a server. No wonder why people just stick with consoles and their online gaming. Pathetic-10
Arma 3Well So far arma 3 has been an excellent game! Except for one problem. I CANT PLAY ANYMORE! So I get on arma and go to play wasteland and then I find a server Join it choose my role and then i get the loading screen for the server. As i hear the arma 3 backround noises Battleye justs ruins everything. 'You have been kicked off the server (Client not responding)   I would like it if someone from bohema or battleye did something about it. Ive only played for three days and this happened. I dont know how to fix it. So i spent $40 on a piece of crap that wont let me play. All I have to say is that Battleye should be removed. Theres thousands of more servers to go play on. Let them hack! How about you do the work instead of a client that doesnt work! I love arma 3 but sadly this is what keeps me from playing it! This was 92% of the games I play. But iI cant play it because you guys wont fix it. So far WE HAVE! Ive seen other ways to fix it but none have worked for me. But instead of keeping players on by taking away some hackers (As in the ones that dont know what there doing) You taking away 1/3 of the population of arma! And the sad thing is YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS! Its been on your forums! Its been sent to you! BUT YOU HAVENT SAID ANYTHING! I am just dissapointed that you made an excellent game that 1/3 of the people that bought it cant play! I just hope you read this and realize that your game is going downhill.   - One less player  This is another review for the game and yet it still succeds to dissapoint Yet again I cannot play arma Why? Because everytime I click on the arma Icon to start the game it automatically crashes and then tells me to go to a crash report site at  http://feedback.arma3.com/ . I went on it and found nothing helpful I have emailed Bohemia and have yet to get a reply. For some reason all my friends can run the game just fine but I am stuuck with a crash report and a site that has no information that can help me at this time. Please contact bohemia and help get this problem fixed because it has been occuring for over a month now. After I wrote my last review I fixed the problem with a help of a friend and I loved the game but a few months after that this keeps on occuring. Please help me fix this problem because it is very frusterating and I would love to get back to playing this beautiful game.     Sincerely - Sithcyclist-10
Arma 3It is a good game but in the middle of a level the game crashed and I cannot play anymore. Battle eye also has trouble. Anybody has any idea whats going on?-10
Arma 3This game just does not work constant crashes bugs and endless garbage mods that will forever remain in 'beta'. I hear they're working on Arma 4 so this game wont even see anymore bug fixes instead they will release  DLC.

Arma 3this game is a waist of moneyshould be free wish i could sell it-10
Pros : beautiful island ; beautiful graphics and sound ; character control finally became comfortable ; ' Customization ' of equipment and weapons ; a powerful editor and support modifications. Cons : No campaign; terrible optimization in a network game ; indecent small amount of equipment.;-1;0
Arma 3First time using the CONFUSING menu eventually joined a server got to another CONFUSING menu then it black screened and i could not get off it even by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL ALT+ENTER etc...  Pretty  for a first time-10
I can truly say this game is a great game but the ing controls are the worst. I spent a whole hour on figuring out controls and game modes. The ONLY problem I have is the complicated controls.;-1;0
not a game that i would enjoy. just get frustrated. no reward for playing not fullfilling. in my trash games folder;-1;0
Arma 3What a waste of time and money. This game just like Arma2 does not seem to be finished. AI is a joke interface is super clunky. The only good you might be able to get from this game is multiplayer - that is if you have all the files/mods that the host have because the game won't download them for you you need to go to google find them and download them yourself.-10
Arma 3It's an awesome game been fan since Operation Flashpoint so I really like it and all that but it's an unoptimised garbage so I can't give it a thumbs up.-10
Arma 3This ing game. I played alot of Arma 2 loved it almost everything about it bar 1 thing. Stairs. The bane of my life. I had hopes that stairs wouldn't be my biggest killer in Arma 3 sadly they are. I mean how ing hard is it to make a game where stairs don't glitch you into walls and instantly wipe you out? I'll recommend this game when I can walk down a flight of stairs without worrying about getting sucked into the wall. Good ing day sir.-10

I not play this game even when arab prince give me 500£;-1;0
Arma 3This game is such a piece of . Come on Bohemia learn some  from your previous mistakes. The snipers are near impossible to use due to the dramatic weapon sway even when laying on the ground after 10 minutes. My player is tired after 10 seconds of sprinting and my game seems to run the same on ultra settings as it does on all low. The Arma engine is absolutely terrible and needs to be completely re-done. The ing go karts drive like  like the rest of the ing vehicles. I run over a wooden fence and my car blows up. The dumbest  will really  you the  off in this  waste of money.-10
Arma 3This game used to be so fun now I spend an hour or more getting started on my character only to be killed and have to start over. If you have alot of time to blow doing absolutely nothing then this is the game for you.-10
Arma 3Unless you are a REALLY REALLY big fan of the Operation Flashpoint lineage avoid this. Avoid it until they see their stocks plummet so far into the ground that they finally decide to get off their lazy  and fix this piece of  up.  It's been what two years now?  It's still a leaky piece of  with major FPS and performance problems of which mind you 3/4th of these issues come from the ORIGINAL operation flashpoint. Litteraly NOTHING has been done to remove any of these issues and it very obviously shows.  Only pick this up if you don't have any of the previous itterations it's exactly the same minus a few gameplay tweaks.-10
its a good game but over priced if you ask me.;-1;0
Arma 3Don't get people to download the game for free then charge them to play the following day.-10
Framerate is awful in all situations and the game is insanely unoptimized.;-1;0
Arma 32 years later but still a lot of lags bugs glitches and dropping in textures-10
PLEASE HELP. GOT AN ERROR MESSAGE WHEN FIRST TIME TO PLAY.VERY DISSAPOINTED.;-1;0
Arma 3Takes to much power to run I could get 40+ in dense areas and 100+ in not so dense area's on low settings. This was extremly unsatisfying. 40 FPS is not enough for a fps game IMO. I returned it after 2.5 hours of messing with the video settings.   I have an   i5 3570k R9 280x  8GB RAM -10
Arma 3I've only played this game for about 300 hoursbut numbers don't matter. I know what to say about this game. Lets start off with a nice little summary of the game.  ArmA IIIthe sequel to Arma IIcontinues it's theme of Military Simulation in a near-future settingon the Islands of Altis and Stratissouth of Greece. The game features a three part campaign and many multiplayer gamemodesranging from Team Deathmatch to Sector Control.  But summary's are useless. I'm going to tell you what you SHOULD know RIGHT AWAY.  First offDON'T ENTER THIS GAME TREATING IT LIKE CALL OF DUTY/BATTLEFIELD. This game is a LOT more realistic than 'shuut the gun and dey ded'. DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST DIVE IN. This game has quite a large learning curveso expect to die a lot at the start. If you want to practicefirst do Bootcamp then VR Trainingthen complete the campaign on Regular/Elite. You should be ready after that. Finally DON'T ENTER THIS GAME TO PLAY NON 'ARMA' GAMEMODES.This means gamemodes like Breaking PointEpochor Altis Life. These gamemodesin my opinion don't really represent what Bohemia was trying to achieve. Im not calling these gamemodes BADthey're ing great I just think that you should also look at the 'Military Simulation' gamemodeslike Invade &amp; Annex Co-operative missions or KOTH  Lets now do what I like to do when reviewing games Categorize and Pro-Con-ize.

Do you like Military?BUY IT. Realism? BUY IT. Role-playing?BUY IT.This has become my favorite game of all timeand the only thing that I think will beat it is ArmA IV.  BUY  THIS  GAME10
Arma 3Purchased the game beacause I was looking for a realistic shooter that can be played multiplayer. Fun for the first few hours as the missions are difficult but satisfying.   I played the game for a few hours got a hang of the controls and decided to go for the multiplayer. This was supposedly the strong area of the game and the reason I purchased it. Most reviewers give a very positve reviews on the game but fail to mention one detail : In order to effectively play online you need to purchase DLC'S and mods. The few servers I was able to access were empty or had little to no cooperation. The servers also have high ping and often unreliable connetions and this is from someone with wired high speed internet in southern california.   Pros : Realism Variety player support  Cons : DLC'S are a necessity to enjoy the game  To summarize do not purchase this game if you do not plan on also purchasing the $60 worth of DLC'S and modding it extensivly.-10
Arma 3Don't get me wrong this game plays fine and is really REALLY pretty so if you are after good graphics then this is your game. It just didn't appeal to me because at the end of the day it is really boring. This is coming from a guy who has played previous ARMA's and Operation Flashpoint games and this one is by far the worst. Pick up ARMA 2 instead and install a graphics mod. It's cheaper and is more fun overall. Just my opinion btw so you may totally disagree if you have the game.-10
Arma 3i used to love this game now i don't after the tapioca update the graphics were changed and my AMD can't keep up anymore so it's unplayable. they changed an ok graphics system to one that didn't improve realism and although its probably just me a little bit more eye strain. arma 3 is still an (alright) game compared to OA which is something I still hold dear and if you really do want arma 3 with it's mediocre altis life servers and lack of 8934 factions then buy it but i can't really reccomend it anymore-10
Arma 3If you're into trolling you'll probably enjoy this game. The community is incredibly toxic and most servers require you to utilize third party programs if you want to get the admins to enforce their own rules. It's a massive waste of time and it comes with a plethora of bugs such as getting stuck on weird corners and then dying for no reason as well as awkward collision mechanics. Join an altis server and watch an hour or twos work get  away by some 12 year old call of duty kid who refuses to follow server rules yet somehow never gets banned. If you complain about it prepare to receive a barrage of snide comments in the chat. The in game reporting system is nearly non existent. I tried really hard to give this game an honest go and after purchasing a helicopter and glitching into a pole immediately upon take off only to see several hours work explode away and then being gunned down by a troll straight after respawning I think I've had enough. Good luck and hope your experience is better than mine.-10
1. fix the ai intelligence 2. fix the neck rubberbanding 3. fix the fatigue 4. fix bugs such as not being able to heal and forced walking;-1;0
this game is nothing like the videos that i have seen about it! ive asked for a refund twice the first one they answered and the second tyhey just left! im not happy with steam as it cost me £35.99!;-1;0
Arma 3Horrible game very poorly written instructions the AI is awful. I would not spend your money on this game I regret it greatly.-10
Arma 3It's  m8 yeah has some cool features decent graphics at times and what not but it's broken... The engine is complete  it's just ing broken... Tbh idk how such a large gaming company put out such an unpolished turd... DLC's are coming out while memory leaks and game breaking mechanics still fail.... And how long has the game been out? Good god bohemia.-10
this game wont let me play and just now when i tried playing it says i dont have it.... STEAM REALLY!!!!!!;-1;0
Everything is amazing except the game needs more gunzzzzzzzzzzzzz like in arma 2;-1;0
most glitchy game EVER to be released. half the time it doesn't work and the oher half it keeps crashing. i'm at that point i want to uninstall it and i have only been playing for the last 4 hours that was after trying for 2 hours to get it working.;-1;1
Arma 3Terrible game not even worth the money-11
cod is better;-1;1
Arma 3UNABLE TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER BECAUSE NO LIST OF HOSTS POPULATE THE WINDOW-11
wow it's like i paid for arma 2 again.;-1;1
Arma 3Whoever is over the aiming department .To you sir i say.....duh....duh...duh...downsyndrom you   .I shoot alot in real life and this...this is just patheticlike truly pathetic.The skill it takes to hit someone running without a gun is just godlike.In real life hitting fast targets really isnt no more difficult than one moving slow but yall act like it takes a navy seal to shoot a gun.I dont know if yall are part of the anti gun group that thinks you dont have control of your gun while aiming but you do.even a 5 year old does-11
The graphics are amazing and weapons not to bad.. i have to recommend if you want a combat simulator go ahead. if you like battlefield/cod you will not most likely enjoy it to much...;-1;1
PIECE OF  BROKEN GAME! would have recommended it but game is broke for me at the Moral Fiber Mission. I want all my time wasted back. Absolute overprice peice of mut;-1;1
Arma 3Same old sh*t just a different name ..-10
Servers aren't optimized very well. Not as much content as Arma 2: only 2 maps and very few vehicles.;-1;0
horribly made shooter... fun with exile lame on its own...;-1;0
Arma 3Throught my playtime of Arma 3 I realized how empty it is. I don't mean to sound like your Call of Duty gamer that wants all the action in my face money shot style but I would like at least something to do in the long stretches of nothing-ness. I know people disagree and say it is more realistic to find the fight but I would like for the fight to be at least a few minutes away and obvious.-10
Arma 3Keep in mind before buying this game you'll have tons of time just getting the right mods to play online most of the online games has some kind of mods then you have to remove some mods to access another rooms.-10
Arma 3Do you enjoy buying games and being banned from them for no reason? Do you enjoy being accused of hacking a game and losing your purchase and when you try to contact the developers people in charge of the servers and the provider selling the game getting no response because they don't care? If you answered yes to any of these questions then go ahead and buy this game. If you didn't well this game isn't for you. Albeit the game is very fun when you're not banned. The customer support is so  poor that I cannot recommend this game at this time or any time.-10
The arm is gone dont know how dis was made but the jumping is shiot!;-1;0
Arma 3WEll This game started out great now all is does is crashes! starts running at 3 or 4 fps then crashes my computer!! even in editor. searched all over the internet found HEAPS of fixes but none of them work. comes down to the fact its just a poorly designed game  DONT NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-10
Well it would be a good review however the game seems to have a set resoloution that I can't change because I can't see anything. Waste of money even if it is on sale? YES;-1;0
Arma 3Spent 60 dollars for this game played it alot played the alpha and beta to test the game then today got battle eye banned for no reason and can't play one of my favorite games ever it seems like bohemia interactive is so cheap they have to use battle eye a screwed up hacker security setup that bans people who do nothing I was on yesterday play altis life then today I get on to go play with a friend I get a ban message they are too cheap to use VAC that actually works and doesn't ban people that do nothing it bans people that do hack and break the game I have also been banned on arma 2 OA and I sent a support message to battle eye and bohemia interactive and then I got a bot that messaged me back saying that I need to go to steam and I did I went to steam and I got a message from one of they're support consultants an actual person not a freaking bot I commemerate steam for this and I scould bohemia interactive and battle eye. I will be missing out on arma 3 life city life battle royale and many other fun game modes because I get banned for no reason by battle eye.-10
dont buy this if u have a AMD cpu;-1;0
why wont my game start?;-1;0
this game does not live up to it's predessors. Was very dissappointed.;-1;0
Lags when using multiplayer but when using campaign lag is gone and FPS is 100. Not going to play until they fix the lag in multiplayer and if you think it only me that lags in multiplayer maybe look up online and you will see.  I get 7-10 FPS on multiplayer I get 50-100 FPS on Campaign;-1;0
Arma 3While Arma 3 is a good game it is still has issues. Myself as well as a lot of other players have experienced multiple problems while playing one such problem would be when we are launching the game a message pops up saying 'Handle is Invalid'. Don't risk your $60 - $65 on a game that still has issues. Dissapointing...  EDIT: There have been a few things that I wish to add to this review. I think it was a poor decision on BIS part to add DLC's that cost money with little content. The Zeus free DLC/update hasn't done anything to the game multiplayer wise the karts DLC looks a bit fun but still needs more stuff the helicopter DLC only adds 2 choppers and a few new gameplay mechanics that should have been in a free update which costs $15. Also like I have stated before my game often crashes on even at the lowest possible settings. I'm overall dissapointed in this game and its just a HUGE waste of money that could be put to games that are ACTUALLY enjoyable and not riddled with bugs and costly DLC's.-10
Arma 360+ hours later this game still makes no sense. Multiplayer is buggy and laggy. Gamemodes are poorly designed the only thing that actually makes me play this game is the great editor it can be really fun to just make giant battles and play though them in different positions and perspectives.-10
Game not worth the money! UNLESS! You have a super hightech computer! Waist of 45Euro!;-1;0
Arma 3NOT RECOMENDED!  Why?  Well BI just keep adding steeply priced DLC that divides the community and or locks you out of things like guns scope vehilces skins etc.  I bought the game. (alpha BTW as soon as it went on sale long time ARMA fan since op flash)  I bought the first overpriced karts DLC (Only ever used a kart once in an online server)  I bought the helicopter DLC (Only so I could pilot the new helis nothing like finding a heli in Epoch and not being able to fly it until you buy another $30 DLC also the advanced controls are trash and ABSOLUTLEY no one uses them)  aaaaaannnnd I bought the overpriced marksman DLC to so I could actually use the guns I would pick up in King Of The Hill mode and not have stupid symbols pop up right in the middle of the sights.  So far this game has cost me over $140 AUS and now they lock me out of all the new stuff again and most of the servers have swithced to the new paid DLC map. So I guess I'll have to buy that to or just stick to empty servers...  When will this game be complete and not be over charging me for mostly useless addons?  p.s. with all of my money you think BI could optimize the engine so I don't need to overclock my i7 to 5ghz paired with my 1080 to get decent frames?-10
Huge Arma 2 fan close to 1900 hours in game recorded and probably alot more in mods.   Arma 3 is getting better but then this DLC package stuff has really in  me off. I bought into the game to support the development and now I have to buy in again to use a few weapons and what not?   Feels like a bait and switch. Sure I don't have to buy it but then your only using a small maount of the lesser effective weapons in the game. If this is BIS idea of pay for play they can get ed.;-1;0
Arma 3YOU GUYS ED UP MY GAME!  9/26/16  I decided to jump back into the game after having not played for a while. Several months ago I was an avid map maker and I just wanted to simply jump back in for a hot second and shoot some enemies. But guess what I find out. THEY ED UP THE EDITOR COMPLETELY! Now its all in 3D and I cant do  because the controls are garbage and the ing layout sucks ! I am aware of the map option but its not like how it was! I believe I spent $60 ing dollars on this game when it first came out years ago and now I regret ever buying it. If I hadnt of bought it such a long time ago id be asking for a refund right now.  If anyone is thinking of buying this game because you saw a Youtuber playing it I highly suggest NOT picking it up. It has gotten way to ing complicated than its ever been and the interface is hugely disappointing. PLUS Bohemia Interactive has snuck in dlc into the game for $40!!!!!!! HOLY ! I just spent $60 on your game now you need more money?  greedy ! I probably wouldve bought Tonoa too if it wasnt for the utter disaster you guys have created in the editor! Im taking my money elsewhere! Ill just watch Frankie play it instead. So long....-10
Arma 3I have been a fan of tactical shooters for as long as I can remember my first one being the original Rainbow six and all of its additions. Hidden and Dangerous Ghost Recon And the game that spawned this one Operation Flashpoint. As buggy and screwed up as that game was I was still able to eveintually play it. Not the case with this game. There is no excuse for the graphical bugs and gameplay issues present in this game.   There has been ample time for this game to be optimized and yet it is still a mess. I am able to play every graphic intensive game out there on my system yet this one is barely playable. It seems some people have been able to get it to work but no luck here. This is unfortunate as it looks like I would love this type of gameplay based on my history however looks like I'll never find out since I can't even get it to run properly.-10
Arma 3I wanted to like this game so much. The controls are so extremely horrible and the muted gunshots past 100 yards just remove any immersion from the expansive battlefield. I just cannot reccomend this game or series to anyone. Don't get me started on the network issues on any and all servers i've tried. Have you ever seen a vehicle move across the battlefield smoothly? Not me.   100FPS on max settings too.-10
i git it for free and now its not why;-1;1
so i downloaded the dlc bundle for arma 3 and i try enabling it and i restart it and then i get back on and its not there ive tried verifying cache;-1;1

I will waste my money some where they atleast pretend to care about customers.  Day 21 still no help. was emailled to delete my profile deleted all arma 2 and arma 3 profiles and the game still crashes.... they would have to give there products away and I still would not own one.-10

This review is better than the 'game'. And you have to buy the overpriced dlc to join most servers.;-1;0
Arma 3Arma 3 = running around for half an hour and eventually get shot by an AI BOT that is using iron sights at 2km distance and who you can't even find using a scope because he's behind a bush! In other words unplayable and unenjoyable even on rookie settings unless you have 20 mods and then you'll spend 1 year trying to configure everything to your liking. Then when you go online all servers have different mods that you may like or not like.-10

Arma 3Bugfest unstable crashes horrid optimization casues full system shutdowns. I7 4790k @ 4.5GHZ GTX 970 16gb vengence ram 512 crutial SSD max 30-40 FPS with everything on ultra **Update** Uninstalled. Lost all of my player data not once but twice because they are too greedy to have deticated servers. I am out.-10
Arma 3Pros: -sick graphics -sick physics -sick control capabilities -awesome dialogue between npcs and player -alot of realism in the camp setups and mission stories -multiplayer is alot of fun if you have 20+ friends  Cons: -enemies that can magically see you in full camo while u prone behind bushes at 3-400 meters distance with no zoomed sights or binoculars  -appearance of a difficult campaign based on designed circumstances requiring you to 'corpse run' your way through it or be Chuck Norris and one man army groups of 30 enemies at a time at 300 meters with nothing but an unsighted crap rifle and no ammo  -fatigue system that forces you to walk slowly and stop to rest while your npc partners can sprint 1000 meters in front of you and get killed leaving you to once again Chuck Norris your way through missions.  -over 100 silly keybinds that are not even good as far as default keybinds go and will require at least an hour configuring them so you can use about 20 of them. (Changing from a laptop to a desktop requires you to reconfigure all of them again)  -multiplayer requires 20+ friends   I recommend this game if you want to hate a game while spending hours afk in a bush because despite what the story requires your character is not Chuck Norris and you can't do anything.-10

Arma 3Great Idea for a game still didn't reach the point to where it is a game. It gets boring and repetitive after a very short period of time. Multiplayer isn't fun at all you get all these trolls that kill you while being on the same team. The finisher for me was when I tried using the editor Considering that I bought Arma 3 on sale for 20$ The actual price for the full game including the DLCs is way more.   Arma 3 is an interesting idea for a game should you buy it ? Absolutely ing NOT!!!!!-10
Arma 3oh you find a sniper rifle ingame?  you and buy the dlc! Wanna get into that Choppa? Go grab the in dlc! Woa that gokart seems like fun! Such a suprise it's a dlc content! You can't use any dlc content but the in game downloads them.-11
Arma 3Horrible graphics horrible performance on a dual 980Ti setup.-10
Have an AMD processor? You are  out of luck because the frames drop like crazy in most multiplayer servers.;-1;0
It has potential but definately is not there yet.;-1;0

Arma 3its good just wish it ran better.  my life i hate being poor work 40-60 hours a week just to survive with very little 'fun' money inorder for me to purchase a new build would require me to save for the next 3 years 'did the math to have minimum requirments met' and by then BI would have put out ArmA 4 by then then i restart my never ending cycle of un-enjoyable saving for a decent CPU and motherboard and ram and graphics card and everything else. Its fun on low settings with the resolution scaled down to about the 75% mark world looks pretty plain with no vegitation and no shadows even then still get a lovely 10-18 FPS i hit 22 fps once... once.  Fun over all tho. Thanks BI for an enjoyable game. :)10
Dont buy this if you dont have a decent computer. I love my 10 fps in multiplayer!;-1;0
Single player is really weak and boring. Multiplayer is not fun for me. I need to keep playing to hopefully find a mode I like. It took me a long time to learn how to enjoy Arma2 and I think this will be the same. I have had it for years but haven't found the motivation to do that yet. Also the clouds are bugged and look really weird and they never fixed it in about 3 years.;-1;0
Arma 3I know it's a great game.. but it's unplayable for me. oh god it's optimized so poorly and I wanted to enjoy it so badly. both cpu and gpu didn't have spikes above 60% utilization.. ( 1070 oc and 6600k oc ) And yes I've read forums on how to optimize but it barely helped.. the drops are just too massive..-10
Arma 3If you like awful AI Ai that can shoot you through tree's rocks planes. And well everything if you love not being able to see who you were shot from and then not being able to complete a mission because the AI have ran off and you can't find them get this game. 10/10 for bad AI. Like seriously games that costs £2 have better AI than this. Simulator my . Would recommend for the fact the only decent part about this game is the multiplayer- except well you have to get mods to play half of the servers then the mods you get are outdated or modified on the server making it hard to get on said server. Will recommend when the developers actually take their time to make the game well playable. Don't get Apex if you have read this comment as it is literally are searching simulator find the guy that shot you so you can finish the mission simulator is more accurate. OH and btw the AI have a 90% chance of a headshot on you making them kill you instanstly almost everytime. Especially annoying when ARma decided to put a death limit on the missions...-10
Arma 3Ill get into the fps and system specs first then the graphics gameplay and my opinion on the game. The game's fps drasticly changes depending on what server and if you're using any mods and the action that's going on in your server my game usually runs from around 20 to 70 fps. The 20fps can happen if there's alot of action around with explosions vehicles driving around helicopters and jets flying. This is the performance i have on: Intel i3-6100 @3.70Ghz(4cpus) 8GB RAM Geforce GTX 750ti MSI B150 gaming M3 motherboard. I get that fps on kind of medium-high graphics i have some settings on ultra but some on low. I've found that to work for me the best. The game overall looks beutifull depending on the map and server render distance limitations. The gameplay is highly customizable litteraly you can make any mission and find mods for any type of situation you want to play or any kind of operation you want to do though this needs a good editor or editing team. The game is great especially with mods the base game after around 200 hours seems very plain and has nothing new to offer the dlc isnt good the dev's dont make the dlc and new updates compactible with mods and thus making problems for highly modded servers the game itself with mods is playable very long friends to play with is a bonus and deffinetly makes everything more fun and interesting but its not a necesity you can play solo too though it will deffinetly get boring faster than with friends. I recommend everyone to try this but dont purchase the dlc's they're not worth it if you are sure that you will use them and/or need them only then purchase them becuse the updates of the game are free only some useless content which the dlc add's that could be aquired via mods months before.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ As of October 2016 i can barely reccomend this game due to the actions of its developer apex dlc which they released at the price of 30Euro is very much the most overpriced dlc i've ever seen it does not offer content for the price that it asks 21/10/16 Just saw that they're releasing 5 more dlc's in 2017 1 of them will be free which dosent matter becuse it probably will be . Jets Dlc 'Orange' Dlc Malden 'free' dlc tac-ops Dlc Tanks Dlc  i cannot express how bad this is instead of updating the game with fixes and optimization updates they create dlc similiar to Payday 2's developer - Overkill which is very bad if it does go down to the point where dlc's are more than the base game itself can offer it will become a pay to play game similiar to World of warcraft or skyrim online where you need to pay every month to play surely you wont need to pay every month but the dlc seemingly will fall into your lap and ask you to buy them bassicly vets of arma 2 and now arma 3 players will feel the need to buy these becuse of the simple fact that the previous dlc didnt offer as much as it should bassicly resulting in an endless DLC spam from the devs instead of updating and adding content to the base game. If you do not have the dlc you will be recieving  ad's all around the game you payed allready for for example driving in any other seat than driver seat in any apex vehicle or using any apex gear such as the re-skinned vests or uniforms. Also commenting this fact on the roadmap announcment in steam i was banned for 5 days and my comment was deleted even though the game is rated 16+ and rated with bad lenguage so i dont understand what the  is up with this bias that the devs are trying to make out of arma 3. Its sad i really enjoyed arma 2 with barely any dlc if these dlc's result in me not being able to fully enjoy this game the dlc will come but ill go.-10

Also commenting this fact on the roadmap announcment in steam i was banned for 5 days and my comment was deleted even though the game is rated 16+ and rated with bad lenguage so i dont understand what the  is up with this bias that the devs are trying to make out of arma 3. Its sad i really enjoyed arma 2 with barely any dlc if these dlc's result in me not being able to fully enjoy this game the dlc will come but ill go.-10
200 hours and i still dont know what im doing;-1;1
Single player is really weak and boring. Multiplayer is not fun for me. I need to keep playing to hopefully find a mode I like. It took me a long time to learn how to enjoy Arma2 and I think this will be the same. I have had it for years but haven't found the motivation to do that yet. Also the clouds are bugged and look really weird and they never fixed it in about 3 years.;-1;0
Arma 3I know it's a great game.. but it's unplayable for me. oh god it's optimized so poorly and I wanted to enjoy it so badly. both cpu and gpu didn't have spikes above 60% utilization.. ( 1070 oc and 6600k oc ) And yes I've read forums on how to optimize but it barely helped.. the drops are just too massive..-10
I dont reall like this gamei havve a exelent computer i got this game fo $20 and i hate it;-1;0

Arma 3Great Idea for a game still didn't reach the point to where it is a game. It gets boring and repetitive after a very short period of time. Multiplayer isn't fun at all you get all these trolls that kill you while being on the same team. The finisher for me was when I tried using the editor Considering that I bought Arma 3 on sale for 20$ The actual price for the full game including the DLCs is way more.   Arma 3 is an interesting idea for a game should you buy it ? Absolutely ing NOT!!!!!-10
THe fact that use Battleeye like a anticheats engine is enogh to give a bad rating !;-1;0

Arma 3Arma 3 is a videogame that can be a simulator.  The engine is really old though and it can't handle everything. Sure it looks good but it is kinda old.-10
Arma 3I don't get why theres so many good reviews for this game. Yes its fun but its so unfinished in terms of realism yes you can say this game is as realistic as it gets and its difficult but giving AI unforgiving aim and reaction time isn't realism people. This games idea is a gemstone but they chipped away it and cut corners while making this one they actually just didnt even work hard the Flow of the game is just dull and the physics are god awful cars get stuck on fences helicopter blades fly off when you hit a tent you get stuck in floor for vaulting? Its just so hard to play with the game mechanics just being unfinished. Its fun to play with friends but when it falls to the Milsim portion you just cant. Specially trained soldier? cant run 20 meters without breathing your entire lung capacity. Need to snipe some taliban? Oh heres no bipod. Driving 120kms an hour? here hit a bush and explode Its just so hard to play with this broken engine. Go Back to ARMA 2.-10

Arma 3Broken Single Player Might Be Good Fun as a MilSim with a Group ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately while the concept is generally solid the game fundamentally doesn't work at a basic level. Trying to spot let alone shoot targets that are just a pixel or two across doesn't make for entertaining gameplay. Is that slightly lighter green pixel an enemy soldier or just a rendering quirk?  This is made worse by the poor adaptation of the weapons and sighting which simply does not resemble real life. In game at 100m the dot on the scope is the same size as a targets head. IRL I've shot (dummy) targets out to 600m using iron sights and 4x scopes. At 100m you should be picking out which eyeball you want the round to go through.  Further more the single player game is simply broken. NPCs automatically track you and can see and shoot through objects and foliage*. This makes those infiltration scenarios a waste of disk space. In fact since one of the basic pillars of the game is supposed to be finding good cover pretty much all the missions are pointless. The campaign is  the showcases are the worst and the VR training room is so totally lame that I actually felt like I was playing WoW again.  Finally a kart racing addon for a MilSim are you serious? Obviously Bohemia is not.  If you're buying the game to play online with a group either coop or PvP then this may suit you but in that case you probably didn't need this review.  ----- * Yes I am aware that rounds can penetrate cover I'm talking about rocks and HESCO.-10
Arma 3now im playing arma for a couple of days and there are many thing that anoyed me :  1. quads are nothing much more than offroads ...just smaller. quads have no problem with rolling over 5-10 cm high rock pills. seriously  i crash and suffer damage from micro stone walls on the fields that are not bigger than 10cm.   2. when i bought the game i was so ing happy to install it on my new computer( wich i specially bought to play arma3) and was dissapointed. System: AMD FX-4300 Quad core processor (3.8GHZ) Nvidia Geforce GT 730 4GB Palit 16 GB RAM  that is way more than what is required . still i get only max 30 FPS on almost everything LOW and distance of 1100m. there are games developed by LOW LOW LOW LOW LOW end studios like Mortal Online from Star vault( only about 10-15 devs if im right) wich runs VERY much better but has higher requirements plus the game is Free. everything i leaned of bohemia is  that they just create bad optimized games for big prices . i can even run battlefield 4 on this computer on medium-High   3. i never thought about that bohemia became THAT corrupt to put standart weapons like AKU AKM ect. into a DLC that is about !!!30!!! euros. the DLC APEX includes some interesting new vehicles and clothes  but since ive seen so many weapons wich are these days NOTHING SPECIAL i decided to not buy the DLC .  4. RPG and Altis Life literally destroyed arma 3. there are TOOONS of RPG and altis life servers  wich have NOTHING to do with a combat simulation and sooo less game modes like CTI wich HAVE something to do with arma that arma is besides all the other crap nothing more than a expensive GTA San andreas Multiplayer clone.   in Short : a expensive GTA SA:MP game made without any love bad optimized that will go very very many times on ur nerves with some adverts while u snipe or play just because u bought a gun from a DLC with ur last money without knowing it . when u are looking for a combat simulation  go buy counterstrike but dont buy arma3 -11
Arma 3Pros: -Beautiful graphics -Open world giant map -Massive MILSIM immersion -Large Variety of stuff  vehicles  weapons  MODS gamemodes  player stances ( this one i've never saw in any game)  Cons: - optimization this game after years  after Arma 2 didn't change at all expect 30 fps or minus over MP -Crappy SP AI bots are dumb as C.S Hostages -Sp missions may be broke sometimes -Not realistic at all for a distinguished MILSIM game  what the hell is all that futuristic halo crap? -Every now and then you must buy Apex DLC you are forced too  unless you don't wanna to play MP -Unrealistic Weapons Vehicles Soldier Gear  - Apex is more a call of duty infinite warfare dlc than MILSIM one  6/10 by a 2k hour ArmA player-10

Arma 3The Minimum or Recommended System Requirements are totally FAKE my graphics is NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650Ti but i just get 20fps in all low settings...that is super super horrible but the gameplay is excellent hope i can back in one or two years to recommend this game!-10
Arma 3its good just wish it ran better.  my life i hate being poor work 40-60 hours a week just to survive with very little 'fun' money inorder for me to purchase a new build would require me to save for the next 3 years 'did the math to have minimum requirments met' and by then BI would have put out ArmA 4 by then then i restart my never ending cycle of un-enjoyable saving for a decent CPU and motherboard and ram and graphics card and everything else. Its fun on low settings with the resolution scaled down to about the 75% mark world looks pretty plain with no vegitation and no shadows even then still get a lovely 10-18 FPS i hit 22 fps once... once.  Fun over all tho. Thanks BI for an enjoyable game. :)10
FPS is terrible in this game prepare to drop below 30 in any server with more than 75 people  Also it's pay 2 win you can buy DLC snipers that are way better than the normal ones. Stay away from this game totally not worth the price they don't optimize the game at all.;-1;0
Arma 3100+ hours of entertainment. You are going to need a pretty good computer to get the most out of it.  After a while Battleye kicks in while you get kicked out... forever. Battleye directly denies access to the game you paid to access for no reason.-10

Arma 3Full of bugs this is glitches galore what little content there is seems unfinished and rough. Its hard to call this a game and it doesn't completely qualify as a simulator yet. There are no collision mechanics vehicles colliding with each other or some objects usually ends with one of them flying off into the distance. I wouldn't recommend this game for 60$ not even for 40$ this was released as a 'full game' months before it should be and we're still waiting on a real full release in the mean time they haven't even added any of the old vehicles or equipment there is very little hope and I'd say the only salvagable content is the modding community which so far has kept arma 3 alive for as long as it is though most of the people who purchased it have given up.  I want my money back.-10
its ;-1;1
Arma 3it would be a 11/10 if you could join a populated server without high ping and buying the dlcs so far no servers in my area runs without arma 3 apex and low ping. guess im stuck in singleplayer -10
Arma 3Arma 3. Well what can I say about this piece of . For a normally 60 dollar game the graphic are unappealing to say the least. Alright that's it! I'm done with this game! I'd rather press my face against a Hippopotamus' butt while it 'muck-spreads'! That's when a hippo takes a  rather than allowing the  to drop from it's  it presses it's tail against it's own -crack waving it back and forth shredding the  all over the place! That's how much fun this game is! Like putting a turd in a fan or a band-saw you just don't do it!   In other words don’t buy it save ur money. -10

Arma 3IF YOU WANT THIS GAME FOR DAYZ MOD BUY IT FOR SURE! The dayZ mod runs flawlessly on my PC. As much as I love this game it is so poorly optimized. I would've thought by now it would at least run a little better in multiplayer but it is still pretty laggy and I get tops 40fps on a good day. The rest of the times its 30 and under (mostly under) no matter how low or high I have the graphics settings. The game is so much fun when it runs correctly and it has a decent campaign buy it if you have brand new hardware. If you are running with something about 2 years old its gonna be booty. Like I said 3 times in this one review I LOVE THIS GAME and you will meet some really cool people working as a team... That is if you can handle low fps 90% of the time.-10

Arma 3I really need help I have a fx 6300 clocked at 4.0ghz and a gtx 960 but i only run at 30 frames all low. I tried alot of differant methods I have seen a couple of bench marks with the exact same specs as me and the get at least 80 fps. Hopefully I didn't just spend 60$ on a game where I should be running 60fps max.-10
Some things glitch out and end up not working;-1;0
Arma 3Absolutely terrible game. Totally unoptimised. I'm running on a high spec PC however the FPS is averaging around 10. This isn't acceptable and I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this game. To be honest it's the entire ARMA 3 engine.. Just poorly created.-10
Arma 3I think the forum post that I made sums it up well. Tl;dr the game's community is terrible and the multiplayer is full of  mods that barely work with the occasional gem ruined by the community that inhabits it. For a more detailed review of my free weekend day with the game read below.   After my dad bought arma 3 I thought I would try it out as well. I've been interested in a realistic modern FPS but they don't really exist in numbers these days. After taking over an hour to install the game I was able to play the tutorial while tweaking with my video settings. I eventually up to over 30 FPS while looking really good. Then I decided I wanted to try the multiplayer out. What a mistake that was. ARMA 3's player base is actually worse than ARMA 2's in that every single online server is some  reincarnation of the Hunger Games or DayZ without the zombies. I spent about 4 hours trying to have fun in these game modes. But to no avail I was playing a really bad set of mods set in a gigantic map that might as well be a copy of Just Cause 2's getaway island all in a modern FPS simulator. It was like trying to play paintball in playground that was clearly a copy of McDonald's playplaces.  After some searching I eventually found a Domination server which was as close to vanilla ARMA as I was going to get. It was incredibly confusing there was no tutorial to explain any of the game mechanics/mod additions and people were wrecking the base's vehicles. I was desperate so I tried to play anyways. After about 10-15 mins of gameplay I noticed that my FPS was lagging really badly. I had just found a team of coordinated players though so I just tried to play through the pain. After the 5 of us singlehandedly took the next objective everyone was complaining about FPS issues and I was getting 13-18FPS. There was clearly something wrong but luckily for us a moderator just got on! He reset the server for us which I thought was really nice.  But it was to no avail. Everyone was still having FPS issues and I guess that has to do with ARMA 3's terrible optimization and/or the custom map's or plugin's memory leakage filling up our RAM. Then I encountered a new problem. The moderator. He was especially grumpy and clearly over 40 so being so out-of-touch with not understanding everything he was getting really upset at all of the new players. He understandably kicked a new player that was spamming the minigun on our helicopter even after the moderator told him to stop.  And then I got kicked for no reason presumably because I was also in the helicopter? I came back in told him that he kicked the wrong guy and the moderator essentially blew me off. Whatever screw him then. I found a FOB to spawn on that somebody set up on the enemy's flank. I was able to shoot a couple of guys before they shot me off the hillside. I spawn back in and everyone is doing awesomely. The enemy has a Frogfoot firing missiles and bombs into the city the Warthog is doing the same thing we had mortars they had mortars and I was able to move into the town because it was getting absolutely hammered.  So I set up shop in a 2nd story window down a street when I spot a couple of soldiers. I aimed at thier bodies but couldn't see a IFF tag so I shot one of them. After the other part of this ambushed squad came back out in the open I shot another one. I was unsure about whether they were friend or foe still so I kept an eye out for server messages in the lower-right corner. Loe and behold this guy was a friendly and I just shot him. The other guy must've been a friendly too which means that I accidently killed 2 of my teammates. I immediately said sry on Side Chat but it was too late.  Apparently the immature community that seems to make up ARMA 3's multiplayer though it would be funny to set up a special plugin for teamkillers. Whether it was an accident or not after 2-3 TKs you are immediately teleported away from the game and your position in the town to some prison with several annoying soundbites going on in the background and nothing to look at but other TKers and a really low-quality repeated billborad of some kind. After I sat there for a few moments I was also wearing pink clothing that had TEAM KILLER printed all over it. And there was a soundbite of a baby crying because that's how annoying the moderators wanted to be.  In short I accidently made a mistake and was punished in the most immature way possible. By being imprisoned in an annoying micspam room with nothing to do for 6 minutes. Wow. In every other FPS you either lose a bunch of points get kicked or are killed by the server. In ARMA 3 the s that run the only close-to-vanilla server throw you in a prison that forces you to listen to once again MIC SPAM that is against the server's own rules.  I'm so glad that I got to try this game out this weekend because I would have regrets had I bought it. Thank you ARMA devs for letting me experience the tiness that is your multiplayer. Glad I didn't waste my money on it.-10
Arma 3Poor performance on high-end PCs Low player count huge learn curve.  Good for people with nerves of steel bad for anyone that does not have more than 3-4 hours of just sitting and waiting for something to happen.   Not recommended.-10
Arma 3Arma 3 broken game broken promises. Arma 3 alpha comes out has great voice over quality great hit registry guns work when you shoot them. They update it. Broken voice over broken hit registry (90% of bullets don't register a hit) car physics are for trolls all the servers are run by admin and friends (donate money and they will ban whoever you don't like) planes don't work AA shoot you down from 5 km away. The only thing fun is flying a helicopter. Running is broken in the game. Play epoch mod and get shot by a five year old hiding in the bushes in his underwear. Bad games made worse. Just pretty graphics however half the servers run terribly and don't support high frames so even if you have a nice computer good luck getting good frames. Would have been great if they just left it in alpha instead of screwing it up.-10
Arma 3Tried this for the free weekend to see if I could enjoy it. Played on normal and the difficulty was far too great for me to find fun. I respect this game and feel its good and everything but even on the lowest difficulty I find it near impossible to find and shoot the enemy. Gun sway is really intense and this is with me lagging behind the rest of the AI players walking to preserve energy (im aware of the extra stamina drained when moving crouched). Enemy seems to be able to see through foliage. If you like incredibly difficult things this game is for you. I took my time to do the tutorial learn the buttons positioned myself carefully and usually just ended up getting shot. Theres time compression thank god however a lot of people might not even realize its there. This game has its moments but I would recommend Operation Flashpoint Red River over this any day I find it much more satisfying moment to moment. I am an adult with a full time job walking through the woods simulator isnt my thing I gave this game a chance and I feel as though I wasted two hours of my life yesterday. I want to love this game as much as the original operation flashpoint...but I can't I simply can't (in cleetus voice). Graphically things went well I have a gtx 660 and 10 gigs of RAm on an i5 with shadow play on and recording I was getting somewhere between 25-70 FPS. FPS drops intensely around buildings. I am runnning it on ultra settings. If you have a system similar to mine you can be pretty much assured to play at an acceptable framerate. If you have friends to play with turn on OF:Red River. The friend I tried this with was too frustrated with the shooting mechanics to enjoy it. This game is good mind you but not for me....-10
Arma 3Paid $70 for this and I've spent more time trying to figure out how to join multiplayer servers than I have even played the game:  Play&gt;Multiplayer&gt;any server - - Loads for a second then returns me to server list without saying why as if it never happened before.  Waste of money thanks.-10
Arma 3Arma 2? Amazing. Decent DLC. Arma 3? Great. HORRIBLE DLC. For the simple fact they're charging £10.99 for TWO helicopters I'm just done witht his game.-10
Arma 3Arma 3 is not a game you should pay $60.00 for. The game does indeed offer a few nice features but it does not offer the good realistic and tactical gameplay you would recieve from Arma 2-10
fix everything plz;-1;0
Arma 3All I can say is this is the worst POS coded game I have ever played. While I do not have the most current hardware 280x 3.6GHZ Proc 16GB Ram and SSD the FPS are at best 24. When using autodetect I get 14fps. Really? I spent money on this? Save your money and buy something playable. I even tried the process prioroty and run scripts. THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY-10
Arma 3Bad optimisation in the engine leads to FPS lag meaning you need a pretty insane rig to run it even tho you shouldnt have to. Has A LOT LESS content than previous Arma versions (Not counting community ofc). I enjoy the game but the FPS issues (which cant be fixed because they have to re-design the engine) and the lack of conent makes it stale quite quickly.  Edit: Due to some incredible community members some missions are now actually playable. Wasteland by Sa-matra is very stable as are some Altis life servers.  System:  i7 4770k @ 22ghz 32Gb RAM @ 1600Mhz GTX 970 OC'd  With this I get around 20-60FPS wether It's on low or ultra it still runs the same.-10
Arma 3Sad to see how far Bohemia Interactive has fallen. Dont buy this B$#@ S%$@ or the DLC all DLC should have been in the game in the first place! ARMA 2 had chinooks in the game for free they released Cart Racing DLC before Helicopter DLC.... If you do own ARMA 3 already dont waste your money on DLC the community will mod more Helicopters/Islands into the game for free then BIS ever will. Just wait dont waste your money.  Stay Far Away-10
Arma 3Arma 3 is definitely more improved than Arma 2 the experience is much better and the graphics has improved and the maps seem to be bigger. However to play it with at least 30fps or higher you need a supercomputer to do so as this game is horribly optimised. Here is a comparision of my frame rates playing different games  Battlefield 4 - 70fps (ultra settings) Tomb Raider - 120fps (Ultra settings) Arma 3 - 40 fps (Standard settings)  The graphics of this game is comparable to Tomb Raider.  Verdict: Don't buy it unless you own a supercomputer.-10
Arma 3I bought Arma 3 way back in the heady days of Early Access past. I remember very distinctly playing a bit with it playing some multiplayer with friends and thinking to myself 'This is cool but it feels unfinished'. So I let it sit for a while.  Arma 3 came out of early access and that feeling of unfinished-ness never faded. The amount of content in the base game is frankly embarassing. There's basically one of everything: one OPFOR IFV one BLUFOR IFV one OPFOR assault rifle one BLUFOR assault rifle etcetera. The content that is there feels much less like it belongs in a series touted as a realistic infantry environment simulator and more in the latest AAA shooter- firearms with tinny unconvincing sound vehicles with fictionalized designs and paint schemes that make them look like they just rolled off the set of a bad low budget scifi film CSAT infantry have  bugeyes on their helmets. The underwater gameplay is a one-trick pony of a gimmick- there's a single underwater-capable rifle in the entire game and there's rarely a reason to actually do the sort of frogmen ops the rebreather gear lets you do unless you absolutely positively must find some way to cram it into a mission you're making.  On top of all that they nixed the old DLC policy that I absolutely loved- wherein if you didn't have a DLC you could still make full use of its content but at a lessened (visual) quality. Instead you just can't make use of DLC equipment and vehicles- you get a large popup telling you to buy the DLC (or at least that's how it was last time I played).  It's frustrating. Arma 3 iterates so well on Arma 2 in some areas and completely fails to deliver in most others. The new movement and physics are a massive step forward from Arma 2 the new flight modelling on helos (while not being DCS quality or anything) is great the game looks significantly better. But there's barely any content (a problem BIS won't be correcting: they're already selling DLC) and what content is there feels jarringly disconected from the idea of realistic infantry combat this franchise sells itself on.-11
Arma 3How is this a Full release game....? THe net code is from 1998 and it can barely get 40 fps online. Single player is great! But holy  man the whole point is to play online. There is a game changing glitch or neck snapping d-sync every 8 seconds. Walls just randomly murder you and the cqc is just dreadful. Id write a longer reveiw but i just dont care i already put 100 hours in this abortion.-11

I have an 8350 clocked at 5.0 and a video card 290x twinfrozer. I score 9250 on 3dmark and this game runs like crap no matter what. On top of all this I hate the amount of control buttons this games always have. They need to make them like operation flashpoint.;-1;0
Arma 3Eh.   I'm gonna plug away and play this to the end someday but even if you buy it now and aren't affected by the fact that the initial release contained maybe one fifth of the final content they slowly leaked out to users there are still so many issues with this game that it's not really that fun to play. Yes it's realistic I suppose if you don't count the fact that you can be shot in the face by a man with the vision of an eagle and the aim of a robot who is so far away or hidden behind bushes that you can't even see him but it's not fun to play.   Consider the mines in the forest of the second level that you can't detect and kill you forcing a checkpoint restart and a frustrating trial-and-error progression through the area again and again.   Consider the checkpoint about 5 minutes along from that one that is placed at the start of a 3 minute march followed by a battle that if you die during it makes you start back at the beginning of the eventless 3 minute march.  Consider these issues exacerbated by the manual save system that only lets you save at certain times effectively dooming you to long endless stretches of replaying and replaying until you can slog through whatever ery they stick in front of you.   Consider the poor optimisation that leaves the game chugging on a high-end pc and still displaying all kinds of low-res textures anyway.   Consider the frequent updates that corrupt your save files and render them unplayable.   Consider the lack of a co-op campaign - one of the few things that made the buggy mess of ARMA II fun and literally the only reason I bought this game in the first place. Perhaps I should have done my research but then perhaps I had no idea what the total content of this game would contain when it bought it and was shocked to find it bare-bones until they released the last of it months after I purchased it.   In some ways it's a vast improvement over its predecessor - it looks much better and the confusing and encyclopedic control system is explained MUCH better. The mission objectives are also a lot clearer and completing a given mission isn't as much of a 'pray that you're in the wrong place rather than that the game as bugged out' scenario.   But I still I don't know what Bohemia were attempting with this - so many design choices leave me tearing my hair out in frustration (why on earth would it take them months after release to add a tutorial section to the game? Should that not have been one of the first pieces of content released?). However I suppose that most of my gripes regarding content have been resolved at this point so at least that's a plus for those considering whether to buy but all the odd little design quirks combine together to make playing this game a minefield in itself.   One wrong move and you're ed.   I do not recommend this game.-10
Arma 3This game is buggy as  have fun clipping through walls and spawning outside of the map  physics... it's like from one of those indian movies if you hit something you gonna feel the impact after few seconds.  Do not buy this game.-10
This game is trash. Arma 2 with updated graphics and controls. You cant run for more than 10 seconds at a time because EVERYONE IS OVERWEIGHT apparantly. Just ruins the game. Cant go anywhere quickly unless its in a vehicle. AWFUL... was going to buy if it was like 10 bucks at christmas sale but not anymore. This game blows just like arma 2. The only thing arma 2 had going for it is dayz mod. and even that got old.;-1;0
Arma 3Buggy mess in which I get around 15fps in large multiplayer battles on the lowest settings on a GTX 670. Oh the AI on single player is absolute dog  too but at least I get around 40fps on single player! :D-10
Arma 2 was better. The pay to win kinda ruins it and battleroyal is the only good mod. Wasteland is kinda boring on the giant map.;-1;0
unoptimized as hell;-1;1
Arma 3i am ing angry because they make me pay almost as much as the ing base game costs for DLC disgusting-11
Horrible optimization on a system that runs Doom on high settings at 60 fps. Really wish I could get a refund.;-1;1
 fps on any setting;-1;1
This game would be fine if it was on Early Access but feels very unpolished for a almost 3 year old game;-1;0
Arma 3THIS GAME IS IN BETA DO NOT PURCHASE  DLCS ARE BROKEN GAME IS BROKEN MODS ARE BROKEN  THIS GAME HAS NO CAMPAIGN YET ADVERTISES ONE IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT ENJOY THE 5 MISSION PROLOGUED OF TELLING YOU THAT THE GAMES F&amp;^$%KING -10
More demanding than a gay bank robber. 4/10 #NeedsOptumumizations;-1;0
The controls are all over the place first the mouse then the actions and you cant change walking controls but its a good game if i got feedback.;-1;0
Arma 3I cannot recommend this game when ArmA 2 is still alive and well.  First of all the game is lacking in content for example most of the weapons and vehicles are the exact same for different nations with different paint schemes. The map is huge which is great till you look closer at it. Most of the buildings are empty no furniture nothing. A lot of the assets are missing even basic objects/buildings for some missions that were around since the OFP days like CTI just aren't there.  The gun handling feels like something straight out of battlefield if you know how to control the recoil which by the way is not hard it basically goes straight up you can be completely accurate at 300m with a fully automatic weapon.  The character handling feels very awkward and this is coming from someone with 2000+ hours on arma 2 I know about awkward controls there are like 3 movement speeds all of which take around 3 keystrokes to get in/out of what happened to the good old days of just pressing W then going? This isn't a damn car I don't have to switch gears depending on the speed I am going at.  Speaking of cars the cars handle very awkwardly aswell the acceleration is just ridiculous it takes forever to get up to around 30kmh then it just switches on the afterburner and off it goes!   Hey look an afterburner! Oh wait it's a trainer jet a stealth a10 and some freak su25 thingy. Oh boy there is so much wrong with the planes and helicopters in this game. I love aviation hell I'm trying to make it my job so this part hurts me the most. Where do I begin with this... Let's start with the easiest L39 it's a trainer it's not supposed to carry weapons and you're gonna tell me it's gonna go up in battle with no other air support? Ha good joke. I'm gonna be honest I like the looks of the su25 looking thing but it's never going to happen much less in 20 years. The SU25 is still doing well and if it were to get upgraded in the next 20 years it would probably only be the systems and avionics either that or they will build an entirely new aircraft from scratch or replace it with the already existing ground pounders. Oh boy here comes the big one. That damn stealth a10 freak. There is so so so much wrong with this it's not even funny. Alright let's start with what stealthing an aircraft is all about. Sharp edges to bounce the radar off in a different direction than where it's coming from the whole aircraft needs to be sharp guys not just the engines. Notice something about the stealth aircraft that are flying around today? Internal stores. You don't want those suckers reflecting radar signals now do you? The a10 is a subsonic CAS (Close Air Support) ground pounder It is literally designed  the enemy up and they'll know what hit them but it won't matter cause they'll either be dead or their equipment will be too ed up to shoot back. There is no use stealthing a plane that will be flying at under 5000'. Everyone and their mother will be seeing that bad boy. It's also supposed to take damage the whole titanium bathtub  and whatnot by sharpening the edges you are adding more structural failure points in the event of you know a missile hitting it. I'm no aircraft engineer but to me this makes sense if someone is reading this and actually is an aircraft engineer please tell me how wrong or right I am. Same goes for stealthing helicopters I mean come on how are you going to stealth a ing rotor spinning at hundreds of rpm and constantly changing pitch/angle? The mi48... This is not how things work you can't take 2 choppers merge them together and add some stealth t on it and expect anyone to take you seriously...  ArmA 3 is set in the near future. around 20 years from now. If you look at military history in the 20th century progress was at it's peak in WW2 up to Vietnam and then kind of slowed down till the mid 90's and we're now more or less at a standstill. We're still using tanks aircraft and weapons designed in the 70's and 80's and perfectioned. It takes a world war or some major conflict of some sort to get us off our asses and to put our thinking caps on. So do you really think that 20 years from now the ak's m4's m16's etc will be out of service and replaced by a new standard of 6.5mm caseless shells? That we won't be still using abrams strikers t90's and BMP 90's? We'll probably have the f22 unfortunatly probably the f35 PAK FA and others most of this stuff will most likely be old  with fancy new systems.  I half blame dayz for how this game turned out. DayZ is/was a good mod/game but it attracted the wrong kind of people to ArmA it didn't attract milsim people it attracted the general public that likes shooters and zombies. The funny thing is most of the dayz servers you find on ArmA 2 are those stupid 10000 vehicles ones with military weapons in every corner and everyone shooting everyone else in chernogorsk that's not survival that's just glorified deathmatch either way I digress. Bohemia probably decided to make the game more accessible for those people leading to this casualized shadow of what was once great.  I could let the whole 'it doesn't seem finished' part slide if they weren't releasing DLC for the parts that aren't finished... You are expecting me to pay 15 bucks for 2 helicopters? When there are barely any in the base game to begin with? And I do agree that all of the future bs thing that I've been saying can be fixed with mods but modded servers are not popular and the most modding the general public wants to do is grab one of those all in one mods like dayz.  TL;DR: It's a casual version of ArmA 2 designed to cater to the general public. If you want a military simulator I'd recommend ArmA 2 over this. If you feel like arma 2 was overwhelming then this is probably the game for you.-11
Arma 3Very frustrating game overly complicated gameplay with a very unpolished combat system. Gun sway is completely unrealistic and annoying. Navigating the different in game and in campaign menus very frustrating. Lots of bugs random people walking in place. Not very impressed so far.-10
Arma 3Arma ... well what can i say? That haven't learned from the last time.. Make a better server list that doesn't suck your internet dry.. or makes you get kicked out for not being able to connect almost each and every time. I was doubing to purchase this titel but when it got on the free weekend and i played it.. well ... let's just say i'm not turning my money into this game.-10
---&gt; Low FPS even in smallest settings with a computer which runs BF4 with good graphics easily ---&gt; No proper single player campaing ---&gt; Multiplayer servers full of rpg ;-1;0
Don't but this  without 7x GTX TITAN X..  0/optimize;-1;1
Arma 3the games has potential but i hope u like walking and driving cause the map is comparable to the real world the map is so huge it makes the game a joke and unnecessary lag i like the idea of being able to have more room to plan attacks better but this is just insane i possibly would have liked it if they made it simple to play but the instructions were horrible and not written the games has way to much problems for me and i can already see going through hell just for 1 round of shooting. i would rather go play battfield 3 and not enough players all the games are empty except 2 and the admin kicked me out of the 1 lol and after that i tryed 1 more game then i had enough only can take so much problems in a game.-10
Arma 3trash tbh Arma 2 was better-10
Arma 3Worst performance ever  Have to turn everything down except for the res and textures and set scaling to 100% to get 40 fps otherwise it's at 30 fps at 17% gpu-11
Arma 3-bought the game -rig sucked back than so set graphics to low -spawned into altis life -bought a hello kitty truck -ran over a pleb -chased by cops all the way to the northern part of the map -bought a rifle with night stalker -killed all 5 cops chasing me with -20 fps -got back in car -feeling like a pro sniper -drove into a tree -car ing explodes -UNISTALL UNINSTALL UNINSTAAAAAAAA-10/1011
my dang multiplayer servers aint popping up in the server section why it do dis its a good games but that glitch sux;-1;0
Arma 3I loved Flashpoint but this game has one of the worst singleplayer campaigns EVER! At some points completely unplayable. If you are into singleplayer - don't buy this game. The only thing you can enjoy here is the multiplayer which can be AWESOME at some points and it is the only reason why I have bought this game - at some point I was hoping the campaign will be at least a little enjoyable but I am very dissappointed now. I don't recommend buying this game until they fix all the issues in the campaign.-10
I have very low fps on low graphic settings in ARMA 3 while my PC is able to run BF 3 on ultra without any glitches having MUCH better picture. It is impossible to play this game. Very bad.;-1;0
I guess im the only one who thinks this game is impossible and honestly made me think about killing myself.;-1;1
It's been 'released' for a few years now and I can't help but feel like this is still an early access title.;-1;1
trekking+bug+desync+low fps+a few weapons simulator;-1;0
Arma 3 What I liked:     The tactical and simulation aspect of Arma    Very in depth shooting and cover mechanics    Open world plus challenging gunfights steep learning curve    The sheer number of vehicles weapons attachements is great   What You Need to Know:     God this game is hard to run well( got a 7870 and it looks terrible on low settings)    This game is mostly played for mods such as Altus life(lame) Exile Wasteland.    You can play Zeus or other military warfare based gamemodes too but not many up at time of playing    80% of your time playing will be boring sadly you get in a helicopter or vehicle and will die before you can get to any meaningful engagments.    You must play with a group or the enjoyment will hardly be there    I played this game only during 2 free weekends and both times wasn't enough to convince me to buy it 11 hours of trying so hard to enjoy it :(    My Score:-11
Arma 3Whilst being a unique and ambitious game with unparalleled scope and detail the overly complicated bindings and game-mechanics and lack of any meaningful tutorials for the more complex systems often result in frustration. This game is known for its mod-ability and whilst this is a blessing given the clunky unpolished state of much of the core mechanics the number of community mods/ variations of gameplay modes adds to the confusion and inaccessibility of the multiplayer game. The poor optimization also leads to performance issues in multiplayer regardless of system specs.   In summary- i want to love this game but its too demanding on my time and patience. This 'game' is for the Hard Core MILSIM fan only.-10
Arma 3Amazing concept. Amazing tactical play. Even a great community. Amazing mods.   All negated by the worst engine known to mankind. Multiplayer runs at around 10-20 frames regardless of tweaks and optmisation.  poor resource allocation.   Great game  devs.  -11
Arma 3 game with  physics bohemia interactive deserves to have high caliber lead thrown in their direction with extreme prejudice.   you .  I would rather have to deal with a naggy wife for the rest of my life than play this game for an hour.  Also they dont know how to use more than 10% of your processor. This is worthy of execution.-10
Optimised for supercomputers and quantum devices. Engineered to 24fps for the cinematic experience.;-1;1
unoptimized piece of stinking  made by utter jews;-1;1
Arma 3No decent manual available. The training in the beginning does not show you how to use the sight on the gun. So the next step where you have to shoot targets in a field you have to hit one 400 yards away but there's no clear way how to use the sight on the gun. The cross hair on the screen is not accurate enough.   Wished it had a better manual because playability is paramount to graphics.-10
Arma 3with graphics made of clay and a price tag that is as bad as a call of duty game this is truly the best shooter experience of the decade.      This review is powered by NVIDIA™ Phyx™-10
Arma 3One of the most poorly optimized games I've ever played. Game feels incredibly clunky unresponsive and laggy online. Not worth the hassle.-10
Arma 3for the money... well no.. this game is worth 10 times less than what i paid for it. actually i have played phone games more exciting than this.  my review for arma 3 is simple i got it on steam sale i played it 3 times. and its been pretty bad.  - the servers cause FPS lag (because I get 40fps normally on some servers and others it crawls to 9) - the missions are basically to try and troll people - the maps are big and awesome but theres not many people and whoever you see just kills you - its just boring half the time.  so if you like just exploring the virtual map and doing jack all half the time then this games for you.  but you could be doing that in the real world and have an extra $30 bucks in your wallet (sale price).  decisions decisions..-10
You'd have more fun stabbing yourself repeatedly with a rusty screwdriver.;-1;0
Arma 3if you've got a fetish for first person shooters and the military and happen to be rejected by a real life military branch or happen to be a mechanic or cook in the military then this game is for you. other than that move along in your real life and join the military. if you can't and happen to be in a wheel chair and love the military then buy this game and dream. -10
Arma 3Singleplayer feels like Duty Calls Multiplayer feels like Red Orchestra without fun.-10
Arma 3This game is very buggy I have an average graphics card that can run most of the games out there but with this game you need like a $9000 computer to even run it. The Maps are way too huge for your graphics to run smoothly I had to turn everything down and even still I was lagging like crazy. I would highly recommend playing the Battlefield series instead of this game because A. You will get more enjoyment and entertainment from Battlefield B. Your computer will be able to run it C. Better vehicle system and lots of weapons to choose from-11
Arma 3Literally the worst game I have ever played in my entire history of gaming. Crashes horrible optimization extremely boring server issues buggy characters game breaking errors. How did they even get so many good reviews?? This is from MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE not some hatred or bias against Arma 3. I assume that many fanboys will downvote this.-10
Arma 3While crawling at the amazing forest enjoying sights you're spotting an enemy in a bush 5 meters from you. You're making a 3 well-placed shots right into his unprotected face from your heavily modded fictional MXC(whatever that means). Blood animation confirms that you've been successful. Enemy runs into the other bushes. He probably HEAVILY injured..  This is what Arma3 is. Unpolished unfinished game with fictional weapons on a map that makes you feel yourself an alien. They should really expanded Eastern Europe theme instead =\   Arma 2 Wasteland &gt; Arma 3 Wasteland-10
Arma 3This really is a poor game and should not cost £36 here's why:  1) Recommended system specs are a lie. I could not run the singleplayer campaign above 30fps at 1024x768 lowest everything including draw distance with a FX6300 and HD 7770. False advertising and also extremely unreasonable hardware requirements. Fanboys will tell you Arma 3 is super advanced etc. so demands a lot of the CPU but I believe it's just poorly optimised. You can have a lot of units moving about and framerates will stay smooth but as soon as people start shooting performance plummets so I believe it's something to do with badly optimised effects not demanding AI (which is pretty poor in any case). Multiplayer performance is even worse and when 20fps is considered 'normal' it's effectively unplayable. People should not accept 20fps due to game restrictions and the dev's ought to really address this.  2) Gameplay is terrible - so bad that it feels like it's buggy rather than poor design decisions. Jogging for about 10 seconds will cause you to start panting and creates extreme weapon sway - maybe they are trying to simulate a Wall-E future of fat soldiers? Again really kills the gameplay considering the size of Arma 3's missions which require a lot of moving about. Recoil on weapons is ridiculous and feels like your guy is shooting with only one hand with the gun held sideways. Damage is ridiculous enemy targets will take 2 headshots and some more chest shots to be brought down. It all adds together to completely kill immersion and makes the game feel like a chore.   3) Immersion - Again keeping in mind how bad the shooting mechanisms are the AI are utterly gamebreaking as well. You can empty a clip of bullets in a relatively small 1 meter area around an enemy target. He will not budge he will not flinch he will just keep on shooting you until you die and you probably will die because of the awful recoil system in place which makes aiming for the player impossible. The AI are basically terminators who will simply run about from time to time stand still and then shoot you to death. There is a mod which reduces recoil and with this mod a player can mow down these AI like fish in a barrel simply because they don't move once they've decided to stop and shoot you.  4) Content - Really really lacking. Okay they have a single player campaign (which is pretty dull). But what's really bad is that they seem to have left a lot of the content up to the community to develop. There is no ambient combat module in the editor unlike Arma 2 there is no SpecOps module in the editor unlike Arma 2 there is no quick mission creator unlike Arma 2. This makes a huge difference in the game because it means if you want to actually experience the sandbox of the game with AI you have to either 1) create relatively complex scripts yourself; or 2) download other missions or mods. It's not a pick-up and play game which is disappointing considering Arma 2 was.   Arma 3 just goes wrong in so many ways from the gunplay to the AI to the stamina and damage system (basically every aspect of a fps) and the lack easy to use content such as an ambient combat module or quick mission creator to the incredible system requirements. It really is not worth £36 and while the futuristic setting is very appealing and graphics look nice there's no real reason to get this over Arma 2 which is much better overall.  Save your money!-10
I thought this game would fix the giant mess it created in the last arma game. I was so wrong and i wasted my money on yet another stupid pile of crap. When you cant finish the tutorial because it wont tell you how to aim down the sight or tell you what the hell barring 220 is supposed to mean i give up and shoot the drill sargent. Game DELETED!;-1;0
Arma 3Poorly optimized game engine you can have a beast of a rig and it will still run horribly.  Stop allowing this by not buying it.  For the people that have it make your reviews negaive and make it be known that this is unacceptable. They will have to eventually do something when their sales drop off.-11
Arma 3ARMA 3 I haven't played the game for 8 months.  Back at it it suddenly came-back to me: Like everything else in their life Chinese can't play a game without cheating!....  That said I would prefer not to play at all rather than to have a guy:    Showing a RED or Blue or GREEN dot on his character (as per a teammate) and shoot us all.   Teleport himself on the top of a tower.   Suicide bomb when wounded.   etc...   http://i67.tinypic.com/1671f7n.jpg   http://i68.tinypic.com/s41661.jpg  chinese cheaters arma 3 steam server  So... what can we do about it? ?? (It's happening in China.....)   -10
Arma 3Id give this game an honest 4 out of 10 rating. It has some pretty impressive depth but its still not a great game. I will talk about the single player  cons: -friendly AI is completely  there must not have been an infantry military advisor on this or they told him to  off or something. Friendly AI moves in a completely absurd cluster employing zero patrol formations. Friendly AI also does not shoot move or communicate at all besides the most clunky and vague methods. Due to the fact that friendly AI just walks around clustered almost all the time they instantly get suppressed by enemy AI that will put accurate fire on you from literally a mile away in game with small arms and often your friendly AI will just get obliterated and you will probably take one of those mile away rounds to the head yourself.  -Weapon sway is just ridiculous you will need to download a weapon sway mod if you dont want your optic constantly moving around in about a 15 degree swivel for no reason it makes it kiiiiiiiiinda hard to engage any contact let alone the enemy AI ing with you from a mile away that dont have optic sway.  -There is no real CQB in this game it will leave you alone to clear an entire village while the rest of your team provides security and the movement and interaction with doors and such in this game is soooooooo rough the game will often get you killed when its limitations put you in comprimising positions  -Mission briefings are a ing laugh vague and meaningless about as legit as a Mc donalds supervisor talking to his employees  -Vehicle animations are not fluid at all helicopters for example look like they are attached to marionette strings or something and vehicles look like they are super imposed on top of the ground when they drive because they dont react realisticly to the world at all in their natural movements on the road or off road  Anyone who has actually served in the military will most likely have severe problems getting over how non mil sim this game is for what it is supposed to be based on its reputation. Its ok but not worth the price tag-11
Arma 3Game launcher won't load no one in the community assisted me in fixing the issue 10/10 would refund again.-11

Spent over 3 hours loading into a game and downloading mods. Join game where I have 5 frames and everyone yells at me. Try to change controls and control menu breaks. Get frustrated ask steam support for help. Sorry you have over 2 hours on the game. No refund. Enjoy your 5 frames and default controls :) I'm on a laptop so I don't even have numpad keys so I'm pretty much ed in the  here.;-1;0
this is the problem that i have after the new update okay i open the game launch it whit the launcher and then when its loading the addons  this thing pooped up Addon 'A3-BaseConfig_F' requires addon 'A3_Weapons_F_SMGs_pdw2000' and then when i click OK the game started but whait is it working?? well only for couple seconds just until the bohemia interactive logo show up end then the game crash and this notification showd Warning:preNLOAD format in object a3\anims_f_exp\data\geom\sdr\m01_executioner.p3d again i click OK and another notification show up it said The exception unknown software execption (0x0000dead) occurred in the application at location 0x0000000075B1A6F2 that's my problem;-1;0
Arma 3The matchmaking is broken (As in it doesn't work) and I can't join most of the servers because I need to buy the $30 DLC. I really want to learn this game but it's too much like work.  Get a mentor or prepare to look up how to aim down the sights. I'm not kidding -10
Arma 3Alright  first of all : how the  am I supposed to even shoot properly in this game? Honestly . gasilion of unnecessary options such as : watch  different kinds of aiming etc . But guess what? You can't jump! I died because 0.0000001 meter wall stopped me from running away! I tried  tried to play it with my friend but he rage quited as well. This game sucks  money wasted.    Just to let you know  I'm not noob. I've been playing shooters for 8 years or more and I even participated in a E-sport competition but... this game is just...too much for me. I don't have enough patience to play it even more.   3/10 ( because graphics were good )-11
Arma 3This worthless game studio instead repairing game (killing stairs as example falling through floor) they add DLC button in server browser to make more money on unfinished game. This is the only game that is crashing my PC and/or Video card in random moments witchout any reasons............. And the best part is that I'm not the only one with this problem this problem is since 2013 and they didn't bother to repair it. Instead they added go carts for money... In game about war.......... I tried to eliminate this random crashes by changeing almost all my PC components and no luck only the same parts are disc drives (i changed from HDD to SSD) and CPU (i5 4690k) everything else was changed. THEY WILL NOT GET ANY MORE OF MY MONEY IF THEY DON'T REPAIR THIS CRASHES FIRST!-11

I would suggest you don't buy this game and just go play other stuff and try to be happy because quite frankly it gave me the worst gaming experience I've ever had after 12 years of gaming.;-1;0
Arma 3What a pile of **** needs heavy updates.-10
Arma 3Downloaded Game into steam Played for 40 Hours total. Game disapeared from computer. Redownloaded Played for a while Game disapeared again. As someone with a download cap and 2 other gamers in the house was. not. impressed.-10
Arma 3Recommended graphic settings: Ultra &gt;Starts game &gt;22 FPS and laggs -&gt; Sets the Graphic settings to Very Low &gt;22 FPS and laggs...  --&gt; Buys a new GTX Titan &gt; Starts game and plays for a while... &gt; 23 FPS and laggs.  Thank you Bohemia Interactive for yet another  brilliant  graphic consuming game... I think my GPU is just complete . 16GB of Dedicated Video-Ram just isn't enough for ArmA 3 I guess..-10
too expensive;-1;0
Arma 3This game has not worked on my machine. I bought it but there is no way to get a refund or sell it or anything. When I go to the makers of the game they say to go to steam for a refund. When I go to steam they so go to the other guys. 60.00 down the drain for a game that I cant play. This will be the last game I download and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone-10
The worst game in the series. 1 run - 1 screenfreeze. The issue has been reported to BIS many times but they do nothing. Waste no money! Don't buy the game!;-1;0
Arma 3The game would be good if they dident spam you with the TUCKING APEX thing all dam day Plus half the stuff in the game you cant USE becuase you need to buy the APEX to use it..................-10
Arma 3let me start off saying that the gameplay and the overall game is the best thing I've ever played. One of the most realistic military games out there but however the game has alot of errorsbugs and fps problems that needs to be fix some but errors are the biggest one's. Errors can keep from playing your game and that sucks when you pay a good amount of money for the game. I not trying to say the game is bad. I'm just saying you need to be ready for the errors you will get and some of them will take alot of time to fix it for yourself if you don't know what your doing. you just might not fix them at all and not get to play it.-10
Arma 3The worst AI ever even mods cant fix that dumb AI. doesnt worth 60$-10
Just get Arma 2 its better and cheaper.;-1;0

Arma 3The gameplay in itself is actually quite good and enjoyable. Technically this game isn't all that great. It is optimised horribly (extreme cpu utalization) it's just laggy all around. And yes i meet the hardware requirments. So if you have the chance to try this game out before buying i strongly recommend that. If it's running smooth on your pc it's a game worth playing.-10
Arma 3The community is toxic af and almost all the game modes are DayZ like mods or RP. It could've been such a good game but it's garbage. Don't waste money on this.  Also:  ??????????????????????? ??????????????????????? ???????????????????????  ??????????????????????? ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????ArmA ???????????? ???????????????????????-11
Arma 3Have to download 1000 mods just to play multiplayer. So that's pretty cool. Also servers are .-10
Arma 3Were you a former player of Arma 2? Do you want to play a game that connects both FPS and real time strategy in one wanting to be a hero and a leader? - then this game is not for you.  This game is for people who wants to spend money on a uncomplete game then spend more money being commercial spammed to spend even more on DLCs and then on top of that you get to spend more money to get a reserved slot on the PVP elements of the game.  If you enjoy just dying in a game this is the right game for you when you play on the online servers you will be blown up over and over again by a distant A10 air to ground fighting aviator that can see your motorized veichles anywhere on the map with precise precision - this is the perks that players that initial bought the game that has progressed way further than a new comer than you will possess.   Unless your buying the game from someone thats selling his account with all weapons unlocked and a infinite pool of money for good veichles in PVP element to start off with then i recommend you not to buy this piece of junk. Its sad that such a good graphical game being a development from the past Arma series turned so  both in gameplay balance poor community and being slaves to commercial of money begging.-11
well spent 60 euros on the game and says my ip is reported for spam      how the  is that possible i never spammed anyone;-1;1
Arma 3Pros:   Extensive weapon penetration system Engaging story (black guy dies) Nice Graphics    Cons:  Same model for Rocket Launchers for Independent Blufor and Opfor usiing different skins Same model for Armoured Transport for Independent Blufor and Opfor usiing different skins DLC that should have been included in base game Go-Karts  _______________________   GET ARMA 2-11
Arma 3I didn't even own the game for 30 mins didn't even get to play except when they we're offering to play it for FREE! And I was GLOBAL BANNED. wtf. That isn't right that's called fraud.-10

Arma 3Worst ing campaing ever honestly.   Like how are you supposed to know where the  they are? *Middle of war trying to get to safe point* Hurry! *Hears gun shots* That's normal in a war. Ah what the ? I was shot? *Looks around* Exactly 0 exposure though... *Dies* WHAT THE  IS THIS?   Also you need DLC's for the good stuff. Pay to win? Yes.  campaing? Yes. Did I alt+f4 in the middle of the campaing because of t? Yes. Do I recommend it? No.-10
Arma 3Total waste of my money if I had the chance to refund I would totaly get my money back. Go and buy Squad.-11
Arma 3bad performance  stamina system buggy as  (played chernarus and the ground was white...) the movement system and animations suck they take way too long and player controls are funky and inaccurate overall 2/10 good idea bad in practice-10
Arma 3Lack of content such as weapons and vehicles (vs. previous games) empty greek islands with debatable level design singleplayer campaign old game engine graphics &amp; physics low quality audio &amp; voip poorly designed and broken user interface (feels more like a 'point-and-click' game than a first person shooter) d-sync and fully priced 'pay-2-win' dlcs for the weak minded.-11
Arma 3A lot of grass and a long draw distance don't make games beautiful. It just runs slowly and looks ugly. Better lighting and colors would have helped a lot. The scenarios have very poor voice acting and no suspense at all. The controls are just idiotic. And it thinks I want to play with my Xbox Controller just because I have it plugged in. So I have to unplug that controller every time I want to play the game. I don't know what they were thinking but this game is one of the worst shooters I've ever played.-11
Arma 3It is great that i bought a game with 2d editor and now someone dicides that i can't use it... no question I can send back my game.. and i want my money back. STUPID POLICY of Bohemia... should be punnished I want my game.. with all components.. I PAIED FOR IT!!! and i want it!!!!!!!!!!! for god sake.-11
Arma 3This game was such a disappointment I have a fx 9590 8 core and a r9 290x the 450$@ launch one XFX double D (it has 5Ghz mem clock instead of 2.5ghz and i get   frame-rates so if i dont have a Nvidia card i cant enjoy this game?  YOU!-11
not worth $54.99;-1;0
Arma 3You know what's t?  Paying $40 for a game then having to pay $60+ for content... in order to play the game.  This  should already be in the game itself.-10
If you want to buy this game to play coop with your friend - never try do this. The only reason to do it is if you want to see 'server is not responding' all the time you want to connect.  It is very strange that such an easy issue is still not solved in 2014. Don't spend your money on this game.;-1;0
Arma 3An absouloutly SH*T game. Cannot stress enough how bad i find it. The minimal gamemodes along with their boring opportunities make this game a complete waste of money. £40 for this? It's not worth £10! In the near future it may improve; it needs to improve drastically to appeal to me at least. As a simulator outstanding. As a game made to play for enjoyment and having fun useless. I find more fun in the Call of Duty and Angry Birds franchise. Not Fun! Not Enjoyable! Not Worth It! Bohemia need to up their game or they will definately DEFINATELY decrease in sales. Do Not Buy This Piece of Horse Crap.-10
Arma 3Cars in this game are absolutly terrible.. Not to mention the mad desync causing you to crash your vehicles into your friends and ending any chance of a successful fun game. Honestly. TOO BROKEN.-10
This game make my  bleed. You have to waste 3 hrs in order to play 30 min because it is filled with  bugs and it isnt optimized for mods. Game for autists 0.69/19;-1;0
Arma 3Not the game for me it has very good graphical detail but that is about it. Multiplayer is very laggy and borderline unplayable controller support is listed as a feature however only a select few controls can be mapped to it - Making playing with it extremely difficult.  I bought into it when it was £20 in early alpha I would not pay £40 for it now and I'm glad I didn't.-10
Most realistic army simulator? more like the most realistic b*llsh*t simulator. This game is about as unrealistic as whales with detachable pen*ses that fly to jupiter and f*ck jupiters babies while on steroids. I can name 3 games more realistic than this right now. World of Warcraft. Toontown. Fapville on steroids extreme. THOSE ARE ALL 10x MORE REALISTIC. But if you wanna hear the big black juicy good parts of this game well here they are. This game features breaking your legs from 3 foots drops. dying from jumping out of a vehicle moving 2 KPH. Dying from drowning in an enclosed submarine. DERPING FROM LSD THAT YOU GOT FROM A F*CKING HOBO. but best of all dont forget the jerk circles. (this review was made entirely for comedy purposes) serious part -----&gt; this game is pretty bad and they keep making it worse;-1;0
Arma 3You'll shoot your eye out kid! Well maybe if you could figure out how to shoot.-10
This game freaking sucks big balls!;-1;0
Arma 3As is typical for Russian developers there is little foresight applied to teaching game mechanics. The learning curve is steep and harsh. The AI ridiculously god like.   If battling an uphill struggle wearing nothing but boxer briefs while burly vikings throw large barrles full of stones down at you sounds like a good time then Arma 3 is for you.-10
LITERALLY the worst game I have ever played;-1;0
Maybe if it was possible to use sights.;-1;0
Arma 3Sigh....  Arma 3 is a First person military simulator..... and there's the problem. Simulators are notoriously buggy and dificult to optimise notoriously unforgiving  and above all notoriously dull. Unfortunately Arma 3 suffers in all these areas to some degree or another.  Online multiplayer is undoubtly the heart of the game ( as shown by the frustrating AI in the rather soulless single player campaign ).  Without teamwork howerver the game quickly can devolve into a run and gun shooter unsuited to the simulator style severity of gameplay... GOOD LUCK finding any real teamwork on the great majority of online servers.  Perhaps the only servers displaying such teamwork are the hardcore milsim servers playing invade and annex....by their nature impenetrable to newbies.  Which leaves........well not much.....probably best avoided.  ( Dear fanboys please consider that i really did try to like this game.....even through gritted teeth)  A game you'll come to loathe.... if you've the good sense (addendum)-10
doesnt run well even tho its optimized ™;-1;0
Arma 3If you like games that are to hard and are not enjoyable to any extent go head waste your 60 bucks on this game... game is extremely laggy horrible hardware optimization and online play is a joke... if your look to get anywhere close to 60 fps max settings you better have a top dollar machine.  Story mode is ok if you like getting shot at and never knowing if you hit the enemy or not ....-10
Arma 3The controls and gameplay are way too clunky for me. I don't get the appeal it has for people maybe I missed something?-10
Arma 3BIS really hoping for the community to fix their game even more arcade than ARMA 2 still can't deploy bipod since first ARMA lack of content 6 month waiting and the only good updated one is SP really hoping ARMA 3 will be as good as ARMA 2 but the reality it isn't  welcome to the ARMA 3 reality-10
Arma 3Fantastic Graphics could be a really good game if they would stop screwing with it. The AI walk through things all the time shoot through things Fall into hills mountains you name it. Every time they do an update it screwes all the maps up and some things now cannot be fixed yet Like Events and objectives. This does not occure 1 or 2 times its everytime they update. They are not interested in fixing it just make the mappers do it. Im not wasting my next 6 months with this crap. and BTW if you think the bare min requirements will work fine then I hope you like playing solo. We have all had to do major upgrades and still runs buggy. I just do not undersdtand why the hell you would make a game that cant keep up with todays processors-10
Arma 3Arma 3: This game is for the hardcore frankly it's not for me. But this is my review on the game and what it is not just my very limited experience. Let's say you are dissapointed by how untactical modern shooters are like call of duty and even sadly battlefield. If you want a game in which death actually means something and where you have to coordinate attacks for a chance of success then really play this. That or you can go sell coke on altis life. Your choice.   TLDR: I don't really care about this game. It's not a bad game it was just a waste of my paticular money. Go buy it if your friend said to.-10
Arma 3Overall I would give it a 1/10 why? Because this game sucks. Every server I joined was extremely laggy and seemed like nobody seemed to know what the hell they were doing and yes I joined other servers than Wasteland. I find the guns horrible and inaccurate and yes I'm aware that it is supposed to have some sort of realism in it (that's why the vehicles are so realistic right?) but the guns feel like they are to inaccurate for me at ranges 300+ I find it hard to hit anything while in ARMA 2 I could hit a tire on a moving car. The only reason I didn't give it a 0 is because of the ragdolls.   Edit: The campaign was horrible I mean I realize that ARMA is really known for its voice acting but I mean come on it could've improved a LITTLE bit the campaign was extremely boring and I had to speed it by 4x to even be able to play it the story was stupid and I'm glad I didn't play long.-10
ughh. waste of money...;-1;0
Banned for someone elses fault Period Life in altis gets givin million bux BI bans me  you Bohema!  you!;-1;1
Arma 31 year ago i tried to play arma 3 with my old pc but unfortunately i couldn't play the game because of huge fps drops and screen tearing isssues. I was very disappointed because my pc was still good enough to reach recommended requirements. After that i decided to invest all my summer job salary to a new pc. I spent huge amount of money to my new beast pc rig (cpu i7-4790k gpu gtx 980 ram 16gb etc...) just to find out that i still couldn't play arma 3. My average frames per second is about 25-30 and i have noticed a lot of screen tearing.  WARNING: GAME IS POORLY OPTIMIZED!-10
Arma 3Uh wtf is with the controls and player handling? Seriously eventhough the graphics is 10/10 the player controls brings the game down to 2/10. The UI is also horrendous. Find a better UX desinger already.-10
The worst game in the world... full of try hard s;-1;0

ARMA III HELICOPTERS While exiting a helicopter it hit me and I died. I tried again and my parachute didnt deploy. I tried again and I died from hitting the air hard enough(WTF)  ARMA III GROUND VEHICLES My tank hit a fence and broke down. My truck did a flip on a 1 cm high pebble and crushed me. A quad bike nipped the back of my truck which caused it to explode as if it was hit by a rocket.   ARMA III PVP People go under the ground and shoot you. You get fatigued from walking 2 metres but a red dot sight will cure that for you somehow. You swap kills a lot because of lag.   ARMA III GRAPHICS  Graphics can be good but high end computers lag.   ARMA III FUN Doesnt exist.;-1;0
Arma 3This is absolute BULL####! The fact that there are only TWO helicopters and BOTH are for TRANSPORT!? Are you even serious about keeping your community base Bohemia? I swear it from this day onwards that I will NOT support any of your games that are released EVER in my life again - and you most definitely will not catch me reccomending this lackluster effort of a game to ANYONE - on the contrary I will make an active effort to warn others away from purchasing this piece of ####!  First you release a game in alpha and promise that the entire game will be ready in the next few months it took you over a year and a half just to release a SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN. HOW can you call it a game when it does not even have a single player campaign?   Then you rip off your community by charging $15 for an obvious last minute effort to release a DLC to get a quick bit of money? #### you and your company. Seriously. The expectation for this DLC was atleast 10 different helicopters in mutiple roles - from new attack helicopters and support helicopters from offering different utilities such as possible winching functions? Yet you are determined to destroy a great franchise and name for a game with your lackluster efforts in releasing both game content and support.  I hope I am not the only person who feels this way and that the word is spread because I hope that with these efforts that your company actually hits the banks and liquidates because frankly the ARMA reputation would be held more intact with you going bankrupt than with your current efforts.  -This is coming from a veteran ARMA player who has bought into your franchise for many years (just check my steam library if you doubt this).  LONG STORY SHORT:  DO NOT BUY THIS DLC THE DLC PACK OR EVEN ARMA 3 THE GAME AS YOU ARE GAURENTEED TO BE RIPPED OFF BY MONEY-HUNGRY LACKLUSTER LAZY PROGRAMMERS THAT HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER TO RUIN THE NAME OF A GREAT FRANCHISE. THE GAME IS AVERAGE AT BEST AND ANY GAME CONTENT PROMISES ARE EMPTY AND LACK DELIVERY. BOHEMIA NEEDS TO BUCK UP BEFORE ANYONE SHOULD EVEN CONSIDER PURCHASING ANY OF ITS GAMES OR DLC'S.-10
Arma 3buy arma 2 insted this is crap. -10
Arma 3Okay i have ArmA 3 since 4 days and actually PLAYED the game for maybe 2 hours. The Campaign and showcases are fun and the mechanics work as they should. So me and a friend got some mods from the workshop and maps from armaholic. And we built two big fun missions. Mine didnt work. I hosted and he got stuck at Wait for Host. We tried everything the internet told us. Nothing worked. So we built short stupid missions to actually play and shoot a bit. Then we wanted to try his mission with another guy. He didnt even made it onto the server eventhough he had all the mods. I got stuck on the briefingmap because the host wasnt shown as 'on the map'. Some other time i also got stuck on recieving data but only once. We host over LAN with Hamachi and are really  off after only 4 days of 'playing' the game. We had much fun with ArmA 2 and tons of mods back in the good ol days and as ArmA 2 died we mourned a long time. Now we thought ArmA 3 would be a new beginning and we could relive the old times with mods and self-made fun missions with cops zombies aliens and all that stuff that worked in ArmA 2.  But nope.  So im very sorry to give it a thumbs-down because i really love the game but without a working MP its just an empty shell.  RIP good ol ArmA times-11
this game is some cheecks. Multiplayer in a nuthshell: many people doing nothing while a teammate mows you down from a helicopter;-1;1
Very good and realistic game but why I have 25-30 fps on multiplayer and 60 fps on singleplayer?Really?Servers are also laggy;-1;0
Arma 3Mobile games. Get the free version and there are ads. Pay small amount of money and ads go away.  Arma 3. No free version. Pay 40$ and theres ads. Buy all the dlc and ads go away....for a short while then another dlc is released and more ads show up.   Gameplay is decent as long is your ping is good and you find a half decent server which is almost impossible.  Dlc isnt even worth it. Only reason i bought any dlc in the first place was to get rid of the damn ads.-11
Arma 3  Only reason Im giving this game a negative review is because BattleEye Anti-Cheat System and  of Bugs with mods after Apex  Before Apex I could play on every single server that existed in game just downloaded mods and ready to go but after Apex came out  got real. BattleEye can't update signature missmatch for mods (that are downloaded from Workshop) server not respoding battleye can't connect to master server/firewall block. Its a great game that is worth every pennie loads of action diffrend mods diffrent gameplay open world but until this 'BattlEye – The Anti-Cheat Gold Standard' more like  standard gets fixed or replaced im not comming back.-11
Arma 3Until they learn how to optimize there game it's just not worth a buy. Even on a good pc this game runs like a turd. sad.-11
Arma 3All Arma games suffer from the same issue unfortunately.   Buggy as hell and has more buttons than a NASA space craft.-10

Arma 3realy its crap still my computer should be able to run it atleast in medium setting. if i play single missions its resoable stable but when i go for multi player. than  hits the fan big time.  masive lag textures not loading properly crashing because of memory errors  wtf is going on ARMA was such a great brand releable and good system. now its totaly crap. people keep saying i need to go to win 64 and up my memmory of my maching i say frag that i should be able to run it on this machine acording to the tech specs.  so fragging fix it so i can play.-10
I didn't like how in order to get into a highly populated server you had to have a subscription or sign up for some website just in order to be put on the waiting list for a spot to get in. Not a game I'd recommend;-1;0
Arma 370 dollars for content that should be in the base game....ha ha ha. Bohemia has become money hungry every year there turning more and more into EA.   Before  downvote this The base game has barely any content copy paste vehicles for opposing forces.   Now they charge:  $30 F***ing dollars for some unique vehicles and a map.  $12 for f***ing 3 helicopters  $12 for f***ing 4-5 guns.  $2 for  go-karts.....WHY??? -10
Arma 3A game that could be amazing but is completely broken by all the completely illogical bugs. Let's start with the absolutely horrendous framerate this is not something based in inadequate hardware. Once you start playing on a server you may notice 100+ fps things are moving along nicely. This means you managed to strike gold and entered a freshly booted server. As soon as you get into a small community the framerate drops. To insanely low levels. &lt;45 fps is hardly uncommon. This happens on every single server. Once the server is rebooted your 100&lt; fps is back. This is of course just the tip of the iceberg. Every single staircase on all three maps will  you up. You get stuck in them you teleport around you fall through them. Amazing stuff when you're running up a tower while being shot by everyone including their grandmas.  Once we've started handling this usually rememdied by running in fully standing position you're still getting rubber band lag and all kinds of incontrollable spastic movement. Amazing. But here's the real piece of the pie - the server browser is the worst browser I've EVER had to handle. Not only does it send you flying to another server when you select one but refreshing the server list even with decent constraints it's a major gamble. Will you find ANY server at all? Probably not. Okay let's restart the server browser then. No. Of course not you have to restart the whole ing game to even have a chance. But no usually you still find absolutely nothing what so ever. Okay so you give up and decide that 40 minutes of trying to enter a server is way too much. OH hell look ARMA 3 keeps running even though you closed it 5 minutes ago. And you've suddenly got no internet connection. Supposedly this is due to some overloading of routers but have fun trying to solve that issue. Nothing helps. You just need to wait it out. Or reset your router. Or restart your computer.. Nothing helps in any consistent manner.  I love the gameplay I love the slow paced sniping and the huge amounts of features. Too bad you can't ing play it.-11
Arma 3It feels like soldiers who have never played a videogame made ARMA III.  This game is the most unintuitive glitchty mess I've seen in a long time. Simply not enjoyable to play. Annoyingly it seems so promising as a large-scale shooter but it just doesn't have the quality to really satisfy that niche. The optimization is abysmal; completely unplayable problems arising from strange performance issues are frustratingly common. There are common glitches that break the game such as ladders and walls magically killing you. It's not worth the money for this kind of attention to detail.  Do not buy ARMA games unless the devs suck your  in return.-10
session lost all the time and i try to uninstall and install the game and cant play in any server .to much problems with this game !!!!!!!!!;-1;0

Arma 3DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE TO ROLEPLAY AS A MILITARY DUDE OR SOMETHING. YOU WILL LITERALLY WALK AROUND FOR 8 HOURS TRYING TO GET TO ONE PLACE. If you really like that kind of stuff why not just join the army ?-10
Arma 3Kill me my friend made me get and i though this game wasnt immersive enough-11
Arma 3Boring game you spend most of the time running around trying to spot some pixels in the distance. Yes that's probably realistic but it's not much fun. Particularly when one of those pixels shoots you and you have to revert to a point 20 minutes earlier. Also seems to involve huge amounts of walking around without really doing much. Again realistic but not much fun.-10
charged me an additional 39 dollars locking my game and support won't help. Don't buy.;-1;0
Fantastic gameplay// Horrible performance Under 20fps on multiplayer (high end rig);-1;0
Arma 3unfinished so its bad-10
Arma 3still not sure why I bought this game... it's never fun to play overly technical the controls are ing horrible and even after all that you still just get randomly sniped een if you know what's going on. also the people that play this alot are a bunch of inbred hicks... if you don't believe me join any random server and just listen to voice chat.-10
This is an army shooty game where no one wants to actually shoot at real players. There are only servers for co-op AI-hunts or playing pretend dressup with their armyguy dolls on RP servers.;-1;0
Arma 3DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE TO ROLEPLAY AS A MILITARY DUDE OR SOMETHING. YOU WILL LITERALLY WALK AROUND FOR 8 HOURS TRYING TO GET TO ONE PLACE. If you really like that kind of stuff why not just join the army ?-10
Fantastic gameplay// Horrible performance Under 20fps on multiplayer (high end rig);-1;0
Arma 3The single player campaign is virtually unplayable isn't enjoyable and just becomes more difficult and frustrating the more you play mostly due to AI enemies that can see you hiding behind a forest 7 miles away and then shoot you right between the eyes before you've even had time to find the prone key. YES I know it's supposed to be a simulation but I at least would like to feel good while playing it and not slowly develop post traumatic stress disorder like a real soldier would.  This game gets some points back for the active multiplayer community and great mods that are available and it looks great when it's not lagging but the disappointment of the single player campaign still lingers and is a stink that's hard to shift.-10
Arma 3Oh wow. Another DLC package included edition.-10
charged me an additional 39 dollars locking my game and support won't help. Don't buy.;-1;0
Arma 3Boring game you spend most of the time running around trying to spot some pixels in the distance. Yes that's probably realistic but it's not much fun. Particularly when one of those pixels shoots you and you have to revert to a point 20 minutes earlier. Also seems to involve huge amounts of walking around without really doing much. Again realistic but not much fun.-10
Arma 3I might be mistaking but i will talk for myself only!  At first i saw ARMA 3 in sale so i say lets buy this game! Wow wait lets see the system requirements. So i see that my system is way way better than the RECOMMENDED  and i buy it! next day i run the game for the first time i run the tutorial and everything looks fine. I love the fact that the map is so close to reality according to where you are! For example the place KAVALA at Greece was extremely close to reality! And the environment just amazing!There the problem starts!  Even when a helicopter comes close i have a huge fps drop to 5-10 frames!   And im like why the hell is this happening? i meet the recommended and more!  So i decide to run the auto detection and let the system decide! After a while the system decides to put everything at low quality so i can play the game smooth! YEAH IN MY DREAMS! i met 30 fps max in a fight situation!  So i really dont know who the hell i have to blame! blame my system? i cant cuz my system has 2 gb vram hd 7850 i have i7 cpu i have 8gb ram etc!  So what i did was simple. REFUND. never touch a game from this company again!  -11
Nothing worked waste of money;-1;0
Arma 3i dont reccomend arma 3 its just not up to my standard's it needs to completely remake its engine and then i would be happy.  Performance = Rubbish (even on a high end systems)  Gameplay = great for playing with people  Muiltplayer = mulitplayer is almost unplayable due to the performance issues  Content = the content is really good just that most of it is useless and the work should have been spent working on optimizations. they are working on dlcs and other things for the game but hardly any work is spent on making the game more playable   Final conclusion this game is half complete and need serious work to be up to par with modern game engines.-10
Arma 3Arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give Arma 3 its long lifespan. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here until Bohemia's support starts paying off.-11
Arma 3So far I love the game's difficulty and community around it. However the AI is broken. Multiple times I have found a patrolling unit or AI sqaud member crashing vehicles into walls. I like the game but I am giving it a thumbs down as to draw attention to this issue.-10
Arma 3Perfect example of a 'Dad' game. Unless you derive fun from dicking about in sandbox servers you'd need to be retired to get the most out of this clumsy game. My military geek friend convinced me to by this and I regret it.-11
Arma 3I dont like it because so many servers need mods and dlcs for money. Its a nice game for people into the military tactics and such. I personally don't recommend this game unless if its sold for 15$-10
Arma 3Waste of my money. The people who developed this game to be like actually war literally had no clue what they were doing. One thing apparently an enemy soldier can fire accurately at a 500 meter target or more that is moving at full sprint and can take them out. That would almost never happen in real life but in the game it happens like every two seconds. Second of all the fatigue and weapon sway are stupid. I can run for like three seconds and the soldier is almost out of breath and can't hit crap even when prone. I'm a private in the Army and I could run a mile and then immediately take a knee and fire at a 300 meter target and hit it. Third thing I can be maybe 50 meters or less from an enemy I can't see because they are over some type of hill or behind a rock or a building and I can't hear them in game before I see them which again is not realistic. This is ridiculous.-11
multiplaye/co-op refuses to work after hours and hours of tying still no joy. can not find or join my friends server...waste of money.;-1;0
Arma 3As a long time fan of the series I wanted to love this game but I just can't recommend it right now. The developer has gone overboard with the DLC overcharging for just about every addition to the game. I bought the complete game last year with all the DLC and now I'm already unable to use content that has been added since then to the point where the game is almost unplayable.   Want to play a mod that has DLC in it that you don't have? Good luck. I was playing Altis Life and picked up the most basic pistol in the game only to find out it's now considered DLC and therefore neither me nor my friend could use it. Not only that but now this game has almost constant in-game POPUPS that block your view make it impossible to look down your sights ALL DURING THE HEAT OF COMBAT. You can't make this stuff up see for yourself:   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827632355   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827632391   The game engine is a huge improvement over Arma 2 the maps are brilliant but the weapons and vehicles are okay at best and the DLC popups completely ruin the game. Avoid this blatant money grab. I won't be purchasing any more DLC because I'm not going to reward this nonsense.-10
rather not spend an extra $70 on dlc 2 play multiplayer xddd gonna go get squad instead;-1;1
It's like Day Z but worse.;-1;0
would rather buy winrar;-1;1
Arma 3WOULD REFOUND FOR SURE. This is sooo badno real gameplay in the story mode. Online? Unless you get the expansion that costs 25 pounds I don't think you will have fun. This is a sandbox game...-11
Arma 3Arma 3 yes. A huge game with lot of fine stuff in it. Its really fun to play actually..... BUT; you gonna reconize very soon what ruins this game again: - if you think you put 1500€ into a gaming machine and though arma would run proper.... forget it.... in singleplayer you wont get troubles but in multiplayer. Some server run with 50 players or more and thats simply too much for this game. Gotta be honest it depends on the mod you play but compared to singleplayer its a huge framedrop-difference. - as you noticed its 2014..... this games has bugs that takes you back in the 90s..... it seems to me as its still in alpha maybe beta now; 45€ aint justifiable!!!! ..... and for sure not the dlc that includes 2 chopper for 13€..... cmon the community can make better add-ons and doesnt want any money for it! - if the fun isnt ruined by the stuff i already mentioned it will after you noticed youre hard work was wasted by a hacker. You need to seperate a good gamer and the fact that 3rd person can be very tricky if used smart or the fact that its not like hitting stuff in COD or it can take up to 5 bullets or even thermal-attachments was used with a hacker-child that uses god-mode and hits anything with his aimbot..... or even more annoying stuff like finish a whole game by probably 1 click...... 80 peoples will lose all their stuff by 1 hacker..... how can bohemia make it that easy to hack its game?.... im not talking about a hacker once a month....... if you have some game experience after a while (im personally talking about 600h+) you will notice them in almost ANY SERVER!!! and dont think they get caught...... steam wont support your work with finding and banning the hacker... of course not .... its like 'hmm the more hacker there are the more player dont wanna play this game anymore.... and what will they do? ..... buy a new steam-game!!!!! perfect lads'..... this game is death good bye!-10
Don't expect to be able to play multiplayer unless you have a PhD in computer networking.;-1;1
This game is broken  The new launcher update broke the game for 45% of users ARMA 3 IS HORRIBLE DON'T BUY IT WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK!!!!!;-1;1
Arma 3broken POS  dwarden plays favourites within the community will hand out bans for some yet not others. Clearly purple circle club happening in the dev modding commuinity between  dwarden foxhound for armaholic unsung devs all a pack of paracidical cockroachs who have no people skills  preferbaly need a bullet in the head.-11
Arma 3You have to have a really really powerful computer or enjoy the low frame rate. You'll get in start playing and then when you want to pick up a sniper you'll have to pay for them or shooting will be near impossible. If you want to use some of the vehcials then you need to pay for DLC. ARMA 2 never forced you to pay extra to actually play the game how you want. It let you play it. Bohemia are just trying to screw you out of as much money as they can.-11
Used to be a great game...Now it is CONSTANTLY harrassing you about downloading the latest DLC. What a shame.;-1;1
Its alright.;-1;1
If this game could be optimized better this would be a fun game.;-1;1
Had to wait for the dlc to jump.  ??????????????????????? ??????????????????????? ???????????????????????  ??????????????????????? ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????????????????????  ???????Jumping?????????? ???????????????????????;-1;1
Arma 3WORST PURCHASE EVER!!!!!!  There is literally NO FUN IN THIS GAME if you don't purchase DLCs !!!!  THEY LITERALLY SELL EVERY ING THING IN THE GAME!! GUNS CHOPPERS CLOTHES MAPSect. WTF?  This game is basically a DLC game.   and what's worse? 21FPS at the LOWEST SETTING.....(I5 + GTX970 + 16G DDR3).......are you kidding me???-11
Requires a high grade computer to run dont waste your money;-1;1
Arma 3Arma 3 is aweful!  Engine outdated stupid Community and Apex is unnecessary.  Arma is a b*tch!-11
Arma 3The game is good but then after buying the 3499€ game you have to buy the 2999€ APEX DLC to even go online so the price of the game is 6498€. For that price you can buy minecraft and overwatch (non origens edition) and stil have some money. And dont get me started on all the oder DLCs for 2147€.-10
Arma 3So you all know this game it's ArmA.  However if you want to actually play the game you need to purchase all the weapon DLC's to actually be able to use half of the weapons in maps like Wasteland or KotH.  Don't particularly want to buy the game over for the 4th time now.   It wouldn't even be so bad if they didn't COVER YOUR ENTIRE SCREEN AT RANDOM if you happen upon a DLC weapon or armour (assuming you can pick it up) with watermarks making it hard to see in the middle of combat.  Heaven forbid I want to use a Ghillie suit that I bought from the (wasteland) store without having to dodge watermarks.-10
Arma 3Arma 3 is a military simulator. It's so hardcore almost to the point of it being painfull. The campaign is not the most fun. You don't get the feeling of wanting to finish it. The multiplayer is full of lag and desync. Another thing that you NEED TO CONSIDER is that you will need a top of the line Intel Core i7. But even though you will still end up playing at around 30-50 fps. You may be asking what about just turning down the graphics? Not worthit as you will get about a 5 fps difference for playing on low versus ultra.-11
Arma 3This game has some serious performance issues. For starters it's 32 bit which is never a good thing in that department. The thing that really upsets me though is that I have a decent machine (GTX 1080 i7 4790k) and yet I still have constant lag spikes that are super annoying and make the game unplayable at some times. The lag spikes are persistent no matter what I am doing. They even happen in the game menu. After some advice from my friends I spent $80 buck on some high-end RAM only to end up with no noticeable difference. The only thing would be left is the HDD however even that is fine as far as performance goes. This is the only game that I have issues with and it sucks because I really enjoy the gameplay.-10
Arma 3You can shoot up a school sad part is that there's no kids inside :C-10
Arma 3This game is very realistic. I cannot however for the life of me understand why it is so difficult to design a launcher that will auto download all the mods you will need for a server. CS:GO does this automatically so I don't understand why this cannot. You will get cancer from this game if you try to play anything but vanilla and vanilla ARMA 3 is boring af. Until they fix this I cannot reccommend this game until its on sale for at least 50% off.-10
Arma 3unoptimized gar no matter the rig. Not worth 60 -10
It always chrashes no matter what i play and there seems to be no fix;-1;0
crap game! we could do better than this laggy crap with the hardware we have now a days. Als full of thieving !  avoid!!!!!!!!!!!!!;-1;0
Arma 3This game was just too slow for me.. Some servers are 'meh' at best. The maps are so large and the server populations are so low its a very slow experience.   I've tried several of the game modes which does tend to make for a different play experience but for me I like combat atleast every 3-5 mins in a game versus running/driving/flying across maps for 10 mins to get to the action.       -10
so i got this game and wont even let me install it or show in my library but to my friends it says i have it wtf.....;-1;0
Arma 3I would not get this game until after it fully comes out. The game is in what still appears to be an alpha stage in which there is very little content. They need to keep coming out with new vehicles and guns in order for this game to be worth buying. Right now I would recommend ARMA 2 before this game as ARMA 2 has much more content.-10
-1;0
Arma 3 isn't worth the price. For $10 maybe... But we all know how greedy Bohemia interactive is.  The game is so-so even if you have friends who will play it for you.  There is only so much you can do on an island with 20+ weapons and a handfull of vehicles. Even the level editor is kind of basic. Optimization is MUCH better than ARMA2 but is still  poor leaving the game looking disgusting no matter how good your rig is. You can get a good hour of fun just screwing around but it'll wear off. Stick with Battlefield Bad Company 2 on steam.;-1;0
Arma 3Had this game since pre alpha havent played much because of bugs. but most are fixed to my knowledge. But the biggest down fall is your playing exile and you have no gun you find a gun on the ground but cant use it without the dlc.... walk a little farther and boom someone has the dlc and just shot you with the gun you should have been holding....-10
I am ing mad this game cu k i just payed $60 for  sake and it wont launch ive tried everything ing t!;-1;0
Arma 3Way too expensive. It could have been so much better if only they had optimised it for non-NASA PCs.-10
Arma 3Gameplay is good. But then it's the ArmA series the servers are not optimized properly even with high-end hardware your bound to get low FPS. Until they actually get their  together and optimize the game. It's a NO from me :P.-10
nice ing fps armatards;-1;0
Arma 3Best military sim in history of games but totally unplayable in multilayer becasue of worst netcode logic in history of gaming. Single player is perfectly fine with possibility to have over 60FPS even on mediocre hardware but in multilayer performance drops by about 1000% - no matter if there is a lot of action or not.  - 120FPS in single player drops to 11(ELEVEN!) FPS in multilayer server with just 40 people. - Performance of server can affect FPS on client! (Unique in the history of game design!) - Very bad performance in multilayer - So called 'hackers' are able to take control of game and do *everything* like flying cows with rocket launchers - Probably the worst client/server architecture ever developed in history of games - script running on client side can affect FPS off server AND other clients no matter how good hardware they have. - A lot of servers are running a lot of unoptimized and hacked scripts which can bring the game to crawl even when literally nothing is happening - Users can inject code into server and hijack it - Server can hijack user interface [even escape key!] of client  - Exactly the same problems existed in Arma 2 since 2008(?) and none of them were fixed or mitigated - There is no option tot ban particular IP address - One script-kiddie can ruin and crash entire server becasue of insanely bad server and client side code and architecture  NOT RECOMMENDED. I wasted money on it! They did not fix anything since Arma 2!-10
Very boring unless you like realism;-1;0
Arma 3This game is a huge disapointment so far like they took ACE mod and used new graffix.-10
WINDOWS 10 is not supported ?!!!?!?! WHY? I play like 8mins and the game crash!!!!!;-1;0
everything is  about altis life.  off you ;-1;0
Arma 3It was fun at first but it grew old quickly. I purchased due to Atlis Life mod and quickly found the lack of players willing to comply with server rules made the game not so enjoyable. The large maps are nice and all but too damn big for 100 or less people... I enjoy the realist consideration of the game such as fatigue from sprinting and its effect on aiming.   Overall ARMA 3 does not have a lasting effect on me. Some of the situations that occur are very fun and memorable but I often find myself logged in running around in circles doing nothing. For large scale combat (meaning hundreds of players at the same time in the same location) on maps the size of Arma 3 maps I would recommend Planetside 2 which is a free-to-play game. The simulation ARMA 3 offers is extremely impressive and quenches my thirst of rendering 360 No-Scope Headshot noobs useless. However as a game I don't enjoy it as much.-10
NOT worth the price. Luckily got it when it was alpha for $30. Lacks content and engine is still a piece of crap.;-1;0
muliplayer servers 99.9% populated by 3rd party server providers and are mistreating players with false positive anti cheat clames with no proof.;-1;0
Arma 3If there is a worse game than this please someone tell me. The game is completely unoptamized for any pc in existence and in order to play it you basically need to know code to fix the god aweful fps. PC specs for anyone thinking that there pc can handle it. CPU i7 5820k GPU GTX 1080 8gb RAM 32GB gskill trident memory MOBO MSI Gaming 7 PSU 1000w EVGA G2 1TB intel SSD 4tb WD black. Game playes like crap on a 1080 a 980 ti and 2 780 ti's AND ANYYTHING ELSE. STAY AWAY FOR YOUR WALLETS SAKE!-10
you don't get to shower with other men.;-1;0
WHAT THE  AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?;-1;0
Arma 3ARMA 3 WOULD GET A THUMBS UP IF...  the AI companions were actually COMPETENT i cant empahsize this enough. THE AI IS ABYSMAL by FAR tthe worst ive ever seen npc's cant even intentionally enter buildings if they do its because their  pathfinding led them into a doorway at which point they struggle and thrash around trying to get back outside. Its ing pathetic.  walking in a second story room didnt run the risk of having you clip through the floor and fall to your death  the enemy AI wasnt able to headshot you at ungodly ranges without missing a shot (Theres a certain structure that has bullet holes on each side when they impact. Shot after shot right where my head should be not to mention they can see my head and take aim on the other side of a wall)   the game didnt run like absolute  (i7-4790k w/ Gtx 970 obviously my pc isnt the problem)  BOHEMIA INTERACTIVE WOULD DEVELOPE THEIR OWN ING GAME AND RELEASE IT WITHOUT ALL OF THESE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING GAME BREAKING BUGS. INSTEAD OF HAVING THE COMMUNITY TRY TO FIX IT FOR THEM.  This all being said as much as i want to actually ENJOY this game and recommend it to people. I cant. Not for $60 (still... that)  TL;DR I shouldnt have to download modpack after modpack to fix this game for the devs. Thats what ing patches are for.  Also this game sucks dog di ck-10
 other than the dayz mod lol;-1;0
Arma 3Game sucks don't bother paying their price.-10
A game about walking.;-1;0
Arma 3Ok so arma is a great game but they dont seem to give a  about the people who bought the dlc bundle awhile back who were promised all future and current dlc because the didnt give them apex. Dont get me grong arma 3 is a great game im just salty about not getting apex.-10
Arma 3I found this game to be un-enjoyable to play for a few reasons.   Far far too many key bindings!! I spent much more time than I'd like checking 'what key is that again?' going through the key binding config or figuring out how to do things. Also I often found that I accidentally hit a wrong key or key combo and spent longer than I would like figuring out how to undo it.   It's just annoying non-intuitive and I doubt I'll spent much more time playing (5 hours in as of this writing). UX fail.   The performance isn't great either (quad core i5 w/ gtx 960 here) so you better have a really good PC to run this beast if you want decent graphics at decent framerates.-10
ihated this;-1;0
Arma 3I would recommend the singleplayer only - the Multiplayer got ruined by the community.  PvE:  - Hard restrictions on every server (You cant use this because class you can`t use that because something) - Abusive admins - Stupid rules  - only 3 or 4 server are actually populated  (Ahoy World is the worst server to play on - Admin dictatorship)  And on Altis life server it's only deathmatch with a RPG look - Bandits vs Civs vs Police  PvP:  - CoD styled missions (King of the Hill) - Boring matches (Koth Island control) - Only a few populated server   All in all I really regret that I spend 30 € on it -.--10
my game just dissapparelled at second day i bought it lmao;-1;0
Arma 2 is better;-1;0
.;-1;0
Do you wanna play a game thats unoptimized and server browser works only half the time. Then this game is for you....;-1;0
Fun game but the optimiztion issues killed it for me. Lowest settings 20-40fps with a GTX970?;-1;0
Very  game. feelsbad man if u spend money on this ;-1;0
Arma 3Arma 3 has some great features lots of game modes lot of mods and large open maps. But the client is glichy. I have a pretty high end RIG and i still drop to below 30fps at times and of course there are pleanty of hackers around to prey on the weak.   The game has (had) so much going for it if the right people were to put the time and effort into it I believe this could be one of the greatest games on steam. But at the current state (and not seeing much happening in the future) it's too glichy for the $40 price tag. When on sale ($19.99 is what I paid) it's a good buy but seeing as there are so many free simulator shooters and survival games this one just needs to step it's game up.  Happy trolling guys. I'll be in the Hills with my .408 waiting.-10
not work in windows 10;-1;0
Arma 3Maybe it's me but I don't get what's so great about this game Most of the time I can't connect to a server with players and when I do there's some error or other stuff that kicks me out again and it look's to me as if the whole world is empty.  I probably 'do it wrong' but this game is not for me I'll go back to battlefield.-10
Arma 3Worst ing game i've ever played.... The least optimised game i've ever played unplayable with 1-35FPS all the time wiht a GTX780.... Dont buy unless you want to spend 50 Euros on 100% pure garbage-11
There is a lack of content also I hated the game becuase it never ran smoothly and it felt really incomplete for a game that has been out for 3 years it seemed very ike there where alot of bugs;-1;0
Arma 3its a  game you have no clue what you doing. in basecamp you cant hit at taget at 400m the game dont explane how to work the scope. if you press careful ones right click you get the small red dot on top if you hold it down you zoom in at the side of the riffle... WTF I WANT TO ING USE THE TELESOPIC SIGHT!! HOW HARD CANT IT BE TO EXPALINE THE PLAYER TO USE A SCOPE.. IS THIS GAME ROCKET SCIENCE?  THIS GAME! dont buy it dont support at game developers that make games cryptic. why even use x to duck and z to lay down.. WHY?-10
Arma 3Arma 3 is one of the worst games i have ever played and i have no idea how people play the game the controls are confusing and completely ridiculous you set the game to the lowest difficulty and still die by a single shot. and if you happen to press a certain button (still no clue which button that is.) your game completely freezes on itself and only allows you to move and look around.-10
Arma 3After trying for about 5 hours in vain to just get past a small phase in a mission in the game i can finally say i gave up. above the insanely hardcore combat system i got killed countless times by mines that i can't understand how to tell their location so it's just a simple annoying random death. Also the game has a lot of bugs mainly graphic. i'd say the devs rushed too much. 5/10 game health 3/10 gameplay 8/10 graphics -30/10 gameplay forgiveness. Bought the game when it was 50% off and i regret spending every and each $ for this game which i just can't play.-10
payed for this game today and played it today and must say im very disapointed and sad it cost anything near 60$ when mp lags to a  :/;-1;0
Worst game i've ever played. This is  and this is the worst 30€ I've ever spend. .;-1;0
There needs to be more female characters.;-1;1
Good luck getting into a server lmao;-1;1
Not recommended. It is the most glitchy game I have ever played. My ping could be 30 and have over 40 FPS and still rubberband. I'm level 30 in the king of the hill servers so I'm not necessairly a newbie and my game is up-to-date. I've lost connection more times than I can count due to battle eye or just lose connection to the server. I've spawned in the middle of the ocean. I've run straight through railings to my death. I've been trapped in helicopters because I can't eject. This is all very frustrating when you've spent over $1000 on your gear and vehicle only to get kicked out before you're halfway to the area of operation and making money on those servers takes a considerable amount of time.   Don't get me wrong. When the game works I have LOTS of fun. I love the teamwork and communication involved. But I also have long periods where the game is simply unplayble. And what point is having a game that works only half the time? Your results may very but for me I've given up and don't recommend anyone get this game.   Another complaint; the ads Arma 3 puts on the screen as you're playing is the most annoying thing ever. I've gotten killed before because they literally put a popup in the middle of your screen as you play that you cannot click out of. I made a point of never buying the APEX DLC out of spite because of how annoying it is. I don't think anyone should either!;-1;0
spent 2 hours setting the keys well now i can't refund it  edit came back to the game seeing this 3 year old glitchy mess being sold FOR 55 DOLLARS WHAT AND THEN YOU NEED TO PAY FOR THE MOST OVER PRICED DLC IN THE UNIVERSE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE GAME NOT BUG YOU CONSTANTLY BECAUSE YOU PICKED UP A GUN THAT YOU NEEDED AT THAT MOMENT  well im never buying another one of there games again  edit once again i decided to try the rp servers well there was a mugger every single place the police say you did things you didnt so they can fine you and i got a gun to stop the muggers and one tried to mug me so i shot him then got a bounty on my head got arrested a day later i thought i was kidnapped tried talking to the people that where arresting me no respawnce all they wanted was the bounty no rp at all then i waited 10 mins didnt have a car because my friend had one so i ran over to the closest city then the game bugged i floated slightly off the ground for 3 seconds then died i said this game is  then alt f4 that   also im starting to think they are faking reviews and botting votes as no one has commented saying why they think im wrong or what ever and i already have 3 downvotes and one upvote please to prove me wrong comment something saying why im wrong  i rate this game 5/5 levels of terminal brain cancer;-1;0
2016 update:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDOM7D4NT6Y  No comments required.  'This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things.' This is the kind of line you'll find in most positive reviews of ArmA 3. The thing is ArmA 3 fails miserably in every single front involving both 'the finer things' and the basic things. BI Studio decided to use an ancient patched-up engine used since the times of the Operation Flashpoint. You'd think the bright side of this is they used the saved money and resources to put everything into solid focus on most important aspects of a 'military sandbox' they claim they've dished out. Long story short - they didn't.  ArmA 3 is not actually worth a comprehensive review so let me show you some of examples of how bad execution you can expect in every single corner of the game. Ironically the praised mods greatly expose ArmA 3 as a game that doesn't provide even a basic set of properly implemented essential features. What the DayZ developers achieved with the engine also show what kind of bad apple ArmA 3 is.  Performance: ArmA 3 has already become legendary of it's poor optimisation within the gaming community. The game has completely inadequate system requirements to what it presents. Even taking into account some little simulation (unlike by the common opinion) under the hood. All of it topped with lack of proper use of multi-core processors. Just one of the forum topics on the subject:  http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?147533-Low-CPU-utilization-amp-Low-FPS   Damage and wounding model: I knew it wasn't perfect but what I saw and read left me in awe. A 'military focused sandbox' 'military simulation'. So you'd think the model is at least solid right? If so we could as well call Return to Castle Wolfenstein a military sandbox. FEAR 1 would be something ArmA 3 could only aspire to. To put it simpler: The model is non-functional. You can shoot a man in a freakin' finger few times and he will die. You can put a bullet through the back of a knee of a man and he will only flinch. Helmets protect whole heads uniformly (yup including the face!) bp vests protect the entire torso uniformly. To put it into perspective some of the damage and wounding aspects of ArmA 3 are worse than those in the decade+ old Operation Flashpoint (same developers). See:  http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?168548-Damage-system-sucks-fix-needed&amp;p=2784549&amp;viewfull=1#post2784549   AI: Not a trace of human-like behavior. In a close quarter engagement if you put bullets into AI's arms it will only flinch slightly. First second third - flich flinch flinch. And the he'll kill you with a perfect head-shot without any delay. AI also simply 'isn't bothered' to survive. AI under suppressive fire? No problemo for AI! See:  http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=23969    Sound: You'd think sound location (spatialization) would be important for developers of a 'military sandbox'? You pretensious brat! Arma doesn't use any sort of spatialization. By now you should already know better you shouldn't expect positional audio of any sort (HRTF binaural Rapture3D...;7.1 surround is not positional audio). The game doesn't even do the basic stereo panning on many sound samples (sic!). It's unplayable for me without DolbyHeadphone enabled in the preferences of my Asus Xonar.  To top it off if you imagine a certain situation should involve 20 audio samples (steps equipment 1 equipment 2 wind ambient birds door opening squad mate unholstering his pistol...) you can cross off about 10 of those to get a feeling of how rich the ArmA's audio environment is.  'Erm... so maybe... the potential?' Until there will be a copy of 'ArmA's potential' for sale I'd like to stick to evaluation of what I see. Even if I give it some slack it doesn't really make the picture more bright. ArmA has been released a year ago. Fundamental aspects of it by all signs need rewrite or ground-up implementation which isn't even on the horizon. You plan on giving feedback and asking on the forums. The only thing you'll get is a slap in the face in a form of a shopping cart DLC women DLC real sea streams DLC or maybe Latin America Forces DLC.;-1;0
If you enjoy getting insta-sniped by terminator AI the second you try to sneak up on them this is for you.  If you enjoy not being able to see your opponents but they can see you through all the bushes and trees with their x-ray vision this is for you.  If you hate fun this game is for you.;-1;0
I dont really know what to say about this game. I perfectly understand that some people may like it but I know that I certainly didn't...  Basically if you're not a hardcore military fanatic do not buy it.  The main problem I had with it was that I bought it thinking it was a more realistic battlefield with bigger maps and more accuracy concerning vehicles weapons weapon mechanics and that stuff. And as you probably know because you aren't me it isn't.  First of all the game mechanics themselves are in my opinion faulty and sluggish. It doesnt feel like you're in control of your character whether youre controlling a vehicle or the character himself. The UI is the worst I have ever seen in a game. Especially when it ocmes to looting one of your victims.  Then the AI is completely bugged/overpowered in the singleplayer campaign (which is ridiculously bad btw) I was grenaded by enemies from 300m away.  The multiplayer is bad too because servers are   very   badly managed and end up with your spawns being so far from the war zone that you spend most of your alive time in a chopper to get to the warzone and then end up getting killed after 2 minutes on the ground by a camper in a building who knows the map better than you. And trust me this gets very frustrating after a while it just becomes a cycle of death -&gt; long helicopter ride -&gt; death -&gt; long helicopter ride etc.  The only context I would recommend buying this game is if you have maybe a squad of a friends with the game and mics who will play with you in co-up community made missions. But that's pretty much it.;-1;0
Good game cancer community;-1;1
It was great when it came out. Now the game is filled with ads for the expansions and there is no apperent way to disable them.  I could only recommend this game in it's original state before the ads and there is no way to revert it to an earlier version soooo....;-1;0
The single-player campaign was the only part of the game that I was interested in. I found it unenjoyable: I couldn't see the enemies that were shooting me. Apprarently their eyesight was dramatically better than my soldiers. I frequently didn't know what it was that I was supposed to be doing specifically. E.g. it wasn't clear what the symbols on the map meant. The minutia in the simulation detracts from the gameplay. (E.g. it wasn't clear how to launch and fly the UAV.)  I guess are far as 'realism' goes this game might be in a different league from other shooters. So if that's your top criteria maybe it's for you. But I couldn't forgive it for making the experience unnecessarily unintuitive. So I can't recommend it.;-1;0
*Interview with Bohemis Ineractive* *Interviwer 1* 'Bohemia Interactive can you tell us what the frame rate for Arma 3 is like?' *Bohemia Interactive* 'Frame rate? what's that?';-1;0
It was good for a few months and i really enjoyed it but now none of the servers show up and when i join from the browser it takes a long time to load a then crashes same with quick play and the a3 launcher doesn't work either. can anyone help me fix this problem.;-1;0
This would be a thumbs up if I could get more than 20 fps with a powerful computer.;-1;1
However I think those 5680 rewievers said enough.   In a few words that's example of game genre monopoly which seriously slowed down everything in this game except it's price. We may love and enjoy the only one playable milsim in Steam but still there's much to improve.  Game got it's 90% positive reviews just in case of the fact that there aren't many   good   milsims to compare to Arma.  By the way instead of improvements that are   really needed    dear Bohemia made DLC's. Hopefully we have waited only 15 years for bipods. And here comes Apex DLC with much more really much more improvements that should have been in-game since 2013.   And don't be lazy guys check out the price of Apex and recognize that it's more expensive than game itself in 2013.   Yes yes. ~~~ I bet people would by 60$ optimization DLC instead of that. The problem of engine is that lags don't come from high graphic settings. They come from view distance setting which have to be set low to play with normal fps. However singleplayer doesn't lag so much so you have to choose:  ~~~?1: Play with the dumbest AI ever in SP missions without lags.  ~~~?2: Play multiplayer with the most terrific lags ever. Most servers use mods which make even more lags.      Other hateful sh!t:    For the memory of the brave soldiers who have died being stucked in a fence. Somebody kill the 'v' button.  You can heal youself infinite times in vanilla. Just like in real life medkits set you HP to 75%.  Who cares about that you can sprint half a minute with 15kg machine gun?  Ah we have AP and HP ammo in every game but hell yes not here in the best milsim of our universe.  Oh cr*p you can't normally reload weapon in vehicle. You even can't change the seat.  Very realistic radar really.  Tell us that hero who has made realistic helicopter physics with 1 second delay for engine power control turning your helicopter flight in a 999 ping simulation.  This game don't have realistic physics for planes. Not sure if I should be happy about this or not.  Bohemia was brave enough not to use the nodegraph for AI. Sure it's impossible to put nodegraph on 270km^2 map but guys bots are stuck only in towns. Wasn't it hard to make nodegraph in those little settlements? All of us know that if we'll make NPC drive through whole Altis on a truck it will spend 40% of time bumping random garbage can or house before it reach it's destination point.   Sure you know that AI has other problems as well because sniper NPC still can't make a single hit with his GM6 Lynx from 400m but can pistolsnipe you from the same distance.  Another trouble is low basic content. You gonna say this game has it's awesome mods and be sure you're right. Despite the fact that that must-have mods won't work after every update. And they're still unstable.  To be sure how great vanilla is check out if there are any servers without mods and tell me later how much in % you've found.  People are judging physics but it seems that no one noticed this dumb recoil system an more even dumber penetration system in ballistics for vehicles I hope fellow WOT or WT players will understand what I'm talking about.   Be sure everyone LOVES scrolling mouse3 to change a gun!  NPC walks through stones.  It's fixed now but I remember those times NPC couldn't drive on a brigde.  100% of civilian popualtion are wierd 20yo men. No children no old people no women.  You can shoot out armoured glass with SMG.  We certainly enjoy control system.  Please tell me how NPC survive after 127mm shot.  NPC don't care for driving over their mates with an APC.  Anyone remember those times when NPC teamkilled you if you've crashed UAV?  Guns don't have safe mode. (Mods gonna help you)    Do you already have stairs phobia? Because they gonna come to you at night and make you fall though the Earth to the south pole .    Butthurt is over.  ;-1;0
I guess if your going in the military it might be fun but for an everyday joe like me it's just too slow and difficult.   When the gun fire actually starts it's a lot of fun but I tended to die immediately after that happened :(. Guess I shouldn't join the military.  ;-1;1
New patch gives rendering issues net code slingshot issues still has the freelook bug now the zoom in the gunner seat of armor is bugged and you need to mash your plus and minus keys over and over before it zooms in or out. Graphics wise it runs a little smoother and looks slightly better.;-1;0
Limited selection in customizing keys. AI is insanely tough even at the lowest settings. Too many odd keystrokes to learn. Overall just not very intuitive for the user. Really didn't enjoy the guns either. Has to be played through additional software other than Steam.;-1;1
Tried to return 1 hour over the 2 hour limit. Thanks Steam. It's an okay game fps are just unacceptable.;-1;0

This game made me lose 60 pounds in one day now i am 600 pound i was gonna eat myself to death im just getting healthier and this made me get a job and now i live in an actual house i demand a 10% refund on this game or I will suck your wee wee for free don't push me you have exactly 10 days;-1;1
I spent all my money on this game played for 10mins and i had to get off leaving the game open came back next day played had nothing good to do all the servers are  maps way too big to do anything if it even had any thing to do its not even a good sandbox game its  so basicly i wish i would had closed the game so i could have got a refund D:;-1;0
Arma 3Really wanted to like this game. Seems buggy and unoptimized haven't even played online because you have to buy DLC to get into any games. Feel like I wasted money on this one.-11
Arma 3The game is great but there are WAY too many bs servers. It's like playing ing Garry's Mod. Why do I have to play all of these weird survival servers that are not at all immersive? How can you actually like put 100s of hours into a Life server where you just click on stuff (I'ts already a video game I want it to be at least kind of engaging) and pretend you're doing it? Don't get me wrong they're fun for awhile but I just want an actual war-like experience from this game.-10
Arma 3I would not recommend this game for one reason entirelly this game has extremely unbelievably poor performance. The problem is so huge that out of the 300 hours I played at least 200 of those were waiting for the lag spike to finish and another 30 trying to get into a server because it's kicking me for no reason at all (friend in the server just sees that i'm getting kicked without an explanation). The kicking happens so often and so many times per game session (some days it just completely  on me and after 10 tries I just give up) that it gets extremely annoying and repulsive and combine that with the lag i was writting about (plus the average 20 fps when not in a lag spike even at lowest settings) makes the game time spent in the game an absolute pain. While it does have it's moment they simply aren't worth all the suffering. P.S. I'm getting poor performance while the friend I mentioned plays on a cpu graphics procesing but gets a lot better performance than me.-10
Arma 3I've played this game since it was in early access. I've put way too many hours into this broken game. It will always be broken. It does not matter how good your PC is this game just runs like absolute trash. Nothing will change with Arma I dont care if they come out with Arma 4 it will still run like  and have the same issues that have been around since Arma 2.-11

spent 2 hours setting the keys well now i can't refund it  edit came back to the game seeing this 3 year old glitchy mess being sold FOR 55 DOLLARS WHAT AND THEN YOU NEED TO PAY FOR THE MOST OVER PRICED DLC IN THE UNIVERSE IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE GAME NOT BUG YOU CONSTANTLY BECAUSE YOU PICKED UP A GUN THAT YOU NEEDED AT THAT MOMENT  well im never buying another one of there games again  edit once again i decided to try the rp servers well there was a mugger every single place the police say you did things you didnt so they can fine you and i got a gun to stop the muggers and one tried to mug me so i shot him then got a bounty on my head got arrested a day later i thought i was kidnapped tried talking to the people that where arresting me no respawnce all they wanted was the bounty no rp at all then i waited 10 mins didnt have a car because my friend had one so i ran over to the closest city then the game bugged i floated slightly off the ground for 3 seconds then died i said this game is  then alt f4 that   also im starting to think they are faking reviews and botting votes as no one has commented saying why they think im wrong or what ever and i already have 3 downvotes and one upvote please to prove me wrong comment something saying why im wrong  i rate this game 5/5 levels of terminal brain cancer;-1;0

This game has its quality but I find it so hard to play that I end up never playing... Arma 3 are for those individuals who have either a real glutten for punishment or have a major hardon for playing military. I for one would much rather play Battlefield 4.

Buy Arma 2. More content. More better.;-1;0
Arma 3? More like Arma 3 Apex. Buy the expansion or don't play the game. You're lucky to find a Stratis or Altis server. Also I couldn't see any FPS improvements in MP even a server without mods still runs under 30 FPS on low where as I can play the game on high settings around 35 FPS in SP.;-1;0

You can't play online with the base game because every room seems to need the DLCs in order to play.  Then of course you're gonna have to download a 3rd party launcher that auto fetches mods for you.  Then you have to wait while those download and install.  And when you finally have all that done you get TK'd by a bunch of a**holes that think it's funny to repeatedly crash helicopters into you.  It's prohibitively hard you'll die before you have time to react you may never even know where or who killed you.  My final conclusion: This game needs a multiplayer demo so people can see if they like it before dropping $80 on it and getting f***ed by steam's return policy.;-1;0
stephan hawking runs better than this game;-1;1

Note that this is the MAC PORT I'm talking about. The Windows version runs perfectly fine and smooth. My PC runs it at ultra settings and it is great war game. Before you complain remember that I HAVE A PC THAT IS ABLE TO RUN THIS GAME.   This game doesn't run at all. It crashes even at the beginning of the prolouge. I really don't want to be a Mac fanboy but I would say that they didn't do well with the Mac port. The 'video' setting is very laggy and crashes the game every time I change a setting. The game barely runs and the FPS man. Never have I ever seen 3 FPS in a game. The audio are also delayed at some points such as the dialouge where the man is supposed to say 'Woah!' but it gets delayed for a few seconds. Honestly anything else is just your average 'it doesn't work'.  To sum this up I would suggest playing the on a PC and if you only have a Mac DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR YOUR MAC. I suggest saving up for a PC so you can play the game. In my opinion I think this Mac Port was a waste of time for Bohemia Interactive.   I HAVE A PC. THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE MAC PORT.;-1;0

I have no clue what these game developers are doing.  I got a 5930k 32gb DDR4 980 GTX x 2 in SLI a rampage V Extreme motherboard and this game wont run much over 30 fps for me. I put EVERYTHING on low and still 24 fps. Autodetect did something right but still not over 30-40 fps. And its not even super pretty. The game might be good but the optimalization just is so bad its insane.  I wonder what graphics the rest is playing on because this is t. Neither of my 980 GTX will go over 911 mhz either while playing it. So it stutters while not utilizing the graphic cards. I want my money back its a 'bad code'-simulation.;-1;0
I have better pc specs than the recommended settings and i can't get more than 18-21fps. which is unplayable so i rate this game 1/10 cause it lied to me and now i wasted $30 i'm already super picky what i buy and this just made it even worse;-1;0
NO this game can suck my   (no homo);-1;0
I would recommend it to someone who is new to the series...However..If you are a hardcore ARMA II player like myself  Then DO NOT BUY THIS...Unless you want to play altis life or some other crap..  this game was one of the biggest let downs;-1;0
WOW  never spent my money that well -.- BIG SARCASM THIS GAME IS FAR FROM BEING A 'SIMULATOR'   Its not balanced gameplay/control are HORRIBLE This game is a waste of Time Money Brain usage.   I DONT RECOMMEND THIS GAME WHAT SO EVER;-1;0
The only way i can describe the inner workings of this game is to envision a car junkyard. Now imagine throwing a giant white sheet over that junkyard and painting nice colors on it. Thats what arma3 is.  Just unnaceptable for a 2014 title. I can't believe how poor this game's engine and game mechanics are. It's just shocking to look back 16 years at games like delta force 2 in 1998 and think that this is actually worse. There is so much erratic behavior as a result of poor engine mechanics it is not even possible to even pretend to try fixing them all.  After looking into it i discovered that this game uses the same exact base engine as operation flashpoint from back in 2002. The same engine that arma1 uses arma2 and now arma3. It's like trying to re-use a 50yr old boat trailer meant for 13ft boats on a 100ft YACHT. It's just lazy and unacceptable. I even read a huge article about how the actual developers of the game confirmed that the engine does not utilize multiple cpu cores. And why would it? The engine is ancient and just heavily modified. (i know this is the part where you argue and toss out comments like 'Ohh but you didnt type in the command parameter -8 threads or something shallow like that) that does nothing. If a game is not hard coded from the base engine to unload different tasks onto different cpu cores. Than it does not make any difference if the game can recognize multiple cpu's or not.)  Arma2 had much better graphics in terms of realistic color pallette. If you ever look at arma2 screenshots or dayz videos it actually looks real. And there is so much in the way of woods/trees/bushes and other vegetation in arma2 to the point where you genuinely feel like you are in the woods. Arma3's colors are unrealistic and just plain fruity.  Arma2 was more acceptable as a 2008-9 product. Do you remember all of the different maps in arma2? Do you remember the THOUSANDS of different structures in terms of houses/outhouses/farms/industrial machinery. What does arma3 have? It has one map. Stratis. And the other map is no different. So please don't tell me arma3 has two maps when it just recycles the same terrain from stratis.;-1;0

Its an ok game best part of the game is obviously its multiplayer but with the constant connection problems it can be a drag and its not realy worth a buy considering other games do mp better!;-1;0
i paid 30 pounds for a game that crashes every 5 minutes. I have checked forums and i have tried to fix this problem for the last month. I dont think the issue is with my computer. I dont mind any of the other countless bugs in this game but i draw the line when it crashes constantly. How am i supposed to imerse myself when this is constantly happening. I am gonna just stick with arma 2 which is a fantastic game and has already got a better community.This game is more then just a dissapointment its unplayable.;-1;0

But there is one CRITICAL PROBLEM - there is some as yet unknown issue that can completely break the game for people and they will never be able to play it again. Iv had that problem for YEARS now. Never fixed never address BI is too lazy to bothered. Should of never bought this. WASTE OF MONEY ON A GAME THEY NEVER FINISHED.;-1;0
not what i expected..;-1;0
They improved Arma 2 a lot to make this game but it isn't in the right areas. The game takes place in 2034 but they still have you using a map and compass. Left control and right control key combinations are in here but I don't want to play a game where I have to use control as a modifier for my keys at any time. This game needs more menus commo roses and context-sensitive commands and needs to get rid of the dead weight.  Don't buy it.;-1;0

Coming from a non ing fanboy this game is a buggy piece of . Have fun getting 30 fps on all quality settings from very low to ultra and i have a GTX 970 and Nvidia recommends i play on Very High so i have the specs for this  show game.

Awesome Idea but overcomplicated to a point where the movement is clumsy and engine not pleasant to play in: you get stuck in stairs and doors use scroll wheel for every thing WT?!  An for crying out loud get the engine optimised to run SLI GPUs at 100% not 15%.  AGGGRRR angry!;-1;1

After installing everything took me like fucking 5 hours i turned the game on suddenly this  doesn't want to work soo gg wp refunded as well ;-1;1
i wanna let everyone who is reading this the 'DLC's' are  sh!ty. like i might as well have taken a sh!t and took a picture and made it a DLC. although that might be a better DLC than arma 3's. DON'T waste your money on this spend it on some boi pu-C..;-1;1
diiis game sucks because fps is  in mult  0/10 this gave will destroy your eyes;-1;1
Whatever you do be thankful this review is up. It might be realistic and such but the controls are horrible. You are limited to few weapons and cannot record gameplay footage without setting the game to view in window screen. Don't waste your time downloading this as it is 11.2 GB and there's not alot of things to do.;-1;1
banned for no reason;-1;1
Honestly one of the best hyper-realistic military shooter games out there. I guess if you enjoy that type of game you'd like it.;-1;1
I would not recommend this game as 90% of the players are chronically  and have aids;-1;1
wont start up broken game need to be updated i should not have to go into file and delte stuff just to start the dang game;-1;1
ONLY ONE REASON WHY I PUT NEGATIVE REVIEW:  I PAID FOT THIS GAME 60$ (OR 70$ DON'T REMEMBER) WHEN IT WAS ONLY CRAPY ALFA WITHOUT ANY DLC's  NOW IT'S 40$ FOR THE NAKED AND IMPROVED VERSION. WELL THAT'S DISRESPECT TO THE FANS AND FOUNDERS.  ONE MORE THING - THE CAMPAIGN IS LAME SO TECHNICALY I BOUGHT THE RIGHT TO PLAY USERS CONTENT. WHAT A DUPERY...;-1;1
Sims with guns...;-1;1
well I could give this game a good review if the minimum system requirements were not a lie if the game could actualy do a decent bit of multithreading or not run like  when you try and do anything relatively complex.;-1;0
I bought thisreally exited to play it.Bootcamp ran....Okwith a few freezes here and therebut i suspect thats my dying hard drive.I jumped into multiplayer really looking forward to itbut it ran like crap.Now I knew buying this that the performance wasnt greatbut my godI thought that they meant it doesnt reach 60 often.I was wrong. I was getting frames as high as 30 and as low as 5even when standing still.Changing settings to low didnt help and i expected at this point that is was the serverso i tried another.Same thing.At this point i realised if i tried longer i would have over two hours on the gameand have a chance of not getting refunded. So i quit the gameand requested a refund.I really wanted to play itbut 12 fps is not playable.I have an r9 380 and I5-4690kso its not my system.;-1;1
Not working... I keep trying to play the game it wont launch (at the launcher) I connected my Bonnthia account to steam.. still says I need to connect it Someone please Help :l;-1;0
this is better  http://girlshorse.net/823465817-black-girl-ing-horse.html;-1;1
Getting yelled at by teammates cause i dont know where the  tango bravo  is is not how i roll but whatever;-1;0
So decided to buy Arma 3 last year and the DLC packs recently (Karts Marksman Helicopters etc)....Installed Tried to join a server got told I have been caught cheating and have now been banned?  Absolute disgraceful game DayZ is another piece of !!!!. Avoid all Bohemia games!!!!!!!!.;-1;0
This game shouldn't have been released yet. Deadlines kill games. I love this franchise but this game is a big steaming pile of poop. I DONT RECOMMEND IT AS OF NOW....This game isn't worth 10 bucks and they are still trying to scam people out of their 60 bucks!  For 60 bucks I want a perfect game in the aspect of NO BUGS. This game is full of them. It seems every update that comes out makes the game worse not better. The devs care about the money not the game. The same bugs are there since the alpha release...  Save your money on this pile of garbage.;-1;0
Walking simulator.  That is all all. Deleted of my account got conned into buying this :(;-1;0
Playing on difficult settings feels like dark souls. Very low fps Otherwise lots of funbut i simply cant reccomend it in this state;-1;0
bugs bugs bugs and low frames. i have GTX 660 frostbite and i cant run in the max. I play BF3 ultra and 30frames... this game is waste of money;-1;0
Wait for helicopter pick up simulator' 0/10;-1;0
After only 24 hours of gameplay the game done goofed. I can't play it and when i try to redownload it it does not work. So gameplay is a 8/10 but the Dev's is a incredibly low score of 3/10;-1;0
If you were the smart shopper that decided to read reviews before by this game congratulations. You already outsmarted me. I bought this game because I had imagined something relatively like Battlefield or Call of Duty but on a much larger and more realistic scale. Well instead I got an overly realistic laggy impossible campaign game that breaks if you try to play 1 mod. Personally I would not recommend this game to anyone. I found absolutely no enjoyment in this game. I've played with some friends on a Wasteland server and it was fun until it became Minecraft faction servers in which case you build a base and wait for it to get raided while spending days trying to find someone else's base just to return and find that an x-ray modder has already taken it out. If I was given the opportunity to get a refund for this game I would in a heart beat. The campaign is impossible even on the easiest difficulty because 1: The guiding voice (example: World at War sniper mission with Reznov when he tells you to wait for the bombers) gives you the most basic and obscure directions and expects you to figure it out (i.e. the mortar team in the forest. finding the mine detector.) 2: The hostile AI will drop you in less than 3 shots and you'll never know where they came from and just keep respawning at a check point and trying to find a way to get past them without dying 3: You're friendly AI can and will die in combat and the medic rarely heals anyone or tries to revive anyone. Multiplayer wasn't as bad as long as you were among friends. A friend and I would play Zeus (a gamemode in which one player is able to do anything while the other players just play and wait for the Zeus player to do something) and mess around with vehicles. The vehicles were probably the only thing about the game that I didn't hate except for the artillery. There are no instructions or help tips or anything to help you fire the artillery vehicles. There is no hit indicator as to whether the shell even made contact with the ground or hit four miles to the right of the target. The aircraft are another thing I hated mostly because the were nearly impossible to fly. If you tried landing a jet or a helicopter you were better of grabbing a parachute and hoping for the best because more than likely the aircraft was just going to explode on contact with the ground even going less the a half of a mile per hour. So overall I would rate this game 2/10 just because not all of the vehicles and gamemodes sucked.;-1;0
two words.   Don't Buy This GAME.;-1;0
Doesn't run that well when playing multiplayer because for some reason they thought it'd be a good idea to load the entire map... Kinda the same mistake Unity made by having 12000 NPC's on screen at once.. So it's not a bad game at all very fun and good looking when the game runs smoothly however if you're looking for a fun military simulator that you can play then you might wanna buy Arma 2 instead. So it's not that I dislike this game I have a lot of fun with it it's just that sometimes I have to run it on low to play it at 30fps at most. I have GTX 970 if anybody's curious so yeah 7/10. Wouldn't recommend but it's a fun game still.;-1;0
There shouldn't be any in game purchases. This is how companies loose trust in their customers cause you turn around and screw us by trying to make a cheap buck. Go F**K yourself Bohemia!! You cheap  M*therF**kers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;-1;0
This game is pretty terrible.;-1;0
I hate this game.;-1;0
Scummy making us pay more money with dlc most servers use dlc so your only playing like half the game unable to pick up guns or use vehicles.  performance buggy as  and did i mention the stupid money grubbing DLC?;-1;0
it goes of the game by its self it takes the ;-1;0
Could be very good but isn't simple as that.;-1;0
I have no idea why but this game is kind of boring. I want to like it but I can't…;-1;0
I accept the poor performance bugs and little content (never mind there is a good amount of content. It's a shame it's behind a paywall though.) because it's still in a Early Acces Alpha oh wait it's not. It's just . 10/100.;-1;0
Totally boring and stupid. It is not for fun. Buy evolve or Battle field hardline. this is Garbage;-1;0
After several months of trying to use this game I have had enough.   Today the latest update removed all the mods in expansions (with no guidance about how to reinstall them) that made this half completed game playable.   Despite its huge potential and possibilities BI have developed and sold a half completed game thats over complex unintuitive with poor; single play functions gameplay and AI command &amp; control editing and character / vehicle modifications.   Despite excellent features (Virtual Arsenal and Editor) they are not interconnected but isolated elements requiring complex and 'out of game' processes to bring them together! When was this acceptable?  For some reason its set in 2030 (why?) and relies far to heavily on the modding community to make up for its fundamental weaknesses (e.g. BIPODS for LMG and snipers rifles are an urgent requirement you can not use the weapons effectively (or realistically).  But no Bohemia Interactive priorities 'Go Carts' over critical game weakness to be addressed waiting 2 years to have this addressed in the DLC  Stream can I ask how I get my money back please?;-1;0
Why I do not recomend it  -'new engine'  Still the same arma 2 bugs  new still unoptimised graphics  -Directed by james cameron  Every viecule will blow up because of a bush -AI  Still the same Unintelegent Aimbot/wallhax AI -Commanding AI  Still the same  contols with worse path findings -Fatigue  Basical a Fat Asthmatic Simulator -Multiplayer  still the same buggy piece of crap with poor hit ditection -Body armor and Damage  you will die from a 9.3mm in the foot and body armor only reduce damage even if you got shot with a 9mm at long range  Is It worth Buying at full price Still after 2 years Not at all. They obviusly try to use the EA marketing Strat with the poor DLC wich are basicaly small mods worth .99$ over priced at 15$.  I got only at a steam sales and you should do the same Just watch out Last time they removed the marksmen dlc from the sales but not the rest because it was the top selling object they had.  This game is Bohimia international version of a Czech gangbang Exept its  volentary ....;-1;0
This game is full of bugs complete waste of money!!!;-1;0
I reinstalled this game after a year of not playing it only to discover that I now need all 4 of the game's DLCs to play on 99% of servers. What is this crap? Even if you get the $20 DLC bundle you still have you pay $35 for Apex because again 99% of servers need all 4 DLC packs. After running the numbers I concluded that that is $55 more than I should have to pay to play this damn game online. It's one thing to not be able to go to servers on the Apex level but it's another thing to get locked out of servers on the vanilla level that arbitrarily require Apex.;-1;0
The first thing that I will say is that arma 3 is cheap (not in the money way!) every thing is poorly done it does not worth the price. The best animation and models are from addons that cost too mutch for what they have offer. Why I play this game becaus it si the only game like this !!!! no other reason! Im sure that if it would have competitors the developer would start to fix there game. btw there is mods for arma better and bigger than there arma (RHS) (just saying that those guys hase a smaller team and earn not money by doing mods but arma has a bigger team and earn money);-1;0
i constantly felt like i was cutting this game slack for the scope of it's map but in the end the campaign is pretty AWFUL way less interesting or even realistic than the original OFP (which is a blast btw) they've done almost zero to make controlling your AI squad even remotely interesting or intuitive the gunfights feel very clunky performance is meh  graphics are POOR by today's standard even on max settings multiplayer is often a lagfest  here's a word about military realism - most SP missions have you go in either alone or with a squad ingress is mostly on foot so is egress there are zero radio options for backup or any kind of coordination i didn't even find an option to choose with position in a vehicle an AI should take so you are alone and you get wounded trying to take on an enemy base? can't call for backup and good luck egressing on foot even at 4x speed while your character grunts like a pig in labor..its certainly nothing approaching realism...i was in the infantry this isn't how warfare even remotely works  id say that Arma2 SP was far better in this aspect with vehicles and a way to call a helicopter to pick you up and drop you off...it felt way more intuitive  overall no i would not recommend this game having a giant map doesn't excuse all the above mentioned issues also having a gigantic map and a 75 or 100 player limit is more of a frustration than a benefit  id say if you want a good military game either play OFP or Arma2 campaign both are rather good;-1;0
No Linux cross-play with Windows players.;-1;0
I havnt even played this game yet!;-1;0
play the free vrion a glich for the boot camp pis fix;-1;0
So I Payed $60 for this game a whole back and today i start playing it i get black screen for 10 minutes i cant Alt-Tab I Cant Do Anything But Ctrl-Alt-Delete so i do that it comes up but my cursor was gone so i close out the game by restarting my pc ive done this 6 times now and nothing happens ive verified the cache 3 times nothing still happens its starting to  me off;-1;0
awflul preformance on most pcs unless if you have a epic pc it will run badly. looks like a good game but from what i seen you can't run it well until this game is optimized more and works better i cant simply give it a super high score it is a 5/10 for me     i recommend it if you have a screaming fast pc but if you dont you should buy a new one or wait...     until i have a better pc i can't give gameplay revews because the fps can't go over 15;-1;0
Personally i don't like it. But don't get me wrong i think it's really good game just not for me. (Purchased it just to try it out);-1;0
This game is complete trash wont even launch because battle eye doesn't work.;-1;0
This is the most boring 'First Person Shooter' i've ever played in my entire time of PC gaming. It's like if the developer of Rust had brain damage;-1;0
It was a fun game for a while very realistic good graphics but they do not let you play without buying DLC. They advetise way too much and pick on players who do not pay extra for pointless DLC. It was'nt that bad until the last update. This Apex stuff is 10x worse. The main menu is the menu to a DLC campaign (which is the main button) and using Quick Play in the Mulitplayer section always makes you join a DLC server. That takes it too far. I love Bohemia Interactive but they TRASHED this game.;-1;0
they have had plenty of time to make it not so ;-1;0
where are the crosshairs on this game? if there are any i must be getting unlucky and picking all the servers without them. i mean yeah ok graphics but bad animation details doesn't really feel like a shooter when you can't aim down the barrel of your gun or even see your gun sometimes. The controls for this game are ridiculous there's no need for all those controls games not hard they just spent alot of their time putting useless stuff in it.;-1;0
It's shit lol;-1;0
Great until game tries guilt you into buying guns. There is gun dlc there is helicopter dlc and there is even go-kart dlc. You need to pay 16 dollars to not get popups about buying the dlc.;-1;0
The reqirments are WAY too high and too good for my Pc to handle;-1;0
Hey guys lets make a game and then expect the community to fix it for us. Oh yeah they already did that it's called ARMA.;-1;0
This game was pretty fun at first doing training missions. Then my friends and I decided to play together. Until I realized you had to pay another $30 to actually play the game. So do not buy this game is .;-1;0
Arma3 is so bad you get kicked for nothing dont buy it;-1;0
the game sucks;-1;0
i prefer arma 2 the current day wepaons not bug eyes yawnsville.;-1;0
Worst game I've played in a long time way too complex for a game.-10;-1;0
i want a refund but not sure where to get it;-1;0
Terrible game not at all optimized Can't run the game without a computer made by god himself and servers can ruin your fps if they are not at the perfect specs to join.-10;-1;0
Plain and simple.   ~Do not buy this game at full price.   ~Do not buy this game unless you want to buy the $70 DLC.  Or  ~Buy it and waste $35 on half of a game where people can pay to get better content than you!   Conclusion?  Don't buy this game unless you are a masochist who enjoys spending their time playing critically acclaimed half broken half DLC barred games.-10;-1;0
i got the game for free on a steam sale and bc of an update i have buy thte game again.;-1;0
it sucks;-1;0
Refunded. After 4-hours of playing online I refunded the game. Spent the vast majority of my time shooting at what I was told was AI on an adjacent hill.  20-30 minute firefights with trees that just lead to heli' rides back to the DMZ to re-stock on ammo.  Smokey the bear wouldn't approve.-10;-1;0
Very slow moving not a very friendly multiplayer environment very disappointed by the gameplay.-10;-1;0
Arma3 (needs permanence optimization) THIS GAME IS TRASH WITHOUT THE COMMUNITY ... GIVE BIZ NO MORE MONEY TILL THIS GAME IS OPTIMIZED AND PERFORMANCE IS INCREASED (to the standards expected by pc gamers or at least whats stated on the box preferred specifications)  Many games RELEASED UPDATEs THAT INCREASED PERFORMANCE ON PC WHY CANT BIS GET OFF THEIR MONEY HUNGRY LAZY ASSES AND DO THE SAME ....  ARMA runs like   why is a a game of this scale and this demanding 32 bit ? why does it only use half of system Ram? why does it only runs on 1 core  plus the recommended requirements ON THE BOX SAY   3.10 GHz for cpu   and even on the lowest settings thats not enough (Unless Bis lied about whats needed to run this game or this game runs like dodo)  its been 2 years  OPTIMIZE GAME PERFORMANCE IN SINGLE PLAYER AND MULTIPALAYER NOW TO MAKE USE OF OUR COMPUTERS.... HOLD OFF ON DLC AND TRAILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!?  how bout fix the single player bugs overhaul the unresponsiveness AI increase the game performance integrate AGM mod as default in the game engine integrate K.E.Y.S mod as the defualt in the games engine .. ?  AND YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO CHARGE US FOR DLC WHEN COMMUNITY MODS DO ALOT MORE FOR FREE SMH SHAME ON YOU IN 2015 BOHIEMIA ?  IMHO best solution would be not to buy their products in future. I lost all respect I ever had for BIS because of ArmA 3 and DayZ. Neither has improved the #1 problem with their games;  poor performance. They gained large following with ArmA 2 and Dayz mod and choose to blatantly exploit it and sell subpar products with no intent to fix them.10;-1;0
This game is a MilSim that lost it's identity to Battle Royale Exile and Arma Life.  When people told me that Arma 2 was the better game I thought to myself 'that game's buggy as  even if it doesn't have the exact same features it can't possibly be worse!'  And here we are.   I would probably enjoy this game more if I downloaded exile but that mod is the size of a whole new game that just piggybacks on the core of this unfinished mess.   All of the guns feel and sound the exact same which makes determining DDD impossible.   All of the scopes seem to have this weird blue lense effect that doesn't held when trying to figure out if that thing you're looking at is a player or an oddly shaped bush.  The DLC for this game is a joke what the  do you even use Zues for?  Save your money and buy Insurgency or Squad or even Call of Duty because that's even cheaper than this game AND more balanced.   I expected more from Bohemia Interactive 2 years ago when I first picked up Arma 2 but it seems every game they've sponsored or put forward has just turned into a mess. Lookin' at you DZS-10;-1;0
Supposedly super fit soldiers can't run 100 yards before passing out from exhaustion. Poorly funded terrorist troops have better armour 7-10 hits to kill. Supremely overfunded US troops use cardboard for armour. 2-3 hits to die.  Highly trained US Marine/Ranger/Seal/whatever can't keep the reticle on target.   this game.-10;-1;0
Arma 3 is a mil-sim that is very refined yet buggy at times. Overall I wouldn't recommend because the bugs are bad and only break the game half of the time. They released DLC's purely to make money and make the game play to win. They have a 7.62mm machine gun for free yet the pay to win people get a 9.3mm machine gun that shoots down any helicopter in 2 shots. Not fun. Do not buy for multiplayer this game is only usefull for it's editor function which allows you to make your own missions without pay-to-win guns. Since it's 60$ you have to commit so hard just to be disappointed by all the hype for a decent game that got ruined by the game breaking bugs and pay to win DLC's.  Can't play the most popular gamemode (king of the hill) with a gtx 760 and 3.3 Ghz...game drops framerate to ONE frame per second when an A-10 does a CAS run. Singleplayer still ok but multiplayer is useless. Here's a good example of my problem that 99% of page viewers can replicate:  http://feedback.arma3.com/view.php?id=1264   That feedback was made in 2013. It's 2016 and it has only been 'reviewed' Fix your game-10;-1;0
it sucks;-1;0
This game wouldn't even pass as a beta for most studios... Not happy.;-1;0
It seems enjoyable.. but it crashes every five to ten minutes. And yes mt pc is WAY more than capable to run this game. Itll be running on good settings at a nice framerate no bugs nothing then... the picture freezes the sound repeats like a damaged vinyl record and even my task manager freezes. My pc is virus free I scan after every download and once a week. No viruses just a poor game.-10;-1;0
I don't know what I expected to be honest but it's slow boring and has a terribly steep learning curve. Luckily I can still get a refund. :^)-10;-1;0
Dont buy this game ArmA 2/AO is way better.-10;-1;0
Amazing time and effort went into making this game. However I am not willing to put as much time and effort into playing it. As far as I'm concerned it's a SNAFU Simulator 2016. I understand the goal of the game is to achieve authenticity but it is too hard to survive.-10;-1;0
the game wont even run i want a refund;-1;0
