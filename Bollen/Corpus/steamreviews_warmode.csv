"585,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewBefore anyone says anything, I own CSGO and all of the Cods, I say this as I think it has a bit of both in them. In my opinion this is a 6.5/10 (An extra 2 rating because it is free.)Reasons Why?Pros:They have quite a lot of guns inside of the game,The gameplay is decent but the fps does not stay stable,A good game if you're looking just to chill and play some games on the night or something,Graphics are quite good for a free game,Best of all it's free!Cons:FPS isn't stable a lot of the time,All guns have hardly any recoil some don't even have recoil at all,You could have full health and the enemy could have 5/100 and still be able to kill you,Animations and Modelling could be slightly better,Might get repetitive over time,Takes quite long to unlock the AWP and M60 in a game (Snipers)You can shoot someone anywhere with a sniper and kill them in 1, you can even kill them in 1 shot to their foot,When you run into your team mates or enemies you just end up walking over them."",1"
"586,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access Review  Title WARMODE   Developer WARTEAM   Publisher WARTEAM  Release 25 August 2015  Graphics 3D   Genre FPS  Price Free-to-play  Rating 5/10 The game.WARMODE is a FPS about the confrontation of two sides, represented by the government military and the armed hirelings.Gameplay.An interesting game, still in early-alpha. Can be more than this or just stagnant here. Personally, I don't believe that can be more than this. There are some aspects that make the game be banal, like as weapon balance, some (or maybe the majority) weapons don't have no recoil, and the damage taken or induced is very weird. Btw, I played in a map much imitated of the Dust 2 of the Counter-Strike. I don't know the name but the map have very similar details. I don't like imitations.One more thing, if you have any first-person-shooter game experience, you'll literally be the best player on here and there is a great possibility of being called a hacker. One ranked as gold in CS GO can be a global here in just 20 minutes (lol). I got that feeling. Or in WARMODE just have low skill players.The game isn't bad but there are really betters on Steam. Some aspects like lag need to be fixed, servers are unstable. And please, don't compare CS GO to WARMODE, it only reveals ignorance. Counter-Strike has many years, already suffered so many changes and for sure is better, incomparable, WARMODE is an early-alpha game. The game is free, soft and with a simple interface, you need to consider these aspects too before give a negative review just because yes. I'll give a chance and I'll come back later.Positive points. (+)Free-to-play.Simple and fun interface.The devs read the reviews.Negative points. (-)Majority of the weapons don't have no recoil.The damage taken or induced is very weird.Could have more mods and maps.Need to fix some servers with lag. "",1"
"587,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI don't play anymore, but still a VERY GOOD game for people that just got Steam. This is one of my first games and I loved it, and it's very good for ppl that love FPS. <3"",1"
588,WARMODE,2017.0,Early Access Reviewthis game hoooorrrible  the guns are bad your wasting 10minutes of your life just downloading and playing this game infact just looking at the title is a wast of time.,0
589,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access ReviewI like the old style simple graphics that will run on any machine.I like the simple gameplay and common game mechanics.I like the fact it's a free game and for an alpha actually it's quite playable.I wish in the future it gets some common/classic objective gametypes.Maps are currently too small. They should be at least 2 or 3 times larger.Definitely following the development of this game and hopefully they bring us something cool to play on a daily base.,1
"590,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's an okay game, i like it when i played it but it get's fairly boring sometimes with only like 4 maps. Good effort for a free game so it's a thumbs up from me."",1"
"591,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewThe hitboxes are bad, the crosshair doesn't move when you fire the gun,The accruracy is horrible and full of try hards and people who can't efford CS:GO,I highly reccomend Just buying CS:GO much better."",0"
"592,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is basically just a mixture of COD and CS:GO, Ironicly i like both games but this is just a... whats the word oh yeah, TRASH! Screwed up Physics = Dying for running to a teammate??!?,Why is there team collison and not enemy collison? and The worst thing is The â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Hitbox. the only good thing about this game are There are less Raging Russians and not p2w. 3/10"",0"
593,WARMODE,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThe servers are full of hackers and the gameplay is just a horrible experience.The weapons feel awful and the sounds are bad.Just a bad game please dont download it i isn't worth the 500MB.,0
"594,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI've tried this game and it is actually great :)Good things about it: It is similar to csgo, with the keybinding and stuff, ranking system, good aim and yea probably loads of other good stuff.Bad things: When you buy the armor which gives u 50 defense, then buy 25 defense one you get the 25 defense one and loses 50 which should be fixed imo (u should either get 75 or a windows appearing saying """"You already own this"""" etc :)Also when you die your weapon should drop and you have to re-buy them from the shop :) (makes the game more challening and fun :D)Although I know it's early access but still thanks for me :) great game still "",1"
595,WARMODE,2017.0,Early Access ReviewWorst game of the centuryWhere do I start! The graphics in this game are disgusting. The gameplay its self is so bad I considered whether the developers were just making the game to make a cheap buck or they had just given up on making games half-way through making this. The worst game of the century DON'T DOWNLOAD!2/10 Orizzonte Reviews  ,0
"596,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's really hard for me to get mad at a free to play game. Sure, this is far from being the best, but it is not the worst. It's not even bad, it's just a functional, pretty well done online shooter. If your looking for the same action as something like CS or TF2 you won't find it here, but what you will find is a pretty good free to play game. Also, this game gets two plus points: 1) All of the purchases don't unbalance the game, so you don't need to purchase anything. 2) It's actually being updated rather then cast to the side.Like I said, not the best game I've ever played, but certainly a good time waster and well worth it since it's free.I say give it a shot."",1"
"597,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is toxic, laggy, and the weapons are unbalanced, the guns that should be powerful are not, the ones that shouldnt be are, dont waste your time, just get csgo"",0"
598,WARMODE,2017.0,Early Access ReviewThis would be a very fun game except....there are even more hackers in this game than in CS:GO.>:( = my reaction when someone headshots everybody on my team with a sniper at the same time,0
"599,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is HORRIBLE. I played for 7 MINUTES and i was already dissapointed. My first game on and i was already getting killed by multiple hackers. Then i tried to play they're """"zombiematch"""" mode and as soon as i spawned, I FROZE. I couldnt move and i knew it wasnt a game freeze because people were still moving around. Awful game because of hackers, bugs, and glitches. One of the worst experiences of my life. 1/10"",0"
600,WARMODE,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI downloaded this game on a whim and because it was free. After playing for a bit I have found that this game is AMAZING! It's an easy to play and honestly really fun! It really just is a good time killer and enjoyable. It releases a lot of stress! Great game and I know it's only in a beta but this game is awesome!,1
"601,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game has a lot of potential. Granted it ripped off games like Counter Strike and Call of Duty but what people fail to understand is that it's a FREE TO PLAY. You can't expect original games like TF2 from every single free to play. As a free to play this game so far is decent. No pay to win aspects like literally every other free to play FPS game out there. Easy to run, easy to learn. For broke peasants that can't afford to buy good FPS games, this game is alright. Though so far there is absolutely no ping filtering for servers and it doesn't even show your ping in game. But it's early access, it's understandable"",1"
"602,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewPretty fun game, love how they mixed the buying system of CS and Call of Duty feel together. A few game breaking issues need to be fixed though. Hackers and latency. If this dev team can fix those two things then I will gladly come back and play on my free time. Overrall a fun casual game to play with friends."",1"
"603,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI like it but i dont ... is cool , a poor Call of Duty but if you get banned from CS:GO for like 7d or 1h , or you wanna waste some time . running sistem sux and your first game will sux as well , but when you get use whit it is pretty cool"",1"
604,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access ReviewI like this game a lot it has similar mechanics to counter strike and is a very easy game to run so theres a good player base my only problem is the maps. I like the maps its just the fact that enemy teams can camp in your base and just kill each person that spawns in I think a way that they counter this is by adding a feature so when you spawn in you are invincible for a certain amount of time so that the enemy would just waste bullets instead of gaing many kills.,1
605,WARMODE,2016.0,Early Access ReviewLadys and Gents...You are on the store page WARMODE *said in all caps*This game is the pinnacle of gaming! No other game lets me get spawn killed by a sniper better thanWARMODE *said screaming*No other game makes it so fun to camp behind a crate and wait for the enemy sniper to return just so i can shove my filthy nood knife in his poop hole... but wait! this isnt call of duty with just a normal melee system! This is...WARMODE *said screaming at the top of my lungs while thinking about cutting myself*No! Theres a 1/10 chance you score critical damage killing your enemie with one fell swoop! while the other attack is like hitting him with nerf sword lightly making him cry on the inside because he just realised how how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed  america is if Trump or Clinton wins this election! BUT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this is warmode*said really unenthusiastic because i just relised ive wasting less than an hour of my life playing this game and now i have to go talk to my doctor because i might have AIDS,0
606,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access Reviewok the game is ok its a 50 50 for me im not hating on the game the snipers i love ok just for i amzing but when you shot someone in the foot with no armour and they die that a little weird but still i like the snipers. 2 the hit detection is not the best but its ok for this game. 3 the price for some guns is really high and also you only get $300 if you get a normal kill and the same with a headshot so this game is a yes right now plus its free so you can get rid of the game if you do not like it so ye as long AS they do not make it pay then im happy.,1
"607,WARMODE,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewWell its ok Gameplay wise BUT the idea is so old that it feels like your playing DOOM but a worse version.It tried to copy Rainbow Six,CS 1.6 but failed.Overall Opinion:Its ok as a casual game to play but i wouldnt keep it in my account for long. Also my opnion might change since its in early access."",0"
"608,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is the best hardcore FPS shooter game that is free to play on steam. Would reccomend, just make sure that you can deal with a few hackers here and there. i give it 4 1/2 stars."",1"

"611,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewALOT OF FUN, this game have all the things counter strike GO should have I played only 25 minutes but I had more fun playing this game than counter strike in 160h"",1"
"612,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is amazing, it loads fast and the mechanics are amazing! if they would add skins for weapons and add characters and other add-ons it would even be more amazing!"",1"
"613,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is filled with nothing but lobbies of cheaters. Most people in game just complain about being put in a loby with a cheater, rather then vote to kick them, and when a vote is started, everyone votes not to kick the cheater, even though they're single handedly making the game worse for everyone. Even worse, from my perspective, it looks like the dev's don't even bother to bar them from playing, they just give them a sub name """"Cheater"""". Do yourself a favor and stay far from this game. Pros--Every map seems to be a retexture of old counterstrike maps. Pretty cool (even if it's bad)-Large and easily accesible gun library to mess with-Simple and easy controlsCons--Cheaters in every lobby-You get shot in the head a lot through the map-Angles control too much-Overprices crap weapons-Underpriced overpowered weapons-No one votes to kick the cheater-Your team will never win-Shader bugs in everymap make the fight one-sided-Like above con- Each map is sided towards the Warriors to win        -High ground and right turns with long tunnels to put a gunner downAs you can tell, I did not spend much time on this game due to the downsides provided above."",0"

"615,WARMODE,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is not original, fun, and or exciting. The game seems like an obvious CS:GO ripoff, and doesnâ€™t seem to stop copying CS:GOs motive. Too much loading times, terrible graphics, and too many hackers on it. So do I recommend it to people? The answer is... no and yes. Let me explain, if you are low on youâ€™re steam account and canâ€™t afford CS:GO. Then this would be the great alternative for you. But, if you already own CS:GO, itâ€™s not really recommend for you to play it. Since it already has the same motives and traits to CS:GO. But anyways, my final review score for this game is a 5.5/10 and hopefully the developers will improve these problems and add something different to the game. And take what I said in a mature and polite way. Remember this is just constructive criticism, I donâ€™t mean to upset or put anyone down in this review."",0"
"616,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is the worst/best game that I have ever playedPro: -Free to Play CS with COD features.-Not Pay to Win, most items are cosmetical.-Good way to grind time with friends.Cons:-Awful hit regrisation. -Weird Bugs (Ex: Getting close to a player will launch you in the air or die mysteriously).-Unbalanced gameplay-Dead MultiPlayer. Conclusion: It is a Mixture of CoD and CS with awful gameplay and bugs, a deformed baby of both parents."",0"
617,WARMODE,2016.0,Early Access ReviewWhere should i start... Well this game seem to be a knock off verison of CS-GO... It doesn't run smooth its a little laggy for the most part. It is just plan out the most dumbest game i ever played... Only best thing about this game is the Uninstall feature... DON'T GET THIS GAME AT ALL!!!,0
618,WARMODE,2016.0,Early Access ReviewA very good game to say the least. Aldoe graphicly it can be improved the gameplay is great.I would reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for a Free to Play FPS game which is fast pased as well as tactical.,1
"619,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is AMAZING. One of the best there is. All you have to do is as soon as the game starts pull out your knife and sprint to the enemy spawn and don't forget to hold down left click because screw ACTUALLY losing skill, the game is too messy to actually try. The only way to lose is to see a hacker or maybe someone else with a knife."",0"
"620,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is a great game for early access, I would recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of FPS games, it is fun, fast-paced and entertaining. The only few downsides to this game are the lack of european and/or british servers and  the lack of controller support.  I really like the concept that each match you need to purchase weapons with currency you gain from killing enemies, the only downside is the fact that everyone starts the match with 2000 and that defeats the point as you have enough to purchase a weapon. There also needs to be a party aspec in this game so you can join a party with your friends and start a match. I enjoy this game for what it is and I am excited for the changes that are added in it's developement in the early access stages."",1"
"621,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access Review""""Spawn Camping Simulator""""This gave is very derpy and broken in many ways. This game can be fun, and its nice to mess around, but overall, its a crap game, even if its early acess. It feels like its trying to be a cs:go but is no where near it. All the graphics are really low poly so it can run on any computer."",0"

"626,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you have a better PC than, you can probably run this better than me.Except, if you do have a better PC, you're probably better off playing other games.Doesn't look like P2W from what i can tell after playing for less than a hour(unlike RCF)."",0"
"627,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewI recomend this game just because almost every computer can run it. My computer is very slow, but this game works perfectly fine. It's also really fun and addictive. If you don't have enough money to buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive,  this is the best game for you. Go and play the game!"",1"
"628,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewMy main rant about this game is that the servers are awfully Desynced. The lag the servers give is painful and can make your time playing this game at the up most annoying, However apart from the server issues this game is great so far.Worth quickly patching and having a go!Pros:- Simple GUI- Free 2 Play (No pay to win features atm)- Great gun collection- Simple and fun like counter strike- Easy 2 Run!Cons:- Poor server hosting-  Can get boring fairly quickly- Spawn killing is the kidz thing- May cause bursts of range due to DSync "",1"
"629,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewHave you ever gazed upon something so perfect, so beautiful that simply to sit in its aura gave you impossible strength and love? Is this something you hope to feel in the near future? For me, Warmode was that and more. Before Warmode I was sad, depressed, and alone. After years of being laughed at in CSGO I was about to uninstall Steam. I left my friends my uninstall note, when I recieved a message of light and hope - """"get warmodeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"""" Since then, I have become immersed in the amazing teamplay, unique guns, and well polished maps. The economic system scales incredibly well in Skirmish matches, and the guns are so well balanced that it appears as if years were taken to get them just go. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I would pay 60 dollars for this because this is an AAA release at heart. "",1"
"630,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWARMODE is the poor man's Call of Duty, with elements of Counter-Strike. The idea might've been cool on paper, but just wait. Wait for the endless headshots to roll in, and make money at the rate of McDonald's frycook."",0"
"631,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is fun in an ironic way. It's really poorly designed, and the movement feels absolutely terrible, but I still had some fun playing this with a friend. The gunplay wasn't bad, but I didn't enjoy the movement. Also I hated that I couldn't change my crouch button to shift (what I've always used). The best part is that there is no pay to win issue at all, since you can buy guns with points in every match. I'd only recommend this game to someone who wants to have some (ironic) fun, preferably with friends. People are really bad in this game, so once you get a rifle/smg you can basically kill anyone."",1"
"632,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewGame has slippery, laggy mouse aiming. This is usually a vsync thing, but turning vsync off both ingame and in my GPU control panel didn't fix the issue. I hear coil whine so I'm pretty sure it's not vsync.Despite being pretty minimalistic and both looking and feeling like an alpha, the game actually has a pretty nice feel as a brainless run and gun shooter but loose mouse aiming makes it unplayable."",0"
"633,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI want to recommend this game because it in its self is a fun game. However there are many draw backs.Pros:- It runs (automatically better than most free to play games)- Has a lot of potential- A Counter Strike sort of gameplay for those who enjoy that (buy gear at the beginning with credits, get kills for credits, etc.)- VERY fast paced gameplay and heavily relies on reaction to events.- [This is an opinion for me] Small maps work very well for this game, they're no larger than a Counter Strike or Call of Duty map. Cons: - No unlocking or loot system, only items in game are cosmetics bought with real money. (Nothing expensive, most items are $1 or $2, but the point still stands) - Game disconnects from matches 75% of the time, forcing the user to loose all credit towards their next rank they gained that match- VERY unbalanced. Certain guns rule the game and others are useless. The SPAS-12 shotgun is one of if not the best gun and you can buy it with the credits you get when you start the match. Also many guns are over powered, under powered, bad aim, too good aim, etc. The shotguns can only hit up to about 5 yards and if its not point blank then its ~1 damage. The pistols have no recoil giving those who are good with them or hackers (more on that later) a very easy chance. The assault rifles are crap, bad recoil, large cone of fire, damage regarding range is bad (AK's give more damage at 10 yards than an M4 Carbine)- Clipping errors. The models and entities clipped into eachother often.- Headshots. This one sounds like a pro but its not, the head hitboxes on a player are massive, Making nearly every shot you take a headshot and an instant kill. - Lag. I know you'd think a game thaat doesnt require much of a computer and only a 200mb download wouldn't lag much but it seems you're wrong. Certain guns when fired cause small lags spikes as if the audio, animation, and effects have never been precached or loaded at all. Then shooting them again causes the same lag like its loading it brand new again causing the fast paced gameplay to be choppy and ultimately make you loose. - Hackers. Good lord the hackers. It's mostly small children aimbotting with the starting pistol. Normally that would be fine but considering 2 of the other cons  mentioned. that pistol is a 1 hit kill when its a headshot (even if you have the max armor upgrasde which doubles your health) and  the head hitboxes are enormous. That being said they instantly kil you. THIS GAME NEEDS AN ANTI-CHEAT BADLYAll in all I'd probably say a 5/10 with tons of room for improvement and a lot of potentional. If the devs fix those cons and bugs, and implement a working anti-cheat of some sort (this is none of right now) then I can see my review changing to positive and my time spent playing this game going up drastically, maybe even buying some items from the ingame store."",0"
"634,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI own Source and GO and I still think this game is fun, sure it might be a knock off but its sure fun to play for â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and giggles. I mean the guns are stupid OP and the movement is pretty jank, the point of games is to have fun and I think people would have more fun playing a glitchy game and laughing at the random stuff that happens in it rather than a less glitchy game with better gameplay. Overall its just too much fun to run around and knife people in the face or AWP them from unfair spots."",1"
"635,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewHoly balls. Bear in mind, this is from someone who doesn't normally like fps's, and even though I suck, this is one of the most fun games I've played. Andâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s sake it's free. What more do you need?"",1"
"636,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewEnglish:This game is actually pretty fun! It does not have decent graphics and weapon recoils are pretty much non-existence, but jumping into the game and messing up with enemies did bring me a lot of joy. This is a F2P game so do not expect it has AAA title's quality. Ingame store is pretty much useless since you can have access to all weapons in game and all you need to do is to accumulate money by killing enemies. There are only masks and badges in store and they won't affect statistics whatsoever.

"637,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewAlright, another f2p first person shooter. After an hour of playing i can say, this game is pretty fun, the only problems being the spawns on certian maps (Sewers having the best spawns honestly) and the guns are varied, literally the best thing you hope for is a clear sight apreture. The only paying part of the game is $0.99 masks for either side, that being the ONLY thing that requires real money. The servers could be a bit better, but are for the most part stable. I hope to get more maps, i think attachments and extra weapons would be a nice touch. Other than that, a solid free game that i no doubt will enjoy.I recommend this as a nice casual shooter for you and your friends, and Don't worry about servers, there's like 300+ servers."",1"

Looks good.- Hear about Frankie?- Yeah.- You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going.Everybody knows,sting someone, you die.Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead.I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way.I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day.That's why we don't need vacations.Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances.- Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are!- Bee-men.- Amen!Hallelujah!Students, faculty, distinguished bees,please welcome Dean Buzzwell.Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of......9:15.That concludes our ceremonies.And begins your careerat Honex Industries!Will we pick ourjob today?I heard it's just orientation.Heads up! Here we go.Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times.- Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary.Welcome to Honex,a division of Honescoand a part of the Hexagon Group.This is it!Wow.Wow.We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole lifeto get to the point where youcan work for your whole life.Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive.Our top-secret formulais automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contouredinto this soothing sweet syrupwith its distinctivegolden glow you know as...Honey!- That girl was hot.- She's my cousin!- She is?- Yes, we're all cousins.- Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly striveto improve every aspectof bee existence.These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology.- What do you think he makes?- Not enough.Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman.- What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honeythat hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions.Oan anyone work on the Krelman?Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees knowthat every small job,if it's done well, means a lot.But choose carefullybecause you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life.The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that.What's the difference?You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day offin 27 million years.So you'll just work us to death?We'll sure try.Wow! That blew my mind!""""What's the difference?""""How can you say that?One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make.I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life.But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that?Why would you question anything?We're bees.We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth.You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here?Like what? Give me one example.I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about.Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach.Wait a second. Oheck it out.- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow.I've never seen them this close.They know what it's likeoutside the hive.Yeah, but some don't come back.- Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks!You guys did great!You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!- I wonder where they were.- I don't know.Their day's not planned.Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what.You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that.Right.Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime.It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it.Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it.Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too?Distant. Distant.Look at these two.- Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them.It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock.Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom!He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me!- Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out.What were you doing during this?Trying to alert the authorities.I can autograph that.A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades?Yeah. Gusty.We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow.- Six miles, huh?- Barry!A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it.- Maybe I am.- You are not!We're going 0900 at J-Gate.What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough?I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means.Hey, Honex!Dad, you surprised me.You decide what you're interested in?- Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one.Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day?Son, let me tell you about stirring.You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around.You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing.You know, Dad,the more I think about it,maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me.You were thinking of what,making balloon animals?That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger.Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey!- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny.You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer!- You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me!Wait till you see the sticks I have.I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!Let's open some honey and celebrate!Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae.Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody """"dawg""""!I'm so proud.- We're starting work today!- Today's the day.Oome on!

"644,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewEnglish:This game is actually pretty fun! It does not have decent graphics and weapon recoils are pretty much non-existence, but jumping into the game and messing up with enemies did bring me a lot of joy. This is a F2P game so do not expect it has AAA title's quality. Ingame store is pretty much useless since you can have access to all weapons in game and all you need to do is to accumulate money by killing enemies. There are only masks and badges in store and they won't affect statistics whatsoever. Check this out if you want to kill some time or find some free games to dig in.ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡ï¼šæ¯›å­åšçš„æ¸¸æˆï¼ŒæŒºæœ‰æ„æ€çš„ã€‚è™½ç„¶ç”»é¢ä¸å’‹åœ°è€Œä¸”æ­¦å™¨åŽåº§åŠ›åŸºæœ¬ä¸å­˜åœ¨ï¼Œä½†æ˜¯è¿›æ¸¸æˆåŽ»è™è™æ­ªæžœä»è¿˜æ˜¯æŒºå¥½çŽ©çš„ã€‚æ¯•ç«Ÿæ˜¯å…è´¹æ¸¸æˆæ‰€ä»¥ä¸è¦æœŸå¾…å®ƒä¼šæœ‰3Aå¤§ä½œçš„è´¨é‡ã€‚æ¸¸æˆå†…å•†åŸŽåŸºæœ¬å°±å’Œæ²¡æœ‰ä¸€æ ·ï¼Œæ‰€æœ‰æ­¦å™¨åœ¨åˆå§‹æ—¶éƒ½å·²ç»ç»™äº†ï¼Œä½ è¦åšçš„å°±æ˜¯åœ¨æ¸¸æˆé‡Œæ€äººèµšé’±ä¹°å¥½æžªã€‚å•†åŸŽé‡Œåªæœ‰åç‰‡å¾½ç« å’Œé¢å…·ï¼Œç„¶è€Œè¿™äº›å¹¶ä¸ä¼šå½±å“äººç‰©å’Œæ­¦å™¨å±žæ€§ã€‚å¦‚æžœæƒ³æ‰“å‘æ—¶é—´æˆ–è€…æ‰¾ç‚¹å…è´¹æ¸¸æˆçŽ©çš„è¯ï¼Œè¿™æ¬¾æ¸¸æˆè¿˜æ˜¯æŒºå¥½çš„ã€‚"",1"
"645,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's all about shooting, and a bit of teamwork so it would be a good game, if the hackers got banned or something like that.BTW not bad, 696969 fps on comodor69, free, 400mb etc... "",1"
"646,WARMODE,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewUntil they implement something like VAC don't even bother with this game.Every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing time I go the the server there's at least one cheater in my or enemy team and worst part that you can't even kick them. Apperently there's a flag system that you could vote on, but srsly how many hours or days he will be hacking until those flags will be acounted? And even  if thatâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥will get banned he will be back in 5 seconds with a new steam account, since it's free to play.Devs at least add a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing kick option, you must clearly autistic.....Another option is to make a game non free to play, like at least 5$ or something.Other than problem with hackers, game has some potential."",0"
"647,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is actually a pretty good game, although there are alot of hackers which make it less fun. But recently I've noticed alot of people turning against hackers and leaving them in empty lobbies. But its very fun, pretty easy, the poor man's csgo. Would definitely recommend, just beware of hackers."",1"
"648,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWarmode is the most hella dank F2P shooter available at the market today.The game includes such awesome weaponry.The physics engine is like nothing you have ever seen!Counter Strike, Call of Duty, Battlefield, forget that nonsense, get yourself Warmode and join the fun today!!!!!!"",1"
"649,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's time for a pros and cons =)Pros#1:Most people are friendly, hardly ever get the kid that rages over getting killed too much#2:It's not pay to win like most """"Free"""" games#3:Every game starts off fresh, So the person who has played for months doesnt get an advantage at the start#4:Control feels smooth.Cons#1:Hackers... Some hackers are somewhat decent though... atleast let you get some kills in, they just want a rage finish usually, I have not seen a hacker that has stayed more then 15 minutes... ignore them, They leave... They have fun listening to you rage... Best bet is just to ignore them, they usually go to another server looking for the kid that rages.#2:No Vote ban, I know people abuse this... but vote ban is a good thing to have...#3:Can't host your own server.========================Overall...If you are mature and don't mind a troll hacker every now and then... It's free.... It's not that big of a game... Try it...."",1"

652,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access ReviewPretty good game to play not to long of a download and shooter's can go a long way this just makes it plain and simple.Very good game to pass the time with if you like quick shooters.,1
653,WARMODE,2017.0,Early Access ReviewI don't know if this game is still like this but my experience was purely awful it is an average fps nothing new with not to-new graphics but I hate this game I give it 5/10,0
654,WARMODE,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis is one of my favorite FPS of steam this one has good grafics guns and fine maps.This game dont have hackers well all game has hackers this one is realistic so you die with a headshot.But the gamer ists very good,1
"655,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIt to be honest is not that bad, its the buggy gameplay that is bad. i could only run the gam in windowed mode or it would run at a solid 5 fps, and i dont have a terrible computer, naw im joking â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥dawg"",0"
"656,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewLike CS:GO, but for free, and without the nonsense of recoil patterns. Surprisingly good graphics as well. Could be more active, especially outside of deathmatch."",1"
"657,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewCounter Strike for casuals with down syndrome, people get stuck in mid air and soldiers occasionally load their guns with fluffy marshmellows instead of bullets. 11/10 game of the year"",1"
658,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access ReviewGood game for free but...Could be played instead of CS:GO as a free filler for it but there are things that need to be improved on and also added to this game for overall better experience. Also Submachine gun is mispespelled as submachune gun in game. But overall IMO it is a fun game.,1
"659,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewOkay, so obviously this game is receiving alot of unecessary hate. Look people, it's an EARLY ACCESS GAME, so bugs like the frequent headshots despite shooting someone in the balls will most likely be fixed.This a great game. It's gonna run on pretty much anything, the graphics are nice, and the best part is... IST KOSTENLOS!!!!!!! "",1"
660,WARMODE,2016.0,Early Access Reviewi actullay really enjoy this game. its really fun to play on my laptop and even on my main computer. the game isn't perfect however i belive its a really fun arcadey kinda game :).,1
"661,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWarnode is a free to play game that is a FPS sort of like a CounterStrike clone.  It is PVP only.  It worked, played ok, sounded ok, looked ok, was mostly understandable.  Might be from Russian developer.  Has server system so no matchmaking, they are 16 vs 16. CONS: -Has hackers playing, and have no anti-hacking scanner.   - Didn't see a ping meter on server and playing.  -There is some russian words still this english localization.  -No tutorial, help or hints.Try it, but there are better games out there for free.

"662,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewA really bad game, Ok not so much but mostly. First off this game is decent for a free game. Heres why I dont recommend it. The community is filled with hackers you will probably not see a lobby without a hacker. This game is trash honestly due to its rude and awful community (Yes Im aware there are nice people in all communities but this game is filled with stupid people)"",0"

"664,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAwesome game. Sad thing is when you join you have to use in game points or whatever to buy the guns. the more kills you get the better guns you can get, altjhough you must restart buying them again every round it makes a solid statement and adds a little more uniqueness. most people are hating and giving this game mixed reviews because of their lack of knowledge with FPS games. just about any player that has any FPS experience whatsoever can jump in and kick some serious @ss and all the players getting r@ped come and make that huge commitment to make that negative review as they cry into their keyboard. rarely few have issues with this game. ive heard of _authorization issue but only like 1/20 will actually have this issue.Pros : 1 - Good, Smooth FPS Gameplay2 - Free To Play (For people who dont wanna drop their bank on CSGO when other games can compete at it!)3 - Nice Menu4 - Not bad loading times5 - EXTREMELY easy to kick @ss atCons : 1 - Spawn Shield lasts way too long2 - Pretty decent amount of weapons but their could be more3 - Small Maps4 - Whining Peple in dozens complaining about hackers everywhere (which are just good players, not hackers)Also i have been called a hacker so many times its drilled into my head by now. only thing is that all i play is FPS games 24/7. games like Arma3, Battlefield 4/3, Destiny, etc. So basically i just got alot of experience and i can run in and kick @ss and everyone gets butthurt when i get that 14/1 K/D and then dedicated a review to people just like me. dont listen to people like that. And if your an easy whiner i dont think this is the game for you. but anyone else should jump in and if your good at it just wait for the hate spam of noobs in the chat XD"",1"
"665,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game? Where do i even start. Maybe the part where i cant get past the authorization loading screen, so i cant actually play the game.

Maybe if they fix the problem then the game might be alright but for know this game isnt very good!!!!"",0"
"666,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewDustforce truly is a work of art. I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level. Another thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.Overall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:10/10BUY THIS GAME."",1"

"669,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewI want to reccommend this game. I really do.Sad thing is the servers are all located in Russia. So my lag is really really bad.(If they add servers, like Asian ones. I'd probably enjoy this game more.)The graphics are fine, and i really see the POTENTIAL for this to be a great f2p.(unless they make it a game you should buy, which i am not sure about.)If, and maybe if. The Developers fix some things (Like the ugh, text buy menu), get a better anticheat (maybe?)I want to be able to play this again in the future.

"671,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is very interesting to me it's not TOO bad but it is still enjoyable, they try to copy the concept of cs:go but they really ruined it though there lots of hackers, empty servers, and lot's of glitches, it is still fun to play for example: If you find an empty server 1v1 your friend! There are also many glitches that I mentioned earlier and also those you can mess around with and try to find new glitches! and for the hacking part just do a 1v1 with hacks, like hacker versus hacker.

Quite frankly i would rate this game 9/10 but really it kinda more deserves a 0.33/7 due to it beeing sold in all countries except for europe.

"673,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewSimple Indie shooter. Really rough around the edges but its playable. Warmode itself is really generic, but if thats not a problem for you and you are interested in playing a rough around the edges shooter like this, more power to you.

"676,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThere are no hackers, you guys just lag!it is actually a helarious game!!It's basically CounterStrike but with smaller maps and faster gameplay!It is really funny, for example:If you touch the crates you could actually die!by the time you have 8000 to buy the Heavy mechine guns the game is about to finish!if you want to run eventhough you have a heavy weapon just scroll to the handgun XD"",1"
677,WARMODE,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is worse than actual garbage. A majority of the weapons do not do anything at all and you're better off running with a knife around the map. The hit boxes are so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed that you walked over people. There is 1 weapon worth buying in this whole game: The ASVAL. If you buy anything else you're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing disabled. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless you're 12 and you're not brave enough to steal your mom's credit card to buy Counter-Strike. The game is just a plain rip-off of it. One of the maps is literally a section of a dust_2 and the devs were so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing lazy they just said â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it and closed B halls off and made a TDM map.,0
"678,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI threw this on because it was free to play. I was expecting it to be kind of a joke of a game. Luckily, I was super surprised.This game is fun as hell. I had a blast playing this. The game was lacking music though which made it too silent.The controls for this game so far I would have to say are pretty damn good. Graphics could use polish, but it's early access so it's doable.It's not pay to win, the paid content seems to be cosmetic only from what I could see. The game mode I played was called Skirmish and it was fun stuff.I recorded when I was first trying out the game so if you like first impression videos check this out.https://youtu.be/DCT2-BiBpdkI would recommend this because I had lots of fun and it is free to play. Hopefully we'll see some nice updates in the fear future."",1"
"679,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIn the short time I played this game, Me and my friends noticed Factory is a rip off of Dust 2 from Counter Strike Global Offensive. Also the engine has a critical issue of lag. When you press a button on mouse or keyboard there is an extreme delay between the button being pressed and what actually happens on screen. Also, the maps are spawn trap city. PLEASE update the spawn system in this game. We were able to spawn trap VERY easily. These are game breaking issues that need to be addressed.. AND for the fact that they copied Dust 2 is just the last straw."",0"
"680,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access Reviewthis game is trying to copy counter strike series. it copyed some of the maps like dust2 and most of the weapons is similar to cs but the gameplay and the game mechanic is terrible and its not worth playing. i know its still in beta but just by playing a few matches heres what i found, you can just buy a ump and top score in your team because i dont know y but every one playing this game is acting like bots until someone accually said something then i know their not bots and all ou can buy from the shops is masks(which change how you charecters face looks and badges and they all cost 99cents each!so this game is not worth the time, theres alot of other free to play games that is wayyy more better than this"",0"

"683,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game looks pretty good in the store, but the maps are boring, and the guns barely do any damage, this means that the AWP (The one shot sniper) and the Deagle (The most powerful gun) are extremely op, meaning that buying anything else is just piontless, overall a pretty bad game.Don't install, after 5 minutes of Play time, ur gonna wan't to uninstall.."",0"

"685,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's just a knock off CS:GO, which is not right, what this really does it just influences people to believe that this game is supposedly better than CS:GO, but it fails because it has spawn camp which CS:GO doesnt have (only in warmup). Overall, this game is just a waste of time because you can somehow kill yourself with your own knife which is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and that you cannot join a server without being spawn camped or killed."",0"
"686,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game has potential(Like Advanced Warfare did). The armor should do something, nerf the ARs, buff shotgun damage, and make it so headshots aren't one shot with any gun."",1"

"688,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe movement is buggy, crouching is buggy, the mouse movement is laggy and feels non-responsive. The servers suck, the UI is trash and the community is whining about hackers all the time (most of it is just lag from my experience). The guns are ridiculously op, the spawns are broken, there are angles that provide immense advantage (others players can't shoot you), there is no need for iron sights. However, I had loads of fun playing this game. Headshotting from 2km away with a pistol is satisfying. The game is really small in size and for the time being it is truly f2p. I like the point system to buy guns but I think you should be able to gain points over time. Also more options should be implemented (FOV slider for example). The game needs a lot of work but it has the potential to have something going for it as far as I am concerned. Overall, I thought the game was fun and I could oversee the flaws. I recommend it if you want to pass some free time. In the future I might revisit it and maybe change my recommendation but for the time being this game is fairly fun."",1"
"689,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewTried to give this game a shot, however the only thing I was able to access was the menu upon opening the game. There are only about 8 active RU servers (span out across a large number of """"channels"""") and they're all 16/16 players. Trying to get into one of these in the extremely rare occurrence that there's a slot open gives a blank splash screen which goes back to the menu. Trying to join any empty server (and there are tons of them) does the same thing"
"690,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access Reviewi really like this game it has alot of potential and it did feel like a bit of a stalker multiplayer clone but that was the reason i liked it, please add more stalker weapons and maps also please add more options"",1"
"691,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFor one hour of gameplay, I have to say this FPS has a lot of potential, with many pros and cons. The server that I have played on seems a bit laggy and that's acceptable for an early access game in my opinion, with the simple HUD and basic concepts of this game, I got right into the game for an hour straight. Although the servers were not completely full so about 4 people on each team. At first I thought you had to buy a weapon each time you died e.g. Counter Strike, that's the only thing that took me a few moments to realize that when you buy guns, armor, and other items that you spawn with them for the rest of the game. I also feel that people need to start playing or at least trying this game for a week considering it's in early access and does not need 30GB of space to play which is great in my opinion. Overall rating is a solid 7.5/10."",1"
"692,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewHonestly, there is a bug where it gets stuck on the authorization screen, but sometimes you just need to refresh the game. It is a very fun game after that. There may be a lot of hackers, but sometimes there is not. I fully recomend this game if you do not have enough money for CSGO or Call of Duty"",1"

"695,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access Review     Well the idea of this game is great. It has unique features and has good graphics for a free game. In fact, I would say that this is a pretty awesome FPS game and I usually hate FPS games. But notice how I said WOULD... Thats because although the game is there, the most important things for an FPS game to have aren't! What I mean by that is half of the time your bullets damage an enemy and half of the time they don't. Also the assist system is so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bad that I cant even comprehend it. But my favorite flaw, other than all of the maps being as big as my bathroom, is the random suicide deaths. I'll just be standing there and out of nowhere I die and it says I was killed by me. Now I cant for the life of me figure out what is causing this, it's just completely random.     I really hope that this game is in its beta because it is so close to being a great game. All the game makers need to do is add a North American Channel for servers and fix the major bugs involoved with causing damage, the assist system, add larger maps, and fix the kill system. I would recommend that you try the game for 30 minutes tops and then delete it. I feel that you will agree with me that this game has potential, it just needs some major fixes."",1"
"696,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewPeople who downvoted this game, ITS IN EARLY ACESS. That means things will change, they will implement things better, add new things, make it fun, ya know? I put only 3.6 hours into it and i already find it quite fun. Let me break down the game a bit and what I think are the pros and cons of this game so far:PROS:Great graphics for an early acess! They are amazing for a free to play shooter!Gameplay is fast-paced, very fun.The gun selection is quite nice, although some, like the AK47 and the AUG need a bit of balancing.CONS:The teams can get out of balance incredibly quick. it could be a 3v1 and I have seen games as far away as 5v2. Although I have seen some good players, they aren't that good.The semiauto shotgun is a bit op, as it does a lot of damage from a farther range you are used to.There is only one game mode at the moment. Even though it is still an amazing game for early access, one game mode puts me off a bit.Most of the weapons you can get a tapshoot kill with, which is dissapointing, because i would rather have only a few weapons that that can one hit kill, which would mean balancing out all of the assault rifles, and balancing up the smgs.All in all, a great game for early acess. Recommend it for experienced gamers. Great job WARTEAM!"",1"

"698,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you wanted to play free to play games, this one, don`t even bother playing it.This is a game where """"developer"""" try to imitate Counter-Strike games but failed horriblely,And they dare to add the most useless, and unworthly microtransaction. Only they selling is just """"A"""" skin.Skin that I mention is """"Skin"""" of a gun, """"Emblems"""", and of course """"Masks.""""Thats it? Thats what you can do on the Microtransaction? Super useless piece of item and dare to sell at $0.99 each?So its complete useless Microtransaction, so how about the game?Its a 2 Gamemode only, Skrimish, and Elimination.Skirmish is similar to Team-Deathmatch, only this here, is a bad Skirmish game, Elimination is idk vs idk Counter-Strike rip-off. Balancing Team is complete stupid and frequent unbalanced team.Guns are just a Ho-hum guns, everything looks pale and boring to shoot, it feels weird when shooting something, and its not like other shooting games, where you found it """"fun"""" to shoot at, here is zero fun. I didn`t enjoy at all, P90 why u too nub to shoot, Shotgun, why u too op, M249, why u 1 shot kill player and why super expensive to buy? Why, all weapon damage feels imbalanced and i didn't find any favorable gun that i like to use. Except shotgun, which is super effective.Server is only in 3 """"Channels"""", where player need to join the channels room to play, but I found out this is very familiar.Is this a developer from 3D Blockade? Server was laggy, have super buggy state of art, super buggy of poor net code. For me, at least on Asia. I probably realized this was hosted on Russia. Right. I also died by myself, is that poor net code for me?Hackers, yeah. It has, but is it hackable without ban? Yeah. No one give a damn about banning a person. You can`t even kick player, is it majority of the player who vote will win? No, no one will win if someone """"vote"""" no on purpose of gaining winning. Ban VAC? Who gives a shyt, no one get ban.Graphics are just meh, but sound design is awful, its like they fked up the whole sound library. There`s no voice actor or any voice from this game, there`s no Hit detection where you getting hitted by enemy. Its like incomplete release.And lastly, did I mention the game have """"Leveling"""" system... talk about the """"useless"""" leveling system ever created? You gain EXP by winning a game. So what it does for EXP? Nothing. Yeah nothing. Zero functionality in EXP. Except unlocking skin which requires you 0.99$ to buy????Seriously this game, even though ppl recommended this game, I despite everything this game yet to offer. Even though its Free, you may thinking, Free is the reason why you set """"Yes"""" as a good game, unfortunately, like me itself, I feel like I need to play other game instead. I say a lot of free games like Blackshot is even better than this, even a game like Crazy Shooter Online is 20 times better, this game isn`t. Its just a garbage game.There`s nothing to offer, there`s nothing that can redeem enjoyable, there`s zero factors of entertaining yourself, there`s zero communities, there`s zero calories and fats that can be burn on this game, mean factor of losing fats is no longer exist in this game and you can't even excersice on this game. I just can`t, I just wanted more biceps for playing a Shooter games. In the end, games sucks. Go play other free game instead.(2/10)"",0"
"699,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI actually like this game, its not bad to its core. It just has ALOT of issues that need to bet dealt with. The servers need ping counters.

"713,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWarmode is an arcadey shooter similar to the Call of Duty or Battlefield franchise. It features a selection of game modes, maps and weapons. The player base is decent, if mostly Russian, due to the developers being Russian, and the game as a whole is built in Unity.  What Warmode brings to the table is pure simplicity. It has low requirements, under 1GB for space and it's 99% free. Only thing you can buy here are some masks, but they're only cosmetic and are a way of supporting the developers.   The game, however is full of bugs, broken mechanics and hackers. It isn't a very good substitute for any of the paid competitive shooters. Checking it out costs nothing, but it has nothing to offer either."",0"

"731,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewMy thoughts about WARMODE so farPros:Holyshit is it alot of funThe map design/equipment destroys campersThe guns have SOME recoil, not like Counterstrike and not really like Call Of Duty but I feel its a mix of bothreminds of Crossfire but its not pay to win (yet)Basicly no loading, its just from one game to another in about 5-10 seconds.No gun is WAY overpowered. depending on the cost, you get what you pay for. (with ingame money)One of the maps makes me miss cod4 (best cod imo)Generic but realistic looking gunsNot exactly next-gen graphics, as a matter of fact they kind of look scetchy but i feel this is part of the games charm, so it belongs in prosCons:I dont think theres an anti-cheat, so game is flooded with cheaters, though avoiding them is easy, its still annoyingHopefully more game mods, more servers for every region (except russia) and pre-game lobbing would be a nice edition.Small maps, i thought of putting this is pros because i absolutely love it since its very instant action but most people dislike it, if you dont like small maps i dont think this game is for youIts in Alpha, i hate early stage game. even though this game does fine for my taste i cant help but feel like the developers dont know where they want this game to go, its kind of just out there for now"",1"
"732,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewLearn how to develop a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game. Guns are weak as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, inaccurate, and overall dont even respectfully resemble the guns to their rightful stats. on top of that, learn how to make a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hack shield, every lobby i entered was aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hacks left and right, from aimbot, to insta headshot hacks, to invincibility/godmode hacks. Honestly, ban the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hackers, learn how the guns ACTUALLY â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing work, and all in all, learn how to develop a game that doesnt include aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥fest of hackers, unreliable guns, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ 'Aiming' and crouching keys. I shouldnt have to hold crouch just to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sit crouched. Again i say, learn how to develop a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing game before you send it out into the public without a hackshield or any sort of protection in the game itself. It literally bothers me because without these underlying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t issues, the game was actually decent, aside from accuracy and hackers back to back. Fix these issues and im sure the game will do much better instead of being a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing breeding ground for hackers and lag switchers."",0"

"734,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game strongly reminds me of AS-VAL gun, don't know why. It also reminds me of yet another CSGO rip-off, that, yeah, isn't wasting your money, but is wasting your time."",0"
"735,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWARMODEThis is a quiet good first game from WARTEAM. This game has its ups and downs, but in this review, I would not judge this game too harshly. This is an online FPS game. A great range/variety of weapons to buy to use against the dangerous enemies. What I find is that the damage the weapons do is not that much, unless you get headshots. But like I said this is WARTEAM's first game and they should keep on trying. Speaking of the developers, they should really keep an eye on this game and do updates/patches.There are a couple of good maps. But the map that really catches my eye, is the one that they ripped off of Counter-Strike. Developers, if you are reading this, I wouldnt recommend to rip off maps from other games because you may get copyright strikes and negetive reviews because you ripped the map off. But I see that you made a couple mps of your own and I quiet like them.The last time I got onto this game, the multiplayer was dead. In patches/updates try putting something into the game that make the game even more entertaining, like more game modes, for example.Overall, I think these developers should keep on trying to update/create games, keep up the good work!7.2/10 "",1"

"769,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWhat can I say? Its a COD and CSGO clone, only worse. I cant imagine what they were thinking. Releasing this god forsaken game, even in beta, to the public. Its full of everything that COD and CSGO have. Head Glitchers, Spawncampers (The spawns are preset, and they can shoot you when you spawn, no protection besides 2 seconds of invincibility), and terrible hit boxes. The hit boxes are really wonky, I have to aim at their feet in long range gun fights to hit them. And it gives me a headshot. I dont know what they were thinking with this game. I know for a fact they are adding, or have already added microtransactions. This is a cheap way for them to make easy money. With the popularity of Call Of Duty, and CSGO combined, this will of course gain popularity. I just hope people make smart choices in not investing in this game, for it will increase theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥list games that have made aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ton of money! so please, dont bother with this game, or you will cause a plague that will make the game industry go hay-wire."",0"

"771,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewEh..with the game being in early access I pretty much expected bugs,etc. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy this game,but this game needs quite a bit of improvement.First off,we need better servers or at least be able to see what the ping on the server is,i'm annoyed with entering in to a server and it lagging quite hard on me time to time and going back to smooth,etc.What ever you do,DON'T aim down your sights! I experimented with it and when I was aiming at an enemy with my iron sights right on the person just to see all my bullets flying up in to the sky shooting the roof of the building. So you might as well just shoot from the hip.If you get shot in the head with any gun pretty much,you'll fall over dead every time,so if you run across a hacker.aimbotter there is gonna be no way to exactly even be able to get enough time to even kill them,besides the fact this game has a spawn kill element in it,Though on the bright side,at least it isn't P2W and you get a large variety of guns,but you just need to be able to get plenty enough kills to earn the money in order to have the guns you want,as my personal favourite is the ASVAL. So despite the lag and spawn kill element,the game can be quite fun and possibly have potential in the near future..so I guess I can recomend it,I atleast had a lil bit of fun on the game. "",1"

"779,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI have no idea why the dev released this game in this state. its broken. period. weapons are not balenced. serers are extreamly laggy. the only redeaming quality is the fact that even though this game features a store, you cant buy anything that puts pure free player at a disatvantage. Was this game fun? yes it was. does that mean its a good game? no.-=Gameplay=-This game makes me think of counter-strike and COD had a baby and somehow that god aweful game Combat Arms also came in. It plays alot like Counter-Strike, you only get weapons by killing other players and getting points. But the problem lies in the fact that the servers are so laggy you cant ever get a kill. not to mention aiming seems to be slightly off when you use your aim down sights. there is only 1 U.S server and for the most part my connection to each server remained crap. Now dont get me wrong, i did enjoy some of the matches. but its hard to denie this game has alot of flaws that quite honestly are un-exseptable. The maps feel bland. you can see obvious choke points and sections where most players are going to be. but these highly populated areas are the only place there tends to be any action. Spawn camping is another big problem. if the enemy team has more players you can bet your gonna get spawn camped. -=Sound=-The game tends to be glitchy at times. the guns also dont sound all that amazing. the music you here when you start up the game is nice. but after that is all guns. and thats fine...if the guns were nice to hear. -=Community=-With this being a pure online based game i have to adress community. the community is....there. but its not booming. i havent seen too much """"hacker"""" name calling while in a game as of late. but when thegame was first released, it was somthing you saw alot.-=Free or Pay2Win=-This game does feature a store so the dev can get alittle cash dollar. but theres no guns,ammo,or anything that would make it pay 2 win. what is there is slight cosmetic gear. such as face pain and masks. -=Graphics=-The graphics are not anything new, exciteing, or all that special. but they are not the worst. i can deal with the graphics if the gameplay is good. -=Final verdict=-This game is fun, and with more work could be great. but at its current state i just cant reccomend it. the only way i would recomend this game is if there was some way to host your own servers/games and let others join. that would atleast help with the god aweful conection quality of the current servers. The Final verdict is a 3.75/5.0 (okay)"",0"
"780,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewRight now the game is buggy, unpolished, etc. But with a bit of work this game could turn into a real gem.

785,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access Review       Its a very fun FPS game. (Better then CS:GO) This is a shotter game made for new people to FPS games.  Everywepon shots in a stright line tere is no recoil so you can keep shooting till your Clip/Mag runs out.  In other games a primary is stronger then a secondary but not in this game every gun is OP which makes it better if you forgot to buy something.  The servers are full with people good game and nice graphics this game looks like what cod was intendaed to be back then.The thing i alot of people hate about this game is the shotgun that sprays and has long range yes everyone has used it but everyone has hated it.this game is a 7/10 Fun game i will spray again if you pray again SPRAY AND PRAY,1

"787,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is a First Person Shooter if you havent noticed already. I have to say that this game is a rip-off of CS:GO but lacks the depth like planting bombs and such. I only played this game because a Steam friend of mine parted with his sanity and played this game so much that he changed his Steam name to 'WARMODE KING'. I wrote this review to save you from such dark actions.Because this is a PC game Graphics are everything, but this game does not deliver in this respect. It resembles a potato on methamphetamine quite well. The objects and environment are of low quality and the textures are sub-par. The animations aren't horrible but they take to long to complete, for example i might go to shoot an enemy but they are already dead and i cant see this because the death animation takes to long to finish.The maps are terrible and arent very detailed, with few static environmental objects. They also lack complecity and are far off something such as CS:GO.To be honest i cant be bothered writing a review for this game its not worth the pain and regretful gameplay. Just save your life from a slow death from this game and just buy CS:GO. "",0"

The maps really looks like to csgo choke points maps, some will remember you to dust2 so much. I do recommend it since is a very good game to play for free and not get frustrated, since it is a very fair game.HERE IS WHAT I THINK THIS GAME NEEDS TO BE A BEAST:*Bigger maps.*Up servers 24h.*New Skins / voice chat.*Clean design on hud, fonts, menus.*Player all time stats.*Private / lan servers*Workshop"",1"

"807,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access Review10/10 glimpse into the situation russia is in. The shadows are the most unique thing ive ever seen while the story is crispe and incredible and extremely sad at the end I wont spoil it. The character models shine almost as much as the great gameplay, and the story compliments the beutiful gameplay. The gameplay is so great that Ive had multiple hours of staring at the main menu screen with awe while I saw the beutiful graphics of the play button shine into my soul. The buttons are so rectangular that ive always imagined spongebob jumping into them and wearing them as pants. The character's have great voice acting and the back stories are so sad that I don't want to spoil it for you. The reflections into the water are so beautiful that my eyes gush out blood and spew onto my dead cat (My cat died because I played this game for 12 hours straight one time and needed to eat my cat to feed myself because I just couldnt stop playing this beautiful game) (I now have battle scars). This game will always leave beautiful memories of me shooting the same character model in the face precisely 18/5 times before he eventually died and blood spews everywhere and myÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥gets hard. Before I play the game I slap my leg 3 times and screech so that warmode god will finally except me. When I finish a match of this game I throw my headset precisley 13/5 miles so that the warmode god doesn't kill me next time I slap my leg. Overall this game is the most beautiful game anybody will ever play if you do not agree with my review I will take my cats left over remains and smear them on your face until you call me daddy and start to pray to the warmode god. After that I will sacrafice you to the warmode god for accepting his overall beautifulness. Than I will continue to slap my leg. (Still not better then uncrowded)"",1"

It is strangely addicting and it's free so you don't have anything to lose from trying it. My rating would be a 7/10."",1"
811,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis game sucks. First you start out with the pistol then if you want to get to any good gear you have to kill poeple and the bad thing is that you can't even put your own favorite weapon in you'r beggining weapon of the begining of the game.,0
"812,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access Reviewwell.. that game looks cool for you when you just saw it on steam. but its sucks, you seewhen you start playing it. you know what just dont play the game just the maps are remake of de_dust 2 from counter strike series added crappy weapons just stupid remake thati think made by some â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that dosent got life :P (THIS GAME SUCKS DONT DOWNLOAD IT!)"",0"
"813,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewA great game for it's valueAltough all the hate/troll reviews out there this game is not that bad, it is actually kinda good and fun when you start playing it.

"814,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is ok so far (also CS:GO / Cod crossover) by that I mean the lighting effects have been finally fixed and playermodels look better now.

I know it's still in early access and there is a lot more content that's probably going to be added in the future, So I wont complain too much."",1"

"825,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewFirst game was mainly learning the ropes and how to control my dude after a 1 second flash of controls. No tutorial. No campaign. This game is honestly really boring. The second game I played was just people running round kifing. I can honestly say that I've never wanted to shutdown my computer, get some gas, pour it on the computer, light it on fire, pee on it and go buy a computer with windows XP so much. Then the third game, oh man i spawned and just died over and over again from a dude with a glock. At first i thought he was just really good. But after waiting in spawn with no enemy in sight, watching your entire team die from hackers was very great. I think I had more fun than Minecraft and Roblox's offspring game called 'I wanna die'. The guns are fun but the game is perfect. Totally. I just wissh there were more hackers so that I continually can't play. FIX THE GAME. It's not even bad, you just need to nerf the knife and upgrade anti-cheat software. Jeez."",0"
826,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access ReviewIf you dont mind getting killed and not able to get a kill because of the stupid lag of all players and possible hackers in this game then I HIGHLY DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS GAME. There is more lag in this game than all online games that have lag put together trust me when I say I dont like or play games that have lag. I do play games that have lag but nothing compared to the amount of lag in this game. Steam would do us gamers a favor by taking this trash off the steam market of games.,0
827,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThe game can be alot of fun it just needs to be updated have better graphics and add some attachments  (that come free with the game you have to win or something) and only make the cometics like amsks and that kind of stuff buyable with real money this could be a really good game.,1

"830,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThe worst FPS I ever played, and I have PLAYED A LOT! from Prject Black out to Call of Duty, CG:SO, all those twitchy squad shooters. Now this...this actually makes me want to installa notorious P2W game than play this poor game. Ok, well I give it this: It tries to be """"equal"""". IF any one is familiar with Begone, a Unity based squad shooter for free, this is the same thing. you log in, load up on kill credits and pay at spawn for armor, grenades etc... so it starts most people off equal and you build up as the match stays open...I personally like that than hard load outs. But this game losses all points when :1) The maps feel baby block desing. Hard to explain but super simple mushy non thinking, turn here fire. 2) Because of this design the damage and hit detectioni is so off. It feels like you are getting hit by paintballs. But problem is, I played better paintball sims. You can walk up and unload two full clips to peoples head and I guess there is a RNG where sometimes it is a headshot, and other times you just slowly reload, and refire. It is soo bad. It just feels so fake and silly....It gives it charm though. If you are tired of one shot kills ing ames like CS:Go and doubt who is a hacker or or skilled... play this, no doubts, everything is pillow fight calculations. You can swing, hit a head, but sometimes you get em RIGHT in the eye. 3) Buggy. This is what happened: I log in, play a round, ok, earn enough to buy a grenade, found out it is cool, you buy it once, don't need to rebuy each spawn. Game ended, I quit the match, joined a new server to get new group of guys. And it says I have 1 grenade in the bottom right. I thought, oh cool. I use it, nothing happens, die. """"Oh a bug. That makes sense I don't have one, I jsut started and don't have the kill credits yet..."""" I can live with that bug. So I go back out, decide to do a wall clip shot, you know, you shoot the edge of the wall as you edge out to get anyone hiding behind wall and use your own cover fire....I die....Who killed me? me.... I somehow killed myself....I can only guess this the ricochet off the wall....Like, this game is either so great! SOG EPIC that it calculates deadly ricochet into my skull, or it is so pathetically failing at being an FPS that it has no idea itself as  a game who killed me... I uninstalled on match 2, I can no longer continue. Pure cancer. Oh yeah, before I left, I hung out in match a little longer because I noticed a lot of russians with high knife score in a gun battle. I saw a guy passing walls, floating, and invisibble 1 shotting with a knife....hacked cancer, the worse there is. Seriously, you can get a BETTER experience on a web based shooter called: Begone."",0"

"837,WARMODE,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is a clear carbon copy of CSGO. It plays almost exactly the same. The way you get weapons is exactly the same. And the game is exactly the same.

"839,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewOkay.. listen up. This game? It's a whirlwind. I played it a WHILE ago, and can tell you it was pretty fun. NOw that doesn't mean I would have recommended this game over counter-strike... even for the free price tag. But it was fun, broken and fun. After an mmmmm 5 Month Hiatus, I've come back to it.. and no surprise whatsoever, it got worse. Before I get into that, I am going to tell you what they had going for them.-Broken spawn traps.-Unbeleiveabley unbalanced guns.-small and crowded maps.-And sub-par servers-okay graphics... like ps2...NOW... they tried to fix that.-Spawn protection...-The guns have been """"balanced"""" (on the edge of a cliff with everything on one side)-.... New maps...-Servers that no longer tell you your ping.. Now you're left wondering if that knife death was because you were lagging, or because the game decided that a ten foot knife was now in the game..-graphics that make my computer couch and weeze when I try to load it in 720p... early ps1The game ( when I got it) was a Mixture of CS:GO and C.O.D and it was broken beyond belief, but it was fun. you could go 80-0 with your friends and not care about anything. It may be early access but I don't think that going backwards is how you make a game. I know That I am rambing, but I guess this could be geared more towards the makers of the game. if you see this, go back a few months, figure out what you want with this game, and build from there.For those of you that feel like getting this game before CS:GO.... Don't. Get csgo first and then ty this game out. Drop a thirty bomb in casual, or TDM. then get the game."",0"

"852,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's very rare that I am unable to have at the very least a single praise for a game I don't like. Wow where to begin with this hot mess of a game.....I mean this game is bad and I mean REALLY BAD! The map designs feel like someone is just painting by the numbers adding in only the most basic and mundane boring, bland landscape imaginable. Oh let's not forget when I logged in for the very first time, I received a machine gun volley of invites from every single random person imaginable. I literally got 35 invites within the first minute of logging in which was enragingly annoying. I could not find the settings menu fast enough to turn off notifications. An option such as that should be turned off by default seeing how a new player could get spammed into the ground with invites before they even put their foot in the door. My gosh never has a game had such atrocious hit detection/registry in all my years of gaming. Aiming in this game is a bad joke and attempting to aim with ironsights is just dogs***. I lined up a target in my ironsights, took precise aim at my oppenent's head and opened fire like crazy only to find out I DID NOT HIT HIM ONCE! So throughout the match I sat there trying to figure out where the hit detection/registry allowed me to damage my opponents. And of all the ridiculous solutions I've found this has got to be the worst. I found out how to make headshots in this game using ironsights. The trick is you don't aim for their head when trying to make a headshot (I know I'm just as confused and surprised as you are by that fact). You aim either at their crotch or the center of your opponent's chest to make headshots which is a**backwards and makes no sense what so ever.And then there is the blatant hacking in this game in which I gotta say wow. People who hack in this game are WAY TOO COMFORTABLE in cheating. From what I've seen these hackers walk around like """"Yeah I'm cheating....The f*** you gonna do about it?!"""" In some instances they don't even try to hide the fact that they are cheating which is amazing in a depressing kind of way. Noticed a guy on my team straight destroying people on the other team with just a handgun all the way on the other side of the map. Not saying such a thing is impossible but to have such a high kill count with just a handgun shooting at extreme distances is not something a person can pull off constantly without cheating. But not to worry the other team had their own hacker(s) as well so I guess the equation balanced itself out in a kind of psychotic way. Shame on me for not noticing this sooner. I get rushed by a guy with a shotgun and realize that NOT ONCE during the entire match has he reloaded or ran out of ammo as he is rampaging around the map which is rather suspect if you ask me. This game basically took all the elements people enjoy in shooter games and combined them together but their execution in designing around these concepts was done in a very mediocre manner. The problem with the designers is that they don't have a clear understanding of why people like or even enjoy these particular elements in the gameplay. I can only tell you about my personal experience and opinion with the game so if you're feeling brave enough to play for yourself (Who knows you miles may vary)"",0"
"853,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI really think this game is a lot of fun and that is has potential. I'm really surprised that this game has made it this far into development. Though there are bugs in the game, there are very minimal and are extremely rare to come across. When I started playing the early build of this game, I started to encounter hackers in the game, but as the game progresses in development, I started to see less and less. This shows me how much time and effort is being put into the game to make it enjoyable for everyone. I approve this game and can't wait for it to become out of its beta stage and be set to go into the actual steam store page listed not as an early access beta, but as an actual free-to-play game."",1"

Skins go from 50 cents up to 3.5 dollars for the highest level skins. Skins look kind of decent even if they are same pattern reused a lot of times. Sadly they aren't in the steam inventory which makes them pretty much worthless, unless you really want to spend money on this game. There are also some hats and banners, which require payment as well.Game offers 4 different game modes: """"Deathmatch"""" (team deathmatch), Confrontation, Sabotage (search and destroy/plant the bomb) and Zombiemode (pvp). I mostly found players playing deathmatch, there is very little of them left though.Now the interesting part, especially for a free to play game is that all the guns are bought and reset during the match. There is no inventory where you manage the guns in the lobby, annoying trial guns, p2w weapons or lucky boxes"
"863,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI know I dont have much time played but come on what else is there to do then shoot people. with that said I honestly had fun playing this game. It is very broken in alot of aspects but its early access which HOPEFULLY means its being worked on, right?. I get so used to hearing """"early access"""" that it pisses me off. Early access IS for games that are being actively developed and for some players to get a tase of the action before the full game releases and at the same time the players help the devs by finding glitches, bugs, exploits etc. for the devs to correct. Early access IS NOT an excuse for a broken game..... It IS NOT for a bunch of idiots who dont know what they are doing to release a broken piece ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥for people to download and play for 20 mins before getting bored or pisssed which ever comes first... Spawn killing, knifing(broken), unbalanced weapons, modders, framedrops etc. pick your poision, these are a handfull of the many issues this game has. I doubt this game will be fixed.... like EVER. but I wouldn't mind eating my words on that one. until anything big changes my review will stay unchanged."",0"
"864,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWhat a great game, but I feel as if it is incomplete. Us fans were told about hurricane gameplay and several modes. All we get in the end is a 6-map, linear shooter with a limited user interface. It seems as if mid-development, the creators of the game said, """"Nah, it's good enough."""" and left. Which sucks because it a really fun and addicting game. I would say it's a 6/10 rating, but only if you can get past the limited graphics, and limited user interface. Great game, but can be improved."",1"
"865,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGame is unplayable with multiple monitors. Fullscreen mode or not, the mouse goes outside the window when you try to turn around and as a result when you try to shoot you click out of the game.Have the developers never used a second monitor before? Wow."",0"
866,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access ReviewPros         easy to pick up and play         not very heavy on the hardware needs        free always a +        large maps        loads of weapon choices        a fair few serverscons well this will be short        too easy to campCSGO has a rival at last.as long as it's kept up to date and they fix the camping spawn problem add some more maps time to time with new game modes this ill take off. ,1
"867,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access Reviewi kinda dont reccomend it because first there is a lot of hackers, second, they dont have an anti cheat to keep those hackers away and third. its just not really a fun game"",0"
"868,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is a mix of CoD and CS:GO. The game isn't that bad and it doesn't take much time to get the hang of it because you don't need any skills to play. Some things need to be improved and fixed like the 'Authorization' screen, the spawn camping, add anti cheat system because it's full of hackers and also dying randomly and saying that I was killed by my self. When those little bugs are fixed I will give the game a positive review.12/10 would get killed by my self again"",0"
"869,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWhy bother writing a review for this game? Everyone is on the same boat"
870,WARMODE,2017.0,Early Access ReviewPro'sFree Cs:goNot That Bad Graphics Good On Potatoes(my laptop)Con's Alot Of HackersHitboxes Are Glitched I Shoot At A Guys Head No Damage shoot At the Chest HeadshotSome Weapons Are Too OpOtherthere should be a gamemode where the guns are free just saying ,1
871,WARMODE,2017.0,Early Access ReviewHave you ever played another fps shooter? If you have you will most likely be at the top of the score board unless they have a blackmodeplayer then he is cheating.,1
"872,WARMODE,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewWarmode.If you like fps games then DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS. It takes like 10 or 15 shots to kill some-one, The graphics are really really bad.Pros.1. N/ACons.1. The whole game is a con.This game is a waste of time and disk space.......I am just trying to save you both.First of all it takes about 20 shots to kill a player.Then then guns all just suck!!!!!!"",0"
873,WARMODE,2016.0,Early Access Reviewits one of the better Free To Play games because the servers doesnt lag at all and but the bad thing is that there is not so many players. 8/10 Cant wait for the full realease if they will realease it! :(),1
"874,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access Reviewmediocre game, but some real annoying thingswhen you make contact with another player, wheter it be friend or foe, you teleport ontop of his headeven with mouse accel off, it feels like its onknife if glitchy, sometimes it hits sometimes it doesn't. seems random"",0"
"875,WARMODE,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFlawless design and stunning gameplay.This sexually arousing offspring of the gaming industry and a dash of cronic H.I.V, highlights the exhilerating experience of playing a CSGO rip off. Both my â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and bladder imploded upon sight of the 1080p graphics. After getting my entire lower half removed and both of my kidneys abducted by a 10 year old cuban doctor, I have since rekindled my grind on WARMODE stopping only when going on violent coughing sprees, like a chain smoker with tuberculosis. An absolute gem.10/10"",1"
"876,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game isn't as bad as alot of people say it is.Now, don't bring the torpedos yet, let me explain:This game is full of glitches,bugs,noobs and hackers.To be honest, that's the fun part of it. The randomness of it makes it fun. There isn't really a point on playing it, since you don't get jackshiet from levels, and you have to pay for skins (way to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid for me).But the game overall is worth spending like 20 minutes downloading it with â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ internet connection and  is worth it wasting like 5 hours on it.Though there are alot of better games out there to waste time, I waste my time on this one lol."",1"
"877,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewCompletely the same as CS:GO but more fun, and also free. Great game to waist time in anticipation for something. Runs well. Find yourself spending hours playing to unlock a beast sniper, and having the round end. Ont the best to play with friends, as teamates do nothing in this game but sit there and steal your kills. 9/10+Free+Better Then CS:GO+Runs Great+A Great Time-Multiplayer Can Be Repetative And Annoying-Same Thing As CS:GO"",1"
"878,WARMODE,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game i just don't know what to say about this.  It's logic is really flawed, apparently shooting without your iron sights is less accurate than not. There is also A HUGE problem with spawn camping. And it only has like 3 game modes. There is no  variety really, just get killed and continue. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I got spawn killed  this time. Yes my iron sights are Wait? What? Useless. I kept this game to long. At  least I didn't have to pay for it. Don't waste your time."",0"
879,WARMODE,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI played a bit. This game is too horrible. After just a bunch of minutes of playing I immediately uninstalled. I don't recommend until this game gets better. It has potential but the devs aren't just trying to make it.,0
"880,WARMODE,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you play using DSR or VSR in 4k it doesn't look all that bad.The game feels super call of dutyish with CS elements. If you're somewhat decent at COD 4/MW2 you're going to crush everyone in this game(check my screenshots). THE GAME IS NOT P2W, the microtransactions are all cosmetic. RIght now there isn't much content, I can see this game being somewhat fun to play for an hour. It's 300mb just go ahead and try it."",1"
881,WARMODE,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is a bad rendition of counterstrike.....but its really a rather fun shooter...just something to waste time on really...my bet though is that it wont have a good player base within a month,1
882,WARMODE,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is not that good to be honest. I like the idea but the way they made it is just awfull but I do believe it can get better. For now I don't recommend it but if it gets better I'll give it another go.,0
"883,WARMODE,2017.0,""Early Access ReviewI recommend this game as a filler, meaning as a break from your main game for a few mins or a hour. Guns are solid, balanced in my eyes. 1Shot sniper ofcourse makes sense since its pretty easy to kill in the game. All but the knife is crazy. KNife will get you the guns you need late game faster than the pistol by default they give you from the start."",1"
"884,WARMODE,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is good, there ARE hackers yes. But in a game like this it doesnt bug me as much as a game like CSGO or CODsome guns need work"
