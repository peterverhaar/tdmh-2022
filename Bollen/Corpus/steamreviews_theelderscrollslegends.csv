"9281,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I love this game. At least, the game as it's meant to be, as it was in the previous client. I still think it will be that again, eventually. A month or two ago, this game was migrated onto a new client, by a new developer, as the old client was not made with expandability in mind. Problem is, the new client wasn't ready and the release was a catastrophe. Right now, I can't honestly recommend this to a new player. But! The bugs are being fixed fast. Maybe in a month I can recommend this again.Really, you should give it a try! It's an amazing game! The card designs are awesome, the game mechanics are awesome, and it's really nicely balanced unlike many other CCGs. Just... wait a little bit first."",0"
9282,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,i have uninstalled this game after updated. i have expected to upgrade some mechanics of the game but looks like never changed maybe it can be worse than original like as interface.Maybe i can play in future but not now. Sorry Bethesda and newly Sparkypants. ,0
9283,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,The Update killed it for me not only on my Phone (where i play 95% of the time) here as well. I spent a total of four days trying to update and i just plain give up and am moving onto something else. Was fun while it lasted though but I'm over it.,0
"9284,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Absolutely horrid update. Unplayable and ugly to boot. No point in playing until they figure out how to make the client work. No rewards populating for me at all, making quests worthless or even logging in. Have spent several hours over the past 5 days communicating with tech support, each one has a random useless hoop to jump through. """"Log out 2 times, that'll fix it."""" It's steam, idiot... """"You should start getting rewards again after you reach your next level."""" I leveled up yesterday. Are you telling me that no one gets rewards until level 37 now? I've put almost $60 into this game, and now I'm a beta tester? Heck no, frend."",0"
"9285,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Recently ESL went through a change of developers from Direwolf (awesome at ccgs but slow'ish with new content) to Sparky Pants (I know, that name...really) who rewrote the entire client well keeping the game the same.  Obviously, this was a bit of a rough patch with alot of bugs, hence alot of negative reviews around this time, thus the mixed rating.However, SparkyPants are through the rough patch, which actually only lasted 1-2 months and are now putting out new content (new cards), they have also been fast to fix bugs.  In fact, actually did pretty good handling changing devs and re-writing the entire client.The have just released a mini-expansion 11 new cards, are back to producing 1 new monthly card for ranked rewards per month and a new major exapnsion due soon, the Isles of Madness.  The new 12 cards from SparkyPants look really good cards as well and fitted really well into alot of decks I have, so good going there too.ESL has always been a excellent ccg, with a epic feel to it and based on the excellent Elder Scrolls universe / lore.  You can create some amazing decks, items / equpment and movement across the 2 lanes can be awesome to behold and give ESL are far more dynamic, exciting ccg experience.  Also, its very generous rewards wise and there are cheap decks you can put together without epics / legendarys, you can also buy pre-built decks with gold, which contain epics / legendary cards to get you started.I have played alot of other ccgs and ESL is very, very good.  I recommend it!"",1"
"9286,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""The elder scrolls legends is a game based on the universe of the famous saga the elder scrolls, after playing more than 500 hours (game mostly on android) I can say that it is a wonderful game with multiple game modes: history, mind-busting, ranked, arena, casual, has a new attractive interface, good dynamics of games, different types of decks and creating them from a fun to the most strategic, the community is very close, you can advance in various ways to get cards and decks You can farming gold or buy it with real money, at no time the game forces you to spend, it is up to you how to play and get the items."",1"
9287,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,I've been pleasantly surprised at how much I've enjoyed this game. I love learning how to make my deck better. The art is gorgeous in my opinion. It also gives me a way to enjoy Elder Scrolls without diving into a session of Skyrim/Oblivion/Morrowind/ESO if I'm not in the mood or don't have the time at the moment.,1
"9288,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Surprisingly good and strategic game. And while battling other players is fun and rewarding, the single player campaing is really intriguing and interesting.The only downside is that most of the singleplayer campaing is locked behind a paywall and those are bethesda-style prices. And since those purchases happen outside of Steam (you still can purchase in-game things with Steam Balance), they'll never see a discount.If you play casually, you won't have to spend anything to get cards. Just play the game and complete quests to buy packs and cards with in-game currency"",1"
"9289,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Excellent free-to-play Hearthstone'esque clone. The model is similar, for anyone familiar with the digital CCG. The game reinvents the wheel enough to make it the better offering as of 2017. Daily quests reward players with gold that can be used to buy packs, get entries into solo or versus player arenas, or can be used to buy bonus content that would otherwise normally be stuck behind a paywall. Cards that you own more than 3 copies of can be sharded to craft other cards you don't own, eventually amassing enough of a collection to venture into constructed play. The game itself is just so much more intriguing than Hearthstone, given the multiple lanes, rune additions, and deck combinations between the various stats. Play this at least for the free solo story campaign that lasts ~4 hours! As of 06/28/2017 Heroes of Skyrim expansion is out, adding in an additional 150 cards and all sorts of fun! Check this one out."",1"
"9290,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Honestly I have no idea how many hours I've logged in this game, but I truly cannot tell you if it's a good game. I've played since the beta using the bethesda.net launcher, but with each update I would be locked out of this game for some time despite all efforts  (including uninstalling and reinstalling the software). Now that my personal background with this game is out of the way, let me tell you about the Elder Scrolls: Legends. It's a card game (duh) featuring characters and monsters from across the Elder Scrolls series. Rememeber the Adorng Fan from Oblivion? He's in this game along with Cicero and Miraak from Skyrim. The Adoring Fan is just as annoying as he was in Oblivion so don't worry! See, he has special card attributes (known as keywords in ES:L) that make him a priority target. You have to kill the Adoring Fan before attacking anything else. In addition to this, he has another keyword that triggers when he is destroyed (called a Last Gasp) and his particular Last Gasp sends him right back into your deck to be played once you draw him again if you're lucky. Just like most card games, there is a hefty amount of luck involved. The rune system, combined with this ingrained luck, drives me insane. Runes work like this"
"9291,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""When I heard Bethesda was making a card game in the likes of hearthstone I got very excited. I really enjoy the Elderscrolls franchise and I also enjoy card games of the likes of Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. I have been playing Hearthstone for quite a while and I have gotten a bit weared down by the sheer luck it takes to play the game and the  new expansion with the quest mechanic that turned me off a lot. Any ways, I am happy to say the Elder Scrolls legends is great and a worthy competetor in the card game genere. I like the rune mechanic with drawing cards as you take damage so you never feel as though you are running dry on cards. I also enjoy the profecy mechanic which is bassically the equivalent to a Magic The Gathering Instant. The only problem I have with the game is with the card presentation but I am sure It will be fixed down the road. If you are on the lookout for a quick card game to pick up I can, without a doubt, suggest this game."",1"
"9292,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I discovered this game when my gaming rig broke down and I was basically forced to use a potatoe laptop that was made circa 2008/my phone for gaming. Luckily for me it supported both platforms, as a result I kinda got hooked. And now that my rig is back after some RMA issues, I'm still playing this game over the other 1100 ish games I have in my library, why you ask? Cause honestly this game is that fun. Honestly give it a go, it's free and you won't regret it."",1"
"9293,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Note: While my 'time played' metric is really low on steam, I've been playing this game since the release of open beta last year, and have played at high ranks for the majority of that time. This is an excellent card game. It's my favorite card game on the market because it combines excellent card design with board mechanics that facilitate multiple lines of play on each turn. If you want a card game that strongly rewards critical thinking but is easy to pick up and understand, I encourage you to give this one a try. If you aren't a competitive player then this game is still a blast, due to it having the most rubust single player modes of any digital card game. Over the last few months I've alternated between playing competitively on the ladder and playing the solo content, and they've both been great fun."",1"
"9294,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""For me, better than Heartstone. I like how cards can evolve and have different paths. Also, having to different lanes adds a lot of tactical options onto the game. The Dark Brotherhood story mode is kinda expensive tho, imo."",1"
"9295,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Product received for freeBeen playing this for the last few months (through Bethesda.net Launcher) and i love how much fun this CCG has to offer. It has some balance issues like most online games, but overall the game is very good and i like it more than Hearthstone!Achievement update!"",1"
"9296,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""First time playing a card game such as this, but have greatly enjoyed my time so far. Initial learning curve is easy to get over when completing the campaign, allowing you to go into online play with a reasonable chance. Playing with friends is easy and enjoyable as well."",1"
"9297,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""So..this is my opinion about this game after playing it for over 6 months with over one thousand hours played.Short form: Extremely fun game with nice balancing that has some minor flaws here and there.Long form:This game combines alot of interesting aspects making every game played to something realy cool.Im talking about a dual colour system, prophecies, 2 lane mechanic and much more.A dual colour system allows alot of deck creativity and at the same time viability. Currently there is only one colour combination that i dont see as viable, even though people still have success with it.This alone also speaks for great balancing. Bethesda is constantly balancing cards. Not only nerfing the op ones but also buffing underplayed ones. Thats simply amazing.Prophecies make the game exciting and frustrating at the same time. It just prevents this game from getting boring and you learn to play around it as much as possible.The 2 lanes make this game also more skillbased than for example hearthstone. You always have  a decision to do even if its obvious which card you have to play. This is one of the reasons i like this game so much.Another point that is probably very important for most people is the f2p model.Bethesda is being very generous with their rewards. So dont be discouraged by the expansions we already have. It will take you maybe 2 months to get all the content unlocked and have most of the cards. Without any investment besides playing the game for 3 hours a day. So compared to other games the f2p model is realy rewarding. Since you get 15-50 gold every 3 wins and a random card or pack. It can even be a legendary (even though rare) Epics on the other hand are not so rare. You usualy get atleast 1 epic card.The only thing that i dislike about this game is the compatibility for either my hardware or windows 10 as it sometimes lags ingame.Overall a great game!"",1"
"9298,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Same stuff to say as pretty much everyone else, much more balanced/competitive friendly than Hearthstone.  Better beginner rewards, wider range of viable decks, and less random effects compared to HS, but not as great cosmetics.  I've played since the closed beta (about 1 year), and it has become more and more refined and better with every patch. If you're looking for content creators I would recommend iamcvh and bradforlee on twitch, and charm3r and Justin Larson on youtube.  There is also a database for decks/card collection progress/story mode at legends-decks.com "",1"
"9299,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Sparkypants, The new interface is no better than the original. You have somehow managed to use every shade of brown in the playfield. The cards images look smaller, maybe due to the loss of border. What was the piont of this update? The UI is the same played out minimalist crap from 10 years ago. Did you hire a child to desighn it? This is the only ccg I currently play and sparkypants has made me regret my choice. Someone at this studio better put on their big boy pants and try to produce a product worthy of The Elder Scrolls franchise. This is the kind of garbage update that can kill this game."",1"
"9300,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I enjoyed this game, but all online TCG games are too expensive to play casually with their rotating seasons. Casual F2P or low-paying players simply are going to be stuck using the same cards in stagnant decks."",0"
"9301,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""They fixed the new client. It's no longer laggy, the new UI is easier on the eyes. I had my complaints when they switched over, but they are fixing it! This is a great card game for RPG fans and card gamers. Glad they are turning it around :)"",1"
"9302,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I love this game, but the deck is stacked against you. (excuse the pun.) the fact that they make you pay for the new set is crazy, the game is already good, and now they are adding a pay to win gimmick... it's too bad... the game is already really good I bet lots of people are buying booster packs... what can you do, some companies just want to see the world burn."",1"
9303,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,After nearly 1000 hours of time in this game since it was released on Steam
"9304,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Easily one of the best """"Card RPG's"""" I have ever played. I usually don't play these kinds of games longer than a few hours. This one being Elder Scrolls themed, I knew I'd play longer than a few hours. But I was not expecting to get lost in the day playing this game, and ignoring all my other games. Bethesda wins again. Great game, solid tutorial which sets you up for success for first timers. This game takes a little time to build up coin, but if you grind the daily challenges and story, you can earn enough to buy in game items, instead of spending real money. "",1"
"9305,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Played many hours on the Bethesda launcher so my hours played is inaccurate. Big fan of ESL and in my opinion is currently the best CCG at this time. It's very similar to Hearthstone as many point out, but personally feel like it improves on a lot of aspects over HS, certainlly more tactical and is less RNG-based card-wise.- A free story mode with custom decks and choices which reward you with different cards. One of the strongest points in the game, and one that I prefer over the solo adventures from Hearthstone. New story modes are paid for, unfortunately, but from what I've seen, these modes are a lot more interactive compared to HS' quirky straightforward adventures.- 50 cards and up to 3 copies of non-unique cards mean more dust/soulgems needed, but only 1200 for legendaries. The game is quite generous with it's packs however, and rewards come quicker and more frequently ie 3 win rewards- The Solo arena along with the multiplayer arena. The Solo arena is great, and feels like an extension of the story mode where you face AI, but they tend to have an advantage in various ways and have themed decks- The lane system is a welcome addition. Usually there's a standard lane which is a normal lane and a shadow lane where creatures basically have stealth against attacks (except spells) and you can't attack across lanes. This feature means a lot more strategy is required on creature placement.- The rune system is something I have mixed feelings about. On one hand it makes the game a lot more tactical and calculated instead of going all-face all the time, but card draw isn't too rewarding - which is where prophecies come in. For those unaware, each player has 5 runes and breaks for every 5 health increment, and each time one is broken, you get a random card draw"
"9306,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Ignore the 6 minutes played - I've played this game for over a year now and it's really the best thing out there for people who want to play an online CCG.  It takes all of the lessons learned (but ignored) from its predecessors and builds upon them with brand new ideas.  The game is incredibly balanced, and there are ways to play successfully in every archetype.  There's extensive solo play options, and there's not a game out there that's friendlier for people who are free to play.  Highest possible recommendation."",1"
"9307,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""The new update ruined everything that made this game unique in the first place since day 1. It is now just another average iphone game for kids when it was such a decent source of soundtrack, art, and roleplaying experience with the Elder Scrolls Universe. Bethesda, bring back Direwolf."",0"
"9308,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""If you don't plan on spending any money on this - it's still good. Everything can be bought for in-game currency, all the cards can be crafted using soul gems that you get from winning battles. Mechanics feel like a Magic: the Gathering rip-off (there's going to be a 1:1 exile mechanic from MTG in the new patch, too) but that's really ok for me. Bonus points for Morrowind cards and houses"",1"
"9309,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Only been playing for about a week, but already spent 35+ hours ingame. The cards and storylines fit well into the elder scrolls universe, and the gameplay is awesome.Update, October 2018:Returned to the game after a few months of being away. The UI has been revamped from simple and exciting, to clumsy and annoying. Even worse, ranks have been expanded to 12 instead of 9, which means it takes way too long to grind back up to your natural base-rank after time away.Last thing left to completely ruin the game, is to make it p2w."",1"
"9310,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Fun to play for a little while but sadly it doesn't do much to stand out from the other online card games out there so it gets boring relatively quickly once you've been at it a while.  Maybe download it for a few hours of exploring, but it's not gonna be a game you're going to want to stick around to play for any sort of extended period of time.  Sadly despite my love of Bethesda and the Elder Scrolls series and card games like these"
9311,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,The best card game.Probably the only card game with real random RNG and not bs/fake/rigged draws. Ok the AI has some bs decks in Solo Arena while you have a random deck but at least the player vs player RNG is truly random and doesnt favor the player that has invested the most real life $.,1
"9312,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""As a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls universe this game was a huge attraction to me! It's really personal preference whether you play this, magic or hearthsone etc but each game has its unique way of gathering new players such as the double laning system in ESL. The story has many tough yet doable quests for you to do and they're many different ways to test out new decks created, vs AI or actual players. There is a nice casual game mode and even ranked too, and also there is a nice addition of Solo Arena which pits you versing tough AI characters with the mission being that you have to beat as many as you can before you lose 3 times. Each time you succeed or lose in your journey you garner great rewards. The deck system is extremely diverse which allows for great consideration and mixing for deck creation. Overall this would be my favorite Card game in its current genre. 8/10"",1"
"9313,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""TES: Legends is fun, well-designed and has its own personality. Out of nowhere, it has become a strong contender in the card-based battle. Itâ€™s not as pretty as Hearthstone and its lack of responsiveness is sometimes annoying, but Dire Wolf Digital tackled gameplay mechanics expertly, making The Elder Scrolls Legends Hearthstoneâ€™s main rival."",1"
"9314,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Very sad about the change of direction, it's just not TES anymore. I can't recommand in it's current state.Bethesda dug it's grave for TESL when it happened. There is no turning back anymore and it's going to be it's doom.The previous version was fun and TES themed. Not anymore."",0"
"9315,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""This game is a breath of fresh air, in a stale genre of games. I've started to tire of all the harthstone rip offs, but this game manages to borrow from that formula, while at the same time adding enough new mechanics to feel original. I love the two lane mechanic, because it's like managing two boards at once, and requires a fair amount of thinking. I like card games that actually make me think, instead of one's that are nothing more than smashy smashy time to bashy.  (mindless action with no actual skill involved) I love all the different troop types and keywords, and how they have a few standard card game keywords (lethal and breakthrough being the first to come to mind.) but at the same time they added enough unique mechanics to make the game feel different from all the others. Best part is, that while it's a bit grindy, it's in no way P2W and the game gives you a lot of ways to earn cards and packs for free.Cannot recomend this highly enough  9/10 Fantastic game."",1"
"9316,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Awesome game.  If you enjoy """"Magic: The Gathering"""", """"Yu Gi Oh"""" or the """"Pokemon Trading Card Game"""", then you'll enjoy this one. Fermiliar formula but with unique machanics. Can't go wrong with the """"Elder Scrolls"""" lore either.  Check it out."",1"
"9317,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""The only thing remotely interesting about this game is the PvE arena (all of the PvP is 1-dimensional because the lack of viable decks).Unfortunately, like so many other card games, the developers have no idea how to balance the AI. Every PvE game is an RNG match. When it's a game you're supposed to lose, the AI will draw insanely improbable combinations of cards... every time, and you'll never have a chance.When it's your turn to win, you'll blow through the AI without a thought.Don't spend any money on this one -- it's soon to be gone for good anyway."",0"
"9318,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""while the game itself is certainly a big step up from how dull hearthstone was i feel that the game can be mabe a bit too snowbally in places.  as a lot of my matches can simply consist of one sided games, there was frighteningly little middle ground, u either stomp or get stomped on.i also find the abundance of cards that add even more RNG to the game pretty unpleasant whether its getting a powerful bonus effect if the top card of your deck is revealed to be the correct type, or getting a random card added to your hand. i will give the single player campaign credit tho as it was very enjoyable and interesting to play through for a digital card game, but the mess of playing multiplayer or the arenas afterwards is so painful in comparisonEDIT -  since it came up a bit in the comments i really dont like the idea of the rune system either. while cards may be in a set order so it's technically not RNG it feels just the same since you cant know the top card of your deck. So it simply adds to the problem of relying on chance too much in this game. If you're in the middle of getting some hits on your enemy and you break a rune, he has a chance of getting the right prophecy card he needs to stop your assault dead in its tracks or screw you in some way, or he could simply get a dud or a prophecy that doesnt really help in that situation, and vice versa if you are on the recieving end of attacks.between prophecy and a good number of cards in the game, so many just depend on the top of your deck at the time just happeneing the correct one, making it feel more like a game of chance at times."",0"
"9319,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Love this game on my phone but will not work with either my laptop or desktop computers, both capable at gaming. I spent a little over a week with 3 different support staff members at Bethesda trying the game both through Steam and Bethesda's own launcher, would not connect to their servers with all ports forwarded and firewall exceptions made. After my experience on PC I can not recomend on this platform. Rediculous since it works with no problem on my phone on the same network."",0"
"9320,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""This is the best card game I've played and my new favorite. (Unless the Cyanide and Happiness card game comes to PC somehow.) It's got an incredible amount of tactical depth. From being able to select an avatar from one of the Elder Scrolls races to affect how you collect cards as you progess through the game. To being able to level up certain cards when you/your avatar levels up. I'm 18 battles into the story campaign and I've been presented with many story related options that gave me different cards based on the choices I made. There are also many different types to the cards that are attributed to different stats. As you play through the story or level up, you unlock new decks that augment different play strategies based on the 2 main attributes that make up the deck.In the deck editor, you can pick up to 2 main attributes for your different decks. What attributes you choose affect the types of cards you can put in those decks. There are some duel class cards and a fair amount of neutral cards that don't belong to any attribute (mostly monsters and dwemer constructs from what I've seen thus far.) but most cards belong to one attribute. Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Endurance, and Willpower. Each one provides more cards of that type that helps its playstyles as you level up. For example, a deck of Strength and Intelligence would likely have a lot of magic spells and creatures (for Intelligence) and many creatures/items/weapons that are focused on an aggressive playstyle. In contrast, a Willpower and Endurance deck would have a lot of smaller creatures and ways to augment them to be larger/tougher (from the Willpower) and a lot of cards help you out more and more the longer the match goes on (from the Endurance). There's also the fact that there are usually 2 lanes to the combat. Sometimes the lanes have special effects that change what happens to creatures in that lane. For example, there's a Shadow lane that provides Cover to creatures the first turn they're placed (so they can't be attacked by other creatures during that turn), there's Windy lanes that move a random creature from one lane to another, and even an Arena lane that gives a random item to any creature summoned to that lane.With so many different variables and more being discovered every few matches, this game is rapidly becoming one of my favorites.Edit: You can only have up to 70 cards in your deck-and a minimum of 50 cards. A maximum of 3 copies of a card can be in your deck and some cards are Legends (ultra rare) and you can only have 1 of those per deck. Excess cards can be trapped in soul gems and will give you a number of soul gems based on its rarity and how many there are of it. You can then use those soul gems to """"soul summon"""" cards you don't already have. Of course, better cards have higher soul summon costs. You can also collect gold from battles and use that gold to buy card packs or entry tickets to the Arena (battle up to 10 opponents with a randomly drawn deck until you beat all 10 or lose 3 times-chances for better than normal and more than normal prizes) or you can save them up to purchase in game DLC-the dark brotherhood DLC appears to be able to be purchsed a la carte using ingame currency-yet another plus for the game in my opinion. You can also earn more card packs in game through play. And some of your cards have different paths they can be upgraded along."",1"
"9321,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I've apparently spent some 50+ hours on this game. I find it to be fun and I've not spent a dollar on it. Since everyone is name-dropping card games they play for weirdo internet points: Vampire: Jyhad, Magic, Pokemon, and Legend of the Five Rings were some of my favorites. I rank it up there with Card Fighters Clash, Pokemon TCG Gameboy, and prefer it to Hearthstone."",1"
"9322,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""......I was going to give this a negative review because as far as I could see it was simply an elder scrolls Hearthstone clone but then something changed my way of thinking.....I was about to win a game and going on my usual minor Hearthstone gloat of """"Thank you"""" to my opponent but made a mistake of reducing his health down to a level where he lost a rune and drew a card....he drew a prophecy card which can be played out of turn.....This card was a high guard (Taunt in Hearthstone) and he played it stopping my cards passage to winning the game and allowing him to win on the next play......That was a turning point for me. This is not a Hearthstone clone....this is so much more and as such I am giving it a big thumbs up.I now have 2 accounts totaling over 350 hrs....Still love it.This is 1 of the best games I have ever played...."",1"
"9323,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""10/10 card game with plenty of nuances to differentiate it from other cards games. If you enjoy other Card Games like Hearthstone/ Magic, this is definitley worth a try!10/10 The Duck Approves"",1"
"9324,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Im going to try and keep this brief.   this IS a pretty GOOD game.  the biggest things i have noticed is that it is very much like Magic the Gathering.   not exactly dumb down to much but some where  between dumb down and intellegent.  the game flows well, has a good story, voice acting is solid.  enough handle holding so you know what to do next, not so much that you feel like you already know whats going to happen next.  You can mix colors like you do in Magic but you only get 2 color and what i think is """"artifact"""" card system like they have in Magic.  there are daily quest to get """"coins"""".  So far i would say you can easily play this game without paying, although if you want to drop a few buck you can save yourself some time.Small Recap:  The makes of this game did do justice to the game.  the art is good, animations are statisfactory, voice acting good, equal balance between hand holding and letting you think for youself.

"9325,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Liked the game at first. Then after I played through the story, experience dropped to almost none, daily quests didn't fill even after I did what it asked for, and everything costs money. No thank you."",0"
"9326,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""This game is extremly close to Hearthstone but somewhat worse, """"synergies"""" are more important than stats according to them but they give aggro an Edge over other control decks to the point, that in ladder, every aggro deck is the exact same deck with red as a base, and every control deck is exactly the same with green/purple. You will face the same two overpowered decks over and over and you will get sick of them because the game match you with people of the same level/rank as you... and when you hit level 20 they will have the complete netdeck and you will face almost no variance. The good thing is that """"starter packs"""" you buy with real money offer a lot of value but right now there are better more generous games like Gwent that offer a different experience than hearthstone and might I say it, where you won't need to spend money if you don't want to.The developers tend to listen to the community to an overextent where if the comunity asks for nerfs, they will nerf the cards even if they consider them to be balanced. This is really good/bad because yeah, they will change the cards, but they won't test any changes making changes either a nerf to oblivion or stupidly unimportant.If you like Hearthstone and want to try another extremly similar game, you will love this game. If you also like aggro vs aggro matches, this is probably the game for you. If you like getting ahead fast and hitting top players fast, this game is for you as not that many people are playing and it's somewhat easy to rank up using only a couple of decks and  If you like small variance in decks, and a meta with little variance this is the game for you.If you like deckbuilding, I would not recommend this game. If you like control games, I would not recommend this game, and if you like generous card games I would go to either Gwent or Shadowverse, both of them excel where this game is left behind."",0"
"9327,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Lets be clear, the full game costs $500+ and this number will climb rapidly over time. DO NOT BUY IN in or you will just continue to encourage the pay to buy cards buisness model that compromises balance and player enjoyment to squeeze as much cash from players as they can tolerate.Believe it or not, it would be possible to make a strategic card game that respects the player and prioritizes game balance and player enjoyment. Too bad it will never happen because players keep giving in and funding this abusive buisness model.The usual trickle of daily quests disrespects the player by urging them to form a habit of logging in to get a pittance of gold. Balance isn't as bad as some other card games, but it won't be long before you'll get hopelessly stomped by players using decks you could never make without dropping a significant chunk of cash."",0"
"9328,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Out of the gates its a fun and addictive game, however after about a week of fairly heavy play its flaws shine through. The game really becomes an over complicated coin flip simulator heavily based on luck sure a core part of these card games is luck but this game is excessively luck based because of its design flaws. 1)There are very limited and straight forward strategies that pretty much begin and end with producing units to attack the enemy giving them equipment to make them hit harder, and then producing units that destroy or stop them or really cheap simple kill cards to stop them that is pretty much all the game offers strategically.2) The automatic mana aspect which starts low and grows each turn is part of the problem as it takes out an entire important strategic aspect of card games being resource and its management. So most games will proceed through a rather mundane same old same old start until each player hit 6+ mana at the same time at which point luck of the draw will determine the outcome my units out mash down your avatar or your spam of guard units plus kill cards stops me with only an extremely small sample of """"counter cards"""" that typically  is limited to silence or """"remove guard"""" or units with guard or instant kill cards (include silence). So most decks are just """"Zergs"""" just flood the board with cheap units that buff stats of each other and overwhelm/outdraw each other.While no resources makes initial learning curve really small in the end it destroys the game as it also precludes any real depth of gameplay and strategy so it gets boring repetitive luck of the draw really fast (took a week of 3-4 hours a day play before it set in for me) since eventually both players have plenty of mana to play super cards and well its just luck if you draw the 2-4 super cards of your 50 before i do.3) The comeback mechanic of breaking runes to get draws is another very flawed mechanic that again just reduces the game down to raw luck. At first it seems really quit cool then you realize it just penalizes you for winning, completely negates a entire deck strategy often refer to as burn decks (just focus on killing the avatar) but it gets even further compounded by """"prophecy"""" cards which are cards you auto get to play for free if the opponent breaks a rune. A comeback mechanic is great but not this iteration since there is no strategy, now if you had to have the resource aka mana to use the prophecy card then you might have a strategic asset to gameplay but its not it just turns the game even more to a basic luck of the draw. Maybe if they refine this to be strateigc it would add to the game but right now it simply removes it.4) Finally the games balance turns to crap because in the end most of the truly powerful cards in these types of games have extraordinary play costs making them a risky choice and difficult to bring into play but with the ever automatically increasing mana per turn this no longer applies so once we hit 9-10+ mana if you draw your supercard which is wildly powerful due to its mana cost you win I lose, if I draw it I win you lost because the cards at so insanely powerful for example a card might have 10 dmg 10 defense and when it comes into play it automatically does 4-6 dmg to every unit...in this game most units have 1-4 hp so it wipes the board and now you have a 10/10 unit that your only hope is a luck draw to to stop it since all your units just perished gg win to auto loss via pure random luck with no way to control zero counter play.So until they add more cards with actual interesting mechanics and if they tweek some poorly designed mechanics right now this is a basic deathmatch heavily based on luck which is the antithesis of what makes these card games fun. So it starts off fun, but before long it becomes bland and boring AF. Do not get suckered into buying packs off your initial experience give it some solid games like 50-100 normals before you truly have a feel for the game."",0"

"9332,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""A particually bad offender in respects to, """"The person with better cards will win so you better grind, but you have to grind against people with better decks or give us money in order to get the resorces to build a better deck.""""And yes, I am aware that the arena exists so you could grind there. But in order to get the dark brotherhood and madhouse cards, you need 4,500 gold in chunks of at least 1,000, so if you grind in the arena, the rate at which you'll acumulate the gold for those cards will be hampered so much that you won't be getting any of them for a very long time."",0"
"9333,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I totally love The Elder Scrolls Legends. The rune mechanic and the use of lanes set Legends apart, and give it more strategic depth than its main competitor Hearthstone. The art on the cards is really top-notch and I prefer the more realistic art style. The user interface isnâ€™t super intuitive at some points but always reacts very quickly. In general, Legends is pretty generous with its rewards from different game modes and if you put the time in each day you can amass a half-decent collection relatively quickly. Reaching the upper echelons of ranked play, however, will take some time, but collecting a refined list of cards is hugely satisfying, and the game seems to have what it takes in terms of gameplay and community to make spending the time worthwhile.

"9334,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I have been playing The Elder Scrolls: Legends for 9 months now. I've played through all of its open beta and now its release. The game play is fantastic, the community is enjoyable and supportive, and the depth in the game is what keeps me coming back for more. This game is, based on my experience, 300% more free to play than competiting card games.

"9335,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I LOVE IT !First i was struggling really hard ... Im no card game veteran, but a Elder Scrolls Series One.The Campaign is perfect for people new to such games, it is great to play a Card Games with Chars you are kind of familiar, because of The Elder Scrolls Series.I've started to play PvP as soon as it was availible and i was loosing one after another and thought myself wow what aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥game, so no recommendation to PvP for new players ... the next day i started the campaign more and it was pure fun.The story of the Campaign ist just awesome and is really interesting as usual in TES games. I recommend playing the Campaign anyways because it unlocks you tons of usefull Cards and Extras you will need to win PvPs later on.Give it a try, its free to play and even for people with a slow downloadrate fast to download,install & play.I surely can see myself spending tons of hours in this game and you should too :)Microtansactions are availible aswell, but especially in the begginning no need at all."",1"
"9336,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I have a little over 20 hours into the game, and I can honestly say it's worth the try!It might need some little changes in the future to keep it fresh for players, but It's extremely well constructed and blends TES lore perfectly with the game.I recomend it for anyone who is a fan of TCG's, strategy games, or TES in general"",1"
"9337,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I have played this long before it came on stream, while it was just in Beta.It's almost impossible to talk about The Elder Scrolls: Legends (TESL) without talking about Hearthstone, so let's compare.Coming from Hearthstone, TESL at first almost looked like a rip off. The mana system is the same, most of the abilities are the same and the way creatures fight and interact is also the same. However, with a few tweaks that seemed small at first, TESL has established itself as its own game, and a good one at that.The whole board is divided into two lanes, often equipped with some special ability for the creatures you play there. This in itself creates a much more strategic and dynamic game-play compared to hearthstone. The creatures in the different lanes are normally not allowed to interact with each other, although some cards can move them around and create interesting scenarios.On top of that, TESL has a much stronger defenders advantage in that you get to draw a card for each 5 damage lost to your hero/character. Some of those cards can also be played for free as you draw as well. With the addition of very little RNG elements, this makes for a much more dynamic game-play in terms of aggro vs mid-range vs control decks.Coming from Hearthstone, TESL was a refreshing experience, with generous drops for the f2p users out there and gave me back some of that good old Magic TG feeling without the awkwardness of trying to play Magic on a PC.I recommend you try it out. Especially if you are used to playing Hearthstone. The base game-play is the same so it's easy to learn, yet different enough to keep you playing it."",1"
"9338,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Absolutely love this game. It's easily my favorite DCCG. Coming from Hearthstone and want to know what sets it apart? This is based on probably a hundred or so hours playing the game using the Bethesda launcher. Here are the major differences from Hearthstone to get you started:1. Rewards, in general, are much more generous. This is partly because of point #3 with bigger deck sizes and can have 3 copies of many of the Legendaries. You get like 10-50 gold and a spare card (can even be Legendary or a pack!) every 3 wins instead of just 10 gold. WAY better. End of season rewards... I forget how HS works, but you get a ton of gold and soul gems and like 1-3 packs for end of season purely based on what rank you are. In addition, they release a new card every month, and you get 1-3 copies based on your rank as well! 1 copy at rank 9 or better, 2 copies at rank 5, 3 copies at rank 1. You can craft monthly cards anytime after that for ones you've missed, but you'll never find them in packs.2. Generally less RNG than HS. The randomness that is in the game (for the most part) has some interesting control, and not totally random. The really RNG cards typically aren't competitive, but still fun to throw 1 or 2 in your deck at times.3. Solo Arena. Basically like Versus Arena, but against enemy AI. You earn cards in a similar fashion, same type of 30-card draft, but against enemy AI with random lane and game start effects. Rewards are similar to HS as well. Guaranteed pack for playing, even if you lose all 3. Infinite time to play, THIS COUNTS FOR QUESTS. There is no timer for playing, so you can take forever or walk away to do something if you get pulled away. I think you can even log off and it will pick up right where you left off if you join back in. Same goes for Practice mode, which I'll go into later.4. Constructed decks have 50-70 cards, with 1 Unique copy of each Legendary allowed. If it's not Unique (the Golden circle at the top of some Legendary cards), you can still have 3 copies of a Legendary card, or any other card except ones marked Unique.5. Constructed ladder. You win, you gain a star. Lose, you lose a star. However, you can't go down in rank in a given month. You go down to a separate 2-star constellation (rank) called Serpent. Below rank 5, a Bonus Round will randomly be in a given match. In that match, the winner gains 2 stars. The loser still loses 1.6. Now for the big ones. Lanes. There are 2 of them. Yippee... you say sarcastically. But really it changes the play a LOT more than you'd think. I've heard it helps the defender. Left lane is normal. The right lane is, by default, the Shadow Lane. Every creature played here gains Cover for one turn. This can be played around and affected. Some cards can Move, or switch lanes, as part of their lane effects. Trust me when I say: 2 lanes are better than 1. I was made a believer.7. The other BIG one. Prophecies and Runes. Here's where things get really interesting. Each player has 5 runes to start the game, at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 health. When your health drops below 25 for any reason, no matter whose turn it is), you draw a card. If it has the Prophecy keyword, you get to play the card IMMEDIATELY (even during your opponent's turn), for no magicka cost, if you so choose. You can also choose to put the card in your hand. This rule goes for both players with all decks in every game type. This obviously has HUGE implications. Because there aren't many cards with Prophecy, breaking Runes in and of itself is an important decision every time. The only exception to this rule and all others is, if any player ever drops below 1 health for any reason on any turn, the game is over. Prophecies can be skipped in this way, if 6 damage is done in one attack, the last rune is """"skipped"""". Knowing what class and colors you're playing against is key to playing around potential effects during your turn. Speaking of colors and classes...8. Card colors / classes / card synergy / creativity. There are 5 colors, Red (Strength), Green (Agility), Blue (Intelligence), Yellow (Willpower), Purple (Endurance), plus Neutral (gray). Each color has a general theme, but can play any archetype (won't be top tier, but a taste of it). This is for balance, variety, synergy, and creativity. For example, Purple cards generally are stickier with slightly higher stats. Many Green cards are reactive or mobile (can Move between lanes). The 10 classes are all combinations of 2 of the 5 colors, plus Neutral cards can be in any deck. The Summon ability will activate any time that card comes into play, even if another card summons it. This makes for MUCH more card synergy than Battlecry in HS, which only activated when the card was played from your hand.9. You can play Practice mode to get soul gems. 5 for a win against Easy, 10 against Normal, 15 against Expert. 300 gems per day cap. A Legendary every 4 days if you max it. Not bad with very fast aggro decks like mono red. You play against a random class with standard lane effects and starting conditions.10. Chaos Arena is very fun and helps shakes things up once a month for the weekend. Random lane conditions and special conditions even on top of that sometimes. It's the first """"new"""" game mode they've introduced.11. A few new keywords. Haven't played HS in a while so some of these may be dupes. Breakthrough lets you overkill a creature into their face for damage. Pilfer activates any time the creature damages the enemy hero. Regenerate brings that creatures current health back to maximum at the beginning of your turn. Drain gives your hero back the same amount of health as the attack damage it deals.12. No Secrets (Prophecies fill that role), but Supports instead. These are either limited use or perpetual, until removed. There are a few cards that can remove Supports. They typically either buff all your creatures while in play, summon a creature per turn, or buff 1 of your creatures with limited uses.13. A few cards trigger if you have more health than your opponent. You may have noticed that 2 lanes and Runes / Prophecy tend to favor the defender, but clearly this favors the aggressor to maintain balance. These mighty few let aggro decks maintain momentum through all those extra (and potentially free) cards.14. Heroes can never attack. Can't equip your hero with items. No hero powers. This makes cards, card draw, and X/1's more valuable since there are fewer ways to kill them without requiring a finite resource.15. Card costs in soul gems (shards in HS). Legendaries in TESL cost 1200. Epics cost 400. Rares cost 100. Commons cost 40 (I think)."",1"

"9343,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""A good card game. I know it's a bit clichÃ© to compare it to Hearthstone but the mechanics are very close, so I think it's only fair to make some comparisons. Very close to Hearthstone in terms of gameplay which can be a good & a bad thing. A few interesting mechanics: - When you lose health, runes breaks every 5 damage, and you draw a card so it balances the game when you're getting stomped or you have only one card to play in your hand. Prophecy cards can also be played for free when runes break.- Two lanes, each with their own playstyle, which makes for interesting strategic choices.- Cards can level up (not during gameplay, I mean permanently upgrade). It feels more fair and less RNJ than Hearthsone but still not as fair as Magic or Gwent. Generous when it comes to giving packs and resources to craft cards. A campaign with some cutscenes and a solo (versus IA) arena mode.  It's free, if you like the Elder Scrolls universe (or not), try it out. "",1"

I'm kinda on the fence here. I like it for the most part, but the fact that its random can mean some pretty big swings. - lot of legendaries are not unique so you have to craft 3 instead of 1, kind of a dust sink in my opinion.

"9345,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I haven't played card games beyond Gwent, both the mini-game and its independent variant.

"9348,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I keep saying I don't like games like this, I keep saying how 'card games' are not my ''thing'' and yet certain ones will come around and disprove me, they'll lull me in and a few hours later I am hoooked, and this is one of those games.I've played 2 hours of Elder Scrolls: Legends so far so my review isn't a review of the entrire game as such but more an impression of the game after giving it what I feel is ample time to get a idea of what the game is about.  The battles themself are a mix of really easy and really bloody hard, and so tactics play a big part of card selection, attacking, defending and buffing your cards to inflict damage but also to keep the enemies away from you.  I struggled with this taking 5 attempts to do the early Wolves battle but as sh arp as I felt the learning curve was it made me want to beat it to stick the middle finger up at it and say 'there i beat you MF'er' and I suppose ultimately that is what you want, a game that is not too easy or two hard but requires you to think a little more tactically each time you face an opponent.I did see that there was DLC, for a free game it's not really an issue as there's plenty to keep you occupied and to be unlocked if you are willing to put the time and effort into playing it although I can understand if some want to save time or simply have to have everything at their disposal to play with.Overall a great game and would recommend people at least try it once."",1"

It's refreshingly challenging, and doesn't feel like a clone of other card games.

The nerdy kind.I must admit to the fact that I have never played a table top styled card game like this but this game was surprisingly fun. i mean, it was actually fun and enjoyable. It is certainly no epic adventure where you lose hours, but it is simple and fun.If asked I really think this game belongs in the Elder Scrolls series under one condition. Rename it"

I look forward to the moblie download for android and such to play on the go. I highly I highly recommend it to any elder scrolls fan if you also like card games. It is like HearthStone, with more additions in mechanices and gameplay which is very unique in it's own right.

"9355,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""So I don't write reviews. Not usually. Anyways, I found this little gem about a week ago and so far I have 28 or so hours on it. It is F2P and although you can buy packs and advance faster in story to get more cards it is not P2W game and you can easilt and with good strategy take out someone who paid money.The only problem is that sometime you get into a PVP battle where the combination of cards on the other side is just ridiculously stupid and you get you behind handed to you on a platinum platter.Overall, fairly easy to get cards either from purchasing with gold, finishng quests, ranking, leveling... and crafting too.I find it to be a fun game and the part that you can build from two different type of cards + hybrid cards + colorless cards is great.Also, I have not seen the same deck playing against me and there are so many ways and deck building ideas to try that it really helps the game moving on even after so many hours. The decks are of at least 50 cards and you get to play about 20-30 in a normal match so although you can get great combos, it is more about adjusting rather than oh yeah i do 1,2,3 and thats it.Also the fact that there are two lanes to play is great and cool.My opponent got a card that let him play a card if his HP was greater than mine, he pooled the same card that left him play a card that made the next card cost 6 less mana and got demolished the next turn.  11/10 will do that again just."",1"
"9356,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""By the egg, a fine battle.- For reasons unknown, I am enjoying this far more than I ever did Hearthstone. Perhaps it's the refined, mature art style"
"9357,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I think this is the best card game available online right now if you love the mana/magicka system, creature to creature combat and a deep strategy experience. The two lanes and the runes add a lot more in depth to playing and deck building than obvious at first glance. It is F2P playable, meaning that the rewards you can get by playing are really generous and capable of getting you a T1 deck in a reasonable timeframe. Not to mention that the developers really care about the game and the community and not only about their revenues - as of today you can get daily Twitch drops which are worth like 10â‚¬/$, you get daily quests for gold, arena can give you 4packs + entry fee for 7wins and you can even farm the ai for soul gems."",1"
9358,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,My favorite card game right now and for the foreseeable future. Low RNG dependence (not completely without some crazy stuff though) and a wide variety of viable deck types in an evolving meta.,1
"9359,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Updated June 30, 2017:If you are or were a fan of Blizzard's hearthstone, but despise Blizzard, then this is your """"light at the end of the tunnel"""".A masterpiece card game that raises the bar for the genre to yet unsurpassed levels of excellence. Truly an ultimate achievement from the guys who brought us the Elder Scrolls.All of the lore is in this game. The racial elements, and all of the """"awesome-sauce"""" from the RPGs. Making it a great experience to play. Addicting as hell, so beware"
"9360,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I've been playing this game for about 3 or 4 months now and really enjoy it, my hours will say they are low because I've played through the bethesda launcher. Compared to other CCG's it is very generous. I've played f2p the entire time and have quite a nice collection of epics and legendaries. You get card rewards (including legendaries), gold, and sometimes even pack rewards for leveling up, and you get daily quests that give gold (in game currency) as well. You even get gold and cards (sometimes even a booster pack) everytime you win 3 games. You can use this gold to play arena versus players or the AI in solo arena mode. Both arena modes give fantastic rewards and is where I have gotten most of my collection so far. In fact I bought the newest """"Dark Brotherhood"""" expansion entirely from in game gold I earned. The best part of this game to me is the card interaction between so many different cards, and games are not decided before a match begins because of classes or archetype. Decks are very fun to build and even after being around for the better part of a year there are still many """"new"""" interactions and decks to be discovered, especially with new monthly cards and certainly future expansions. The meta is not just 1 or 2 decks like """"Quest rogue"""" or """"Pirate warrior"""". It is exceptionally varied and changes up quite often when new cards get released or something new is discovered. But even when the meta sticks around for a bit there are always decks to build and counter them.Another great thing about this game is the fantastic community. Between avid streamers, youtube content creators, and player-run tournaments, there are plenty of ways to have fun and learn more about the game. Some tips for new players:-Leveling up card rewards are based on your avatar you choose, and you can change it at anytime.-Arena is the best place to get packs and new cards, once you learn the game it becomes quite easy to get multiple booster packs for one arena ticket.-It is not always a good idea to just hit face because of the runes and prophecy mechanics, which make this game very interesting and strategic."",1"
"9361,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Most Generous CCG I've ever played.  Because you can earn dust vs the AI, you can grind an Epic card in about one day, and a Legendary card every 4 days!  This makes this an extremely fun game to play as F2P.  If there is an awesome deck that you dont have the cards for, you can grind them up in a very reasonable amount of time.This is my go to CCG, and I have tried them all.  I can't wait for the mobile release this summer!"",1"
"9362,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Great card game with innovative mechanics, a good amount of complexity in the types of strategies and decks you can have, and a good reward system for people like me who prefer to earn things in F2P games instead of paying for them. Everything in this game, including the recent expansion, can be bought with in-game gold that you earn through daily quests, ladder matches, arena matches, etc. I would reccommend using gold for Arena playthroughs over directly buying packs, as Arena playthroughs give you gold and a pack at the end.Worth playing for any CCG fans or just Elder Scrolls fans in general."",1"
"9363,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Easily my favorite card game. There are a lot of little things that I really enjoy about it, but there are two big factors for me. Legends has two lanes, that (with rare exceptions) do not interact with each other. One if the field lane, which is exactly like Hearthstone's board. The other is the shadow lane, which is the same with the exception that all minions summoned here gain stealth (they can't be attacked) for one turn. The shadow lane mechanic effectively makes board control non-binary, which makes games dramatically more interesting. Then there are prophecies and runes. You have 30 health, and at each interval of 5 beneath that you have a rune (25/20/15/10/5). When you reach that health value, the rune triggers and you draw a card. This is a nice catch up mechanic in and of itself, but then there are cards with the ability """"Prophecy"""". These cards are able to be played for free, immediately when you draw them off of a rune. Prophecies at seemed like awful RNG, but they've grown on me quite a lot. They add a lot of depth and decision making processes that otherwise wouldn't be there, and the rng they add overall is still quite a lot less than land in MTG or just good old fashion randomness in Hearthstone.These two mechanics together make games feel a lot more unique and gives me a lot more to think about compared to Hearthstone, but still has the same basic gameplay pattern and ease of play that made me love Hearthstone all those years ago."",1"
"9364,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""As somebody who has spent many hours in the beta through the Bethesda Launcher days, I want to say this being on steam eliminates some of the old launchers hassle, while expanding it's horizon. I'm not a card game player, but this is the first that caught my undivided attention. For new players I would suggest visiting the Legends Deck site, the Reddit page for legends, and watching some of the streamers like CVH and Justin Larson. Those sources will teach you how to build the best decks, play more strategically, and what cards are best to craft first for newcomers! Enjoy! May we meet on the ladder."",1"
"9365,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I grabbed this game for two reasons: 1. Elder Scrolls Obssession2. It Was FreeI was very pleased to find a game that, so far, I haven't had to spend money on to be able to play. You can purchase booster packs with in-game currency.  The game itself is simple and elegant. Pick two colors to base your deck on and go to town. The single player tutorial/story mode is pretty good and so far the people I've come up against have been good sports, win or lose.The Prophecy mechanics are really wha separate this game from other TCGs.  you have 30 life.  For every 5 life you lose, you draw one of your rune cards.  These are random cards from your deck.  If a rune card has the keyword prophecy, it plays for free.  I haven won (and lost) several games that seemed certain to be about over based on someone's drawing of a prophecy card.Overall, I'd say 9/10."",1"
"9366,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Don't let my time played fool you. I played this in closed beta and for quite some time on the Bethesda launcher. If you are long time MTG player and could never fully enjoy hearthstone, this is the F2P card game for you. I love The Elder Scrolls series and I love the lore and fan-tribute in the game. If you love MTG and Elder Scrolls this game is for you. Love this game."",1"
"9367,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I played this game quite a bit before it came to Steam, and I can safely say I recommend it. It is free to play yet it doesn't feel like a grind, or you are at a disadvantage all the time. You are rewarded more generously than other card games so you actually have a chance to make the decks and get the cards that you want. It is much deeper, strategic, and skill based than other card games"
"9368,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I like it more than Hearthstone tbh. I've playing for a few days and I already have more legendaries and WAY more epics than in HS, and I've playing that game for almost a year. Also you get 6 cards per pack, and I think drop rates are a lot better adjusted.Mecahnically the game is basically Hearthstone with a few new things so it's all good. Plus TES has great lore, if you're tired of working so much for a single legendary in HS play this, you'll love it."",1"
9369,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,One of the very best online card games. More depth and less random than Hearthstone.Game is really rewarding with cards and gold. Single player solo arena is a fun feature to play at the beginning.,1
"9370,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Played this game ever since the closed beta started, it's very good for a card game. Not everyone's cup of tea if you don't like CCGs, but I would suggest trying the game out. It's not Pay to Win and has fun mechanics and cards."",1"
"9371,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""DISCLAIMER: It says i've only played an hour but i've played on the bethesda launcher before.I love this game, why? i love it because the randomness is near non existing. Of course you've got your card draw randomness but besides that it is completely skillbased. I recommend it!"",1"
"9372,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Ok here we go. I played this game since the closed Beta a year ago.For the people who talk about P2W, sorry but this game give you so many chances to get cards as no other. Every 3 win you get Gold(different amount but between 15 and 50) AND a random Card which can be a Legendary. There is also a Solo Arena against bot, early stage easy to get through and win stuff. Also the battle against AI give you soulshards with which you can craft cards.Also the Campaign/Tutorial give you cards and not only crap. To grap Packs you can pay real money or spend the gold you grap by winning 3 games or by completing the daily Quests from which you can choose everytime between two, so you can choose the quest which fits you more. Sure to get up in the ladder you need some cards but its like in other card games.Very nice compared to other card games is that there are many many decks you can build and win games. Also there is no dominating style like in HS aggro. The Lane System works nice and give the player some strategy to play around. Also to attack always face is not that great because every time you brake one Rune the enemy draws a gard, if it is a Prophecy the player can play the card for free right away.For me this game is well balanced and give players a good chance to collect cards and get up the ladder. Also the RNG stuff is not that high as in HS where everything can happen. So in my eyes try the game, play the campange and then try some normal games(for beginning not ladder)."",1"
"9373,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I have played this game for around 2 months now and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It can be a bit of a grind at times but what F2P game isn't? It seems to be a much fairer and overall better version of hearthstone which I also spent many months playing. You get good value from the Arena, the Story mode is something special which I don't see in many other card games and the rune system makes it possible to win even when behind if you get some prophecys. Overall would rate it a solid 9/10."",1"
"9374,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I love this game, it has nice soundtrack, really good story and the art is nice. It adds more to the lore and continues from where Skyrim left off. One thing i would suggest to the devs is that they'd add some small lore in each of the cards, some quotes or passages from ingame lore and books, like in Witcher gwent."",1"
"9375,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""There seem to be plenty of reviews from the perspective of people who are CCG veterans, but not many from the CCG novice. I will writing this review as someone for whom TES: Legends is their first CCG. I have also been playing the game for about 6 months via the Bethesda launcher, so the low hours recorded on Steam is not accurate.TESL provides an excellent new player experience for those unfamiliar with CCG mechanics. Not only did it gently, but firmly, move me towards understanding the concept of a creature-based card game as a whole, but it also smoothly integrated the game's unique mechanics into the learning process as well, such as the lane and prophecy systems. Not only that, but during the Story campaign (which serves as an extended tutorial) you are provided with five separate decks for free that allow you to experience different classes and archetypes of play. While it is relatively easy to move through most of the story using these reconstructed decks, the final encounter of the campaign is difficult enough that it forced me into the deck builder to try and craft a deck that was better than the starter decks. While veteran CCG players might scoff at the difficulty of the PvE campaign, for a new CCG player, there were some legitimate challenges that forced me to learn the mechanics and think about my choices. As I result, I felt much more prepared for when I began challenging actual humans not long after.As a F2P title, the monezation of the game needs to be addressed. Overall, I feel that TESL offers great value simply by playing the game, either by winning consistently on the ladder, or by competing in VS/Solo Arena. All told, it is quite viable to be a F2P player and have a lot of fun in the game, and there are plenty of people over on the subreddit who have hit Legend using nothing but F2P decks. I think it is necessary to mention that I am NOT a F2P player, but given the minimal monetary investment I have put into this game, I feel like I have been provided a solid foundation that allows me to avoid spending money later, rather than feeling like I need to continuously inject cash to stay competitive. For a game that I play casually, this is very important to me, and I imagine many others as well.Finally, I need to talk about the setting. As an Elder Scrolls fan, I love being able to recognize the references in the card collection, and feel that the abilities, artwork, and voice lines all complement the characters they are intended to potray. some of the card references are fairly obscure, too. while Odhaviing, Miraak, or Divayth Fyr may be immediately recognizable to many TES veterans, characters such as Ahnassi, Gortwog, and Allena Benoch I needed to look up.TL"
"9376,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I've never played card games unless you count Monopoly. This is my first and its not the least overwhelming with game knowledge. Its simply, easy and fun to follow. Ithink I'm going to be playing this for the weekend then give another review but right now as it stand, I would recommend this game."",1"
"9377,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Played this game alot before it came to Steam. An excellent choice for card game if you're looking for something fresh. The lane, rune and colour mechanics are all refreshing for the genre."",1"
"9378,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Despite not besting Hearthstone in terms of playerbase, The Elder Scrolls Legends has most certainly outdone Blizzard's RNG-fest in terms of gameplay.  Set in the rich universe of TES series, Legends is an excellently balanced card game that offers a rewarding experience, regardless of whether you win or lose.  Not once have I felt like I lost because the game's RNG cheated me out of a win (except against the A.I., which does tend to be gamey, but at least it offers a challenge).  There's a variety of modes in the game, including a Story Mode which mainly serves to introduce you to the game mechanices and offers rewards such as starter packs and beggining resources, a practice mode where you can grind for Soul Gems (this game's version of Hearthstone's Dust) or try out your new decks, a solo arena and vs. arena, for single player or multiplayer, and finally play mode, which is the standard multiplayer experience of the game, with ranked and unranked options available.  Throughout each mode, you can acquire resources to earn card packs or individual cards in a manner similiar to Hearthstone, which is by purchasing a pack for 100 gold, or summoning cards with Soul Gems individually.  F2P players should feel fully capable of gathering the base cards without any need of spending money, though the game is of high enough quality to where it deserves a few card packs to be paid for here and there.  You can also unlock the first expansion for the game, that being the Dark Brotherhood, with gold, though each chapter is priced at 1,000 gold.  A bit excessive, but the expansion is only $20.  Even so, you don't need the cards that the expansion comes with to be competitive.  I was able to reach Rank 9 in ranked play with base cards, which is where you earn the rewards for the month.  You also can't de-rank back to square one in this game, which is incredibly fair and much appreciated by myself.  Instead, what happens is that you'll need to win two extra games to go back to climbing up the ladder that you are currently on.  Much better than getting squashed all the way to the bottom rung like in HS, if you ask me.The cards in the game fall under six different categories"
"9379,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Like everyone else I played Hearthstone for a long time and like many who did, I wasn't really too happy with the direction it was heading, particularly due to the ever increasing randomness on cards. Legends tones the randomness way down, though some will argue the prophecy system is still too random, while simultaneously having a lot more depth to it. The introduction of the shadow lane, where your creatures can not be attacked by other minions until the next turn, is one of the best ideas they've come up with. It adds a lot of strategy to the game and makes it so that your big guys have a reasonable chance to survive a turn, which is great if you're like me and enjoy just slamming down big dudes. The card is art is the best I've seen in any cardgame, although the board is a bit lackluster and I'm hoping they'll introduce new boards as we go along. Overal definitely recommended."",1"
"9380,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""fun and mind games. 9 out of 10this is a fun game if you like card games like pokemon or yu-gi-oh, its free wich is a + and it has allot of callbacks to skyrim and oblivion, its balenced on all teams but it dose have 2 bugs that have annoyed me but havent over-shadowed the game. ((not counting the magic and giving you you're tern but not giving you magic or a card for your tern)) it will take up hours of your life if you love card games, you always have to think about what the other player has in his/her deck+hand and thats what makes it hard but really fun, to the people who made this game, thank you!"",1"
"9381,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""This game is very good. The new expansion brought new mechanics that are sure to modify some metas and that is perfect. Upon logging to this Skyrim expansion, you will also get a free random deck, composed of both some old and new cards, which is a nice touch. The 2 lane system is refreshing, so is the rune/prophecy system, giving it a edge over the competition. Of course, some will say """"pay to win"""", and yes, those who can buy packs or campaigns will get a wider choice of cards for their desks, but it's still achievable, with patience, for a totally free to play player to beat one who spent. Strategy plays a good role, although, being a card game, RNG is here and can work for or against you. The production value is set pretty high, as cards are voiced, making it feel a but more immersive. If you love card games, this one has plenty to offer. Of course, be warned you will have to win quite a few matches/level up to save up gold to unlock campaign or arena tries. I took time to pass over 100 hours to give my true """"free to play"""" opinion, and sincerly, even if some decks completely destroyed me, most of the time, strategy and a good flowing deck made experience very enjoyable.

"9393,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""It's like eating a juicy dirty burger, except better. Therefore I recommend this game period. oh, plus solo arena and upcoming in game tournaments, you don't get that in burgers very often.On a serious note, your hearthstone playing skills brain data can be transfered over to this game. Nice of the developers to incorporate that feature.10/10Update (10th July 17): After the release of heroes of skyrim and 30 hours into the game, been playing a lot of solo arena and some ranked matches, I have already started to lose interest in the game and getting bored more often. It just dosen't have that FUN factor that I get with hearthstone. With hearthstone, I get plenty of good laughs which makes it a happy game, where as legends just feels dark and somewhat sad. I tried to like this game, hopefully leaving hearthstone behind after 3 years but It just dosen't quite make the cut. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent game (I recommend), I enjoyed the first few hours due to the exitement of a new card game but it's just not appealing enough for a hearthstone veteran like me.

Compared to Hearthstone, the amount of stuff they just give away in this game is astounding. You get a free card for every three ranked wins, and PVE wins reward you with crafting materials.This game is quite simply one of the best on the market, and I can't recommend it enough.

"9395,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""ESL is a solid trading card game with inevitable comparisons being drawn between it and Hearthstone and MTG.  Overall, ESL is a bit more straightforward than MTG (fewer overall cards and no land cards to play in ESL), and in a number of respects is therefore more similar to Hearthstone.  Overall, I recommend giving ESL a try - play through the free missions and decide whether or not you like it enough to continue playing.  Be forewarned, though, the latest DLC is *not* free - you'll have to cough up $20 in order to play it, if you're so inclined."",1"
"9396,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""This game is absolutely fantastic.

This is the game I can recommend more highly than any other in my steam library."",1"
"9397,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""By far the best card game card game out there. Great story mode and very generous rewards if you choose to go the F2P route. You should be able to fully craft even a top tier deck in about two weeks, and it just gets easier from there."",1"
"9398,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Consensus: Has every single problem with these types of card games and worse. Honestly one of the worst pay to win games I've ever come across. At least Hearthstone lets you earn broken card packs through daily challenge but with the Elder Scrolls: Legends you actually have to pay REAL MONEY to earn them. A very good chuck of the cards are locked behind a paywall which is honestly the worst thing you can do in a game especially when those cards are INSANELY GOOD.Positives:- Low card count makes the game easier for new players- Campaign mode for offline/learning opportunities - Multiple combinations of classes.- Rewards for playing.- Ability to recycling unwanted cards.- Ranked gamemode with seasonal rewards.- It's free.Negatives:- Low card count means less variety in builds.- Campaign mode would insult anyone seriously invested in the current lore.- Classes are a dead giveaway of what the player is building. Some classes are clearly better than others.- Rewards aren't good, most of the time they give out unwanted duplicates.- Card recycling gives out terrible returns.- Ranked play isn't ranked. Everyone starts out at rank 0 so pros get paired with new players and it's a terrible experience for everyone involved.- Microtransactions everywhere. Heavy reliance on gambling.Inherent Negatives with this Genre:- Too much reliance on RNG.- Quick play doesn't search for fairness, it searches for speed.

"9400,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""It's a less pay-2-win and far more balanced version of Hearthstone. I have spent Â£15 and have more than half of all the cards and it's extremely easy to earn packs in-game for free. 10 hours into the game and I already had a close to complete """"meta deck"""". The 2 lane system is a nice addition compared to other card games and it works really well."",1"
"9401,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""If your sick of hearthtone but still love the gameply, this is a fun game to least try. It does a fantastic job teaching necommers how to play, and the campain it has is superp. Ive had a great deal of fun already, so I invite you to join the fun!"",1"
"9402,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Overall pretty good game for a card game, similar to hearthstone but based off the Elder scrolls world. So if you know that world better than WoW, this might be the game for you. The PvE side of it is pretty good as well, provides somewhat stories with choice and you technically never have to play against a real player if you dont want to, thanks to the pve arena.Biggest downfall which i very dislike, you cant create the cards that are in special bundles. So of course more pay to win than id prefer with a competitive game. The reason I want to highlight this out is because they have a description for The madhouse bundle stating: """"we've added some cards thatll really help balance out certain decks and help the game"""". BUT you have to pay $10 just to get a bundle of cards.Regardless of the pay to win issue that arises in these current meta card games that force you to buy their content to help maintane a competive advantage with exclusive/OP cards, the games fun in its simple form. Also im sure if you really wanted to while refusing to pay could find answers to said OP cards. I give the game total a 6/10 due to it being a similar card game ban wagon and refusal to fix the pay to win gap. (Cuz revenue is always better than player experience, we all know how the business world works). If your ok with spending money on digital cards, the game deserves 8/10 for its unique card functions and creativity compared to other card games.This last paragraph is edited: As Necrophagist pointed out, u can use your ingame gold to purchase said content above. Which is a good alternative, it just takes quite awhile to rack up said gold to purchase such a small portion of the games content. So i've decided to change the total rating to 7/10 due to that alternative."",1"
"9403,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Awesome game, no need to spend a cent! Fun for a lot of hours, 100+ easy. I played on Bethesda Launcher and my iPad a lot. Glad it's on Steam now, so I have all my games together!Better than Gwent."",1"
"9404,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I love this game.Mandatory disclaimer, I've been playing this game prior to its Steam launch in open beta and on the Bethesda launcher, so I'm not new to the game.However, I have decided to stick with this game for various reasons, the main one being that it does a lot of things better gameplay wise than it's older and much bigger cousin Hearthstone. The gameplay is fantastic and demands a lot more strategy and planning, whilst reducing the RNG to much lower levels. I always felt after a game that I could pinpoint exactly where my deck choice, deckbuilding or play ultimately led to defeat or victory and hence enjoy this game a lot more competitively as there are just far fewer occasions where one big RNG swing led me to lose and often tilt for a while.The prophecy mechanic and reduction in RNG means the meta is a lot more balanced, with aggro actually not being very strong currently (again, unlike for TESLs cousin Hearthstone).Overall the meta is very balanced, with various deck archetypes being viable, which makes the game alwasy very interesting!As drawbacks I would definitely quote the aesthetics of the game. The premiums are often not very impressive compared to what we know from other games (notably Gwent is doing this very well), but the biggest thing is the gameboard, which really ought to be at the top of Bethesda's/Direwolf's priority list as it's just the same grey scroll background whether you're in the main menu or in every single game.Overall I really love this game and am looking forward to the competitive scene that will emerge and make use of the fantastic and skill-testing gameplay."",1"
"9405,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Basic mechanics similar with heartstone  but some diffirences to like board is split from mid to 4/4 (max 8 minion for each player) left lane is field lane right lane is shadow lane. Right lane is completely basic but shadow lane gives stealth for 1 turn  (stealth minions can't be targeted by enemy minions but can be targeted by actions, supports, battlecry and deathrattle effects) and unlike heartstone when you summon a battlecry minion with another way than playing  (like evolve) you can use battlecry.  Game is pay to win of course but with daily quests and monthly claim rewards it's easy to make money. Game don't have very much expansions yet but slowly more coming.  Game got story modes  (3 part each one costs 1000 gold) are pretty fun to play i highly recommend the game if you like this kind of card games."",1"
"9406,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""8/10Best free to play card game I've ever played, and I've played many :)It's very fast paced, and easy to learn, plus you can make endless interesting decks. If you're a fan of the Elder Scrolls series then you'll love all the references, plus you don't have to invest any money into the game and still have just as much fun as a pay to play player, however unfortunately top decks use the same strategies and cards, which is a huge no no for a card game, especially one introducing itself to the community.Pros: Fast pacedFree to play players can do just as good as pay to playGood early on playability.Cons:Game is unbalanced at timesTop meta decks usually use the same cards and strategy"",1"
"9407,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I'm gonna be honest, I never intended to try this. I'm not a huge fan of TES, but I do love the series and it's atmosphere. I was convinced this was simply another Heartstone ripoff, aimed to steal the audience. I imagined it as a cheap clone, because honestly, that's what it seemed like. I couldn't be more wrong. From games like MTG and Pokemon, where mechanics almost never change, to YGO, where a new one is introduced every other year (and it forces half the players to quit, because it gets worse and worse), to HS - the ultimate softcore TCG, I couldn't believe how TES: Legends achieved so much in inovation and freshness with just a few simple, but well placed mechanics. It really has to be tried to be understood.From the fact that it offers somewhat of a story mode, with actual content and choices, which reflect on your collection and individual cards, to the battlefield with two lanes, each offering different strategic options, via modifiers or simply via controlling the two lanes so you can manipulate your oponent into reacting in a manner that suits your intents, there is clearly a great amount of thought and design put into this TCG. And honestly, as someone who's always fallen for TCG games, this is one of the best I've played and the only one that actually takes advantage of being digital in way, that enchances gameplay - it's a feature that I've wanted to see in a digital TCG forever! In conclusion: if you are a TES or TCG fan, you deffinetely need to give this a spin. There is always a possibility of it not being up your alley, but beyond that (and certain meta/balance complaints that are always a given in TCGs), there is absolutely no reason for this game to be NOT recommended. It's an absolute gem."",1"
"9408,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I think it's a very good game, it contains the Heartstone feel, but got even more mechanics. The only downside i could find very fast is that if you want to continue the story, you have to cash out in my opinion quite allot for so little. It's fair that they take payments for more content, but i think it's very expensive. If you donÃ¦t like to play against player, this isn't for you, i think, but if you do like that, then you should try this out. Also, the voice actin is pretty bad, ESPECIALY in the payed story line, for example the storytellers voice has changed, pls fix Bethesda.So, all in all, a very good game that's similar to Heartstone, but it's a bit expensive when it comes to additional content (booster packs, story line)"",1"
"9409,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Seems like a solid alternative to Heathstone. Hearth is slightly more polished and flashy, but if Blizzard's lore does nothing for you, while Elder Scrolls does, this is likely the card battler for you."",1"
"9410,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""It's a improved Hearthstone, in all aspects that matter anyway.  Hearthstone is a more casual Magic, TESL still is a casual Magic but with more depth than HS. But the best aspect of this game is that you can trully play it competitively for free. The  in-game rewards are more than enough for you to make a top deck in less than a month. Not that you need to play it competitively, you can always just build a custom deck and still have fun, the Arena mode is a great place for that kind of fun."",1"
"9411,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Second Review after bout 500 hours.My first Review was positive. Its still a good CCG. No paywall, no p2w. Good mecanics. Play for free for a long time.Good learning curve. Good ingame rewards for successful playing and free card / gold drops by connecting account to twitch.But...In the long run it lacks a good meta for multiplayer. You have ranked play that reset every month. So you have to climb the ladder again and again and thats not a competition, it feels like a senseless grind.Those weekend events just give you more """"ingame"""" but after playing for a long time you got enough cards.What leads to a bad overall result is a broken core mechanic all CCGs suffer. And thats randomness and luck factor, the developers decided to boost this more and more instead to reduce it.After a while you realize you win by luck and lose by bad luck. This become so frustrating cause its not rewarding in any matter. you dont feel good win by luck, but you feel bad by losing by opponents luck/your bad luck.I also expect there is some kind of cheat/hack around that manipulate the  randomness of own/opponent card draw. Its hard to have evidence bout this, cause it can all be luck or bad luck. But i cant belive some people are constantly more lucky than others.Its my opinion, and it poisened the rest of the fun i had playing combos of cards in casual mode and rarely get those going in ranked mode. Generally this free to play game suffers same issue all free to play games suffer in the long run:Everyone can create as many accounts as he wish, so a ban of trolls and grief players is impossible.Despite its  a multiplayer game, there is no teamplay possible. There is a social UI where you can even spectate your friends games, but it dont make any sense, cause everyone plays on his own versus others who play on their own.So for what you will play this? Till you have your stack of cards that make you win some games in multiplayer its a salty way. After you have a competitive deck, you need competition. There is no competition in a game where luck always defeat skill and expirience.I regret now i spendet some money and so much time on this game. It was a waste of time and looking back i was more angry/frustrated playing this game than happy and joyful. The greed of getting/crafting better cards and the hope of getting """"better by time and expirience"""" held me captive so long. By creating an illusion this game is very succsessful.Be aware, compared to other multiplayer games that reward you at least with some nice memories or new friends this leaves you with nothing but a black hole. This must be like, if you awake from a drug consume.Lesson learned, keep your hands of CCGs and free to play multiplayer games with a big russian community.Deinstalled.Best regards "",0"
"9412,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Honestly the best card game I have ever played. However, I love Elder Scrolls and pretty much any game by bethesda, but this one will keep you entertained for a long time.  I mean I have put over 150 hours if that tells you anything."",1"
"9413,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Even though I've played this game a lot, I cannot recommend it in its current state. Growing up with MTG is likely the reason why I stick to this pile of inconsistencies and randomness while listening to podcasts. The amount of disconnects and """"weird"""" hard to document occurences dampen the enjoyment a lot, but since I only spent 10 Euros on this, besides the easily 400 hours I could've used to learn Mandarin, I keep playing. The loop has me hooked. Were I to spend money on cards I could build better decks, for sure."",0"
"9414,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""This is basically a Hearthstone rip off will Elder Scrolls lore. That doesn't mean it's bad though. Listing the pros:Elder Scrolls: Legends allows more freedom when it comes to deck building, no need to restrict yourself to 30, instead, you can have a max of 70 cards if you want. The art is really nice, and the plethora of cards you can make and get equal nearly unlimited deck building.Thats mostly where my compliments for this game ends.This game is NOT heavy on PTW in my opinion, however, it is highly RNG based. You play a 10 minute game, successfully put up guards, lethals, charges, (those are types of cards) whatever you may want, only to go from about 25 to 30 health to 0 to -10 in a matter of 2 turns. People in this game either play extremely defensively to the point that you're fighting an indestructable turtle, or they play hyper aggressive with lethals and """"vampire"""" cards.Now that I got the salt out of my system from losing 4 consecutive matches with a strength/willpower deck to a bunch of agility/endurance decks (good luck beating them), this game is all and all basically just Hearthstone with more depth and more freedom. If you like that, play it.Oh and this game is free, which is nice."",1"

"9416,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I really enjoy this RPG card game on PC, Tablet, and phone - the graphics and animations are great ... story line sticks to The Elder Scrolls settings and surroundings, the game is easy to understand without a steap learning curve.  You can earn coin to purchase different card packs and backs, or purchase items with actual money as well.  This does not affect the game play if you do not purchase with actual money - you can build your decks by your winnings over time if you choose to do so.  There are plenty of competitions to engage in and trials to over come."",1"
"9417,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I Have been playing this game since beta and i really do love it, i am a fan of these games and a massive elder scrolls fan so i would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of either and more so to those a fan of both."",1"
"9418,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""The free campaign is great, greatly narrated and the choice cards are good, But the Dark Brotherhood expansion is a rip off.I spent money on having that expansion only to find that the computer cheats and the developers designed the challenges to be ungodly hard.For instance, oh Warning Spoilers though I'll try and be brief.You go to assassin's house, you either kill or talk, I chose talk, and you show him your skills. He not all that challenging.He gives you his contract and you get to go too two places, because he has to be at either places, I finally found the right place after a difficult battle. you go to assassinate him.Turns out its a TIMED BATTLE! which I hate, but oh no they don't stop there it gets even better! (you can't see the sarcasm but its there!) If you play in the left lane your shackled for a round, if you go on the right you can be knocked into the left lane. add a timer that CANNOT BE REMOVED OR SENT BACK TO HIS HAND! and the battle becomes a chore, I got him to 6 of his health and he regens it back with health cards and minions that give him health. once again  I say this to someone YOU SHOULDN""""T HAVE TIME LIMITS IN A CARD GAME! especially because all strategy flies out the window, every deck is useless because if the time hits 0, you lose immediatly. and the way his AI is set up he dosn't attack your minions at all unless their guards, speaking of which he had all guard cards mostly, I nearly one but he cheated, and I'm serious I don't know if its a glitch or something but he pulled out a 4th version of a card that was a guard and I lost because I didn't have enough minions, it dosn't take ten turns to win a match unless the player is a even match against the CP!Despite...all that I still reccomend the game, not because of the DLCs but because its still a good card game overall, just don't buy the DarkBrotherhood DLC unless they post something saying the've nerfed it so people actually win.Rant Done. go play the free part of the game."",1"
"9419,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Pretty great game. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that it's too heavily based on RNG. You could be destroying the enemy one second, all the way down to 1hp and they could pull some luck right out of their asses and field wipe you with a field effect that basically costs you the game. So if you have a problem with rage, I would most definitely recommend not getting this game (especially since its pay to win, but at a lesser extent to other games like hearthstone)."",1"
"9420,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Love this game although I hit a spot in the story where the computer had cards to perfectly answer my cards when I was close to winning for close to a dozen games but I was tearing it up before then so whatever, great game."",1"

"9423,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I mean, it's just another card game.  What can you really say?  The Pay2Win aspect is very minimal, though, especially with the daily login rewards now.  But it will still make you unbeatable versus a non Pay2Win opponent.  The gameplay itself is okay, nothing spectacular or very different about any other card game.  The cards are more unbalanced than other CCGs.  I swear the AI cheats though, some of the occurences are so rare it's like getting drawn a Royal Flush back to back, but it happens.  Really nothing here if you are a new player, the remaining playerbase is so advanced you won't win anything in PvP unless you spend cash.  There is very little single-player aspect of this game, so unless you want to spend money and get rekt by PvP for a few months until you get a nice deck built up, this game isn't for you."",0"
"9424,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I have to say, this is just a bad game.  I was playing through the tutorial (aka the """"story""""), and early on realized tactics of any sort didnt matter, it was much, much more based on luck.  Then I got to the story """"boss"""" and got beat like I stole something.  It allowed me to change my deck to another and had a popup for buying packs with $.  Then I went...oh its going to be that bad.  2 more tries later, I beat the boss and went to the arena, where enemies all had much better summons (even the AI enemies).  By better I mean they had stronger summons that had great synergies and were cheaper to summon than my crappy ones.  After a few arena fights, I realized I couldnt win unless I got a great draw and the enemy got crap (even the AIs).  They wanted me to pay $ that much that they made the game 90% based on the $ you spend, and about 9.9% luck (ill say it takes .1% tactics, not even that much but it has lanes)."",0"

If you enjoy the Elder Scrolls series and are found of and TCG like Harthstone, Magic the Gathering, or even the Warcraft one, this is for you. It nails how a online trading card game should be. The mechanics are balanced and fair, plus this game is far more skill based over the dumb luck approach that some TCGs take (*Cough cough* Hearthstone *Cough cough*). The cards are easy to get through leveling and I quickly found my self with a surplus of options. The game even gives you some tough chocies early on. The race you pick at the start even influences what cards you will be getting more of at the start. The story is decent to. Nothing extreme but I found my self chuckling at a couple lines and even caring about one of the characters that shows up. There are also checky nods and reffrences to the ES series (Not going to spoil them though because some them are worth the reaction). Over all I think this is a very good and well made game and I look forward to playing it more."",1"

"9427,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""The release of The Elder Scrolls: Legends on Steam is great news for fans of CCG ( Competitive Card Games ) and The Elder Scrolls franchise!First and foremost, It is not Pay-to-win, each and every card can be crafted with soul gems ( equivalent of hearthstone dust ) Now, those of you migrating from Hearthstone might bring up grinding. Fortunately, very less grinding is required and here are the reasons why:1. You can play against the expert AI in practice mode and get 15 gems for each win. This is hard capped at 300 gems per day. With this rate, you can get a legendary card in just 4 days, if you are so inclined. ( For comparison, in hearthstone, it takes you a MONTH to get a legendary ).2. This game will award you cards, gold just for leveling up your character. The soul gems awarded to a player at the beginning are very generous, and can help you craft cards needed to make a budget deck. I have been playing since just 3 days and already have 44% of the cards.     3. You can always play the solo/versus Arena to get higher rewards, depending on how much you win. 3+ wins will net you more than you invest. Reasons why you should play TESL over Hearthstone:1. Less RNG, more skill. There are no cards with random effects (yet), and the game is actually surprisingly balanced, having no overpowered class or archetype as such. 2. With the way Blizzard is approaching expansions in Hearthstone, you will have to shell out hundreds of dollars just to even play slightly competitive (400$+)3. The rune and prophecy mechanics discourage aggro/face hunter (FACE IS THE PLACE!!!) decks which form much of the meta in lower-ranked games, effectively making low ranked Hearthstone games stale. 4. An F2P player can actually compete with wallet-warriors, providing he/she is willing to be patient for a while.( Not Hearthstone 'patient' lol) There are many f2p players who have hit the legend rank ( absolute highest rank ).I see a bright future for this game, Hearthstone always left a void, which other CCG's failed to fill. This game just might be the one."",1"
"9428,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""It's a """"free"""" game, so we cannot expect a lot.

In more detail, my main three points are:- game mechanics very good, easy to learn and play.- it's free: if you don't want to, there is no need to pay anything. You can get a lot of card by free, mostly completing story mode, but after that, the game has a very limited options. For all the Arenas or you pay some coing (an amount that takes several days* to obtain) or then you have to pay real money.- there are some daily quests, but they can be achieve only in the Arena (and maybe in """"play""""), but not in practice. As this i the main way to gain coin, makes it harder to enter the Arena, and so fulfilling the quests, and so getting money, and so entering the arena... see where I'm going?So, I would rather pay 5 for the game (and then no entry fee for the Arena) than having this limited options. They can still earn a lot of money from store (people who wants more and better cards), from the expansions and so.Just my opinon, hope it helps someone"",1"

I think its a better version of heathstone.For everyone who asks if its P2W or not. I have been playing for a long time now and ill tell you right now it is not. you can get a lot of good cards in the game without paying a $ only thing you will pay for is stories or if you dont have patience and want shortcuts you can buy card packs and see if you get lucky.,1

9436,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,well 300 hours in game I can say that its fun but hella annoying n more or less all have to do with luck u can make good decks but still wont help u win if u get â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ draws but still fun The dark brotherhood maps good n worth the 1000 gold each but dont spend real money its not worth it lol. in periods game wont load until u try many times n game can be unstable at times. u can pay to win but Ive not spent any money on game but still got all the DB maps and madhouse collection missing a couple decks so if u are pantient its not that hard to get. The seasonal reward cards are good but think its dumb u can forge them before theyre given as reward. kinda kills the fun. some cards too op n if u meet an opponant with too many of these u have no chance. Id recomend it unless u get your day â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed if u lose too much cause expect that to happen in periods n u will notice that the resistance from opponants differ very from what time a day u game but that goes for most games xD,1

The card artwork isn't sloppy and the game itself is quite interesting. If you like Elder Scrolls, but may not be into card games.. I'd give it a try anyway. The story isn't very good, but, it's more about gameplay. Every race plays differently, for example.. Imperials spawn large numbers, then buff them up. It brings you in slowly, but if you jump straight into multiplayer it can be a bit overwhelming. All in all, for the price of $0, i'd say its fantastic."",1"

I think fans of the Elder Scrolls franchise will be quite happy though."",1"
"9441,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Way better than Heartstone. If you played Scrolls games, it will be instantly recongnisable and brings back fond memories of Oblivion, Morrowind and Arrow in the Knee.Much more tactical with two lane battles and shorter games.Worth dropping a fiver on starter pack."",1"
"9442,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Pros- Very fair f2p/p2w model. The intructory story/tutorial is alright, just about what you should expect from a free game from a company with as much money as bethesda, but the game deserves praise for giving you access to  a generous number of 50 cards decks with very little overlap with each other from the start (or at least, after finishing the tutorial). You can also get two more themed decks with the most recent cards from the heroes of skyrim expansion with in-game currency,  In less than 30 hours of gameplay I was able to buy two of these decks for 1000 coins, which you get just by playing against other people and playing through the tutorial/story. -Great art, TES designs at their best. Each and every card is vibrant and nice to look at, and they all come with accompanying sound effects and/or voice over. - The game's rng is one hell of an important factor in winning games. There's a big overlap between what a common card can do when RNG favors it and what a Legendary card can do when RNG is not in its favor. What this means is that you absolutely do NOT need to spend money on the game to be able to enjoy it. Good cards give you an edge, but good deck synergy and rng still reign supreme.-Great card/deck identity. The game really benefit from the TES theme, each card and deck built around it oozes personality, and each combination of different races (or lack of) yields a solid, recognizable theme, different from all others. Recognizing and preparing for the strengths of each race and attribute becomes second nature as you play the game. This ties into the game's balance: learn to pace your decisions. Every  deck has a certain """"rhythm"""" to it dictated by its attributes and the races it contains. Learn them to make the most of each deck. Cons- Way, way, way too many rng mechanics. Yes, this is a pro if you are just starting to play the game, but you'll eventually be on the receiving end of the RNG beating. Numerous cards have effects such as """"summoning a random creature"""". No, not a random creature from your deck, ANY random creature from the entire game. You WILL get screwed over by a Hail Mary at some point, you need to learn to accept that. This also ties into the next con:- Built in comeback mechanic. As you burn through your opponent's """"life points"""", you'll break a total of 5 runes. Each time you break a rune, your oponent draws a card. If your opponents card is a """"prophecy"""" card, they'll be able to play it immediately with no cost. This can turn the tides of battle in their favor unexpectedly, so most of the game's meta revolves around trying to be as prepared for this possible random comeback at all times. You are never entirely safe.Overall, I recommend the game to all fans of TCG games. If you ever played a TCG game, you know luck of the draw and pay to win are just inherent flaws of the game by its very definition, and the game has plenty of things to offer to make up for it, and you don't have to pay a price of entry just to see if it's going to appeal to you."",1"
"9443,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""More strategic than hearthstone / More generous than hearthstone / less p2w than hearthstoneNeed I say more? Okay in all seriousness though this game is heavily influenced from MTG & Hearthstone. It's got some great innovations that the other 2 don't have such as the runes [every 5 life lost you pick up a card and a rune is destroyed] and having 2 lanes to play cards in.The interface is top notch as well, same with the cards/balance [for the most part]. The ranking system is a bit more merciful than hearthstone in that you will go into the """"serpent"""" mundus if you are say rank 2 and are at the bottom of your constellation mundus. So you will have to have 2 wins to get back onto the constellation board but you won't go to rank 3 once you hit rank 2 no matter what.So in short....screw hearthstone and play this instead. Your wallet / ESO lore will thank you later. Also for the record I JUST hit legend and I only spent 30 bucks on the game cause I wanted some packs....I easily spent way more than that on Hearthstone and you still couldn't keep up with the meta"",1"

There's no oomph with the client. No feeling of instensity with each new minion added to the board. Compared to other contemporaries, it's just nowhere near their level.

THus I am writing a review for this game.I am half way through the story and have been enjoying it so far. I did get the 3 packs for regerstering. Got one or two purple and 5 or more blue cards.As mentioned before, it is like Hearthstone, but the multiple lanes add some new strategies. Of what I understand, it is not pay 2 win as most items can be bought with in-game gold. Only item that cash only buys is pretty cards and a title. I feel that that is an excellent balalnce.

"9452,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""It's fairly new, and I've only played about an hour of it, but I really enjoy this. And I usually don't enjoy trading card-style games. It's somewhere between MTG, Hearthstone and Gwent. It has the 2 color mechanic from MTG, Lanes from Gwent, Polish, card-forging system and turn-growing Magicka (Magicka) from heathstone with an engrossing and full singleplayer campaign, Elder Scrolls Lore, its own spin on Trading card games and a lot of polish.PROS:-""""Free""""-Good Story (So far)-Great card art and sound design-A lot of polish-The Rune system is something I haven't seen before-I love the idea of upgrading cards as you get repeats-The lane modifiers are interesting-Story choices actually have a tangable effect on the cards you're given for your deck-Not too computer-intensive (I have a macbook, and didn't notice any major hiccups)-Each race has a different effect for your deck, and pretty much all the races you are able to play in the main series games are represented, and are able to be changed at will-A lot of in game statistics recordingCONS:-Not many cards, so far (Already have a 5th of the regular set)-In-game transactions (Up to over 100 USD!)-A lot of animations-The art design for the campaign kind of looks like those cheap point+click adventures with the still image that they add effects to, but it works for the game-Settings menu in-game lackluster-Long loading times (might just be my machine)-Fairly lengthly unskippable tutorial-It is basically necessary to sign up for a free Bethesda account, if you don't have one already (Its the first thing that comes up upon starting the game)OVERALL:Like I said before, I don't usually don't like Trading Card Games. I don't like the meta of them of needing every card. However this one, with its thurough optional single player campaign and loads of polish really did hook me, even though the pitfalls of many TCGs are present.

"9453,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""This is the online CCG I've been waiting for since I stopped playing Magic: The Gathering as a physical card game fifteen years ago. A well balanced, well thought out game that is not dissimilar to M:TG but does away with the concept of land-for-mana and simply grants you one extra mana each turn. This makes for a faster, more dynamic game IMO.Unlike the various incarnations on M:TG on Steam, Elder Scrolls: Legends is much more fluid in terms of card selection, meaning the deck tweakability is endless and with each new drop, you are encouraged to experiment more and more to build that 'killer' deck.For the whiners, this game is emphatically NOT PTW. All you need to do is put in the game-time and patience and those Legends will eventually be yours. You can shell out real money if you can't wait, but there is absolutely no need to. The more you play, the more you learn in terms of strategy and card useage. Grinding is both rewarding and a learning-curve.Loving this!UPDATE AFTER HoS EXPANSION:What can I say? The Heroes of Skyrim expansion is huge and does not disappoint. It has added tons of new content including dragons, werewolves and - brilliantly - shouts, as well as massively increasing the card choices available for deck-construction. A fantastic game just got even better!UPDATE AFTER SPARKYPANTS TAKEOVER:Ruined. The game has been reduced to a buggy Beta with a hideously ugly layout."",1"

Long time player of both MTG and the Elder Scrolls game all the way back to Daggerfall, and this is a perfect combination of two of my favorite games.

You can mute their avatar if they don't shut up and the turn timer counts down pretty quick once a turn of inactivity passes in case they just want to sit and run the timer out.

"9463,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Very fun digital card game set in the Elder Scrolls theme. The game is very good so far and is a nice alternative to hearthstone.You start off in a story mode that also features a how to play introduction. You choose your class and charcter type, each having different strengths and weaknesses. In the begining you play through the story mode to unlock more cards but what makes this card game different is you just dont get new card the base cards can be upgraded to better cards with a variety on different attacks than the base card had to start with. For example lets say you had a base card with 1 defense and 1 attack and was soldier. This card could upgrade to a 3 attack 3 defense knight or it might upgrade to a Gaurd ( same thing as a Taunt card in Hearthstone )( If you dont know what a Gaurd or Taunt card does its a card that must be removed from the board first before you are allowed to hit other cards or the main character )Something unique about this game compared to lets say Hearthstone is that the playing board is split in half. You may lay your cards on either half but can only attack opponents cards that are on the same half of the board unless you play a card that can attack across the board.Also when you play the story it gives you a choice on how the story will go. If you kill this person you get this card if you spare them you get this card and the story adjusts to your choice.Everytime you or your opponent loses 5 health they draw a card in addition to the card they get t draw at the begining of each turn.Yes there is a store to buy card packs this is a free to play game they have to make money some where, but like hearthstone you can earn coins from playing matches to buy packs without actually using real money.I reccomend this game if you like trading card games.

"9472,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Played the game on Bethesda Launcher before it was released on Steam. Finished the free single player campaign but never player PvP.It felt like a mixture of Magic and Hearthstone. The deck construction is like magic where you can mix up to two classes of cards, while the battle system is like Hearthstone where magicka (like mana crystal in HS) grows up by 1 each turn and how attack works. There are also supports and items which are pretty much similar to the artifacts and equipment in Magic. Creature abilities are basically a sum of both games: summon (battle cry), guard (taunt), breakthrough(trample), last grasp (deathrattle), lethal(poison), drain(lifelink), pilfer, regenerate, etc.It does introduces something new in this game: Mainly the two lane system where each lane is its own battle ground, so you'll have to be more tactic about distributing your creature cards on the field. Also the special rules of each lane (stealth-like right lane and level-specific left lane) makes it worthwhile to consider which lane you want to lay down your card (In a way, it's a reinvention of Magic's flying creature mechanism). There's also the rune sytem which acts like secret from HS that let you draw 1 card when losing certain amount of health. There are cards that interact specifically with such mechanism. Second-go player are quite compensated with jewel rings that are like the extra coin in HS but you can use it three times.I have to agree with what others said about the balancing. I feel that the three uses of jewel for second-go is a bit too much, but at least it's not completely unplayable for first-go player. Also I'm not a hug fan of 50-card minimum requirement for deck construction. This makes it extremely hard for beginners to build decent decks that don't contain """"filler"""" cards (which essentially lower your chance of draw combo cards).Overall, I still think this is definitely a game worth playing. You can play through a quite lengthy campaign for free and unlock others with in-game currency that you earn. There's even a solo Arena mode (like in HS) but you play against AI, great for PvE players like me. I think it finds a balance between the casual side of HS (simpler rules and faster pace) and the hardcore side of Magic (creature abilities, deck construction). It's a game you don't have to heavily invest your time in. You can simply pick up and leave any time when you have around 15min to spare, good for killing time. It would, however, be even better if it's brought to mobile device (which I think it's going to happen) for even better access to game.It's very light on hardware and friendly to touch-screen. I would simply keep the game installed so that you can play it while waiting for a class to begin or having a coffee at Starbucks. "",1"
"9473,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I don't know about Hearthstone as I never played it, but I can't help but notice it's comparison with Magic the Gathering which I played for many years. Let me start off by saying I think this game is really good, if you've played MtG than you'll notice it's very similar yet with a slightly streamlined style which works very well. For a start you don't have to tap cards, and instead of declaring attackers and choosing defenders, this game has implemented a sytem where you directly choose who you want your creatures to attack. This makes the game play very smoothly and it's much quicker too. The drawback this game has in comparison however is that it does lack the same level of depth as MtG as there's less phases to the game, such as you can't case instant spells or react to enemy moves. However, what this game does so well is implement a few other mechanics which retain a level of depth which keeps the game challenging and engaging. One of these is the prophesy/rune system which allows you to draw a particular card in reaction to being attacked at certain stages of the game, this system actually allows for a bit of reaction play such as tapping down an attacker if they're making a critical attack in the last moment. Another great thing about the prophesy system is that it allows the losing player to draw extra cards which forces the later stages of the game to remain challenging for both players. Another interesting system is the lanes mechanic which means you have to plan ahead which side of the board you want to play cards, this works very well and adds yet more depth to the game.As a MtG player I've found it very easy to translate my skills directly across to Elder Scrolls Legends, the colours mostly play the same rolls with a few aspects mixed around, there's also a lot of the same creature skills but with different names such as"

"9476,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Some background: This will be my first time reviewing an electronic card game. I've played MTG (Magic: The Gathering) online and IRL, but only at casual levels. I enjoyed Elder Scrolls' games as well.I'd like to begin my review by saying that this game is easy to understand. Like many games, you can learn it in hours, but take weeks to start really excelling and mastering. With all card games as well, you have to learn what every card does and be prepared to do a lot of learning from mistakes.I recommend this game over MTG games due to its MUCH faster pace, challenge, and rewards. You don't have to enjoy Elder Scrolls first-person games to get into this card game. You'll learn everything as it goes. I also like how there's AT LEAST over 100 strategies with the current card sets available in the game, which adds to the challenge and mixes up the meta substantially.It's free to play, so just give it a shot and see if you'll like it.UPDATE: After 120 hours played, I can fully recommend this game to anybody who has appreciated Hearthstone, MTG, and even Pokemon TCG. The new expansion Heroes of Skyrim just came out and now the meta is changing again. I would say now is a great time to get into the game because when there is new expansions, there is also new players. This game is simple, but addicting.UPDATE 2: I'm now over 400 hours and this is the only card game I bother logging into now. It won't be easy reaching Legend rank with commons and rares if you're just starting, but with some face decks, you probably could. This is a good game and could use more players and streamers. Good luck!"",1"
"9477,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Typical card game.It is ok.But the gimick of free doesn't mean much. For small expansions on the short tutorial that is free, are not worth the price.Their intent is to extract as much money from you without you noticing. Don't fall for this gimick. A game should be presented in whole and the price shown, not hidden behind small expansions that each cost as small amount but add up to big bucks. The type of sales gimick has been around for some time but ZOS is finally starting to get in on the action and it kind of sucks. Selling their souls for obscene profit and suffering content.Stay clear of this game to show you do not support pay to play, arcade style pay systems from ZOS."",0"
"9478,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I have played a few of these card games, so far only the physical ones have caught my interest. I saw this on Steam, figured it was worth a try. There are a lot of complaints that it is pay to win, which in my experience is wrong, I haven't spent a cent on this game and have beat the campaign and a ton of online players. I use the Alduin's Apocalypse deck I bought for in game currency, I made in about an hour, after beating the main story and a few mini rewards quests. A lot of complaints are that the game is too hard and they can't advance fast enough, but that's only due to the players skill level. As with anything, this game requires you be skilled, which means practice."",1"
"9479,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Pretty damn good game, I enjoy playing against my friends. We play a couple games and get cards then setup  some decks to 1v1 each other which is pretty fun. Its balance, not pay to win. I mean spending money helps, but you don't have to pay to keep up with the current meta's of the game. Just takes some time and saving gold to unlock the stories.Only bad thing is people trying to wait you out on turns to be annoying and also people spamming cancer cards to annoy you.8/10 game "",1"
"9480,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""It's easy to get into, and is just as easy to master if you're willing to put in the time. I never found it necessary to buy card packs. The starter deck is good for early gameplay, and normal progression awards the player often."",1"
"9481,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""The game is fun but the arena rewards are really cheap. I mean, 150 coins for completing a full 7 out of 7 arena run(the amount you pay in the first place to play in the arena). Really Bethesda? And i thought hearthstone arenas were cheap.."",1"
"9482,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Really enjoying this one right now. While not the Elder Scrolls game I'm sure that everyone really wanted, it is definitely worth playing if you like CCGs. Especially so if you are also a fan of Elder Scrolls lore and themes."",1"

"9484,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I only play it because it gives me Morrowind nostalgia, and because it somehow has better VO than any of the TES games (of course that's not really an accomplishment), but it's fun to play every once in a while"",1"
9485,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,I orginally got it on mobile and then found out it's multi platform and lemme say the integration between platforms is seemless. Aside from that it's basically MTG with more layers and it's fun as all hell if you enjoy TES lore.,1
"9486,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Elder Scrolls Legends is a great game, whether you're steeped in the Elder Scrolls games or not.It's got several interesting mechanics (two lanes of creatures, runes, which give you card draw every 5 life lost, prophecies, which cast for free when you lose a rune, some interesting keywords, etc) that make it much more tactical than it seems at first glance, and provides a very generous free to play experience!I've been playing for a couple months now and have fully constructed 2 decks and have budget versions of 3 more, all of which are different enough to give very different play experiences!"",1"
"9487,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Generally The Elder Scrolls: Legends (TESL) is a fun, well balanced game focused on creature combat. Coming from Hearthstone, TESL has a lot more potential thanks to not limiting it's card design to single click effects, and not overusing RNG effects. The unique aspects of the game are two lanes and the rune mechanics, which give creature combat depth and they give the defending side better comeback chances. While the game isn't the most popular card game out there, the playerbase and community are certainly healthy enough to have fun with. The economy is certainly very generous compared to hearthstone, and after playing on and off for 6 months F2P I have a nearly all the important cards. The game recently swithed developers who made a completely new client, which was released too early. It was originally buggy, but good patching has fixed it and the game runs and looks great now. The new devs are actively adding features and content to the game, and Bethesda is not giving up on the game any time soon after pumping money into the game with the developer switch. Overall, its free to play, give it a try. Maybe you'll like it."",1"
"9488,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Pay to win. It was good until the Skyrim update, but now there are tons of overpowered cards that should be nerfed ASAP.UPD March 2018: by now, I have also experienced problems with matchmaking. Probably, because in February I accidently reached a competitive rank milestone that I had never reached before and that is obviously above my actual level, the next month I was matched with too strong players while still having the lowest rank. It used to be that I rapidly reach a certain milestone and then it goes as victory - loss - victory - loss, i.e. in the way it should be. But then there was an endless losing streak before I could make any progress - very unpleasant. It has become better by the end of the month, though.Meanwhile, overpowered decks remain. The worst thing is werewolfs. There are many decks that can nuke your opponent very fast, but werewolfs are unstoppable. (Of course, you can craft an effective anti-werewolf deck, but it will be unbalanced against normal opponents.)UPD October 2018: Bethesda found a new developer to rebuild the client from scratch, and what they have done is terrible. The old app was so much better. I don't mean visuals and interface - it is a matter of taste after all (although I do think that now the game looks more generic). It is just full of bugs and glitches, at some point I even was worried that the new client discarded my progress, as I started receiving titles I had already earned. I play on a touch screen, which worked very well in the old client. Now it is hardly possible.Well, they are likely to fix bugs, but problems with balance (damn OP werewolfs) remain. I do enjoy playing arena, though. It might be frustrating when you cannot compile a decent deck, but at least everyone is equal in this mode and having a new deck every time is refreshing. It is quite accessible, you can afford it wiht gold from daily quests without great grind.I did not really apreciated the Morrowind update either. IMHO they overcomplicated gameplay. The puzzles mode is cool, however.Still 5/10"",0"
"9489,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Tried many card games and this one really stands out ! Not p2w (all can be bought with in game gold), nice universe especially if you like the Elder Scrolls and many fun decks. The meta doesn't have to be only composed of 2 or 3 super decks.Highly recommended."",1"
"9490,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Before the Developer change the game was pretty fun. Quest worked, daily login rewards worked, and everything else worked just fine.Since the developer change, I've missed out on free daily login rewards, one was a Monthly Legendary where you have to login every day of the month. Consecutively. It's not like warframe where it tracks each day nonconsecutively but total number of days you've logged in. Which for this it would be nice, every 30 days you login, give us a Legendary Card, doesn't have to be something new everytime but something we don't have.Recently the daily quests have started bugging out. You complete a quest, it gives no reward and the quest changes to something else. What a rip off. I only play this for the quests and stories. I give 0 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about Ranked gameplay. And give us an option to turn off ALL emotes by default.I can't recommend this right now until the new developer bugs get worked out, otherwise you are just going to be disappointed in things not working properly.I will say the artwork, gameboard and menu's do look nice, so that's a plus but I'd rather have a working game than a pretty one with bugs. It'll just take time to work the bugs out and if I care any bit, I might change this but, it's doubtful."",0"

"9492,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""This will be my first review I have ever done and it is because this game deserves it! I loved Hearthstone when it first came out but I feel it was very cookie cutter. This game is MUCH better, MUCH more strategic and A LOT more fun! Definitely give it a try, it's free!"",1"
9493,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,Played this since it came to beta last year.Great f2p game if compared to others like Hearthstone.Game currency can be used for things that require money so playing a decent amount gets you the same cards as players who use money. Expansions  and special cards included. Also daily rewards and fighting against AI in arena give you decent rewards.Loved the elder scrolls related artwork.,1
9494,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,Sadly too much of a pay to win with little reason for non-paying players too continue playing it.There's lots of F2P card games which don't feel P2W due to how to shops work or due to how matching functions.I don't understand why the consumer should choose this over other F2P card games which are simply more fun.,0
"9495,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""the game is awesome! i love it! but but but!!!update: ok, i do not recomment the game under the explained circumstances but i keep playing the game because i solved the computer behavior. i could 100% predict the computers behavior. but its not very easy. i spend a whole night to understand the why! and found 10 rules you can predict the computer and by that i mean cards drwan by the oponent and yourself. i made some recodings to prove a 100% prediction chance of what will happen.but the system has 2 flaws. first, i was psychotic at this time, that means iam able to extremly focus without effort. 2 flaw is, there is a particular playstyle, wich creates so many possibilities that its at least for me impossible so calculate all resulutions.if you want to know about how the computer works and want a detailed explonation whats happening whyle playing, then send me feedback. if enough people show interest, i create youtube videos with commented gameplay and turn prediction , why the computer akt like that and what fails lead to a lost match. also i create a list of tips, to help understand the computer behavior and rules to rise chances to win. basically, you never play against human, its all about understanding the computers move.send me a message, show interest and i share my information and hope to develop better playstyles and raise winrate. tahnk you.just to mention it, iam not atvertising. iam no utuber, iam no streamer, i dont write frourm stuff. iam just a guy plaing games and is angry about todays player rip of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t to make cash. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ legends â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this pay to winâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ lets solve thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥and break there system! â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the system! short list of pro and contra:proart stylesoundscardsgameplaycampaincontrathe game feels artificialy manipulatedthe game is build around paying money or live with frustrating, timeconsuming grind.the deck is is controled by the computer and not by the universe like in real, so i assume we are not talking about real coincidence.withour money just very little reward and not balanced between time spend and rewards claimed. paying money will defenitly create that balance.long version and in deph explanation of my experience.it is very unsatisfying, that the game is not kontrolled by the universe instead controled by a computer wich is programed in a way, that the actual game feels unnatural.in every match and every round, you just get the right card for the last minute rescue or a turn around last minute victory.in every single match either me or the oponent, get just the right â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing card for the most obvious game changing resolution. problem is, i cant prove it, but my guts telling me, that the computer is not mixing the deck once in the beginning, the computer rather calculate and analyse your behavuior and moves to keep the win chances for both players 50% until its not possible to correct the player made false decisions. its aweful!i assume but i cant prove it, that with so much control from a computer, maybe the chances to win for a paying customer are higher then for a non pying customer. and i dont mean the unfair advantages from the cards, what i mean is, that the win chances may be higher for payers, so they are more satisfyed for there insvestment and keep paying, while the not yet paying customer put into artificial frustration, to force the non payer to pay real money to keep fit for the competition.lets be honest, this came is a casino, a lotteri, a sot mashine its gambling and what happens if the house play by the rules of the universe? right the bank is balanced, because winning and losing is after 1 million tries at 50%. but that way u cant make money so you have to control the situation just enough, so the payer dont feel riped off but the bank stil makes money.it is aweful how obvious the game is completly build around the real money shop, no doubt. if i werent such a pain loving mashine, who loves frustration in a weird way, i would have payed real money yet, what i did not have.so be warned!!, the game knows exactly how to get your money! esespecially if your not so damn stubborn like me.example: i played last night 7 hours. i won 3 games out of 12. since i hit level 21, the difficulti changed big step. before that, i had a win rate for like 10 hours at around 50%.right now, a intense match against a human player 1v1 will take around 20-30 minutes.you need 3 win to get a reward of 15 gold and 1 random card.you get xp for losing and winning. per level upgrade wich, gives u usually a pack of 6 random cards and gold i think.in between you get card upgrades for special cards.together, for me it feels very unrewarding i can tell you. compared to the campain act 1 its like chiling on the beach or strugling trouth an orcan.the campian against Ai was so awesome satisfying and felt like it should feel, but right after the free experience and even the first arena against AI and even the first matches against players, you get a big â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing sign to pay pay pay. for me it felt like """"whoa"""" wht the hell, whats that mountain doning here suddenly.the thing is, the full campain cost extra money ( but act 1 was very cool for a card game!!). also, the arena a second time was so impossible hard with the same deck i played the first one, that i did not even win a single match and wasted 150 gold ( for 150 gold you need 10x3 won , 30 played games with 100% win rate a 20-30 minutes wich make 300 minutes or 5 hours in a perfect world! )also, after leveling up form 1-24 (iam right now) , i felt like the matchmaking put mit into realy hardcore fights, in my opinions, just to show me, what paying real money can do in this game. the game takes care, that you dont win all the time and it rembers you very direct, when a guy plays a 5 time combo chain in round 4 an win 2 rounds later. i mean yeah, skill and experience is stil important and i am aware , that my wrong decisions lead to lost matches, and yes iam quite aware, that i just try to find a explonation for losing more often then winning. so i maybe wrong, but since i cant prove manny asumptions , all i have is my"",0"

"9498,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""As many gamers know there are a lot of card games out there, and this one stands out in that it does not get boring as fast as most of them.  Legends has several play modes and ways of gaining new cards for free.  However, sadly it does have the same mechanics problem that makes it P2W due to no real balancing during matching players for ranked or unranked games.  That becomes more and more obvious.  For this reason, I would only suggest this game to people who love the Elder Scrolls genre and trading card games as well as paying for what they love."",1"

Also enhances the fun even more for Elder Scroll fans. I think ES:Legends is a way better game than Hearthstone since the game has a lot more going on in the board. Besides that there is way less RNG deciding games and depends more on strategies to win. Solo arena is also a pretty fun addition to ES:L compared to Hearthstone. Pretty good game overall,1

"9515,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Played through the story mode and an arena.  Much better game technically and far more accessible than Shatstone.  Mixes that old heroes game laning mechic with Shatstonesque format making the game much deeper strategically and enjoyable. I am not a fan of crafting systems however in these types of games as they seem to simply waste time rather than allowing for a way to earn new cards through gameplay.The draft modes are pretty fun however and there's some leeway, with you having to lose 3 times to get knocked out.  7 wins gets you the best prizes.  Very well done by Bethesda.  I haven't paid money yet as I was able to earn my tickets.  Am looking forward to playing some more and trying multiplayer eventually although these games usually take to p2w designs in order to get people to spend.I still am not up to speed on the meta however but I think this game will destroy Shatstone in the long run.  It is just so much deeper and there should be many more options than the ~2 deck meta you will see from Shatstone since that has a flawed design and this compesates for it with random playing field types which makes for many more deck building choices and plays to take advantage of."",1"
9516,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,Fun at first and playing the AI is engaging enough.  After that no different than the rest of the CCGs.  Pay to win.

"9518,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""REVIEW UPDATED!First impression:Kinda mixed about this one... While it's definitely better than Hearthstone aka RNJesus-stone, it's kinda worse than Magic the Gathering. So... I'll rate this as neither a great nor a bad game to get.Second Thoughts:Edit: Thoughts behind the rating below.FINAL RATING:This game looked promising to begin with. (first impression was mixed with a rating of 4.75/10) Although it had some positive elements, the reviewer can't really state that he is impressed by the game and its core elements. The collection is ok, but nothing is impressive to any degree. This feels like another game to be forgotten within the next couple of months... the only positive element is the graphics, which prevent the inevitable 0.0/10 rating... this time!I rate this game as 3.5/10, which means that I strongly advice people not to play this game - even though it's free-to-play. It's simply not worth it, there are better alternatives.1) Gameplay: 1.0 / 3.5The two-lane system is by no means unique, MMDOC had a three-lane system and it still failed in the long run due to yolo expansions coming out. ES: L has some balance, yet the card-pool is very limited at the moment. (-0.5) and the majority of the effects are hijacked from other ccg's. It's inevitable, but still a point to consider while creating a game. (-1.5) As I have collected ~70 % of the baseset, it becomes increasingly depressing to watch, so... -0,5. This start to look very much like Hearthstone... unfortunately, but it is nevertheless true.2) Graphics / Aesthetics: 2.5 / 3.0The graphics of ES: L are very well-crafted, although I have only played this game for a very limited period of time. The voice-over is adequate, but a bit tiresome in the long run... so (-1.0) for that one. At least the animations are much better than Hearthstone's an extra (+0.5) from that aspect.3) Uniqueness: 0.0 / 1.5My apologies to all ES players, but this game is by no means a unique game in the ccg-genre. (and no, those """"prophecies"""" just simply don't make the cut, my friends) Nothing else to say compared to Magic the Gathering. (you all knew it was coming anyway, so I'll leave it there...)4) Replayability: 0.00 / 2.0As with all games, replayability is important if you want to keep the playerbase at a decent size. I fear that this game doesn't have that much to offer atm. If you want a casual ccg with RNG as a major factor, then you should turn to Hearthstone, while the grand old ccg Magic the Gathering has everything that suits a grand strategist's needs. So (-1.5) from these considerations.But I still have some faith in the future development of this game... so if the developers are aware of the competitive ccg's out there, they might increase the replayability-value for ES: L through several tweaks. This thought gives a slight bonus, as I'm currently in a good mood. (+0.25)Update: Nope, the starting hand size is a joke and game-deciding. As the ring... so unfortunately I have to give -0,75 for this."",0"
"9519,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,,""player from Direwolf days (beta and early or so.) If you are smart and browse Steam reviews only reading the negative ones to get actual non-sponsored opinions, this re-visit impression is for you.Stay away from this game, it looks like Bethesda is no longer making any money with this one and dont have the decency to can it, rather opting to syphon the existing fan base of as much as possible and kill it slowly. Hence the decision to pass it off to Shitpants or whatever this company is called, 99% chance you never heard of and YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHY. You can tell from the name alone what their priorities are.At the moment it looks like they are full-stop converting the game to exclusively P2W/P2P, if that, possibly P2L at this point like is trending right now among mobile-type casual games and are making â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up choices to the already questionable balance, possibly only releasing cards that have been pre-made for them, impossible to imagine this new company will produce any new content themselves (I mean just look at their â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed up website and repertoire of """"mobile masterpieces,"""" looks like a malware distributor that you end up at if you click on a wrong link accidentally.)ES:L was kind of charming at it's inception, it wasn't very balanced and fairly P2W but kind of generous compared to HS for example. There was some illusion and even possibility to play it daily even F2P and get somewhere, perhaps a little money here and there. The fanbase for these games sucks and this was understood, so they had to make a lot more aggro style cards for them and add more RNG elements to give them a chance (and to copy HS, which is all this game was at the end of the day, a genuine attempt at a decent HS clone/competitor) but it was tolerable. Some of the YT and content creators were cool and enthusiastic, rather than just phoning it in for Amazon giftcards or whatever.  Despite it's flaws it had an endearing Bethesda quality to it of circa 2010~/Skyrim era and a couple of cool ideas/designs and it was possible to have fun and interesting matches now and again. While some of that may still be there for the time, it's clear that the corporates have decided that it's past it's prime and you won't find any redeeming qualities left here before too long. It may see another expansion if one has already been made ahead of time, but even that seems like a stretch at this point considering how long it's been since the last one."",0"
"9520,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""This is game needs some balancing.

The AI are funky and the seems liek you need ceratin cards  to create to win against. As the startr and random packs you dont usually get them. It doesnt help if their someone out there with alot of money and they will spend,  me, i judge a game by its content and this is one that can kill your fandom to ES.  Microsoactiont o get a card to beat an Ai, or lose to the random players who have more money to spend ont he game or lucky enough to get the cards.

"9525,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I have been an avid Bethesda game fan since Oblivion, putting hundreds of hours into both Oblivion and Skyrim. Played all of the DLC, roleplayed dozens of characters, and beat both of the games several times. I have no idea what is going on with Bethesda as a company"
"9526,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Its a great card game, they put a suprisingly large amount of effort into polishing and balancing this. Suprising because I figured this was just an attempt to capitalize off of the growing CCG fanbase, while also expanding the Elder Scrolls universe. Bethesda has been diversifying the Elder Scrolls series as of late, in what seems like attempts to monopolize the series in the video game world. Elder Scrolls Online treaded into the MMO world, and now this treading into the more casual game world. Im not really sure how I feel about it yet, but one thing I do know, they cant seem to make a great Elder Scroll game that ISNT an open world RPG. Just like ESO, this game misses its mark, and falls short of being noteable in any way. That doesnt mean it isnt fun, and its definitely a way to kill half an hour or so. Sadly this game only makes me want to play Skyrim again, and quite simply, it does NOT scratch that itch. The game plays similar to Magic: The Gathering, but its card graphics are nowhere near as cool looking. The cards are generally lackluster and unimpressive, I was hoping they would utilize some visually appealing art style, but instead its just a generic western fantasy style. Magic has a more gothic and visceral style, where ES Legends has a hokey cartoon style. There are sound effects when cards are used, which is cool until about 3 minutes into the game, when the cards spout out the same lines repeatedly. A Daedric Cultist card will say a korny line like, """"for the queen of darkness,"""" every time it attacks. Now imagine there are four Daedric Cultist cards on the table, and a dozen turns left in the game, you will hear """"for the queen of darkness"""" literally 48 times, over and over, until you just mute the game altogether. That was my experience, and sadly I now play the game on mute, which should never have to be done. Overall the game is just ok, but since its free its almost impossible for me to NOT recommend the game. Because of this I imagine the steam rating will stay really high, you should note that its NOT indicative of the quality of the game, because in my opinion the game is really not great, its just ok. Not even the subject matter of ES can save this one, and to be honest this game has nothing on hearthstone or other more well established card games. Despite that there is literally no reason not to give it a try, considering its free. 7/10"",1"
"9527,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Hands down, the best card game I've played on computer. From the artwork to the gameplay, it doesn't disappoint. It takes hearthstone, bends it over, and gently makes sweet sweet love to it...like a gentleman."",1"
"9528,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""7/30/2017 - 19.2 hrs last two weeks / 19.2 hrs on recordI found this while meandering around Steam looking for new/different stuff to play.I've played Hearthstone and Magic: the Gathering. I quit both because I did not get enough fun proportionate to the cost.This game shares the resource pool mechanics with Hearthstone and the artistic beauty of Magic: the Gathering. It doesn't look as expensive as either of them. Given the game is in its infancy, it makes sense that there are no special formats based on the release date or release set of the cards. The rune mechanic strongly influences the metagame and sets The Elder Scrolls: Legends apart from its spiritual parent, Hearthstone.Deck building is based on a maximum of two of the five """"attributes"""" plus a neutral pool, which might as well be called """"colors"""" by MtG standards or """"classes"""" by HS standards. I see this aspect as a direct upgrade from HS's system, even though (and perhaps especially because) TESL offers no class abilities. This also removes the pigeon-hole effect from class-only cards by essentially allowing you to dual-class. I think class abilities make the game less about the cards themselves. In a card game, I hope the game retains an undiluted focus on the cards.The intro story mode was riveting with its special game modes and meaning-lite choices, and helpful as a tutorial. I look forward to the opportunity to explore the current Dark Brotherhood segments and future story chapters, with the in-game currency.It's a card game. No matter how competitive or wise you may be, there are randomized elements that are both the intrigue and ultimately the achilles' heel of the game. Luck may have it that you win some and you lose some, or that you win many and you lose few, or that you win few and you lose many. Winning feels good (for me), but there are frustrations about what that means when I could be faced with opponents of wildly varying skill levels and deck strengths. Losing feels bad (for me), but there are frustrations about what that means when both players in a match are subject to draw both useful-at-the-time and not-so-useful-right-now cards. Winning or losing too easily feels unearned, and while the rune mechanic alleviates some of that problem, it also introduces some right back.I will hold onto my wallet for now. I've taken a look at some of the starter and one-time-purchase (?) packs available, and I could easily see myself spending $30. I've spent much, much more than that on Magic, but I'm not here to spend money"
"9529,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""The game is well designed and a lot of effort has been put into developing it. Great soundtrack and audio details.However, a user can play a very limited part of the game, unless you want to disburse a lot of cash for several kinds of in-game purchases! Second, the pairing and fighting combination dont make any sense! One can be a beginner stage and the game pairs you with legendary other unknown users! Plus it takes a long while in the game to understand the mechanisms of the several functionalities cards have, thus creating misunderstanding, confusion and frustration at the end of versus gaming. The user never gets feedback on what went wrong and how you lost! Highly not user friendly.If you have 200 hrs to learn how to manuever this game, go for it, otherwise it is very frustrating.

"9530,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""people are saying that since the reboot, the game has been laggy, buggy, crashing, etc. they mostly fixed the crashes and bugs, and lag isn't really a problem because 1. this is a turn based card game 2. If you play on a decent device, it isn't a problem. What I'm looking for isn't performance but gameplay in card games. Sure good performance, animation, and card art would be splendid but I personally like the gameplay. Prophecy cards help with dealing with aggro deck which can get out of hand in a lot of other games. It isn't very pay to win either and you could make a tier 1 deck with about a months work.  and yes i realize i have don't have a lot of hours on my computer i usually play on what's closer which 90& of the time is my phone.

"9534,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""yeah im getting super frustrated on how matching works in this game.  I cant find people remotely close to my skill level. I mean its real fun to lose 7 matches in a row ranked/casual and win once then lose another 8. All cause people have decks that just beat me in like 3-4 turns easy. Ive got my best cards in my deck and I find it impossible to win any games. not very fun. Just want to actually enjoy the game by playing people who don't destroy me instantly cause they spent too much time making a perfect deck.  so far the only enjoyable part of this game is the story. its taking so much not to just start full out cursing. Literally playing casual cause thats all to do in this game and after losing 8 matches in a row i make a new deck. red yellow, 15ish creatures all under 4 mana cost, rest are all item buffs and actions. Plan was to make a very easy to use buff deck to spam high attack and win fast, as i had view cards that cost over 5 mana. (as decks like this beat me like 4 times in a row) before i had been using a green purple deck filled with magicka buff cards, pilfer cards, and lethal cards. first game i use it in, destroyed by a dude that got out 4 supports 3 were the gives all friendly creatues a +1 +1 and the other gave him a 2/3 guard creature every turn (i think it was a 2/3) and he just spammed guards, and item buffs and beat me almost instantly. Next guy i play is a green blue deck and he litterally got out 2 of those bats that had drain and then had cards to destroy any creature i played before i even got a chance to use them and beat me like that. Next i played a deck that spammed lethal and damage cards, by turn 4 he had 4 lethal cards in a single row and creature i had played has been instantly destroyed and my health was down to 15. Like how the [censored] am i supposed to compete with these people. Im only level 12 what the hell. I dont nearly have the best cards in the game im working with mostly default crap the story mode gave me. Just throw me into match after match where i get butt [censored] instantly.                    \                                                                                                                                                                                                         \                    This game is great I love it, its like magic the gathering if it was simpler and had an elder scrolls theme, but match making is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and I find it impossible to play with anyone near my skill level. The only good part of this game is the Story Mode which only lasts a couple hours (20 matches). This game gets a thumbs down from me until they fix how people are paired together.

"9535,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""While the prospect of getting more Elder Scrolls lore while waiting on the next mainline game to come out may seem attractive, Legends is not worth the hassle. It's a Hearthstone clone, more or less. Pleagued by the same RNG and money-grabbing issues thatp lague ALL CCGs. Every element of the game is rigged to extort money from you. If you want a remotely competitive deck, as with all CCGs, be prepared to blow $100 on card packs so you can RNG the cards you need or get the dust you need to craft them. The non-paid content will last you a few hours at most, and then the game will begin demanding money for a few more hours, which will be depleted after you chew through it because they only have a few content packs out now. All of which are hideously overpriced because the people who DO spend money on CCGs buy the packs 40 at a time. Because as psychological research has shown us, CCGs and other microtransaction schemes are tailored to prey on """"whales"""". People with compulsive personality disorders or poor impulse control who cannot resist the urge to see what comes out of that next pack, or what card comes off the top of their deck next. They're biologically predisposed to take risks, minimize losses, overstate their gains, and keep pulling any lever or pushing any button that makes pleasant noises or flashes pretty lights at them. Game devs know this, so they make their games to milk these """"whales"""" for their money. Legends is no different.Beyond the hideously exploitative pricing model, the game itself is the usual RNG garbage that all CCGs are. You can be mopping the floor with someone and be up 20hp one turn, then the next they luck into a card combo that wins them the game. Likewise, you can be struggling all game against someone and then RNG hands you the perfect cards to turn the game around while stiffing your opponent. There's very little personal skill or tactical thinking involved. The personal skill element boils down to making a balanced deck and making wise trades in the games.That's maybe 30% of what determines who wins and who loses. Another 10% is probably the rock-paper-scissors game design philosophy that plays out like: Decks that spawn lots of small enemies lose to decks that spawn big enemies lose to decks with a lot removal/lethality lose to decks with lots of small enemies. The other 60% is all luck. Plain, boring, dumb luck.I can't recommend this or any other CCG. Ever. If you love these games, seek help instead. There are treatments for gambling addiction."",0"

Very interesting, I love that they have vocabulary for the game you need to learn. Makes it less simple and engages you more in terms of having to give some thought to making decks that win which I like.Problems are with the computer version and the  phone app that are constant and never receive any attention even though other players have left multiple complaints:Too many loading screens. In between everything in this game is a loading screen. You want to go see your decks, loading screen, You want to see one particular deck, loading screen. You want to check your quest progress, loading screen. And here is the biggest problem with that, you get kicked out of your game and try to get back in, you have to sit through loading screens first. By time that is done your opponent is 2 turns ahead of you already. Bringing me to my next point.Too many disconnects. This game disconnects far to often and most of the time it is not my Internet. There have been multiple complaints about this and it is still bad after all this time. I don't know about everyone else but time is money. Disconnects are a waste of my time and money.There needs to be a larger box for putting prophecy cards back into your had when you don't wish to cast them. I don't know how many times I have lightning bolted myself in the face because i was a micro fraction off in putting the card in my hand. Yes both on computer and app.On the app its self navigation is horrible. Just trying to be able to search a card is a major pain. Might be different per one but I have an s8 with that stupid infinity edge. Not sure if that is the cause but It is very difficult to get the search bar to pop up the keyboard. It just sits there going from grey to white on and off. Also trying to advance through your cards is the same. Have to press the little arrow button 100 times before it will advance. Some of it may be lag but I suspect some of it is not. So formatting on that is kind of crap.I won't go too deep into how they listen too often to whiners about cards that beat there decks so they cry until the card that beat them gets nerfed. It happens in all games and its here too.I played Hearthstone for a number of years as well as Shadow era so this is what I am comparing to. I never had complaints like these or saw complaints for HS of SE, one large company and one smaller company so I completely expect that Bethesda should be able to step up their game on this. I think Bethesda is know for releasing half finished projects but in the amount of time that has gone by all of these things should have been priority before new content. I giving this a no but people will continue to get this game and play it because its fun and it works.

"9545,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Overall: 3/5, not terrible but better off playing a different card gamePros:-Great Elder Scrolls Taste-Various Modes to play (story, arena, vs), you still have plenty to do against AI-Not too difficult to get into-You can choose to play it completely free-Story mode offers many rewards-Has two lanes-Neat Prophecy system that allows you to draw a free card when your health passes certain intervals.

Yes, I am aware that as a card game it should feel similar to other pre-existing types, but it just matches too much. The main difference in this is image, the two lanes (which sounds neat but doesn't add a whole lot of change) and the prophecy system.Rant: One of my major complaints is what I am calling """"level barriers"""". A decent chunk of content is locked behind certain levels you need to reach to unlock it. This is understandable to a certain point, you should have enough experience with this to play more advanced stuff but is just overused. Certain starting decks (helpful to new people) are locked behind needed levels or progress in the story. Arena modes also require even more progress and levels (although it does make sense in respect to the story). There are also cards that start off fairly bland (no modifiers) that require you to reach a certain level in order to upgrade them. This sounds cool but think of it like this: you get a new rare card that has limited abilities since you aren't a high enough level. The game makes these upgrade cards worse with their crafting system (soul trapping, just like dust in HS) by making it so you cannot soul trap them until they are upgraded. To explain, if you do not want a card, you can soul trap it for material to make cards you want. Since you cannot soul trap these cards (many are legendaries, worth more material) you will hold on to them until you reach a high enough level to finally disenchant. To make this worse, people can get actually craft the upgraded version of the cards, meaining if you were to pay or play way more to get more cards, you can craft upgraded cards, which you would get by playimg more and leveling up.

THE MOST IMPORTANT PRO TO ME: it is still a manageable size. I left hearthstone behind because it was a bloated complicated mess with more content dumped on top weekly. This is currently a great size, and as a new game, there is less of a pro userbase to kick me down. (#realnoobtalk)The cons:The AI, although fun to play, is fairly weak. It makes clumsy decisions frequently. It steals almost everything from heathstone, and comes across as an amature effort because of that. I mean it steals... Everything.

There is a nice single player story mode in this game, that is narrated and full of choices. When you make a choice after beating an AI opponent in the story, you choose one card ore another to keep and the story changes based on that.

There is an arena mode where you can play with cards you do  not own and that evens the odds against more veteran players than yourself. There is also a ranked play using your own decks too with prizes given out at the end of each ranked play season.This game has some nice original features such as split board where the left anf right side of the game board have different aspects to them such as one can be if you play a card on the right side it is hidden for one turn and cannot be attacked directly til the next turn. This adds lots of strategy to the game. There is not too much RNG(luck) in this game although there is a little. But it is not liek Hearthstone, you dont get some crazy effects every 2 cards that make it feel like you lost due to randomness.They have a feature now that if you link your twitch account and bethesda(publisher for this game) account, you can receive in game rewards for watching streamers play this game, that is a nice boost to your gold or packs and so on that drop for you that way.Overall this is a very solid game, I highly reccomend it to anybody that enjoys card games, this is one of the very best out there!"",1"

"9567,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Honestly, one of the best card games I have played in a while. It's deep, complex, not rng-overloaded and have a very mature art style. In my time I've played some card games like MTG and Hearthstone and can say that this game is on the same level and it's relatively new. You also get a ton of stuff for free when you start and grinding process, while there, is not painfully boring. Oh, and solo arena is amazing!"",1"
"9568,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""It's hard not to compare this to Magic the Gathering. Saying that, this is actually better than MTG.  I especially like the system they use for adding magika to your pool. I haven't done any duels against real opponents yet so I may alter my review in the future, but for now the single player quest line is very fun. I created a green/white deck that was named """"Monk"""" (I wonder if all green white decks are auto named this?) and I will say it's extremly effective.   My only complaints are that I dislike the random events that happen in some chapters, things like being in a bar fight you can get hit with random bottles or in the arena there's random items to help you. Even though these random occurrences may give it a more Elder Scrolls feel, it gives it less of a strategy card game feel.  Being that this is a strategy card game I think we've could've done without those. The other complaint, and I saw this coming so it's no suprise, you can use real money to buy cards, making this yet another long line of pay to win games out there.

"9570,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I've played some 20 hours on the Bethesda platform, before you start accusing me of not knowing what I'm doing.A cardgame that puts less focus on card combos than either magic or hearthstone. The upside to this is that the game is very accessible, even starting decks are very decent since card combos aren't nearly as destructive and you don't really have to hold back cards, rely on perfect cards draws or create intricate decks that optimize card draw and synergy. There's pros and cons to that. Firstly you don't need to spends hundreds to get a semi-decent deck like in hearthstone or magic, where having a good is purely a matter of how much money you're willing to dump into it. Leveling the playing field that way is very noble, because I really can't stand these games that rely purely on deck synergy while locking the means to create that behind a two hundred dollar paywall. The flipside is that this game becomes very simple. The fun in cardgames is mainly to strategize, to guess what your opponent is holding back and to guess what your draws will be in order to optimally make use of your cards. Questioning wether you can hold that card and hope for a good combo or if holding back now will allow your opponent to spiral out of control. In this game I feel like the combos are a lot more tame. When you lose health you draw extra cards, so the minute you start losing health to an opponent's combo you will get a very high chance to draw counters. This turns the main strategy into pure board control until you are powerful enough to destroy your opponent in two turns and give him very little room to counter. Rushing is too dangerous.Beside that, I couldn't get into my Bethesda account from the Steam version, and since I mainly use Steam I would've quite liked having that option.All in all I'd certainly try this game out, it's definitely a good entrance to these types of games in general and there's certainly free fun to be had. Pay-to-win isn't too bad at all so this is a good option if you weren't about to drop several hundreds into physical magic cards or even worse: digital hearthstone cards. Recommended."",1"
"9571,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""As a long term heartstone player that quit a couple years back, I find myself loving this game far more than I ever enjoyed hearthstone. The meta in hearthstone has always heavily leaned on paying for the """"Adventures"""". Even if you did have all the cards, the gameplay just feels stupid compared to this game. Having the lane/rune system in this combined with more reasonably stat'd cards makes it feel like more like a strategic card game and less like a race to the face. I do not understand the mixed reviews as of late and hope this game is supported by the devs for a while.-Edit- I'm level 50 and have many more hours than steam shows, bethesda client and all."",1"

9585,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,This reminds me of Valve's new Artifact game. Everyone was excited for Half life 3 but they got a crappy Dota card game. Everyone was excited for Elder Scrolls 6 but then we got this. Anyone else see the similarity? It's not a bad card game though either.,1
"9586,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""This is nice game, great introduction for those first playing the genre. I've played 3 hours, a couple of matches a day following the story. Decks are quite well differentiated on how they are played. And matches are quick for those without much time. But as many other reviews I agree that gets repetitive quite quick.I mean, I can recommend this, but ultimately didn't like it. Games never last more than a couple of rounds, so you play with a few cards and there isn't many killer combos you can prepare or get chance to play to turn a match around. Mana or magica increases every round. And I didn't see so far a deck that allows you to increase yours or destroy your opponent pool, so there you lose a dregree of playability, and this ensures all cards are eventually playable, if you survive enough, If you have an 8 mana creature in the first hand, good luck with that.All are land creatures, and can always attack the oponent regardless how many defenses you have (except guards, those are well thougth). So, no much variety here, and there is not anything you trade off if you attack (you don't rotate cards), so, why not? The games reduces to the one who can make more damage per round, you can just ignore the enemy creatures if you hit strong enougthThis game is very casual, not thrilling at all."",1"
"9587,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""There are few people who have never heard of the Ancient Scrolls (The Elder Scrolls), every game in this series is a great event in the game world and a new generation of fans. Arena and Daggerfol for those who are older, Morrowind and Oblivion for those younger, and finally Skyrim for the youngest. All these games can be called cult, each introduced something of its own into the world of Elder Scrolls, what we brought the game The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, let's try to figure it out.Firstly, I do not agree that this game falls out of the general series, trampling on the canons of Scrolls. Yes, the key difference between online games from previous single player games is that now the player is not exclusive, he is not elected, as was before, not Nerevarin and not Dovakin, but only one of thousands out of millions. This seems to hurt.Secondly, what do we have? All the same Nirn torn by the war and on the brink of death. Events unfold for a long time before the events of the previous parts of the series, probably this fact also embarrasses many.Well, in the third, the changed game model, which changed from game to game and would inevitably have changed in this case. I can not say that innovations have pleased me, but I have to put up with this."",1"
"9588,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Perfect for casuals looking for fun, the game makes you kill hours of your day without realising it.a little hefty if you decide to go competitve, the P2W aspect starts to kick in.other than that its my favourite card game on the market yet!"",1"
"9589,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I played this game before it launched on Steam. It's okay. It's 90% Hearthstone with some new mechanics and faster ramp to mid-game. The promotion of cards (where cards you own get permanently impproved) feels like a mechanic that gives long-time players a serious edge over newcomers, which might be a problem in the future. But it's free and very generous in dispensing card packs, so there's very little to keep you from just trying it yourself.Edit: After playing this game some more, I'm now of a mind to caution people about what they are getting into. I like the gameplay far more than I do Hearthstone, as there is a lot more dynamic on the board through heavy removals and influencers. But I do agree that it is P2W, or at least as much as Hearthstone is.Once you get through the newbie ranks, you'll start hitting the opponents with more legendaries and promoted cards. Some builds have more than 10 legendaries in them. And they are legendary for a reason. On the flip-side, the cost of crafting cards are the same as in Hearthstone, while the chance of drawing a card is considerably less (TESL uses 50 card decks, so 1/50 at the start of the game). This means that crafted cards have less impact on a build and it will take longer to catch up to the people who decided to spend money on packs and exclusives (ie: cards you'll never get if you don't pay for them).I still enjoy the game and I hope you will too. It's just a shame that this balancing issue is woven so deeply into the business model of this game."",0"

"9591,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Pretty much what would happen if you mixed Hearthstone with Magic: the Gathering, with a little bit of new mechanics sprinkled in. It's very obvious that they were trying to replicate the former a lot when making this game, but unfortunately weren't able to give the same look and feel that makes Hearthstone fun. The two lane mechanic does make for some interesting new strategies when playing, and it's worth the download to be able to try that aspect out."",1"

"9593,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I wasn't overlly surew about this when it was release as there are a number of TCG's available on here now and with obvious competitors such as Magic and Hearthstone, makes you think how could this be an improvement over the 2 staples in TCG's.However I was wrong, it does however hold true to the same model as the aforementioned but this TCG has a lot going for it!

"9598,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Copies a lot from hearthstone(soul stone values for rarities etc), some decent improvments, but new players trying to play for free hit the same wall as most card games, in that they simply dont have the expensive overpowered cards of their opponents (in ranked play at least) and thats too much to reconcile most of the time. The campaign and solo arena as well as daily log in rewards allow you to simply log in for a month and not even play to catch up and be able to make a budget however. This is the route i reccomend if you are trying to make a decent deck without having to grind out the AI to get crafting material."",1"

"9601,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I'm finally drunk and pis*ed off enough to write a much needed review of this game.Steam forces you to pigeon-hole yourself into either """"thumbs-up"""" or """"thumbs-down"""" so I will place my review as a """"thumbs-down"""" but honestly it is more of a totally neutral thumb that tilts positive or negative depending on the intermittent pangs of rage that I feel towards this game. I also feel that I cannot be too harsh on something that has a FREE TO PLAY tag- I mean, they're literally giving it away, sera.First off this game has the same rage-quitting short-comings as most other card games. You can play well, exceptionally even, but at the end of the match it really is about who has the better cards- or who gets their hands on some fu**'ed up combo that breaks your lanes even though you are certain that your opponent is just some worthless piece of sh** with good luck.Second off, this game has the most obnoxious and redundant voice-overs corresponding to EVERY card activation. How am I supposed to convince my wife that I am not playing video games in the other room when ESOL howls with """"my will is good!""""'s and """"I am the night watcher""""'s? Do we, as players, really need to hear these inane prompts over and over again? What is the point? To immerse us in the game environment? To plug the other elder scrolls games? Puh-leeze.. my level 56 orc custom-class barbarian in Morrowind is rolling over in his Fu**ing grave right now. THE ORIGINAL MORROWIND HAD MAYBE 20 LINES OF VOICE DIALOGUE YOU â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. Why can't you at least offer an audio setting to stop the incessant voice over prompts? You ESOL designer pieces of sh** make me sick. Third off, this game's metrics for play are totally off. There is NO early game. By turn 3-4 you are bombing 4/4's and 5/5s, or  some other dreaded legendary nonsense. They need to slow the game down so that early game has some chance of success- especially considering that you get punished for being aggressive. Are you intentionally getting rid of aggro? Why? explain yourself, ESOL. Fourth off- back to the voice overs- GET RID OF THE GOD DAMN ARENA ANNOUNCER VOICE! """"WOW WHAT A BEATING"""" and """"THE HOUSE OF REDORAN MASTERS OF MARTIAL POWER IN MORROWIND!"""" um, NO!. just stop. and fire the designer who thought that was a good idea. He should never work in game design ever again.But finally.. it's free to play. They aren't asking for much of anything. It's entertaining enough. You should download it and play a few rounds."",0"
"9602,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Definitely worth trying. I used to play Hearthstone and few other card games and this one is really decent, but sadly not perfect. +  It has very enjoyable campaign with card upgrade system. I really enjoyed it.+ A lot of interesting interactions between cards with clear description (basically, you dont have to alt tab and google what specific passive on the card does, its all in the game displayed nearby card in separate window)+ It's a lot easier to get good deck in TES Legends compared to Hearthstone and ofc f2p.The only bad thing is the same unbalanced and stupid rng system that most card games use. Basically, all your cards come in random order which itself can ruin your game even in first turn. This is really boring and im surprised they didnt do any improvements to reduce amount of rng related to getting cards. For example, they could at least let players chose 2 cards which they will always start with and 2 random. The next logical step should be giving us options to pick half cards by yourself and half random instead of throwing random only, except situations where you use special action to chose 1 card and throw 2 other away.Really, just too much rng is the only problem with these kind of games."",1"
"9603,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Loving this game already just got it after I deleted it a while back (didn't really feel like playing).Great card game based on the lore of The Elder Scrolls franchise. I absolutely love card games and The Elder Scrolls, very similar to 2 other card games (Hearthstone and (Magic The Gathering) as they are slower than another 1 that I play which is Yugioh.I really do hope that they add some kind of system were it allows players to trade, sell or buy cards from one another by soul gems or gold.Gold is what you use to buy stuff from the store such as packs, bundles some preconstructed decks and an event ticket, gold is also aswell as an entry option for Solo Arena, Verses Arena and Gauntlet, while soul gems are used to soul summon a card which is basically creating it adding it to your collection and you can turn your extra cards into soul gems too.Ah yeah hope they add that in the future as some players don't have enough gems to summon their desired card.I %100 recommend this game to people that like card games and The Elder Scrolls. 10/10 <3 <3 <3Hope you guys enjoy the review thanks for reading and meh- Xysuhs"",1"
9604,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,one of the best new ccg to come out over last year. 2 lanes are very good and the cards work really well. Skyrim kinda chnaged the game and sounds like the new dlc will add alot of new elemets also. very easy to get hte cards without paying alot of money.,1
"9605,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I played Legends via the Bethesda Launcher, when it was first released (before it was on Steam). I'm not sure why I stopped, but I later decided to get it on Steam. I recently thought about playing it again, so I spent some time with it last night. I really enjoyed it, even more than Hearthstone, because it has a deeper single player mode to it. In fact, there's single player story mode and the solo arena.I was surprised, when I opened it up with Steam, that I was continuing from the progress I made from first playing it via the Bethesda Launcher. So, I didn't have to restart at the beginning. I learned a bit more about the game. In most battles there are two lanes for cards, sometimes there is only one. Sometimes they contain bonuses, for instance the right may give cards cover, so they canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be attacked until theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re exposed. Sometimes the left lane may give cards a bonus, too. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interesting.I usually won (in single player mode), but when I lost, I'd switch decks (from what I obtained) and win. I've now finished the first story and I believe I've unlocked all the modes. Now I need to earn more gold or spend real money to unlock more.To complete some dailies, I had to fight real players. I lost each time, but some of the games were close. I didn't feel bad about losing, because my daily goal was just to play in versus mode. So, that was an easy one to achieve. In contrast, Hearthstone often has dailies that include victories, certainly not a daily I enjoy.This game is apparently on multiple platforms, making it much more accessible. I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fun and being based on TES makes it even better. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another free CCG and I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth playing."",1"

"9607,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Really fun and enjoyable game.

"9615,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I've only played for a while but it's a rather fun game. It's basically Magic the gathering meets hearthstone with elder scrolls characters.

"9618,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Decent game, not perfectly balanced, one of the better card games. You can play it on Android. Gwent is way better than it but hard to compare the two really. If Gwent was on steam and android it would overtake this by a long shot though. The new expansion should breath life back into this game though. It has a Magic the Gathering feel but with better mechanics. Not too complex, easier to play than Gwent and more convienent. Sorry for the comparison but those are the top two card games right now beside Crapstone that doesn't balance their whole game. So, that will never be played again."",1"

Tbh I wasnt that much invested into card games, but after playing Gwent in Witcher 3, i discovered they can be quite entertaining.This game though, is very much unlike Gwent (at least the old online version, because the new one had lost much of its originality) and revolves entirely around the ES universe and lore, with a very nice and immersive mechanic. The cards are rather cool, and I do enjoy the graphic style and overall design. The premium cards, not so much, someone got lazy there, because they have just some background effects instead of a full-blown animation (like the Gwent ones).I can see that a lot of people have complained about the new interface and connection/lag issues, but so far (after like 15-20 days) I have yet to encounter any such issue. All in all, its a solid card game, and especially after they included the 3-attribute sets, with  great replayability, if u care more for the story/stories than technical perfection.

"9636,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Been playing this game for a while. New update: Pro- Gameplay is still the same- Load time improved (lost quality of detail - likely so it would load faster on tablets)Cons- Animations seem like a rookie studio made them- Sound effects are horrible now, nothing like it used to be- Animations are laggy- Card art has lost quality, having the borders removed seems like an odd choice.- Interface looks dingy, looks like an old school arcade game or something, the old interface had more character and feel.OverallThe update had graphical changes that were not for the better.  While they improved the loading time they sacrificed detail and quality.  Cards look ok, still nice looking though.  The biggest thing for me is the lag or delay during game play and the sound effects are terrible. I can live with graphical changes however, I hope they fix the lag and really improve the sound effects, they are horrible now. (When your main character gets hit, it used to make a nice BOOM noise... now it is a little whack noise... HORRIBLE) that is just an example.Game is still a great card game, hopefully this new studio can remediate the problems they are experiencing. "",1"

"9638,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Very much like Hearthstone,However, One should not be detered from that fact.The game may have the same concept of Hearthstone, but has its own unique traits, characters, and actually has a story to go with the game.Some may not like that but i enjoy a good story, espically with Elder Scrolls. Overall, really worth playing if you like Hearthstone."",1"
"9639,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,,""Scrolls: Legends is a masterpiece TCG. It's easy to learn, fun to play, addictive, great graphics, mechanics, and unique in concept. As a avid Magic the Gathering player, Heartstone, and LOTR-TCG, I must say i like this one the best! The interface is perfect and the deck building is so much fun!  There is lots of strategy, luck and skill all wrapped up in one quite honestly perfect card game. Of course spending some money on cards, decks, and expansions is there. But there is NO trading card game that doesn't employ those tactics. It's part of the genre, so expect it. But i tell you, you can still have a blast playing this game, going through the stories, solving the puzzles, etc. without having to spend any $$$ if you want. But if you are like me, you will fall in love with this game and at some point might want to spend some money. The expansions are totally worth it! The multiplayer game system is grand and exciting! I love the daily quests and rewards. It keeps me logging in to play a few games and sometimes a few hours at a time.

Pros :Very f2p friendly.Awesome community and alot of helpful guides on the Internet on how to get a fast collection. Very little RNG.Almost every class is viable. Cons: Even tho there is very little RNG there still is some even tho it is most of the time not game deciding.  ,1
"9641,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""*edit 06-08-2018*I've changed my Review to positive after revisiting the game again!(but for the sake of transparency I've kept the original review text.it would seem that through patching the developers have managed to make the game significantly more stable(only had a single freeze so far - where before it was constantly making the game unplayable)also with the adition of the new card releases some more interesting mechanics have been introduced.still find the presentation a bit on the dull side though.*edit 06-08-2018*--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Elder Scrolls: Legendsis a fairly vanilla CCG with only a few """"new"""" features that in the end doesn't  make up for the Games technical problems e.g. GAME CONSTANTLY CRASH.pros:1)Voice acting for the singleplayer campaign is solid.2) easy to learn mechanics3) """"Prophecy"""" cards, one of the new things I haven't seen in other card games. basically for every 5 health you lose(starts is 30) you get to draw a card, if you draw a prophecy card you can play it for free....it's a nice littel catch up mechanic that can sometimes prevent your opponent from steam-rolling you.4) lane mechanics(singleplayer...due to technical difficulties I never got around to play vs. so don't know how it works there) the game board is split into two lanes creatures can only attack each other in those lane....in some cases lanes have special rules....fx. hidden for the first round they're in play.5) upgradeable basic cards. when you you level up your account, some of your basic cards gets upgraded and at times you can even chose an upgrade path...it's a nice touch it does mean though that match making can be a problem if you get matched with a higher level opponent, since he can have upgraded versions of your base cards. but at least for the singleplayer portion it gives a nice sense of progression.cons:1) boring presentation.2) boring card mechnics...basically not much that haven't been done before.(outside of the pophecy mechanic)3) Technical problems. the game constantly crashes for no apparent reason...considering it's a basic card game having the game constantly crash is simply unforgiveable and it's the primary reason I won't recommend this game and the reason I'm uninstalling it."",1"
"9642,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I found the story mode to be very intriguing. It was also very rewarding to play because they give you a lot of free cards and currency to buy more cards.Sadly, the story mode ends at Chapter 3 and you have to pay 1,500 gold to unlock the next episode. (For reference, you get like 15 gold per 3 games won in PVP) I hope they add more free chapters soon, because right now, its 95% pvp grinding. So no, I cannot recommend it in its current state.PS. If you're wondering about gameplay mechanics - just think Hearthstone but with different card rules. Nothing more needs to be said on that front."",0"
"9643,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I have put hundreds of hours into this game well before it ever hit Steam and boy let me tell you, it was worth every minute!If you are a former HS player then TES Legends will feel familiar while introducing some seriously interesting new and strategic differences. The music ( in my opinion ) is great and doesn't get old, the card art is outstanding! And the game employs some seriously interesting and dynamic field/game mechanics that you should definitely come across in it's Arena modes or the games monthly """"Chaos Arena"""". The game is also quite generous with awarding free content for playing especially during the early stages. And with the recently introduced """"Twitch Drops"""" you can either get a free Legendary, 600 gold ( which means up to 6 packs with 6 cards per pack ) or 1500 Soul Gems which you use to craft new cards. All just for tuning into ANY stream that is streaming TES Legends! So if you like CCG's should you give this game a shot ? A big hell yes!  "",1"

"9648,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I usually dont play online Card games because, in my opinion, Card games like this seem to typically be based more on luck instead of skill, which i dont like, i also typically dont play online card games because a decent amount seem to be pay to win *cough* cough* Hearthstone *cough* *cough* and sadly, this game seems to already be going down a pay to win path, its not AS pay to win however, seeing as how getting money for card packs seems to be a lot easier than it is in Hearthstone, but i am still somewhat dissapointed that despite the fact that this game is only about a month old, there are technically 2 DLC's, the Dark Brotherhood Cards and the Heroes of Skyrim DLC, the game gave me the Alduin Heroes of Skyrim deck for free (I dont know why) and i played with it a bit, and the Heroes of Skyrim Cards absolutely destroy Core Cards, which kinda upset me, i just hope it doesnt get to the point where everyone just uses skyrim cards just to avoid being crushed by other people with Skyrim Cards, because most of the Core Cards are very good, but only against other core cards, The only thing i can say i fully Enjoyed from this game was the story, The Story is difficult, but not too difficult, which i loved, and the rewards you get for playing it are amazing, Overall, i have to say i dislike this game, but if you are a person who thinks they could get into it, i highy reccomend playing the Campaign Fully for all the nice Bonuses, and also, dont spend your gold on Core Cards, but Skyrim Card packs with it, so you dont get crushed."",0"
"9649,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""So whilst this game WAS amazing, they released the skyrim set.

The new set made it P2W, it's absolutely awful design because the set is so powerful and renders everything else useless. It's just got strictly better stuff so if you can't pay you can't win. Maybe if they actually balance it I'll reccommend again, but they want money before it dies. They'll just get the money and the game will die, like so many other ccg's."",0"

Speaking of gold you can buy a deck with a theme (Like Aludin dragons/ parthunaxx shouts) for about 500, which I reckon is possible after about 12 hours of somewhat grinding and you'll be pretty set after that, or at least have a nice place to start.Want to also give props to the campaigns, they're neat little stories that give pretty great rewards. The downside being that all except the default story comes in 3 acts, each costing 1000 gold each for a grand total of 3000 gold to play through a whole campaign (oof)Lastly I'd like if the arena saw a bit of a change or tickets for it were more common (without a ticket it costs 150 to enter, a good run where you completly beat it all will probably give you around 125 gold...huh?).

"9659,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Played this game long before it came on Steam.If you are fed up with Hearthstones limitations and money grabbing then you won't find a better alternative in Elder Scrolls, for that you willl need to look at Spellweaver.The same goes for gameplay, they tried to be different with lanes, but they forgot everything else. What makes a card game great is gameplay and the ability to enjoy it in a balanced environment. Elder Scrolls does not offer this at all. In fact it is the same old crap, where players who have played more or payed will have the advantages. Leaving you with a terribly unsatisfying choice of buying your way through or leaving the game or painfully grinding as fodder for other players who paid.At least in Spellweaver you can grind cards vs the ai to get your collection up before facing people, in Elder Scrolls, this is not an option. So you will be faced with the decision to either get smashed vs people or pay.The free campaign offered a really nice introduction into the game and if only the momemtum could have continued from there. But it didn't, the fun abruptly ends when the campaign ends, and you realize the pay wall between you being able to continue to play more campaign or becoming competitive. The alternative is playing the ai for no relevant collection reward or doing the solo arenas that increase in difficulty without an equally scaling of draft choice strength.The game desperately wants you to pay money, that is the sad part, it just isn't worth it. Unless you somehow fall in love with the gameplay, but in my opinion there isn't enough in this game to differentiate it from other card games. So because of this, would rather enjoy another card game like Spellweaver that actually has many more advantages to this or other card games. Would recommend you play that instead. If you really want to play a solid card game. Go with Spellweaver."",0"

A game can fluctuate immensely and it always has me on my guard or looking for a way to knock everything over with a well timed attack.The card variety is much larger than I expected when I started and I only got a real idea of how much there was when I looked to my stats and saw how low my % of each level card I had.The downsides I've run into are as follows"

At some point the cheap deck won't be enough anymore.Though I don't recommend it for another reason: I don't see a skill-based game in The Elder Scrolls: Legends.

"9665,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""A game I tried desperately to like and simply cant, Legends feels very much like a cash grab by Zenimax. Nearly bereft of innovation, Legends is a trading card game. Cards range from Common to Rare to Epic to Legendary (skipping Uncommon) because...that's how Hearthstone does it. Crafting costs are exactly the same as in that...other game...except for a slight discount on Legendary cards despite being able to play 3 times as many of them per deck, for the most part.Decks are 50 cards and playsets are 3 of for...reasons. Apparently, not ones related to either mathematics or common sense. Despite an additional 20 cards in the deck however, starting hands remain 3 cards. Because...well, you guessed it.For all its carbon copying of...that other popular card game...Legends does offer one interesting mechanic all its own (or, well, almost all, anyway): Lanes. In what is perhaps Legends singular fit of innovation, the board is split into two lanes. One lane plays normally, while the other grants minions Cover (Stealth from hearthstone, without the spell protection) for one turn. That the game utterly fails to capitalize on this single innovation should come as no surprise. Lanes exist. Some cards let you move minions from one lane to another. Which sometimes nets you...maybe +1/+1 or a card draw. For the most part, though, games will focus on whatever lane the first minion is played in while mostly ignoring the other, because lanes were a poorly thought out, poorly implemented and large pointless add-on, likely shoved in at some point because its vaguely similar to Gwent in some way on some marketing report somewhere.Couple this clumsy, poorly thought out, copy cat play design with a UI that is an insult to the eyes - half cloth fantasy map and half electric blue star trek lighting, laid latter atop the former - and the game is as painful to look at, as it is to play.My advice: Avoid this. Its clunky, poorly designed, poorly thought out and keeping up with new releases is quite expensive. So dont bother. Stick with card games that will still be here in 12-18 months."",0"

"9671,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""+ Not a copy of Hearthstone+ Tries to fix 'bad hand' and 'no comeback' problems by letting you redraw starting cards once and For every five of your starting health you lose, you draw a crad (with a machanic where some cards can be automatically played from this draw)+ lots of cards that are interesting because of effects other than their stats.~ Magicka Ring. Let's the player that goes second tap it once a turn to get +1 magicka (your resource to cast stuff). 3 uses. I personally think this is overpowered and should be reduced to 2 charges as it makes me want to go second so I have a field advantage for 3 turns, but that's me and would need more input and testing to make sure.~ Unique two lane system. Some say it helps agro decks, some say it helps get around defnsive, wear-down decks. If anything it is new and the lanes are actually different. One lane makes creatures unable to be targeted for one turn by enemy creatures, so the situations you get into are intersting.- A 50 card deck minimum, but only gives you a 3 card starting hand (+1 on draw). Means that the vast majority of the time you won't get the card you need to effectively counter the enemies' opening strategy unless you have alot of that counter. Really makes you fell like half the cards in your deck are useless because you will never get to them even with the draw on lost life. Yet, the arena/draft mode only let's you pick 30 cards, so, I don't even know.- Cards that help you if you're winning and don't doâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥if you're losing. These cards mostly involve the """"if you have more health than your opponent, do some crazy thing."""" For some factions, their effects are fine, but for others the effect basically keeps you ahaed for a good few turns on it's own as your opponent tries to do something about it while he is already at a defecit.- A card upgrade system. For some reason, few people talk about this but it is prevalent enough. A small number of core cards can come to you at a base level through the story. More cards to new players is good, but these cards are mostly worse than their upgraded version. The cards can only be upgraded when you reach a prespecified level and don't think it's like every level for the first ten or something, one took until level 75 when I looked at it. You can get the upgraded cards through packs so you can wait for rng or fork some cash. The big problem with these is how some upgraded are straight better than the unupgraded, the upgrade just straight gains a new ability with no increase in cost or any downside. This leaves players with the terrible choice of play a card that is worse than your opponents or have it sit there for however many levels.- No reward for losing. The game gives you a daily mission each day and you can hold up to three. There is a counter for every three wins you get some gold and a single random card. However, if you lose, you get nothing except progress towards a daily mission. I'm really tired of thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ All it does is try to get you to fork over cash so that you can get some better cards or new strategies. This hurts the people trying to learn, the people who lost a very close match, the people who lost from a bad starting hand, etc."",0"
"9672,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""If you like to be brow beat by a system that is setup to ensure you loose, then this is the game for you. You can either play against the computer that has the decks and special lanes rigged so that you may win here or there, but most of the time it's """"thanks for the money to play, you lose so please pay more to try again."""" Or you can play PVP against people that have been playing since the beginning when the game was easy to build up and they have perfect decks. Of course you can pay them $70 to get a fist full of random cards and hope that you get something that isn't garbage. No luck? That's okay, you can pay another $70 and try again. Again, great game if you're into no-win scenarios."",0"
"9673,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Alright first things first. I've clocked about 200+ hours on the steam version, and roughly 300 on the mobile version. I've played this game a lot.This is and Elder Scrolls Card Game, it plays well and is somewhat """"balanced."""" In no way is this game pay to win, but you can buy the expansions (which are quite fun) that will add cards to your collection that are only obtainable through said expansions. You can either pay for them with in game currency, or with money. The base game is pretty straight forward, the campaign is good and there is some story behind it. And since its based on the Elder Scrolls, if you like the lore, you should enjoy the nod it provides. Now for the expansions. Dark Brotherhood: It's fun, adds some challenge and has an interesting story overall. Worth paying real money for.Clockwork City: This was an interesting change for the neutral side of the game, adding a variety of cards that can really make having neutral cards other than meta cards useful. I recommend buying with money, but in game currency works as well.Puzzles: Now these can be quite difficult and brain teasing, fun to complete but no replay value to them. This one does not give you direct access to certain cards, but card packs. I recommend buying this one with in game currency rather than money, as the price isn't justifyable. Now on to why I don't recommend the game. I won't lie, its still one of my go to games to play on my phone, and something to kill time. But the playerbase is dwindling, and you will be able to find matches easily, but it feels super rigged from time to time. You'll often find yourself in situations where it will give your opponent every single top deck card they need, and you don't have a single answer for anything. You can often tell from the first 5-6 turns whether or not its going to be a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥how or not, but this is not concrete and you can have some epic comebacks. -- The game was balanced exceedingly well before the Houses of Morrowind update, now that you can have 3 attribute 75 card decks, they are often more or less â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t and annoying to play against. Some cards feel extremely broken (though they can have an answer to them if you don't waste your useful cards) and are often just not fun to play against. They added too many new cards in one swoop and it threw the meta and average game into a weird place. Most decks created prior to the expansion feel obsolete and not viable when playing against people with seemingly random decks with the new cards. -- Their slogan """"Are you tired of losing to RNG?"""" is laughable at best. There are quite a few cards in the game that are completely RNG based, and its a card game, its going to be RNG anyways, luck of the draw. You can absolutely get decimated by RNG in this game and its very annoying"
9674,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,Stay away. The initial campaign is entertaining enough but only takes a few hours to burn through. After that the matches quickly become less about skill in playing the game than a contest of who can spend the most money on the game. Mechanics are clunky at best. Play style and cards are also incredibly unbalanced and each release of cards completely shifts the game such that if you cannot afford to straight out purchase the new cards you don't have a chance of being competitive even in the casual arena. If you're looking for a good money sink this is it. If you're looking for a balanced electronic Magic alternative look elsewhere. ,0
"9675,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I usually write longer reviews but i really don't have the time to explain why this is not worth playing.  If you love this style of gameplay, love TES series and don't mind throwing some cash around, then you will love this game.  However, if you dont like the idea of having to spend a lot of money here and there just to get decent content, then don't bother with this.    The balance is mostly fair aside from the 'Lethal"""" status which allows you to one-shot any enemy,   Graphics are nice, story for the main quest is really cliche and just lame.  You don't even get that far into the game before you get hit by the pay wall where you have to pay for the side chapter.  Yes there is an in-game currency that you can gain but its so much and you can only get this stuff for such a small amount over time that its really annoying.Honestly, I really don't know what I was expecting.

This one however is not free to play.  MANY sections of the game are locked to only paying players. The other half of the game can be unlocked if you farm a rediculous amount of gold. I went through the story and played practice matches, at the end of it all I had like 200 gold. common card packs cost 100g, If you want to play other people then you need Arena tickets that are $2 each. Common card packs cost $5 each.  There are 5 more story campaigns after the first, Two unlock with 1,000 gold each and the other 3 needs CASH $14 each. That's for the dark brothood storyline, FYI you can't finish it without cash. There is another clockwork storyline with 3 that can be unlocked with 1,000 gold and then 2 for cash $14 and $20.

"9699,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Nice graphics if you like more toned down washed colors rather than the repulsive barf of colors of the heartsone. UI is horribly slow with the over the top animations. There is no interuption cards as such, you can take your time with the turns. Only disruptive cards enemy can play in your turn are some special cards players earn when their health drops below certain points. Surprisingly many cards have random effects.Story mode is interesting and at start you will see your deck develop nicely. Then the story mode ends and  you are left with cards that most likely you are not able to create anything more than a few decks of copuple of cheap tricks. This is not just because of the few cards you have, but also because the cards have quite few and specific synergy advantages. You are then forced to take those decks to PvsP fights for low profits. Can't say if it is pay2win, but advancement will be very slow and frustrating without paying real money.Please play at least the free story mode till the end and try the PvsP fights before thinking about investing real money. It is free and fun till then and defenetely you should try it. Sadly it looks they don't need players, they want money instead.

9700,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,Hearthstone clone with nothing unique about it. Punishes players for attacking into each other creating boring gameplay. Bethesda's destruction of the elder scrolls series continues in full force with no signs of stopping anytime soon.,0
"9701,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""TLDR My non recommendation has nothing to do with card acquisition or purchases. But purely mechanics. This is from both beta play and a little bit after launch as confirmation.I want to like TES: Legends. I really do, not just because it is based in one of my favourite game worlds, but because it has some really cool mechanics. But some other core mechanics are absolute game breakers for me.The Good:The Elder Scrolls, No seriously they've done  great job of encapsulating the world and races into the cards. Argonians have aggressive majika ramping, Nords rapidly turn into a hoard, Khajit get stronger by stealing from their opponent, Dunmar always get the last laugh even in death. Having played TES since Arena I'm surprised how much this game captures the spirit of Tamrial.Lanes, they add an interesting strategic layer to the game. Where you summon your creatures matter just as much as what you summon. Do you throw a powerful creature into a crowded lane to thin the enemy ranks? Or into a deserted lane where they have a clear shot at the enemy player?Match Effects, this type of game always gravitates towards fixed metas. Having effects that throw a spanner in the works is a great idea. It keeps everyone on their toes.The Bad:Starting Hand Size, no I'm not kidding. Maybe this isn't an issue for many, but for someone unlucky like me, this is a game breaker. I play MTG and even with seven cards I often struggle to get a balanced starting hand, but at only three staring cards I too often find myself waiting to turn 3-4 before I can do anything. Meanwhile my opponent is already getting creatures on the field and dealing damage, often with snowball creatures. Yes, yes, yes deck composition is important, but the simple fact remains that with cards ranging from 0 majika to 7, 8+ majika it's still too easy to get a starting set of 4-6 majika cards, discard your highs and STILL have 3-4 cost cards.It's really, really bad because it just so often leaves the games down to luck of initial draw. Draw your really good low cost cards, you've got a strong chance, get deluged with high cost cards and you may as well give up before you even play a turn. So with this in mind, no, no I do not recommend The Elder Scrolls: Legends... I want to, but with entire games hinging on a 3 card draw, I can't."",0"

Probably worst thing i noticed so far is power creep on legendary cards. Seriously some legendary cards are bonkers and you can have 3 copies of one card in deck ( unless card is Unique, than only one )Most best decks have tons of legendary and epic cards, and believe me they are usualy much better for same mana cost than lower rarities or cards from older sets .This is fun free to play card game you either invest a lot of time or wallet to be competitive .I cannot take this game seriously as daily game becouse RNG and power creep, but ES Legends is worth playing .EDIT :  I forgot to mention this game have super annoying Blink\Flash of light everytime card is played or something happend on board, if you have senstitive eyes like me, prepare yourself sunglasses or you will need medical attention ."",1"

This game used to be one of the best card games out there, now its a joke and sell out. The ranked match ups are not even close to fair. I hope Bethesda goes bankrupt and the developers become homeless. I will never spend a cent on their products."",0"
"9719,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""The gameplay is a blast. It's a well-thought out card game and it has some extremely thoughtful game mechanics and even design features. It's a lot of fun, the different game modes are great (I hope they make more, I can't get enough of them.) It's very difficult usually to make your alternate game modes as interesting as the campaign mode and I think they accomplished that feat beautifully.IMPORTANT NOTE: People say this game is pay-to-win. That is not at all the case. You have full access to the base game and can earn a lot of the expansions with gameplay, although you can make a perfectly badass deck without them. Now if you REALLY like the game, like me, you WILL spend money on it. Guaranteed. But I think it's totally worth it and the prices are reasonable, especially if you keep it to like one microtransaction a month or so.NEW INTERFACEI had never heard of this game prior to reading an article about how much people hate the new interface, so bear in mind that I have ONLY played with the new interface, but I have done so with the negative reviews in mind.PROS:1) It's clean, and it's beatiful. The animations really add something. They need a little work, and are a little glitchy right now, but I think that will all come out in the wash.2) It's lean. I didn't really see any garbage anywhere, and that's a bonus.3) The voices, which I understand it have been altered from the previous game version, are awesome. I love the way they recorded them, and they make some of the cards very intimidating and others downright hysterical.CONS:1) It LOOKS like a new interface, and I don't mean modern and hip, I mean like the game was just made yesterday and they haven't really figured out what to do with it yet.2) It's very sterile, and that is a big complaint in the reviews that I really agree with. Clean and sterile are two different things. Just because things are minimalistic doesn't mean you have to forgo style. That said, it is brand new, and I'm hoping they plan to refine it, sophisticate it a bit (because it stands out amidst the high quality of the rest of the game)"",1"
"9720,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""As far as I can find, this seems to be the best DCcG out there imo.  There is also a small program that will let you import and export decks, keep track of draws for both you and your opponent, and let you export your library to a database.Its different enough from HS to be a nice change.The art is realistic, dark and excellent.  Unlike many other DCCG.You can also get gold and soul stones by linking your Bethesday account with twitch and then having twitch open to TESL twitch channels. You can get to rank 4 with some trial and error and cheap decks for sure.  Especially after playing through all the PVE content.  I hit a wall at rank 4 till i found a good deck to beat that meta "

"9723,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I always find it amusing when people give a thumbs down to a game they play every day and have hundreds and hundreds of hours invested in. Attack me for having an opinion if you want but if you are still actively playing a game and you have invested that much time, why would you give it a negative review? I mean, you seem to have gotten your money's worth out of it otherwise you wouldn't spend so much time playing the game. I understand the game has flaws. Heck, I have screamed about he slanted RNG and can't make it to legend in ranked to save my life. But haven't we all bought games for $50 - $60 and walked away with an opinion of """"meh.."""", but that game wasn't worth writing a negative review. And the complaint that you get your butt kicked when you start playing and have to buy cards. Are you saying you didn't get your butt kicked in COD or PUBG when you first started? Come on now.....Yes, buying cards will help you along faster. But if you link your twitch account to drain drops when you aren't playing and hit the solo arena as often as possible, you will get cards, gold and soul gems very quickly. It is a fun card game. It is free. It is easy to get hundreds of hours invested and you can get where you want to be with some time and effort. Sure spending cash is a shortcut, but I have not seen many free games where that is not the case. But I also know people who have played this game as completely free, never invested a penny and still have formitable decks. You just have to be willing to grind a bit.

"9726,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Fun game, has some good systems and makes you want to keep playing it, which is what you are after.  However you should be very careful when starting the game first time.  The game gives you an option to sign in with an account or click new.  If you click """"im new"""" with the intention of logging into your account later (as in my case where i couldnt remember my password), you will be in a world of trouble.  It is almost impossible to get your account linked to your bethesda account later on.  For some incompetent reason, unlike every other site on the internet, they didnt put a sign in option next to register.  Some people say there is a sign out option in the settings, but it isnt there if you click """"im new"""".  I have searched the internet for ways to fix it and all the solutions other people came up with didnt work.  They suggested to contact support, but all it had in customer support was some random generic problem and no option to type in a specific issue.  I recently studied for, and passed a psychology exam and it was easier than solving this problem."",1"

I originaly played this game on the bethesda launcher during beta and it was fun. I only stopped so I could play the game on steam. This game is a must if you love the Elder Scrolls series. The only thing this game is missing is nothing.PS. Im not a Fanboy and not everything by Bethesda is perfect (AKA. FALLOUT 4 not an RPG/ Dishonored 2 Bugs) so don't even start with me.

"9729,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""An interesting game. Fun for a while before you realize that this game is just too luck based and not enough skill based. For example, one of the story based missions requires you to keep from having a single card destroyed. It takes quite a few rounds to get the luck required to have the right cards in your hand at the right time. For a 2nd mission story to have to be repeated  20+ times till you are lucky enough is just plain frustrating. There is a huge variety of cards to play through and the game has awesome mechanics. When the right cards are in your hand, the game is very fun when playing against other players, but at a minimum of 50 cards, it will take a while to figure out how to build a deck. For card based game players, I would reccomend you to give it a chance. For me, though, I cant stand working on a single story mission over and over and over...you get the idea."",1"

"9734,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I will admit that the Single Player (story mode) is pretty fun but after that the only thing left is a bit of Arena Play (which you have to pay for every time with in-game money) and then there's multiplayer ofcourse which honestly is complete BS. The game itself becomes repulsive after the story mode and even the the Practice mode made me want to rage. I have years of experience with strategy games and I have had alot of challenges wich I kept on trying untill I reached success...but with just the Novice opponent in practice mode, I propably had about 6 attemps before I beat the guy.How I recommend improving this game: Try making practice mode actually possible (seriously you guys..) and give players more ways to improve their strategic skills in the game like designing specific challenges to help players with their weaknesses in this specific game. Go ahead and download it if you want, but it will only keep you busy for a few hours in my opinion..."",0"
"9735,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""So... I've played this game for a measly 6 hours, yet here I am, writing a negative review.First of all, I'm not hardcore into TCGs. I kinda like them but they're not my main gaming focus. I've tried dozens of TCGs, including classics like Magic. But the one I mainly got stuck on was Infinity Wars, at least for some time. I dropped IW due to a massive lack of polish and then the occasional luckstomps. Sure you can't avoid luckstomps entirely in games like this, but not losing a game due to gamebreaking bugs would be nice.In general I liked the gaming concept of IW however, and thus I came here thanks to steams recommendations.So what is my beef with ES:L, so much so I feel I have to give the thumbs down and move on after a measly 5 hours?Let's talk lanes and targeting first. Similar to IW, ES:L has 2 lanes (some very rare rounds have 1). Very unlike IW lanes here only roughly restrict your targeting. There is no pre-set attack order and turns are not simultaneous, so you can hit everything in your lane, but also the enemy if he/she doesn't have a unit with guard.Some lanes also have RNG effects which are nice at first, and simply annoying and pesky later.Now the purpose of this is putting depth into card placements. Basically the question is put your cards in the way of enemy team A or B? Exploit effect A or B?Effectively though this brings tons of problems with it, combined with the other factors. The balance between defending and rushing is extremely fragile, a bit of drawing luck from your enemy, a bit of misfortune from you, and a superior force will be gone in a single turn. And we're seriously not talking about skill here, just to be clear.Not really fun to me.Theres even one card that injures all of your units in one lane, then there's another that kills every injured unit in one lane, exacerbating this kind of problem. No caveat either, and not difficult to play. Stuff like this seems to be rather common, and if you don't have a counter... tough. It's a key-lock situation. If you have the lock deck, get familiar with the location of the concede button. Or prepare different decks for... well, anything and everything.Next we have Magicka, basically your summon resource.You use it to summon cards. That's it. No spending Magicka to draw cards, no shuffling, nothing. So you have to keep up an adequate stream of cards by having other cards that allow you to draw more. Obviously RNGeezus is gonna have a couple words with you here.If you miss your curve, draw too many high cost cards early, or not enough later on, or even better both, have fun wasting half your Magicka each turn. Have an enemy with a bit of luck and watch him spam the livingâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥out of you.Even midway through the campaign it was common to have fights that were entirely based on RNG, with the stampede swinging both ways. Same deck, same strategy, some times I win with 20 HP left easily, some times I lose with enemy having 20 HP left and no chance from the beginning.Oh, also the player that moves second gets a mana ring to make up for being late. I feel that's not quite balanced either and I've seen many people have the same problem.And really, at this point I don't even care about further pros or cons in the game since the main mechanics are not my definition of TCG fun.If you're prepared to dig through a seemingly unpleasant meta, and if you're prepared to face RNGeezus himself. Go for it.Otherwise... pass this one up or be careful. Or try Infinity Wars, it's not perfect but has the whole 2-lanes/summoning resources business down a whole hell of a lot better in my opinion."",0"

"9742,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Game Review:     Mechanics are fun and different. The story, verses, solo, ladder, and AI modes are all fun and make the game unique. There are also special events that happen to change up some of the arena play.   It is an easy Card Game to get into.  If you like the Elder scrolls Universe then it is a must play.  If you are not familiar with the Elder Scrolls universe it is still a good CCG to play. Personal Feelings:Don't do it. Unless you like losing.  Honestly, it was fun at first. It seemed as if the win rate was about 60% for me. I have only spent $25.00 worth of real money to get some decks, otherwise I've used in game coins to buy some of the dark brotherhood.  Recently it seems something has changed. Not sure what exactly but now my win rate is about 15%.   It seems as if the pairing and RNG for card draw is against everything I try.  It is like I'm falling more and more behind those who have all the right cards. I'm not saying everyone has bought all the cards but sometimes I wonder if the game is purposly pushing me into a cornor so I feel like I need to buy decks (like keeping track of how much I've spent).I don't like games that make me feel like I have to buy the in-game content to have fun. Like another Negative review stated """"extremely difficult spike"""".   I wish there were two servers: One for those who've spent less than $30.00 of real money and another for those who spent more.I cannot recommend this game to anyone who dosen't wish to pay-to-catchup with the rest of the TES:L community.

9743,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,Can't reccomend this game. After months of trying to beat the campaign I have to give up. I cannnot progress without spending money and the campaign bosses actively cheat/have scripted cards that you cannot seem to defend against. If you just want to have a time waster to play without investing money and playing only multiplayer do not waste your time on this game.

"9745,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Pay2win, TESL is only for those, who are ready to spend money! Around 40â‚¬ - 50â‚¬ should do it.But, one of the biggest problems is how the algorithm draws cards from the deck. It's far from """"natural"""". I've played quite a lot of MTG (with physical cards) and can tell the difference. They should really work on this issue.When playing against the """"Ai"""", or software more accurately, you can tell, that it """"cheats"""" regularly. Nobody has such luck! Possibly the devs are trying to limit crystal grinding (one can aquire new cards by spending crystals). They are artificially making the grinding more difficult. Not fun at all!Currently you can only make like 2 types of decks, and thats it. Coming from MTG, one greatly misses playing on the other players turn (like interrupting etc.). I mean, in MTG you could make decks, that don't even have creatures :) you just lived off the other players cards. Such great strategies were formed that way.In TESL you just play creatures and boost them, nothing else. The matches feel repetitive and gameplay is really simple. You have to beâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥drunk or plain stupid, in order to make mistakes.On plus side, it has an Android version also. That's kinda fun.But overall, it's ok casual entertainment.

"9746,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""SALTMatchmaking and deck balance appears fundamentally broken. Most players I was paired with played with the same obtusely powerful deck no decks the game itself offered me stands a chance against. If raining a hailstorm of losses onto new players is some new tactic to get them to stick to the game, then I guess I'm just getting old.

"9759,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I ranked 2 one season, mainly because i didn't play enough and i have 75% of the cards with a lot of hours.Yes, this is the hearthstone we all wanted, it is perfect.But why the negative review?Because of the expansion, it made some insane cards with some insane effects like 20 mana when i had 9, destroy 4 creatures and heal 25, summon creatures from his graveyard, a support that gives a 0/1 creature for the enemy to kill and refill their health....and so much more i encounted when i played today at rank 5.Now....i could still win games with my decks but the games i lost were so terible that it makes me say that this is pay to win, pay to play without rage.If you don't play about 5 hours every day for a month or invest money in this......don't bother it's not going to be fun....or maybe you like the singleplayer aspect? you can play a lot of singleplayer"",0"

"9763,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""***EDITThe last time I touched this garbage was September of last year, and honestly it has changed, for better and for worse, but mostly for worse. There were some balances and some new stuff added (mostly paid things mind you) and I can safely say that this is the last time I'm touching this game. Ever.For starters, it feels much more tilted towards paying players rather than regular players. To a very annoying degree, I wouldn't even put it past Bethesda/Direwolf to have programmed (this is possible, don't even try to deny it) some feature of matching up non paying players with paying players in ranked or otherwise to entice them to pay up for better cards to win with. I abstained from ever buying anything on this game with real money, and I am estatic that I did, because it's not worth it and I don't condone the behaviour Bethesda and (possibly) Direwolf has been sporting in this game and (in Bethesda's case) in general. All in all, this game really isn't anything special, and isn't too great unless you're willing to fork over a few dollars to be able to stand a fighting chance against many of the better decks people will have made from bought decks or will have bought. Lastly, theres one thing that seems to need a change yet refuses to change. The accessability of building a guard based deck, guard cards are nice and all, but when you're going up against someone who's deck is primarily guards and buff action cards, then you start to feel like you're smacking your head against a brick wall, hoping to demolish it. I don't have the time or patience or even money to 'git gud' at a game that prioritzes players' money over their skill or competence.--------This game has the potential to be fun. It really does, sadly it's not quite at such a potential yet. The ranked leaves much to be desired, the other main features are just pay 2 play up theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and most of the time in ranked, you'll end up with someone 2 or 3 ranks above you who has spent 18 bucks on the best cards for their pack, that will decimate you. Its sad really, because I kinda enjoy this game. But trust me, ranked can be a struggle, and it's the only mode thats technically free and actually gives rewards like septims and cards (with a rare chance of a pack). The steam trading cards require you to spend REAL MONEY, something that should be outright banned on steam as it is, but I see they don't quite give enough â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s to care...Regardless, if any devs are reading this (HA, I highly doubt that) you have a great potential to make this better than hearthstone. Don't â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ up. Just listen to some of the fans, improve what needs improving. I do think that its nice that I can buy certain full decks with Septims as oppose to money, thats a very very good thing considering too many games force you to use real money on ANYTHING and EVERYTHING in games nowadays. But I digress, ranked can be fixed a bit, and maybe balance the cards a bit? Make many decks less overpowered, and make it more worthwhile to make a custom deck using cards exclusive to bought decks?(UPDATED) So when you get to a milestone in ranked, they made a midway point for you, once you hit said milestone, if you lose a battle, you go down a rank, leading into this really stupid midrank that you can very easily get stuck in if you erratically win and lose. I feel like this is lazy and honestly could be fixed too.(UPDATE 2) Okay, I learned that custom decks are really absurdly broken. So, if you were to make what I call a 'SWAT Team' deck, where you use mainly guard cards and item cards that boost attack and defense, you have a 85% chance to basically ruin anyone you come across. Theres actually several cards that really need to be debuffed, and actually have turned me off of this game. I'll list a few, Golden Saint (if you know this card, you can see how it can be a match ruiner), Ring of Imaginary Might (couple this with any guard with regenerate and a defense up or two and your opponent is screwed), and Royal Guard is also a really powerful card. Regardless, many of the most powerful cards require you to fork over 12 - 18 bucks of your (or your mother's if you're a young child who pesters their parents for money like a leech sucking blood) money, thus making the game have the illusion of being fair, until you get into the meat (or lack there of) and find a Pay 2 Win game with many features locked behind paywalls.SO, would I recommend this game? No. Not even a little bit, hell, even Hearthstone is better than this."",0"
9764,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,A little pay to win and the rng is just too frustrating. Sometimes I win when I don't play good just because I get some nice cards at the end and other times the enemy wins with 1 hp cuz they just get a better card and win with it. It doesn't matter how good you play if the enemy has better rng.,0
"9765,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I don't really know how to feel about this game. It's like Hearthstone but with Elder Scrolls cards. I think if it had more content, more in depth card building ability I could see it being good. I wish they would have gone the MTG route instead of what the did. If they would have taken their time, and wanted to make this game good. They damn sure could have. I think it would have truly been special but, they didn't. It's almost like they were trying to ride the wave of games like Hearthstone. I feel like each game takes little to no thought process. I got bored of this just like I got bored of Heartstone. Sad."",0"
"9766,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""After 10 hours, and a little while doing online research..I can without a doubt say, itÂ´s in a too unbalanced state as of right now.The systems donÂ´t work well together, and you never have the feeling that you won/loose cause of skill / no-skill,but instead of just pure randomness.Too bad, cause the artwork, the story-mode are immensly well done!TL"
"9767,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Finished the story in 3 hours. Arena is quite cool, but overall? It's not worth spending money on. The second story is about as long as the first and they want GBP19.99 to unlock? I think not. Pros: Free to playThe one story you get is pretty goodThe mechanics are probably better than hearthstone, which is it's closes rival.The deck types are quite cleverly laid out and have good internal Synergy: Willpower is generally about helping your creatures out, whilst intelligence is all about direct damage and synergising off of action cards for example. Arena is fun, microtransactions will get you back in, though I'm not sure you get the cards you pick which is a let-down. Cons: Cost. It's microtransaction based, fine, but don't then charge me most of the cost of a full title for one < 3 hour story expansion. You've got to be kidding. Complexity: For all that it's probably better than hearthstone, it's not a patch on Magic: The Gathering, the mechanics just aren't deep enough. Very pay 2 win: Didn't pay out for the booster packs? Sucks to be you then. All in all it's a nice idea, but it's nothing more than a transparent cash grab in the end with some clever mechanics, though outdone by Magic, Pokemon and even yu-gi-oh. If they lower the costs, then the story modes might keep you interested for a while, but as of right now, play it until you've done the free stuff, then drop it and  don't look back.  "",0"
"9768,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""I've had about 18 hours played in the game and while the first 5-10 hours of the game has its benefits that makes it fun, if you want to beat real players, exect to have to pay $50 to do well. Even then, if you go first, also expect to lose. Second has such an advantage with an additional 3 counter mana that they are ahead from the start. Even then, if you miss your mana curve while your opponent hit their curve (especially when they go second) you don't even stand a chance. You fall behind very quickly with no chance of recovery. This isn't a card game that you can get a bad starting hand and make up for it with good mechanics and strategy.   "",0"
"9769,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Too many overpowered cards with ridiculous effects that instantly turn an entire game around just by getting lucky. Luck plays too much of a factor for me to properly enjoy this game still. Strategy and deckbuilding helps, no doubt. It's not *all* luck, but it is too prevalent for me to keep enjoying the experience. When a person randomly gets a prophecy card that instantly gives lethal, drain, guard, and other assorted unit passives to ALL their cards on the field, just by a pure luck draw, and then goes from slightly losing to having instant lane dominance, or blows away your entire advantage by wiping an entire lane without you being able to do anything about it whatsoever, that's when I say: enough is enough.Other TCG's have game changing effects too, but then you are usually in a position to do something about it. Trap cards in Yu-gi-oh for instance can cancel magical effects that can turn a game around by having them on the field. ES:L has no such thing. There is no protection against large scale effects with dramatic consequences, and thus it turns into """"who has the most OP card in their draw/prophecy this time?""""You can't prevent someone from dropping a unit on the field that wipes something out. You can't stop someone from playing a spell that deals massive damage. You can't prevent someone from playing a luck prophecy by health loss via protective means. That last one also means that there is generally no reason NOT to play a prophecy for free because you're safe anyway.You can't place a card in anticipation of an event. You can't prepare yourself for what you expect the opponent to do. You can't play a card solely for the purpose of negating an enemy's potential comeback. You are playing your own game while praying to the nine that they don't draw or play something that wipes out your entire board or gives them some kind of advantage you couldn't prevent and it starts all over again.A comeback in this game will rarely ever come from planning and will mostly consist of luck because you as a player have such very limited means to respond to something.There need to be more measures that you can take to protect yourself from the large-scale effects of certain cards. Without it, strategy will take a backseat to frustration as many powerful cards as possible are spammed because there is little danger in doing so. This is a sad consequence of the fact that there are absolutely NO preventative cards in the whole game, besides """"guard"""" units that can only stop direct attacks, which is not enough when the majority of the cards in the game are good because of their EFFECTS and not their attack strength."",0"
"9770,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""It's really short and the finally boss is basically given cheats and extra draws that are infuriating. You can't play solo arena without buying 2$ tickets or for 7$ you can get 6. PVP for free but you have to get so many wins in order to get any reward for it and there is no timer to force your enemy from just sitting around until you quit. The free story is only 20 fights long. I don't mind paying for things, it is free to play after all, but I feel like these options are too cash grabby. Maybe if there was a feasable way to grind then I would suggest it. As it is they are just trying to be Hearthstone without all the fun little extra features."",0"

I am a fan of Magic The Gathering and I really dont like how you play Legends or Hearthstone. Even Yu-Gi-Oh is more fun to play as the the genearl gameplay is more fun for me.

However, after a few rounds, the house will win, and you will be stuck grinding in casual mode against other players. Again, if you lose, you get NOTHING.

"9777,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""Mostly like Hearthstone, but they brought in an """"interrupt/instant"""" mechanic, which slows stuff down immensely and requires everyone to always pay attention when it's not their turn. Avoiding that at all costs, no matter how difficult it was to keep the game """"deep"""", was perhaps _the_ genius masterstroke of Hearthstone, and it's completely baffling that Legends would try to turn back the clock on that.Normally this wouldn't be so much of a dealbreaker but Legends is _so_ similar to Hearthstone in design that it forces comparison, and must necessarily beat Hearthstone at its own game - which it doesn't."",0"
"9778,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I've always been a fan of card games but this one is very punishing to new players. The short end of it is, when you start the game everyone else has better cards than you and for the most part, even if you outplay them and make good decisions, their cards are just significantly stronger than yours so they outvalue what you have. Arena is okay because it takes most of this away but then again it seems like people get more legendaries and rares than you do in arena. I'm almost level 30 and I still lose around 75% of my games. The only """"fair"""" matches I seem to have are against new players like myself who don't have an extensive collection of cards. I don't think this game is bad, but you definitely have to play a lot to be able to compete with other players. I also mostly play casual where I get matched up against people who have been playing for a very long time so that may be different than if I played ranked. I love watching youtubers like CVH and justinlarson play this game and how creative they can be when crafting decks but then I realize that it's ultimately impossible for me to create an ideal deck when I have such a minimal collection. Maybe in time I'll get enough gold to be able to get a collection worthy of beating players who've been around for a long time but until then, I'm going to continually lose all of my games unless I'm playing against new players or long-time players using trolly decks.Edit: Invested even more time into the game and it's still pay-to-win. After 100+ hours I still lose to everyone because they have better cards. So frustrating."",0"

"9780,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Not too happy with this game, after playing the included campaign basically everything costs gold or cash. Farming gold is kinda slow (you need 3-4 daily missions for 1 event ticket), and to unlock another campaign or state-of-the-art decks, you'll need about 20-40 dailies.There are resources to improve cards that are quite grindy to get.In addition, even if you have all the stuff to improve cards, you might notice that your level is too low for that and you'll have to grind some more.The AI decks look pretty rigged to me, and the campaign often gives advantages to the opponents.It suffers from all TCG probs like getting wrong cards at the wrong time, while opponents seems to get just what they need. To compensate, the AI seems to play worse when you retry a campaign mission, so even the dumbest will make it at some point so he can purchase the next campaign.Card packs (6 cards) cost 2 bucks, and more often than not contain crap cards or cards for different schools you can't use with your main deck.Event tickets are 2 bucks each, and you can fight up to 9 AI opponents for rewards, but without some special cards, you'll start to loose after 3-5 enemies, making this a bit cheaper than buying packs, but still expensive.Not a bad game if you want to spend some bucks or invest serious time to unlock things, but for casual play, it's just to grindy and boring.

"9803,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I play Hearthstone, I was looking for a more balanced, less RNG based card game, this fits that role.Except that it's the most bland thing I've ever played.The reason it's balanced is because every card is so boring, they are afraid to take any chances with their design. Most of the cards I see are stuff like 3/2 """"mudcrab"""" or something like that, with no text, it's boring. I've come to appreciate Hearthstone after playing this game, it may not be as balanced, or skillful, but the flavour in that game is incredible. Most cards have beautiful colourful art with fun names, and cool effects, they are willing to take risks, which is how an online card game should be handled, since they can always nerf cards. In Hearthstone you'll get a card like """"Nightmare Amalgam"""", a card that is part of every tribe, meaning it's a dragon, a demon, a mech, a pirate, etc and in Legends you'll get """"Whiterun Gaurd"""" a 2/3 with gaurd. Even the legendary cards in Legends are super bland compared to Hearthstone. In Hearthstone a card with just stats and no text is pack filler, in Legends that's every card.Try this game if you have time, maybe I didn't play long enough to find the few fun cards they have, but I'm not willing to spend more time in this game."",0"

I play mostly on mobile (so my actual playtime should be around 1000+ hours) and I would like to say that this is the best Digital CCG in the market (for mobile at least since MTG:Arena may compete in PC).The lane system makes the game skill-intensive and the limited amount of RNG makes for a good streamlined game (if you play Hearthstone and hate the insane RNG, trust me that this is the game for you).There are cons ofcourse, the mobile client is slow to load and disconnects if your WIFI / Network drops even for a second but a new client is on the horizon and that should clear up these technical issues pretty much.The amazing soundtrack / art is also a refreshing change from the usual """"cartoony art / comedic soundtrack"""" that you find in every other Hearthstone clone out there. (ESL is in no way a clone of Hearthstone)Regarding the P2W aspect that other reviews are complaining about, you can get a near complete collection with a couple of months invested into the game without spending a dime.

"9821,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""From a game developer and artist standpoint:The backlash against the change is ridiculous. The biggest issue that Elder Scrolls (from an art direction standpoint) has always fell short is their lack of color. Ever since I can remember they have been focused solely on BROWN (which is the color of poop my friends). And while it gave the series a distinct look, it is rather boring let's be honest. What the art directors have done here is they've introduced more color and interest to the existing brown. The brown isn't gone people, embrace the brown cause its STILL THERE. But now there is a focus on bringing in lavender and blues and deep dark purples. I LOVE IT. The game has a vibrancy it lacked before and I would love for the ESO universe to start integrating more color into its art.

I racked up over 24 hours of play time in 4 days of trying the game.This game is hand's down the most frustrating and tear provoking game that invokes levels of nerd rage i did not know possible. Why is that?I'm glad you asked.This game has the depth, and pontential to be great. However as it stands the mechanics are god awfully skewed in a way i did not forsee. ESL has less RNG spam as Hearthstone, which should make it a better game right? Wrong. The impact RNG has on this game in a single play can decide an entire match based off 1 lucky RNG roll.The RNG mechanics of this game impact very high value moves. The rune system means if you get all 5 of your runes poped and no prophecy, and your opponet pops 2 of his, and both are prophecies you are done. You will likely not over come 2 free (often powerful) card plays. In the most critical of needs RNG will fail you. Absolutely, and unapologetically. Leaving you to go 10-15 game losing streaks. Intellect, stragey, tactics, and brillant deck building means nothing. In the end all that matters is luck. The only silver lining is that the P2Win fest that is Hearthstone is less applicable as even a dekc of 30 legendaries can, and will still get screwed by bad RNG rolls. ** One pro was the story mode, it was fun, and interesting. However over all this game falls flat on it's competitive play being decided for you. You don't decide anything, the draw decides everything. *** I once went 8 games in a row where i would get stuck with a 9 cost legendary in my first draw or intial hand in some way. I had 70 cards in that deck, and yet 1 out of 70 chances out of 8 games i got stuck with a useless card that caused me to lose vs opponents who always have the right cost cards for opening play.

(In one match, by turn 2 I literally drew 5 of my 6 item cards in the beginning of a match, with no one to equip them) Then after surviving the ensuing slaughter with less than ten health, stage a miraculous comeback, chain around 10 cards together and whipe out most of the opponenets board, only to have my opponent 'randomly' draw precisely what they need to win that turn. Being defeated with two full lanes after starting with a worthless hand is antithetical to a good game. I don't know if it's an attempt to keep W/L ratios even (which is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t mechanic anywhere) but from the beginning of many matches it's clear who Legends has picked to win.

But there are no sane limits to amount of legendary or epic cards in deck.By the time I write this review, I played 20 hours on steam and around the same on mobile.It's great, till you start playing ranked and get thrown against full-legendary decks at rank 9.Look at this legendary:https://www.legends-decks.com/card/406/gortwoggronagormThen look at this common:https://www.legends-decks.com/card/872/lamecorprusSee the difference :)?"",0"
"9843,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I am disapointed but the new changes don't take away from the fact that this is still a great card game. I do not like the new UI look at all so I agree with that. Everyone is upset at the new changes but they don't realize that they are turning away new players who may not care as much about the looks. I do think that the menus are more confusing, but i'm sure I'll get used to it. I hate the fact that now when I log on or look at the game in my steam menu that I see HOT ELF CHICK IN BIKINI ARMOR. I really hope that the character changes often because I don't want to play a game if it's going to be covered in """"HOT CHICKS"""" it's 2018 we are over this stuff. And it looks like those crappy web ads for the mobile games. Anyway, I Hope there was a good reason for changing how the board looks. To be fair, I do like the look of the cards (after some getting used to) and the player decks on the table are a nice touch. And the new borders around the player Icon with the runes looks cool. The mana ring now looks like crap. it looks cheap, like 2001 graphics. And the blank table does not look good. how can you go from playing on an ELDER SCROLL with cool images that changed to a blank table with not very good looking wood grain??  The game board feels too squished like there is no distance between the players boards. I also think the Moths need to be fixed. They look cheap and out of place, when those moths are super cool and legendary in ES. The table looks too crowded, the soul gem on the table looks cheap. I don't mean to go on but These things mean a lot when you are looking at them for a long time and trying to concentrate on your game. I still love the game and do recomend it. But the dev's need to reach out and let us know that they aren't going to let the game be ruined. People have spent money and time to unlock cards. it would break my heart to have to quit playing altogether. But it is not at that point yet! Keep playing! let the devs know that we care."",1"
"9844,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2018.0,""I never right reviews about games and here I am, online card game i've ever been into and I've tried hearthstone, Hex and a few others. Out the gate you get a fun story mode that will teach you the mechanics while increasing your collection for FREE. That's right folks. Not to mention you get a handful of daily challenges that if you complete, and they're generally a breeze, you unlock currency you can use to buy new boosters or even theme decks. There's a plethora of game modes and some really cool, innovative mechanics. If you're on the fence, give it a try. It's now a daily play for me even if it's just for a miniscule amount of time. You can also take it with you on your phone and manage your collections on the go."",1"
"9845,The Elder Scrolls: Legends,2017.0,""Nearly identical to Hearthstone. The lanes don't add nearly as much strategy as people claim. The cards are very boring in terms of gameplay design and art direction. One of the big reasons hearthstone succeeds is because of how vibrant and animated and creative the cards are while every card in ESL is dull gray/brown grisly humanoids. I like the rune system where you get to draw cards as you're losing. Honestly, with the limited gameplay designs of the cards, you feel like you're just playing a slower simpler version of hearthstone."",0"
