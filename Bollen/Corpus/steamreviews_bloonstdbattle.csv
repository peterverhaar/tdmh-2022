"24494,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""If you don't mind paying up to instantly unlock everything this game is fine, however when they match brand new players with 4 towers to select and half the upgrades locked out against people who can fully upgrade with all the towers at their disposal it's just not fun.Time and patience is finite so I will not be grinding through a metric♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of unbalanced match ups and I can't see blowwing money on this kind of garbage set up so uninstalled."",0"
"24495,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""Well developed, adds a good mix of stragety and skill while keeping it casual. Many aspecs of the game are very well done and are very fun including the choice of playing with freinds in private or playing with random people in quick play."",1"
"24496,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""My hatred for balloons started when I was only 9 years old. I went to a carnival with my family. I remember this day more vivid than any other. A man in a top hat approached me and asked me if I wanted a balloon. Me being the child I was accepted that balloon as fast as humanly possible, the balloon was a black and white balloon just in case you are wondering. Well when me and my family were leaving the carnival I wanted some cotton candy, and my parents being as loving as they were (And me being the spoiled♥♥♥♥♥♥I was) bought me the cotton candy, but as we were going to the car♥♥♥♥♥♥took a turn for the worst. My hands were getting sweaty since it was not only 90 plus degrees outside but also I've been holding the string of this balloon all day. Well I wasn't paying attention and the side walk was like """"Nah nah nah. This boy has a balloon on my turf? Nah he about to lose that balloon."""" And just like that the sidewalk rose as I took another step, not only get my face covered in the sticky mess we call cotton candy, but also causing me to drop my balloon. And I balled like the little ♥♥♥♥♥ 8 year old I was thinking my life was over cause of a balloon. Moral of the story: Don't accept a strange mans balloon."",1"
"24497,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""Y'know I've always enjoyed bloons since the first game. While this doesn't exactly play like the previous instalments in the series, it's absolutely a welcome change to me. Basically, rather than a hoard of bloons that are set by the computer, You play against others, attacking with your own bloons while trying to defend. For anyone that's played Clash Royale, it's sooorta like that (Except this came first). I'll also bring up how in singleplayer bloons games, you have access to every tower you've unlocked. But in battles, the battle lasts an hour at most, so you can only use 3 of your unlocked towers, and one more random tower. This can bring up some interesting combinations, letting you experiment on which one works best.       Many of you may know that there's a mobile version for this game. While you probably can't take this version around with you, depending on what kind of computer you have, This versions framerate is much better than the mobile version. And due to the use of a mouse and higher definition graphics, you can place towers in more precise locations.       In the end I don't really have many problems with this game. It's a solid, multiplayer tower defense. However, certain functions are blocked by a paywall, so look out for that."",1"
24498,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,has major bugs with data retreaval and i loved this game but until thats fixed i will never recommend this game to anyone until then.[Has been fixed temparly] This is not subject to new updates,0
24499,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,Amazing addition to the BTD games! It's even better than the mobile and flash version! I think that they may have made it to OP with the weekly competition...I have every tower and bloon decal and i have been playing for like 4 weeks. The competition is a very easy way to get medalions.,1
"24500,Bloons TD Battles,2018.0,""Monkeys that live in the jungle and in zoos are infamous for throwing uh stuff. Stuff of their own making. This is a fun game,human opponents add a new twist. Assault Mode provides layers of challenge and strategy. You can also use your funds to purchase gadgets that will keep balloons from slipping by your defenses, including tack machines and cannons. You may rightfully ask, “Why would I want to bother? Those aren’t monkeys!” That may be, but machines are capable of delivering blows that a simian cannot, and vice-versa. Whether you decide to put your trust in the monkeys, or whether you employ heartless machines instead, you have but one purpose: to make sure the balloons don’t get past you. Each one that floats by takes some energy off your health bar. Let’s assume they’re filled with mustard gas. Interestingly, sending balloons at your opponent can help you accumulate a lot of cash, which, in turn, can be used to really shore up your defenses. As a consequence, Assault Mode is excellent for players seeking a real challenge, especially since some balloons have different effects that can devastate an army that’s not been properly upgraded to counter them. Thats it and it why i love it so much"",1"
"24501,Bloons TD Battles,2018.0,"" A really good Tower Defense Game Bloons TD Battles is an amazing tower defense game, where you collect money and buy monkeys to pop the balloons.[+] A Bunch of different towers/monkeys[+] Features 4 different game modes[+] Lots of fun, almost never ending[+] You can play with friendsI suggest you to try this game out if you haven't before! Really fun."",1"
"24502,Bloons TD Battles,2018.0,""It can be fun for short periods. With the little money you will get daily (enough for a few of the cheapest payout games) you can play. You may win those games too. However to rank in a tournament you need to play higher cost/payout battles. This means you will spend hours and hours saving money if you want to try and get into one of those decent payout tournaments. That's not all, though. You will spend what little money you have on upgrading towers, meaning you are back to playing the cheapest payout game there is. So to play in any tournament you need to spend money. Once you are there, expect to lose everytime. You can copy exactly what the opponenet does (layout, boost, balloon sends, etc.) and still lose very easily. Very big pay to win game. So if you are ok with that, or with playing a few cheap games per day max, then this is ok."",0"

"24507,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""Bloons TD Battles just like any other BTD game is pretty fun, and the battles can be very entertaining. But the negative points is the time to unlock the nice powerful towers, which requires either a lot of playtime or just a bunch of money, which can be frustating for begginers to fight against """"pay to win"""" players, but with time everything gets balanced eventually. The good points are: amazing battles, fun mechanics, lots of maps, possibility to play against friends."",1"
"24508,Bloons TD Battles,,""this is my first review (and hopfully only) but i felt like i needed to make this. This game is good when you play normal battles (assault mode) because not too many people have op powers and are less likely to use them (Thereby meaning you have to be good in order to win). Although in battle arenas (like cc or rainbow) people always have tier 3 or 4 powers, so if you dont drop at least 10 dollars on this game, you will almost always lose to those with better powers."",0"

"24513,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""in a PVP game, it's important that each player has to at least play by the same rules.  This is not the case with this game.  Certain game mechanics are different for different operating systems.  This gives an advantage to mobile gamers by necessity.  I would NOT recommend this game.  It's a naked cash grab and on a PC you have little change against a mobile gamer who isn't absolutely terrible.  I, being a fan of tower defense games and the bloons series, am very disappointed.

I took a break from it for about 6 months and coming back it is impossible to win many games in Card Battles now. It is impossible to counter people who have those power cards and other high power card when you need to get 100 victories in some cases to unlock the cards. I can't see myself getting that far anytime soon. Since I was not active I couldn't unlock them for the cheaper price, and now I suffer and can't get anywhere now.The game used to be fun.

"24542,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""The only reason I write this review is that hopefully some change might be done.When I first saw this game coming to steam I was happily suprised, as I am a long timer in this game, playing the mobile version for a very long time and reaching the tops of global leaderboards.The problem I have with this game is not defenetly the quality of the game, or the system the use for microtransactions, which I actually feel is pretty fair. The base problem I have is that the game is stupidly easy once you figure one single tactic. The tactic in question is the Dart/Ninja monkey + anti lead (usually sniper monkey or ninja stun grenades) + banana farm tower combo, with the round 13 regen rainbow rush. For the people that aren't deeply aware of this strategy, let me enlighten you how a normal game could look like: *Placing down dart/ninja monkey*Placing down banana farm*Upgrading towers.*Round 12 sell all your farms and use both powerups.*Round 13 just spam the send for regen 3 rainbow ballons and win.This is litterally all you have to do to have success in this game. Once you do it you WILL find success. Currently my winrate is about 85 percent and all my losses is to other people with the same strategy but they are just slightly faster spamming the Rainbow ballons. This is REALLY bad for the game long term, and is the reason why I abandonned it on mobile despite being among top players in the world. Please now, take care of your game. Use your tools at disposal to nerf this strategy and the game might actually turn out pretty fun and tacticly interessting. This problem isnt new at all, but please do something now.*note: I know they did a slight price nerf to the dart monkey, but it isnt a big deal at all as you have more than enough money from the banana farm to kill your opponent round 13. Simply not a good nerf enough."",0"

(one of the most developed bloons you can send to your enemy to make sure they lose) totally passed into the face of my opponent and did not touch nor reduce his HP (when normally only ONE of those should eat out your enemy's entire HP), and ofc i gave it all to make this happen, n when it failed, when it shouldnt, i lost, he didnt even have anything in their hitting range, so its impossible that they were destroyed right before they arrived.this was NOT the only time this happened, and everyother time it happened, i thought maybe i missed something, but now im definitly sure that this game is bugged n hacked easily, and that is never good for competitive play.after knowing how breakable this game is, you still want to know how competitive it can be?well, i believe you know the andriod/facebook game called 8 Ball Pool, it is exactly like that, and for those who do not know it, you put 50, they put 50, and the winner gets 100 (all what was put in) but infact the winner only secured their 50, and took away the 50 of the other player.now imagine when you go on a high bet, and you find out that your enemy is a hack user at the end of the game right after they ran away with all your money, when they should have totally lost the game, and ALL YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT, is to report them? but you are not getting anything back.

"24548,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""Be an apprentice user, or don't be an apprentice user.  Easy choice huh?The game balance is pretty bad.  Don't be fooled by the one or two people shoving content onto youtube.  """"Getting better at the game.""""  Doesnt work here and it takes ages to unlock all the abilities of your towers when everyone is an apprentice user, thus either forcing you to become one of their kind, or spend literally hours trying to find a way around it, loss after loss with your 2 and 3 rank other towers[my choice].Download this game, play 20 games anywhere but defense mode.  18 of those games your opponent will use an apprentice FIRST.  And in all 20 they will use an apprentice.Or you can just be the dude who downloads the game and becomes another apprentice ♥♥♥♥♥.Edit:  Over five hundred games played.  75% win rate.  Cant remember a single game where someone didnt use an apprentice.  Pretty sad.  Even the higher tier replays are stacked with people using them.  Really, the only games where you don't see them are the club arena games where you are forced to randomize your towers.  But ya know, you can still downvote, laugh, leave bad comments filled with untrue criticism, or flat out leave after reading one sentence because you're one of the many MANY shortsighted fools that can't adapt and see that even a bomb tower is better than an apprentice."",0"
"24549,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""This game is, great in some areas but fails terribly for me. I'm not some noob saying I was stuck in the hacker pool, i'm saying that the experience wasn't great. I'll continue to play but here are some of my main issues.#1 Faliure to display the opponent's sideThis one from what i've heard has been a long one. When you're trying to rush, it's a pain to just hope it works.#2 Non-interesting competitionsI see one strategy that I myself use, Dart-Farm-Chipper/Sniper. It's annoying how when I use it, they use it. So just buff other towers.#3 ClubsThis one, is annoying. I'll try to get in rainbow ruins, and guess what? It's club only acsess!#4 WizardI usually win a match when the enemy uses wizard. Although I win, they need to get better at not regrow farming.That's all.

I have a number of HRs in this game and like to play it but the cheats are too much.  Pay to win on a free game is ok... but never losing is BS.  Game is fun but not recommended.

"24556,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""Disclaimer:  The game itself is not inherently bad.  I did put over 15 hours into it before uninstalling it.  You've got the mechanics of Bloons TD 5 coupled with a competitive multiplayer aspect.  However, there are many flaws within the game's mechanics that simply make it such that I would not tell my friends about it.First, the game is straight up Pay2win.  Bloons td5 is good, this is a cash grab.  The game would be better balanced if they just charged five bucks for it and put everyone on equal footing, but that's not the case.  You buy tower unlocks, which give you an advantage over your opponent.  You buy energy, which gives you an advantage over your opponent.  You buy club access (unobtainable by non-paying), which gives you access to more arenas with special rules.Second, there's some balance issues.  Did you spend $10 on the newbie starter pack?  If you did, you have enough medallions to buy the COBRA tower.  This tower makes it impossible to lose versus players that don't have this tower.  In defense mode, you gain extra lives every fifteen seconds, which is sizable.  In assault mode, your opponent loses 2 of their 150 lives every fifteen seconds, PER COBRA TOWER you have.  That is to say, you will win versus your opponents without having to watch a single bloon go by them.  Buy these towers and upgrade them, then wait 'em out.  In both assault and defense modes (both of the f2p modes), this tower also increases your cash income by giving you extra money every round.--If you have it, where's the fun in stomping people that don't have it?--If you don't have it, where's the fun in losing a game where the rules don't matter?Third, the meta is very stale.  At the higher ranks, everyone uses the same tower loadout.  Just google """"bloons td battles chipper farm"""".-Did you NOT spend $10 on this, because the game is supposedly free?  Many of your matches will be fair, but if you see a COBRA tower on the other side, just surrender, because you're losing this round.  Not to the rules of the game, but rather, to Teh UlTiMaTe ToWeR!!11!!one!!!-Your energy replenishes at a rate of 5 per hour, to a max of 20.  Is that too slow?  Buy more energy with real monies!  Is the energy cap too low?  Buy an increase!  Energy has a tangible effect on the game, most notably, by increasing the attack speed of all your towers for a short time (a la the MIB Call to Arms effect in Bloons TD 5).  Are you out of energy and refuse to spend cash on the game?  Your opponents may simply have an advantage over you, as they can use this ability and you cannot.-Instead of using towers to unlock higher tiers, you use medallions to unlock higher tiers as your level increases.  Don't feel like using medallions and/or waiting for your level to get high enough?  Guess what!  Five bucks gets around all that noise!-Card mode is akin to Hearthstone, in that """"whoever has the most sunk into it wins"""".  The details and mechanics are too esoteric to go into here, but it's even worse than the assault/defense mode balances.-To top it all off, the game is full of cheaters.  Just google """"bloons TD battles hacks"""" and click on any of the myriad results to get an example of this.TL, DR:   The game would be better if the following occurred.-Strict and immediate punishment for cheaters.-COBRA towers removed or rebalanced. (Pay money to get these!)-An equal amount of energy given to both players at the start of a match. (Pay money to have more!)-Tower level limits equal on both players in a match. (Pay money to max towers!)"",0"
"24557,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""Don't get me wrong, I love the BTD games, but this one? Not so much. I would only dare play this game with friends, and not getting upgrade points for playing with friends makes it pointless. I'm not going to pay for upgrades when I can go play this game for free on a browser. A great game, ruined by pay-to-win. If I could get points from playing with friends to be able to upgrade my tiers, that would make the game automatically better."",0"
"24558,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""The beginning is insanely frustrating. There is a tutorial but it just covers the basics - I think 3 towers? and 4 bloons? So you gotta figure out th rest by yourself. You can look up what the upgrades do and figure out what the tower itself does from there. No idea where to look up what bloons do. While playing, you are slowly getting there but it's nothing for people with low patience as myself I guess.You get thrown into multiplayer with people who seem to know much more than you do and thus they win while you don't know what their towers are doing or how to counter it. I think you have to lose some matches before you are able to win (or jsut be extremely lucky). If you like, you can buy stronger towers right away via microtransactions. Maybe you have better chances of winning then.The UI is a bit confusinng, but I guess that's because it's for moblie. I'm slowly getting the hang of it.Overall I can't say I enjoy the game but since it's so well received I want to try and play some more. Currently I just can't recommend it. Since this has enough positive ratings, I don't feel bad about giving it a negative now, but I might change this later if I come to enjoy this."",0"
"24559,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""Pros:- Cool gameplay that will throw you back right into the good old days of tower defending in Warcraft 3 or your favourite flash platform.- Interesting pvp mechanics- Fast buildup even for free accounts (about 6-10 hours until you got all your general-use towers at tier 4, where tier-3's can give you a 70%+ winrate if you play them well already)Cons (oh boy):- You can buy EVERYTHING for real money. Towers, Energy, Tokens, access to game modes. Just literally everything.- Almost everything takes energy (you can gather up 20 for free, granted at what I believe is 10 per day) this includes (and this is no joke):Spy on your opponents tower selection (2 energy per game)Get +1 random tower for your loadout (1 energy per game)Map re-random (2 energy each)Free red spikes from turn 0 (up to 5 per game, 1 energy each"

One good thing of this game is that it is free, and it has lots and lots of things. There are plenty of towers to unlock, and 8 upgrades for each tower which you can combine as you want! There are also special towers, very different from the common ones, and you can farm and all that stuff. In fact, thi game has everything you would like to see in a TD game.

"24587,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""Product received for freeNow, I love BTD Battles to death, don't get me wrong. I've played Flash and Mobile/Win 10/Steam (they play just the same) quite a bit. But there are a few things that really need to be fixed in this version that the devs know about (unless they live under a rock or something) but won't fix. Let's get to pros and cons, shall we?Pros:-Replayability, for obvious reasons-Good for all ages and skill levels with its family-friendliness and its battle arena system-Many fun gamemodes-A very nice tower selection-Solid graphics, most other TD games tend to be too realistic or absolutely terrible looking, this game finds the sweet spot between them-Decent matchmakingCons:-Game balance-""""Downloading Vital Data"""" bug-Need to pay to enjoy the game to its fullest (I'll overlook this myself due to my love for BTD, but for others this can be a huge annoyance)The pros speak for themselves, so I'll talk about my cons.Fist of all, the """"Downloading Vital Data"""" bug. This bug causes you to be completely unable to play the game due to the loading screen getting stuck at """"Downloading Vital Data"""" forever, and happens seemingly at random (and not to everybody), sometimes staying for days and other times requiring a simple close-and-reopen to fix. This has been around for a long, long time, and makes this game very difficult to play on PC for some people. I haven't heard of it happening on Mobile.Secondly, game balance. Many will disagree with me here, but I just feel like some towers are absolutely ****ing useless and others are winning the """"best tower"""" race by a few thousand miles. Here's some examples:Dart Monkey - cheap, extremely good early and mid-game, requires zero support until round 22Spike Factory - slow, not that good at any point in the game compared to other towers, requires a lot of supportBanana Farm - gives a massive head start on economy, can be sold to defend a rush, counterrush, or rush, usable on all but one map to its fullest extentBloonchipper - combos well with many other towers, can destroy entire Ceramic bloon layers with just 2 upgrades and entire ZOMG layers with 4, and can almost infinitely stall any amount of bloons with a large enough amount of x-4 Bloonchippers (just fix this already ****it, it's not hard)These are just 4 examples. There are many, many more.There are only really 4 mid-tier towers, which are the Ninja Monkey, Monkey Apprentice, Sniper Monkey and Ice Tower. They perform well, but need support from other towers, just not too much. They're examples of very well balanced towers. Other towers are either quite a bit better or quite a bit worse, and it makes it so that higher levels of play boil down to one or two different strategies, with the rest being unable to keep up with the best of the best.Paying for faster-regenerating battle energy (battle energy being a huge part of the game) and more battle energy is already showing a little bit of pay-to-win. You can still beat energy-buyers, don't get me wrong, it isn't like buying a $1 in-game money tower that has infinite ZOMG and bloon popping power. It's still a bit of an unfair advantage. There's also the fact that you can only enter 1 club room every 24 hours without the $6 pass, and the fact that you can fully upgrade a tower for $6, making it somewhat unfair to new players who get matched up with you because of your 5/2 win-loss record. I'm not saying this game is pay-to-win, but when you need to pay to get the full experience, it's not good.Overall, I have to give this game a negative. If they put a little more thought into game balance and micro-transactions, I would definitely change my mind. Heck, even just nerfing the Dart Monkey and Supa-Vac would make an absolutely massive difference. But as it stands, this game's downsides, despite there being few, make this game quite a chore at points."",0"
"24588,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""Product received for freegood take on the Bloons franchise... except for the tons of poor UI limitations.- no replay function (you can't see what you did wrong or what your opponent did right).- lack of keybinds for sending balloons (the available keybinds are not even shown in-game)- poor use of screen real estate (probably because there's some mobile version)- tower descriptions often give insufficient info (price, attack speed, range, damage... all mostly missing)- bloon descriptions are pretty much completely missing in game- tower placement is still dependent on skillful mouse-pixelling"
"24589,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""A great example or how to port a mobile or browser based game to steam. Don't charge for it, have support for keyboard and mouse, and don't have the microtransactions so bad that it's impossible to play without them. The only part I don't like so far are the club game modes. They add new rules and make the game more fun, but you have to pay for it. And you can only challenge friends to them. Overall a decent game."",1"

"24593,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""This is obviously just Bloons TD Battles ported from a browser game, so don't be expecting anything different. Nevertheless this is still amazing game, I used to play this a lot on browser, and I am glad they did turn it into a steam game, as I use steam a lot more than anything now.I love the fact that you have to actually play to earn your stuff in this game, because as the more matches you play, the more upgrades you can get for your monkeys which makes it more skill based, a lot of the time you have to make last minute decisions to make sure you can defend against both game and enemy bloons, which makes it very fun, I love that there are many different strategies and combinations of monkeys, that each person can have a different way to play.One of the only problems that I have with this game is that there is a surplus of cheaters, I was going for the achievement where you have to win 20 games in a row, I had gotten to 13 when I was met with someone who didn't take any damage, they let about 2-3 rounds worth of balloons though, and this really annoys me, I wish the developers would really try to work on this, as it makes me not want to play and in my opinion, is the biggest problem with BTD Battles.Either way, it is a great game, I love to play it when I have free time, so I do recommend this."",1"
24594,Bloons TD Battles,2018.0,its a fun game but they need to delete the P2W aspect in this game because if you pay 4€ you can ez max a tower out in youre LvL so just pick the tower you can max because 50% of the players cant win because you have a better tower you need to make so much towers because you cant upgrade it no more and the other one can max it because hes tower is maxed in hes account....,1

"24597,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""  This is all my opinon but here we go, ok my opinon on this game is its great just how the idea is. What I think is cool is how you can play against other players  while playing Bloons Tower Defense. I find this game very addictive becuase I really like the Bloons TD games, and when I was getting into bloons tower defense 5 *bam* I slam right into a game where I can play one of my favorite games and go against another player. One of the other things that I find very cool is how you can send balloons to the opponent to try, 1. To defeat you by lowering your lives. Or 2. Gaining econemy to help you get money. Speaking of gaining econemy that is one of the other things I truely fine unique in this game is the way you gain money to buy towers, the way is simple and not hard to do. All you have to do is send balloons to the enemy and you will gain a certain amount depending on the balloon. Ok so now I only have one more thing that is good for me and that thing is that it's free it is pretty suprising that a amazing game like this is free while BTD 5 cost money (On Steam). Although it is a great game I'm sure that it does have some bugs,hackers,and issues but I personly find this game very well-made game and I would certainly recommend."",1"

"24601,Bloons TD Battles,2018.0,""The game in general is really fun, and it captures the spirit of bloons wonderfully.Unfortunately it's overshadowed by the absolute terrible balancing the game has.The game has two main modes, attack mode or defense mode. Attack mode allows you to send bloons at your foe for money, and you will receive increased money per turn. Defense mode is just you going head to head with someone without sending the bloons.Attack Mode is probably most popular, and the best mode in my opinion. It's really great to select your towers for the game and plan out what you'll do, and send certain bloons at your enemy depending on the towers they have.You can only choose 3 types of bloons, and you can get a random one for """"energy"""", this isn't too bad, but it does often feel like you don't quite have enough bloons to cover all your bases.There are two big issues in my eyes with attack mode. It's simply too easy to place one or two towers that can deal with the easy bloons at the start, and save up the large amount of money to get the massive red blimp. Since this would still be relatively close to the start of the game, there's no way you can defend against this and it's normally a gameover.It's not always even a red bloon, people can just flood you with a ton of bloons or even just higher level bloons. You can defend against this more or less, but depending on your setup it can easily overwhelm you. This also leads to having to be very specific you have bloons to defend against these, since you're only allowed 3 - 4 towers.The next big issue I see with attack mode is directly from the game. Once you get to around round 32 they start sending an insane amount of powerful bloons at you. This wouldn't be a problem if you actually had the finances, map space, or upgrades to actually deal with them"
"24602,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""The game itself is good, but only when it doesn't glitch. I've opened the game a bunch of times and only 2 times it didn't glitch.

"24608,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""          If you've ever played any of the bloons td games then you'll love this game. I think this game defenitly shows how great the btd series is. The pvp aspect is insanly fun. The use of medalions gives you more of an insentive to win, and the different arenas makes you want to get better so you can finally climb up to the top. The whole new take on sending balloons is a great idea. This entire game is completely different from the original, while still having that nostalgic, goofy vibe the orginals still hold. The amount of maps in the game is unbelievable, and with 4+ diverse and interesting gamemodes to choose from, You'll never get bored. You can play in arena, assult, card wars, and defense. Each are so unique they could be entirely different games. All in all I think this is a great time waster and I recommend for anyone who played the originals as a kid and always wanted more. "",1"
"24609,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""It's a nice game, and I've always been a fan of the btd series. As for in game purchases I can't say it's exactly the same... When you buy energy, it gives it to you, but does not increase your actual max cap, which it does seem. So I kind of just got scammed out of $1.99, not that it's that much, but for what it was worth it was a complete waste, and I am quite upset about this. After all, I don't recommend wasting a lot of money on this game, because usually you wouldn't get a steam card every single day (at least I don't). Overall, it's a very fun game, just like all of the other btd games."",1"

"24615,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""This game is shallow and un balanced.  The first hour of play seems fine, you get some easy wins against players who have no idea how to play the game.  Then the balance changes, and you ONLY face people who have paid to unlock all towers.  The worst part about this aspect is that when you pay to unlock these towers you COMPLETELY BYPASS THE LEVEL SYSTEM.  So two players can both be '100 darts', and one player can have simply paid for every lvl 3 and 4 tower.  So basically, at a certain point, its impossible to win WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TOWERS.  So a first time player has to look forward to getting pulled into the experience, and then losing EVERY SINGLE MATCH BAR NONE, for 30 matches in a row.  This game is a shallow pay to win failure.  I have 100% completed BloonsTD 4 and 5, and I CANNOT STAND this game.  This game only exists for micro-transactions.  The game itself is a hollow shell to make you pretend you're actually accomplishing something against other players, when in reality, this is a cesspool of kids with their parents credit cards, effortlessly winning against free players.

"24618,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""If you're into Bloons then I recommend you try out this game. It's a small and free download. However, the grind to earn currency (called medals) takes way too long. You need to spend medals to unlock better upgrades for your towers. This seems to promote a some what pay-to-win ecosystem. I lost to someone who only bothered to use three toweres for the entire 25 round match. Even stopping two BFGs I sent their way. Two of these towers I did not have acceses to nor the upgrades that were used to beat me.Each tower costs about 20 medals to unlock. Then, towers have two more availible upgrades for 30-50 more medals per upgrade. You can see how it starts to add up quick. You get about 5 (maybe 10?) medals when you win and nothing when you lose, making it really hard to get any upgrades or new towers.But if that takes to long for you, which it does, you can spend $5 and get 5,000 holy crap medals!

This is a bias review, since BTD will always have a spot in my heart as a childhood game, but if you like tower defense games, this is one of the best out there. Play this game."",1"
24642,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,A fun game however it does suffer from lack of explanation of upgrades mid game so if your new to Balloon tower defence i recomend you ease into this one from the 5th installment so you understand what most upgrades do. As it turns out though it's not intuitive you can learn what the upgrades do in game via  the ? button this is not exactly evident. I do however find it annoying that unlocking some towers are more difficult than in the 5th installmentAlso don't expect a perfect win rate getting tier 3 and 4 upgrades unlocked take time and you will face opponents that have access to good tower that are suited to the specific maps.,1
"24643,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""One of the best games ever released on Steam in the past decade. 10/10. This game combines what everyone loves in gaming. Strategy and Fun.

"24647,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""Hi People,As A Big Fan of Bloon TD i can Tell you this is the same as any other Bloon TD.That being Said this is pure """"pay to win"""" £3.99 to have all the upgrades Tiers 3 - 4 of the towers.The overall idea behind it is awesome. i would of been happier with paying for it and unlocking everything like I always do. With the match making not taking into account whether or not the person has unlocked with money kind of made the whole thing unbalanced. I can see myself playing with friends with the agreement of not paying for the upgrades as this is unfair to whom you play against.Kind Regards,Hypo the Random"",0"
24648,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,This game is awful on the computer for several reasons. 1) The mouse click registers inconsistantly often messing up the buying and selling of towers.2) The system makes it very hard for new players the get to the higher arenas.3) The match making system can quit often screw you over making you fight a person with a 95% win ratio and 10 million medalians.this game is fun just play it on moble stay away from this cancerous version.,0

"24654,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""Not gonna lie i love this game but the recent update is compleatly crap. How are you gonna compleatly kill a tower (balloon chipper) and call it balancing? Ouh yea because you literally took advice from a youtuber and compleatly went with what he said. And the thing is he isnt even a good player. You guys compleatly ditched what everyone was telling you guys to do and went with a youtubers advice. And another thing although i dont personally like late game the balloon chipper was the only way to get crazy late game. And another thing i wanna say is blaze it comleatly gave you guys all the files to his modded server (all the towers were viable and were all balanced) and you guys didnt even care about it and went with with super jom bombo. I understand you made this change to make people use other towers, But you cant compleatly destroy a tower combo that was the only way to defend round 13 rushes and more. Another thing is this game is compleatly pay to win. Theres literally a way to pay to be #1 on leaderboard (it would take a lot of money but its possible). Another thing is you guys were trying to make other towers viable but i will tell you guys exactly how to do that, just buff other towers. Simple. You dont have to make any towers worse than they already are, just buff other towers. And onother thing is you guys literally made typeos in youre coding. Thats all im gonna say although i could say soo much more. Fix youre game ninja kiwi!"",0"
"24655,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""Bloons TD Battles is a decent tower defense game that seems pretty popular on mobile. It has made it way to Steam now and I have to say it is just as good here. There are a few game modes including attack game modes where you have to send waves of balloons and defend against your enemies, or the more classic defend game mode that plays like a traditional tower defense where you see who survives the longest, you or the enemy. I have not played much yet but I recommend you try it if you are looking for a free tower defense game. The only negative I have seen so far is that you can pay for instant access to towers instead of working towards them in game, but even then its optional."",1"

"24666,Bloons TD Battles,,""problem with bloons td 6. if you want the best towers and upgrades, rather than unlocking them through playing like in bloons td 5, you use """"medallions"""" aka paid currency. it functions as gems in mobile games, where you buy the upgrades instead of doing it legitimately.yes, you can earn it through playing, but it takes forever to earn, and half the time youll lose to some dude with every upgrade and tower which takes away however much you spent just to play. and, on top of that, you dont want to play for money? well guess what,♥♥♥♥♥♥ have fun using """"energy"""" that you can coincidentally pay to get back, which on top of that will deplete within 4-5 games. what's that? youre a bloons pro whose tired of the normal tower defense gameplay? well, have I got the thing for you!

"24668,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""Broken game in its current state, only because of how unbalanced it is. Way too easy to just save up and send regeneration rainbow bloons. Balance your game Ninja Kiwi. Not a fun game.I know it says I have no time put into this game but that's only because I played countless hours on other platforms. When playing a match, you can either use your money to buy upgrades/monkeys to defend or send bloons at your opponent to increase your income. Usually that would be find but around wave 12-13, if your opponent saved up money for a few rounds, can just win with like a 70% success rate. The ability to do this discourages players to get to further waves like 30-40. Why waste 30 minutes on a game you could end up losing when you can just save up at round 8-9 and send rainbow regens and win in like 10 minutes? You don't have to play many games to see how infested the online play is with this cheap, dirty """"technique"""". Without a doubt the majority of players play like this and it makes the game unfun to play."",0"
"24669,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""While the game is super fun to play, it's very unlikely that you will play it for more than 15 minutes per session without having to spend money.If you're new to the game or starting fresh in the Steam version you'll soon realize that you will easily lose in the dumbest ways simply because either your opponent is a much higher level than you or because they have all of the good building unlocked. Since this is the case you are constantly having to use Dart Monkeys for camo baloons, Boomerang Monkeys for lead baloons, and using all of your energy to re-roll in vein that you either get a Bloonchipper, Cobra (which is easily the most broken thing about the game), or Monkey Sub. Either you can take days if not weeks to unlock them, while still needing medals to unlock all of their abilities, or you can buy each building for $4.99 each which is absurd. Once you run out of the initial 20 energy (which it takes 3 to roll each time) than you have to wait for it to regenerate. One energy takes 5 real-time minutes to come back so you often find yourself playing two matches, running out of energy, and turning the game off because you don't want to have to pay money for more.You have to get medals in order to unlock new buildings but you don't get any if you lose the match, which I've noticed that most players have a 60% winning streak or lower, so if you're like me and your winning streak is 50%, that means that half of the matches you've played were useless and just a waste of time because you got nothing for them.There is no ranked matching in the game so you will often come across players who have the most advance stuff unlocked at max tier with you only having the basics - so you'll suffer a loss just for getting unlucky which isn't fair. You can also buy the medals with money too.Pros:           • Fun GameplayCons:          • No Balancing          • Noob-Unfriendly          • Full of Microtransactions, which are pretty pricey          • Only fun in short bursts          • Too long and hard to unlock tower tiers without paying for themVerdict: While the game is fun and addicting it is very limiting unless you either wait for your energy to refill or spend money in a game that should have been $4.99 - $9.99 to begin with. If the pay-to-win aspect of the game wasn't such a problem than I would highly recommend this game but in it's current form I don't think it's worth your time. 5.6/10Stick to Bloons TD5 until they come out with a full version of this game."",0"

"24687,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""well the game was sorta fun, if a little bit difficult to start out on, it got ACTUALLY fun when they added in the card game mode and honestly i WOULD reccomend it EXCEPT for the fact that its been getting more and more over-run with ♥♥♥♥♥tain hackers. it was one thing when they gave themselves an extra 500 lives or something, they usually sucked so badly i won anyway. but i just had to FORCE SHUTDOWN my computer in order to exit a game that some asshat had FROZEN UP in such a way that i was UNABLE to quit, but he continued generating money and placing towers. so i watched for mother ♥♥♥♥ing TWENTY MINUTES while he dicked around. now i'm uninstalling the game and refuse to play it again."",0"
"24688,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""Finally on Steam!Compete with fellow monkeys while still fending off intelligent plastic balls. Make your own plastic balls, coat them with ceramic, put them in a blimp, and send them to murder your fellow opponent monkey. Or you could just use a leech/Cobra to slowly drain your opponent of his/her/its health without sending a single bloon.Fun and addicting. Doesn't lag much, even for someone with a useless computer like mine. Great gameplay, too.Would be better if the chat options had a """"Thanks!"""" or """"Wow!""""Also needs more towers, in two days I've unlocked every single tower (not all tiers, but still).Network needs optimization.

24689,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,Straight pay/grind to win. What kind of competitive game allows your opponent to have objectively stronger towers than you? Why even have the match when there's a chance it just comes down to some guy having grinded more than you?,0

"24691,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""ive always enjoyed ninja kiwi games.... and guess what?THEY HAVE BEEN DOING IT RIGHT FOR YEARS!!!! this game, before it was sent to steam.....it was already popular before it came to steam. just download it... and fight me to death with a balloon race. i will defeat you"",1"
"24692,Bloons TD Battles,2018.0,""This game is a poverty simulator.To play, you have to spend 5 medallions to join a newbie match, and the winner gets 10 medallions.Obviously you can profit if you can win more than 50% of games, but the game just matches you with players more experienced than you if you do that.If you can't profit, you can't unlock new towers or upgrades for the towers you have.If you run out of medallions, you can't play the game until you spin a wheel that hopefully gives you some.Experienced players which have lots of skill and have more things unlocked will often play on the newbie server (they normally play on other servers) and easily win, draining medallions from the newbie community so that new players can't afford to unlock towers or even just play the game."",0"
"24693,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""Too much bs. Seems like a fun game then people some how send 500000000000000 bloons in the first 3 mins. Not using banana farm, not sending anything to increase their income, they build 1 tower, manage to kill all bloons, then do that....I would have 5 towers and it doesn't beat it...Too unbalanced and makes no sense."",0"
"24694,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""I love tower defense games so much and although this game brings in a wonderful concept of letting two real minds (?) going head to head against each other (as opposed to the classic TD games where you need to work out your strategy versus the ones placed by the game devs), this is just a NO NO. Although I have only played the defense mode part I pretty much know how everything in all the other modes go so it is so sad.Pro/s:- Cute monkeysCons:- Not a new user friendly game, the tutorial is outdated and only covers the send your enemies with balloon thingies- I crashed and froze countless times in the middle of a match for some weird reason. This happened like 4-5 times with multiple opponents who were nearly losing- You have no way of knowing which tower is that which your opponent is using- There is no single player mode where you would supposedly enhance your skills and get acquainted more with everything about the game"",0"
"24695,Bloons TD Battles,2016.0,""It looks like it'd be fun but the F2P timer systems get in the way of playing. The game uses farmville style energy levels to limit your experience. Play games, lose energy, sit and wait for it to recharge until you can play again. This is hardly an effective F2P system, it just results in you waiting more than playing. The Custom Club area even has its own seperate cooldown, which you can only play once every few hours.Why force yourself to wait between every game when there are many better Tower Defense games on Steam for mere pocket change? Don't waste your time."",0"
"24696,Bloons TD Battles,2018.0,""This game started out very promising. It was a fun grind with lots of different permutations of options in terms of towers/upgrades/bloons. However when you start playing battle modes and go against anyone above 100 (win 200) they just spam you with either blimps or ♥♥♥♥ing zebra bloons. Blimps you can sell your♥♥♥♥♥♥and buy stuff quick enough to stop, but when they spam regen zebra bloons it's game over 100% of the time. I've lost thousands (from 100s to actual 2000 and 4000 bets) against these stupid spamming kids. There is literally no way to counter it no matter what I do. I don't try to do it to others because that's dirty and I say late game and mean it. When somebody says late game and then zebra or blimp spams you early you should have an option to block them so you never have to play against them or with them again. There should be a report option for the idiots who say late game and then don't late game, honestly. It's the dirtiest thing ever, it's like saying you haven't looked at your cards in poker and having the nuts or saying youll quickscope battle someone in COD and then knifing them or pulling out a machine gun. I don't know how you sleep at night if you play like this, but hopefully with a knife through your ♥♥♥♥ing skull when someone you spam out like a noob tracks you down and kills you in your ♥♥♥♥ing bed. I'm ♥♥♥♥ing tired of losing all my money and having to wait 8 hours over and over for spins because I'm way ahead and some ♥♥♥♥ing kid spams me with ♥♥♥♥ing zebra ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Good game if you want to break your mouse/keyboard/closest thing to your computer/monitor. However, if you're a rational human being, don't download this game. Even though it's free, it'll cost you more than other games because of the rage it induces.Not to mention there are a bunch of trolls in the comments and in most games. Absolute trash. You only get to pick three towers which is meant to be tactical, but leaves lower levels stuck on certain towers (having not had the money to purchase higher level/tiers yet) and forces you to pick banana farm as one of your towers. Banana farm forced meta is just ♥♥♥♥ing gay."",0"

The battles end up being a fight of who is willing to spend more money so they can win. I had really high hopes for the game at first but it completely let me down."",0"

"24719,Bloons TD Battles,2018.0,""~ I PLAYED THIS ON PHONE. NOT PC. ~- So, at the beginning it was a little bit fun.I got into a clan, and played a lot!Eventually I got BTD 5, and now BTD 6, and I started to play Battles less.The game kinda got boring, same with BTD 5, but I still play BTD 6 since theres new stuff, and its being updated a bit more than BTD 5 and Battles.I genually liked this game, but then like I said, it got boring.I would still reccomend it but It's only fun for a couple of days."",0"
"24720,Bloons TD Battles,2017.0,""Pay to win garbage. Constantly shoving """"BUY THIS"""" in your face and you consistently lose to people who fork up cash for powerups. It's shameful that such a beloved childhood game has devolved into this trash."",0"
