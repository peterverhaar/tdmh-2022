review_text
uined my life.
his will be more of a my experience with this game type of review because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something I have experienced with CounterStrike. Here you go  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friends house and he was playing a game. I didnt know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didnt have a computer so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friends house. When I saw the CounterStrike logo I was filled with gamegasm  and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends clans was involved in communities and even made two myself. CounterStrike is my first game which I played competitive havely and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun but playing it compitively havely made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way ofcourse. Looking at the current esport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like CounterStrike are the ones that lI have to this day. Also there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple  defend as a CounterTerrorist attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of CounterStrike so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I have lost since 2008. So I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I have played with years ago. I think CounterStrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today if this game wouldnt exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CSGO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CSGO and modern games. Its harder though.
his game saved my virginity.
Do you like original games?  Do you like games that dont lag?  Do you like games you can run on low end PCs?  Do you like games where you dont meet children who have slept with your mother?  Then this is for you!
       Easy to learn hard to master.          
o r8 revolver 10/10 will play again.
till better than Call of Duty Ghosts...
cannot buy skins cases keys stickers  gaben cannot steal our money 10/10 would play again
CounterStrike Ok after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike in all of its versions its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all you just cannot stop playing it you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaponry option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game its just f*cking addicting. With this games I have met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally GOLD. To all the young players who are looking for a good cheap and fun game to play with their friends I highly recommend on this. I have got with steam record 2484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTAL and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP. And too all the people who will keep playing this game all I can say as always GLHF 3
very server is spanish or french. I can now fluently swear in both languages 9/10
Fire in the Hole Simulator 1999
 never played a better first person shooter. Graphics doesnt matter for gamer gameplay only.
WARNING  DO NOT buy this game if you do you will never see the sunlight again !
S is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is in my opinion the best  game to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport so for the girly girls it is an activity to indulge in.  It starts off with a team trying to kill another team.   I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off is not the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks as well as a boom box to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures I encountered a couple of problems those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing and that when we did play nobody was good enough so it was not a lot of fun.  Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited and signed up but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.  When I play counterstrike the whole world disappears. Only I the mouse and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strI have collectI havely towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus CS celebrates the unity of man the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drI haves us towards excellence. When I play CS I play until my veins pump battery acid and then I play some more.  CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life there is a role for us to play and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counterstrike the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels moving in unison happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate Im of course speaking only metaphorically.  Over the course of the years I have increased in skill but I have learned a greater lesson than how to  be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability. Instead there is a deeper meaning behind the colt the AK the AWP the deagle the sands under my feet in d2 or inferno. And more importantly the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gI haves cs its greatness.  In conclusion I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. Its that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside sitting at the television or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over this game may be dead but I will never stop playing counerstrike 1.6.
its... aight.
 met a lot of people who slept with my mother. 10/10
Ruined my life. 10/10
hen you crouch you lift your feet in the air and fall to the ground. Its alright.
Best shooter for 10 years. Steam evolved because of this game.
ne of the best FPS Games the 1.6 Version will stay always in our hearts. I recommend it for everyone who wants a tactical/action shooter.
any players learned here what do well known terms like lag noob or ragequit mean. Oh how i miss old 1.6 days.   9/10
laying it since 2010. Still bad at it.   10/10 Best game in CS series.
his game is the best game forever 3
lame this game for the rise of the online multiplayer modern military shooter. Good game great custom maps terrible community. Not much has really changed since 2000 has it?  I dont think anyone still plays this particular version of CS though.  Edit Wait there are over 8000 people ingame right now. Wow... guess I have to gI have this a yes then because it isnt dead.
006 43  800x600 Resolution Windows XP 2001 office computer fully white White keyboard grey characters  White mouse grey scroll wheel  Public library  Half of the people in the room are playing cs   After more than a decade later this game is still alI have. 
est game ever! Started my gaming addiction D
robably the best FPS shooter ever made. Nothing can beat CounterStrike 1.6.
laying this game since 2001. It ruined my life. FI have stars.
 Update to my review with some shameless advertising 05/10/2016   Hey readers. I am now hosting a server on CS 1.6 where you can play and enjoy the fun experiences I did back in the day.   Map rotations vary from Vehicle Aim Surf Knife Defusal and Hostage maps! IP Address 173.199.73.7827025     Review 21/10/2014   I have played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has gI haven me more entertainment and enjoyment than CounterStrike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason I have only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drI have a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon level them up train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self Warcraft mods zombie mods basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has drI haveable snowmobiles.   1337/10  Leet crew 5 lyf  Kicks csgos fuck by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.  P.S  CS 1.6 is the only Counter Strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy Riot Shields. Enjoy!  Oh yeah you dont have to pay to use sprays in this game either.
ell look at my hours played you can already tell if its a good game or not.         YES IT IS
till better than Call of Duty!
E WONT FORGET 1.6
avent played much but looks ok.
irst of all its my first online game ever. I was very young and i was playing with my friends LAN matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xD This game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a PC to playing this game at my home. With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head how to fire inside the walls how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPSFirst Person Shooter Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing. I had so fucking good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never. For others its only a game for me it was MY LIFE! This wasnt a review but a little story.  SO COUNTERSTRIKE FTW shit yes!!
After 14 years of existence this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world .   While earning tons of money based on CounterStrike sales Valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesnt even exist. Even more starting with February 2013 Valve has released a couple of minor updates for CounterStrike which intentionally created problems for the game suddenly stopping afterwards so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy CSGO which currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection  problem present on all Source engine based multiplayers since 2004.  Congratulations Valve .    Counting the players that migrated to or play the nonSteam version of CounterStrike the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world .
 Old but Gold.   
ld But Gold
 Pros   No crates which you can waste your money.  You dont pay for the extra maps.  Less Russians.  Less cheaters.  Very alI have game after 16 years.  More than 11 000 actI have servers according to Gametracker.   You dont need actually PC to play this you can run it on a Calculator.  More mods than games on Steam.  You can spray in the game.  You can buy MP5.  You can use Flashlight and Nightvision.  You can choose a character.  You can play Assassination mod.  You can use Bunnyhop.  You can play CSGO MOD.  And other stuff I cannot remember....
oins a CS 1.6 server Filled with people that dont speak english
 only write this because of how nostalgic I feel. The game that gave me my passion for shooters. Hands down in my opinion best game made in history.  This game I cannot explain how many emotions it gave me and thousands or millions of other players.  Cs 1.6 please stay alI have.   Pros Everything Cons Nothing
ock and Load. Go go go! Fire in the hole! The bomb has been planted. Counterterrorists/terrorists Win.  It is uncountable just how many times have these few sentences echoed in cybercaf√©s across the world. For many days were spent in front of the computer screen manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyberpersona and pit them against another team. It doesn‚Äôt matter who won who lost who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that for those who are a part of the team this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counterstrike.   Originally a modification mod in short made for Valve‚Äôs critically acclaimed HalfLife CounterStrike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multiplayer computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitiveons such as ESEA League. Of course this does not put CounterStrike as a ‚Äúprofessional only‚Äù game as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.  Getting started with Counterstrike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams CounterTerrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins you will have to purchase your own gun from the market namely the famous AK47 M4A1 Desert Eagle MP5 AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counterterrorists namely the police have to buy their own gun and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows but at least this will balance up the game. Also you can equipment such as HighlyExplosI have grenades Flashbangs not recommend for beginners smoke grenades helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counterterrorist but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be gI haven a knife for free. Don‚Äôt worry about it as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.  The gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps such as the alltime famous de_dust the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multiplayer First Person Shooters you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Don‚Äôt worry about it though because if you are new just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember you are not John Rambo you only have 100 HP and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle AWP will deal more damage than that.  As time press on the mechanism of CounterStrike became outdate. Of course the legacy of CounterStrike continues through its successors such as CounterStrike Condition Zero CounterStrike Source CounterStrike Online Asia only and the newest of all CounterStrike Global Offensive have. Throughout the years CounterStrike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains. Together with HalfLife and maybe Team Fortress Classic CounterStrike has not only helped Valve to thrI have as a gaming company but also defined what First Person Shooter should be.
0/10 Would get Fire in the hole tattooed on my fuck.  Again.
ts a nice game...
he original CounterStrike is the raw uncut cocaine of shooters  Honest Game Trailers
ice oldschool game! CounterStrike is very cool game but now we can play the CS series of games like CSSource and CSGO... I cannot say which game is better its your choice. But i cannot forget this game like my childhood thanks to VaLVE for it!
 tried it a few times.
ith only ~4000 hours of playtime plus a few thousand prior to Steam i might not be worthy of reviewing this game.  So ill just leave it at recommended.
ounterStrike is a great series. Though the real change they made was in CSGO CounterStrike has been one of my favorite FPS games of all time. If you prefer a fast based shooter this game isnt for you.  CounterStrike can have exciting moments where its you VS 5 others or where you have no defuse kit with only a few seconds left to defuse the bomb  A comparable version of CounterStrikes defuse gametype is the Call Of Duty Search and Destroy
his game is like an infection you cannot uninstall it.
ompared to CSGO this is pure gold. Joined a French server where I asked if they could speak english and they did. Someone said no rush and everyone listened. The community is way more friendlier and the game isnt about how volvo can make more money.
njoyed the game for only a few minutes...
he First Crush  You Just Cannot Forget Her
o lag No russian guy saying shit  Classic No expensive skin No need to rank up Cheap lot of great server  RipNo porn spray 
fter 17 years 13 if you want to count from 1.6 steam theres still 2976 servers running.   Nuff said.
team Awards Nomination 2016 review for the badge   When I saw the The Just 5 More Minutes award category  instant flashback  cold sweat..   Year 2005 clock around 7 pm. Tomorrow is school day and Im at a local Internet Cafe playing with some friends   Counter Strike 1.6   time flies u know how its CS. Cell phone rings constantly. Yes Im coming home just need to finish the match 5 minutes top. Im losing .. big time. I skipped some calls later big mistake for the sake of the match. Long story short I was late and there were consequences. Left in hurry after and didnt pay the net fee not that day at least. Time 1+ am gameover.
his game will never get old 3
ts a real legend .. legend of PC games
heres nothing to say about this...    Legend  
irst starting off as a cute little mod based on the GoldSrc engine a heavily modified Quake engine CounterStrikes legacy continues to strife for a decade and a half over. Initially developed and released on top of a HalfLife modification with the inspiration from the developers strong theme and intriguement for military warfare and terrorism the mods success was immediately a marvel to behold selling over 25 million units as a whole in the CounterStrike franchise.  The maps and various scenarios set around the globe players assume the roles of soldiers on two teams counterterrorists and terrorists. Both with a task depending differently on the mission. Bomb scenarios the terrorist team must plant a bomb in a secured bomb location while the counterterrorists must fight back and ultimately defuse the bomb if it may have been planted. Hostage scenarios is where the counterterrorists must rescue a group of hostages being held by the terrorists. With both these modes it has become a traditional campaign over time in different sequels.  The player depending on what team they have been assigned to can change their class into eight different character models as well as buying weaponry and equipment such as armour and grenades to help against the opposing team. As the round is about to begin youre left in Freeze time that allows you to buy things with the money you earned by killing opponents the rounds before. This of course gI haves players the time needed to choose wisely on what many strategies they will execute and whether it will be successful compared to your opponents.   This game is also highly customizable on the players end.The game gI haves the options allowing for the user to either install or create their own custom skins spray graphics sprites sound effects and HUDS that can be used ingame. I forgot to mention that modding is possibly one the biggest things that makes CounterStrike such a versatile game to begin with.  I dont have much to complain about this game other than its become one of the biggest targets of hacking and cheaters since its release. Aimbots that autotarget other players while the player should naturally aim and shoot is just on of the many cheatings that players have executed. Wallhacks that allows the player to see through walls through work by displaying objects that have translucent textures and can easily see targets through them while the opposing team has no idea from their own perspectI have. To me the cheating in this game is now more to do with experimenting than it is to do with cheating overall.   Theres a different meaning when it comes to something that is outdated and oldschool. Oldschool is for nostalgic value something that will guarantee to put a smile back on your face from all these past memories youve experienced and this is what the first title of CounterStrike engulfs. Outdated being something you dont particularly want to go back to while there is the famous remake CounterStrike Source that runs on the more powerful and overlyrecycled Source engine allowing for better graphic and communication capabilities. Nevertheless if youre looking for original flare that is burning in the CounterStrike series this game is definitely for you.  And to think all of this success for the CounterStrike series began as small little mod. Proof on how something so little can create something so big. Recommended.
his game is unlike the other counter strike games. This game requires a different type of skill. You have to become used to the recoil each weapon has. You also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map. I personally think this is the best counterstrike game.
m sorry to say for other games but with counterstrike 1.6 i had best gaming experience in my life.
 have had lots of fun with this game. Graphics are outdated but community is still here to support it.
est sequel to pokemon since skyrim
h this is where it all started from.. The mecca of online competitive have scene.. I still remember bunking my extra classes and play this game in a bunker of a gaming center during my school days. I didnt think that it would take root inside of me that would fruit up some years later.  Come the post graduation years and I found myself playing this again this time.. on a competitive have level and making sure I had fun the entire time I spent whistling away at this ..  Fond old memories.. Still growing strong.. Still making more and more as we keep walking through the life..
he game that started it all. I love Global Offensive have but i always return to 1.6 because of the hardcore oldschool feeling.  I dont even know why im recommending this because obviously you all have it... Right?
f you dont like 1.6 then you can suck some balls
layed 60 fps with a 20 dollars laptop. top kek mate
raphics is not everything!  Old school love.
ld but gold. I really can recommend it to new CS GO players at there rise!
ounterStrike is a firstperson shooter game from Valve the first of the CounterStrike series.  Play the worlds number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular teambased game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your teams success. Your teams success affects your role.  CounterStrike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you cannot just spray and pray short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.
his game is legendary. This started back in 1999 and havent got lost the pleasure of playing it. The graphics are not the best its an old game but its FUN! That was the point of the game! Its one of the best first person shooter in the world its not me saying that all over the world people consider Counter Strike 1.6 one of the best shooter games. And it had lans and big event until CSGO showed up in 2012. Its still played by LOTS of people. 17 years old and still rocks!!
Goes ingame Sets server requirements *Joins a server *Empty *Joins another server *Cursed at in rapid Spanish *Asks for tips says I play CSGO *Gets cursed at some more *Gets a kill *YOU HAVE BEEN KICKED FROM THIS SERVER*
 This is a great game with a great community. I even own the original disk  http//steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=772601842  
ne of my all time favourite games! You never get bored playing this. You may not find its graphics to be very cool as per todays standard but old is gold!
o old! still a better story then twilight.
his game is awesome.  + still a lot of full servers from all countries  + you can find many friends in this game   Unbelievable ugly graphics shit that. this game is 15 years old. 
lmost screw up my exams at high school 1999/2000 when I was doing my vocational training 20012003 and at unI haversity 20042009 due to playing way too much cs...  Great game would risk my future again! 10/10
k9 2k16   So much time a lot of memories 
laying Since 2006 nonsteam/steam more that 3k hours others  after all this time ? me  always.
his game appears to remain No. 1 FPS Action games since 2000 for around 8 to 11 years. It is a intense game as your health and your exposure is important as well sticking together with your team mates at all costs. You should maybe try this game and learn the routes in common CS maps like dust or assault. Go on try it!  However they are a several downsides to this game like the weapon nerfs like the recoils and smoke grenade failing to detonate airborne and the lame Tactical Shield. And cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online that some PC criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials. So you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and Steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and VAC banned so please be careful!  But if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action game...BUY IT SOLDIER!
ldshool classic. Totally worth of buying it!
ore than 15 years and yet best FPS ever made.
 want to you add achievements for CS 1.6 because game is legendary!
ordless.... very very good.
est fps of all time

 still suck at CSGO
est game thank you valve
he best game ever D !
n this game you can play many many modes and its the most positive thing. Its not only about shooting or about playing tactic games. You can just chillout on some kinds of servers and thats what I always loved in CS 1.6.
he 1st and best game i ever played in my entire life! 3  I shiting LOVE cs! 3 D
n the days of my youth I was told what it means to be the game And now I have reached that age I try to do all those things without a shame No matter how I try I find my way to the same old jam  Good times bad times You know there was a game When a woman left home for a browneyed man But I still play and not seem to care  Sixteen I fell in love with a game as sweet as could be It only took a couple of years till I was rid of it I swore that I wont play again and I did not come back But when that CSGO came out I knew it will be sad  Good times bad imes You know graphs not at 1st place When a smurf plays against silver ranked men Bring me back to those happy days  Hitbox was good and people were kind now its not the same Those amazing rounds deep on my mind and all the pros into hall of fame If you talk about cybersport so that game was of that type Now just money flows like a rI haver and everyones getting hyped  Good times bad times You know what do I mean When people were saying  go 1 on 1? And you knew it will be fun   9.3    Nearly the best online game in the world.  Dont start playing GO if you havent played that... who am I talking to you never played you never will.

est FPS game of all time. Its a shame only a few people still play it. Great for older Counter Strike players and newer ones to experience what older players had with this game  This is where CounterStrike is love CounterStrike is life really have a meaning.  After several thousand hours in the game I still love and cherish it. A must have for any FPS player out there.
oms credit card is not maxed out  10/10
illar of Online FPS gaming.  This game will never die no matter how many new versions are launched 
imply THE best shooter that you can play to forget the anger that built up inside of you after playing too much CSGO. It truely is a relief to play another shooter than CSGO without messing with your aim movement etc.  Just set everything up the way it is in CSGO sensitivity keybinds etc. and escape from the austerity pressure to perform well in CSGO. And RELAX theres nothing you can do wrong here. Even when theres a cheater just dont gI have a f. I mean there isnt even a statsrecord. Like theres only a serversided statstracking if at all. So without specifically searching for your stats on a specific server that has some kind of playerstats on it nobody will ever know how bad you are/were 
he Test of Timeù Award  This award is for the game that is just as good today as the day you first played it. Newer games may come out but it does not matter youl always come back to play this one.  
.6 = my midle school years...my best years ever...1.6 full of life full of memories 1.6 = 3
ropping in an old review here. Always a fun game but too bad the newer versions has taken over.
 have 800 hours of gameplay on this since I got steam!. I played it for 6 years before then. Its wonderful. The best game I have ever played.
hile people are outside playing Pokemon GO Im playing a real game.
ounter Strike is the best shooting game I have ever played. The real cs where you plant bombs etc. is not 10/10 gaming but look at all those great mods! The greatest thing in cs is playing mod servers and you do not need to download them from your web you just simply double click that server and thats it! At first I recommend to play normal cs if it gets boring try other servers. Oh and original maps arent that great except de_dust2. You must try cs even if you think it has low graphics. Gameplay is much more important than graphics remember that!
 still remember this from my childhood It was the first FPS game that I ever played in a computer.  8.5/10
 still alI have firstperson shooter since 2000. The game that changed everything along with HalfLife. Still the best firstperson for thousands. And you know why? Because this games focus isnt on graphics. Its for having fun with your friends or even aim for world tournaments.  All profesional teams such as fnatic navi sk still play CounterStrike doesnt matter if it is 1.6 Source or Global Offensive have.   Highly recommend this game.
 dont like because Steam blocked redirections from server to server. I know that people using it to slowhack but now... servers with redirection are unusefull..  Also VAC not working good for CounterStrike 1.6. Maybe it could be good for some update or something...   I can gI have you anything you need for it.  Contact me.  Kinds and Regards drag1c.
ts a good game butu must to make strong vac ban bcz cheaters those days a lot in 1 .6 they make game suck \ u must control this game bcz its international game and a lot of people love it  and thx for read my review
uch a highly recomended game for those who want to get it playing this game in 2016 reminds me of the old style games i used to play on the playstation 2.  I recently came back to play this game due to the fact CounterStrike Global Offensive have is simply a great game and wanting to seen the origin.  10/10
est Game AllTime c #Oldschool 2000 ^^
 have never met so many Brazilians in my life! 10/10
rguably the best competitive have fps so far the skill ceiling is very high however getting started is easy.
ld good game never dies.  I remember first time playing this game when I was in elementary school. Hiding teacher to play this game with friends is very fun you should let your kid have experiences like this.
ne of the most favourite game of my childhood I have spent so much time playing it and I loved it.  From a little cute HalfLife mod to this... When CounterStrike was first released it gained its popularity immediately and become number 1 online action game one of the most successful competitive have games ever created which was easy to learn but hard to master now CounterStrike is dead or at least for someone because its pro scene died in 2012 yes the pro scene is dead but the game itself is still alI have after so many years people still play and love this game even its pro scene lasted for unreal time imagine it started in 2000 year and lasted for 12 years how cannot this be legendary its when graphics doesnt matter only gameplay.  I strongly recommend to play this game at least once if you have ever played it and enjoyed it might not be as fun as before but I still recommend if you like original games or havent played CS at all and started from CSS CSGO doesnt matter... You should really gI have it a try.
est competitive game of all time.
 have been playing this game since dial up and absolutely love it addicted. never know what some one is gonna do. fy is deatchmatch de is bomb map cs maps are hostage many mods and plugins that keep the game exciting and new along w new custom maps being made frequently
ice game
 miss the good ole GldSrc engine
his game is just amaizing. If you have a game with cheaters then change the server with admins that actualy do stuff right like cs.kopideja.lv  Yes The graphics are outdated and the physix may make no sense but this is what started it all... If you havent played this and you play other CS games then you know nothing about this game... Buy it play it and enjoy  For me this game is more fun than CSGO or CSS because its calssic and was a my favorite childhood game 10/10
layed it over 2000hours..woah.. all i can say is..this...is old but gold.. Couldnt let go of 1.6 even after csgo came out.Cs is just so much fun!
 must have classic.
ounter Strike 1.6  The only game that lets you have a 5 kill streak and a defuse with 300+ ping  11/10 Would lag again.  Also a surprisingly successful dating program. Watch the chat when a girl gamer joins the server and see how many players hit on her. Counter Strike is truly the definition of international love.
 miss this game fuck
core says it all. Theres another version out called CounterStrike Source but its nothing compared to how the original CounterStrike is. Plus now adays its really really cheap like 10 dollars off of steam. As well it has like the biggest competitive have gaming community in the world with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of tournaments and players etc... good stuff.
hink you got skills because you came from CSGO?  Think you got skills cause you came from COD?  Think you got skills cause you just bought fallout 4 and still got money left on your steam account?   Well let me tell you a story.         Youre going to suck fuck.       Alot of fuck.
OSTALGIA  classic footstep sounds classic knife default weapons no Russians no troll not p2w [ same all cs games  but nexon zombies is p2w everything is O.K. + 11/10 Best game ever. 
erfect for anybody who like shooter game. Just be careful when searching server though.
aming History!
est bhops 2003
uake was the first game I was ever really addicted to and focused a big portion of my time on for months or years at a time. CounterStrike was the second  and easily more addicting. Theres a reason that I still compare every multiplayer shooter experience back to original CounterStrike to this day. Theres a reason I still compare every server community to this CounterStrike servers each had their own community and personality and people truly got to know each other back in the day compared to these days where a server is just something youre automatically dumped into and feels like every other server.  Despite many iterations nothing quite plays like the original. Its not hard to see why there are still 10000 to 60000 people playing this  at any one time on any day  fifteen years after launch and why it is always in the top ten games currently being played on all of Steam.  This is where it all started. Without this theres an entire genre of shooter and multiplayer that just vanishes. The original days of CounterStrike remain the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my entire life. Its unlikely that will ever be trumped.
ounterStrike is a firstperson shooter game from Valve the first of the CounterStrike series.  CounterStrike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you cannot just spray and pray short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.  CounterStrike is a good game. I recommend this game.  Rating 8/10
ont buy this game its too much fun
onsumed my teen years. LANs lans and more lans. Memories.
ow to end your life  Step 1  Download this game  done .
ounterStrike was the game that changed everything for me in FPS games coming from older games like the FPS Game Blood back in 1997 when I was only 10 years old and HalfLife CounterStrike changed everything for me it was litterally the best thing ever.  The quality of the game was never about the visuals for me but about the game play and performance and CounterStrike litterally had it all in my opinion.  Even today after so many years I occasionally come back and play CounterStrike just because it is one of the greatest CounterStrike versions flat out anyone disputing this are most likely people that started playing either CounterStrike Source or CounterStrike Global Offensive have first then tried CounterStrike but if you played it in the right order there is no disputing this because this game might frighten most the new generation that has expectations to visual graphics having to have a certain standard before they will even touch it.  CounterStrike is not about the visuals that is just a bonus if you want visuals then you probably playing the wrong game CounterStrike was never Battlefield nor CoD which probably to many looks visually stunning.  If you want quality in a game then CounterStrike is one of the best games to play and get hence why I am recommending this game.
est CS of all time!!!
wesome oldschool game 
ice game my first time PC games.  9/10
lay this game to understand why we say this game is the best FPS of one in the world.  CounterStrike is release over 10 years. but a lot of player still play this game. including me.  Why? Because is so easy fun and memory. I am play CounterStrike started in 2002 to now. is over 10 years.  Is like Half  Life . This game is revolution in FPS.
0/10 Still the best game ever.
 Get outta there Its gonna blow!
est Game Ever xD But I cannot Play It On My MAC /
he best competitive have first person shooter ever created.
ame is really good. I like it because of the genre of the game.  I will do some pros and cons for the game  PROS This game is really old 15 years now and people still buy it and play it The game has over 3500 dedicated servers The community is really big for the game this old There are really good welcoming server admins The game has good graphics even for the 15 year old game Its fun to play  CONS Some server admins are kicking people because of their high Latency You have to have really good connection to the internet to play the game as it is meant to be played  I recommed it. I rate it 8/10 would Flashbang my teammate again!!
leying it after school itz very funny
gtjoin german server &gtshout S13G HEIL &gt20 german people shout at once &gtYou have been permanently banned from ther server     10/10 would s13g h31L again  fact Im literally banned from every German server in the server list because i shouted h3il hitler or gas the jews too much
till the best of counterstrike!  keep it alI have
he game may be old now but it is still a great game and full of fun custom maps. Its a good way to spend time with frineds and/or family with low hardware requirments and cheaper pricing. The game may be modded to improve your expierence as well which is allows for more customized game play that never gets old.
t was one the best fps games back in a days.. would go back in time when this game was still popular   10/10
arder than CSGO

I ended up playing it for a whole year... over and over again.  And then came along CounterStrike 1.1 in 2000... and then the other mods from HalfLife.  Thank you for my beautifull childhood

Counter strike is one of the firstplayed video games when I had a PC 9 years ago.  I had an illegal version installed from a third party website yes I never heard Steam before. And sitting there playing against bots almost over the night.  Display  A CRT monitor about 15.6 inches. Processor  Pentium Celeron singel core processor with 2.3 GHz. Graphics  nVidia Geforce 4 MX440  Memory  256 MB with uknown specs anymore. Up to 80 GB hard disk storage thats all I got.  Later on more games came to me running on this PC for more than 2 years before I got a new one. Wolfstein Battlefield Medal of Honor Half Life Voice City and something like these. 
his game was so fun before css and csgo
ow i know what you guys are probably going to say OMG this game sucks the graphics are bad D and like Pfff this game is old nobody still plays it. well its not its a game thats made like 13 years ago so dont expect frosbite engine graphics etc... instead you get the way more epic pixelish graphics and really classic sounds and this game is still actI have with about 30k to 40k players each day.Thats more then all cod games together And in my opinion its a must have game since its one of the best games ever and you still can install skins etc and its price is good its only 10 euro or dollars for this great game.
lassic which started the legendary CS franchise.
 heartpounding visceral experience that gets under your skin. The just one more round addiction factor is very high. When you play it properly with team work that clicks like a welloiled machine the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing.Buy it download it whatever just get on board and enjoy. Surefire fun for the online enthusiast.
his game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all but i recommend buying Counter Strike Conditon Zero and completing the game on hardest difficulty two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of old generation games so I wanted to buy This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all but firstly buy Counter Strike Conditon Zero and complete game on hardest difficul two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of the older games so I wanted to buy it first because i wanted see what it was like before. I played that game my older brothers played aswell . So when you play this game you have the feeling that you went back in time and played it. Gameplay has been perfect for years. The grapichs are still awsome to me I play a lot of Black Ops 3 on ps4 this is way better than that for me. So if you have pasion and love to games first play Counter Strike  trust me you will had a lot of fun.  I rate the game10/10.
 i love this game 
ld but gold!
he best FPS game of all time hands down ! I have been playing this game from the early betas right from the begining ! I still remember to this day the characters legs werent moving it was on cs_siege This was back in late 1999 or early 2000 now its allmost 2017 and I am still playing ! That is 17 years. This game has stood the test of time. Modern games are spurring like mushrooms with advanced graphics and whatnot but none of them can gI have you the experience that this game can gI have you. I can sincerely say that there are a total of 2 maybe 3 games in all gaming history that can match this games gaming experience. All in all I recommend this game to any new players who may come across it who are looking for an amazing online multiplayer experience and also a big shoutout for the oldschool player as myself dont stop playing this gem ! I sincerelly fear that it will take a very long time until a masterpiece of a game like this will appear maybe even never. But who knows ? Untill then start cs 1.6 gl and hf ! 
ounterStrike 1.6 ruined many hours of my life!
he best CS version! Old school D
REATEST GAME OF ALL TIME!
y old game   Good Game ever
uy Condition Zero instead if you want to play with bots. And Global Offensive have if you want to play multiplayer. But wait Im not done yet. Your PC/laptop cannot handle CSGO or CS source but still wants to play Multiplayer? Then this legendary FPS game is the right place to do it.
y first game on steam and after all these years since 2004 CS is still my favorite game. Its interesting fun and nice FPS game!  10/10
lassic masterpiece full of minimalistic concept of shooting bad guys. 7/10
f only the servers were actI have in australia good game either way.
=100,000 hours
 
ad10/10
ere it all started  A true classic to the CounterStrike Series that will never get old.
eat game. A must have for any Steam user.
tter than csgo  you have spray feature removed in csgo  you have flashlight &amp nightvision removed in csgo  you have dark maps and/or dark places on a map removed in csgo, dark places are pretty bright, this is why there is no more flashlight &amp nightvision, it destroys the immersion, dark places &amp dark maps are useful for many aspects ingame hiding or warcraft server when cloaked or when you want someone to knife and reminds me of 2002 game bf1942 where dark maps are not really dark lol. VALVE shame on you  You have character selection removed in csgo  you have no ranking &amp market feature added in csgo, everyone plays csgo because they think they end up as a richshit‚ô•, also on every server there is trade spam in chat and even you get friendrequest spam from traders, also community is not looking at your skill anymore, but at your rank and not every server + singleplayer against bots has rank enabled.   You have no CoD clone like CSGO  Unlike CSGO, everyone plays this for fun, not for useless skins, money, rank etc.. also, here you cannot waste 600$ for a skin. You can get even new models which does not only change your weapon texture, but the model from gamebanana for FREE! You can make your M4 look like the G36C etc.  10/10 my fav childhood game
e best
ll never forget these days and months, I spent to throw grenades on de_dust 2x2, kill zombies with machinegun and run for my life, with my cracked version of cs 1.6.  Goodnight, sweet prince 
6 is love, 1.6 is life
e most legendary competitive have fps game you could imagine. Same old graphics but still keeps you playing.
unterStrike is a pretty old game of shooter, which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counterterrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. ObjectI haves of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.  And here is my thoughs..  This is the most entertaining video game I have ever played since 2007. I think I have played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day... I finally i bought this game and its worth 10 bucks indeed. I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it! By that i didnt mean online or with bots but i had lots of LANpartys in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lanpartys sometimes in my country ^^ The game is still fun and it never gets boring! I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER and more and more and more... Its just fantastic! D  10/10 Would recommand it!

is game an immortal D
tter than CSGO this game make guns feel more realistic than new generation games
ill the best CS ever made!
s a classical game for everyone to enjoy. It always takes me back to CounterStrike 1.6 when I need to remember how to play 1st person shooters 
anks for a great childhood
AAA game, 50percent skillz and 50percent strategy. + Easy to play but hard to master. + Playing it since 2002 + 1000+ hours invested only in steam since 2011. + 10+ smashed keyboards. + Best ragequit simulator! + The game that apparently my mom plays in secret since every player knows her. + Achievement unlock Learn to verbally abuse people in Russian, Spanish and Portuguese. + The reason why the steam platform came into existence. + The grandfather of tactical FPS.  1.6/1.6 I would smash my keyboard again!
s an verry competitive have game with a lots of acction and a lots of mods. The old school shooter.
od game and more cheaters
assic of CounterStrike. The best game for more than 10 years. If youve never experienced it, just get it.  100percent recommend.
azing game, full of good and old memories, 17 year old game and still alI have 3 Hope these old 1.6 days can be back...  #StillPlayinIt
iting nostalgic m8. Best sound N/A. Best Graphix N/A. Nothing better than good ol 1.6.   And I am an Ex. Team 3D player.
u can do thingies and shoot heads!
ve to shoot people with real life guns with different names? Have you ever dreamed to kill terrorists and even be a terrorist? Love playing the same, unI haversal map over and over just because its the only map youll ever know? *cough* dust2 Have you a desire to work as a team to complete objectI haves? Do you know how to speak BrazilianPortuguese and Romanian? Awesome because many servers have players that have Brazilians, Romanians, and many other South American/Eurpoean players Love nostalgia? Love to have fun? Love getting an extra game with bots in it for free?  Love randomly dying from wallbangs?  Great, youve come to the right game. Seriously though, despite the somewhat smaller North American community Which is still big for the old game it is its probably one of the greatest games I have ever come to play, and I have only had it for about a year, and im gonna add hundreds of thousands of hours playing this. I dont even have actual friends that play with me yet I can still have fun with this game. From the countless recoil patterns to remember from all the guns, to the extremely friendly community for the most part and playing all these classic maps. Yes, of course theres hackers, youll see a few of them, but they dont ruin the game. Either the servers admin can just ban them or you can just go to a different server, its not gamebreaking or anything. And besides, if you get this you also get CounterStrike Condition Zero, which has bots. Hell, you can even download Zbots for 1.6, and it waypoints for you! Definitely get this game. This game stands the test of time.  10/10 Would throw bricklooking grenades at terrorists again.
ounterStrike  I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isnt the only activity to do on a computer.  Sometimes the most simple games like CounterStrike are the ones that lI have to this day. The gameplay is very simple  defend as a CounterTerrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. 
 you cannot get CounterStrike Global Offensive have, this is great replacement for it. Its not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. Some servers may be in languages you cannot understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. One of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. Although the games graphics...arent really the best. Even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. Though to me, graphics dont really matter. Highly recommend this game. 9.5/10
have been playing this game for 10 years 7 or 8 years on nonsteam, and it still amazes me with the fact that people are still playing this game.   Met bunch of amazing people, learned english more than what school has taught me, joined and left great community every now and then this game has a huge impact on my life, from personality to the way I see the world not exaggerating.  Some people claimed they have slept with my family, some claimed they are not a hacker while their crosshair moves furiously, claiming it was an earthquake, some other claimed they can play better if their ping was lower and some other claimed they have tracked my IP and are on the way to kill me. What a super friendly community.  Best multiplayer fps game in the history of mankind, never gets me bored with tons of usermade mod, and one thing that this game never cease to amaze me is the fact that this game has a better hitbox than CSGO come at me CSGO plebs  1.6/CounterStrike, would get rekt by a player playing in the earthquake again
r the past 16 years this wonderful educational game has taught children other languages,that many foreign men have had sex with their mother, and fire in the hole. I wonder why I get in trouble when I stand up during English and yell Fire in The Hole! and lob random shit at people. I was in Spanish one day and I was startled as I was daydreaming of CS and I told the teacher I slept with her mother in Spanish. Turns out shes dead. This is the game that coined the term I am autistic and want to kill myself. 10/10 would fire in the hole again.
unterStrike is a firstperson shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. It was initially developed and released as a HalfLife modification by Minh Gooseman Le and Jess Cliffe Cliffe in 1999, before Le and Cliffe were hired and the games intellectual property acquired. CounterStrike was first released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the CounterStrike series. Several remakes and Ports of CounterStrike have been released on the Xbox console, as well as OS X and Linux.   Set in various locations around the globe, players assume the roles of members of combating teams that include counterterrorists and terrorists. During each round of gameplay, the two teams are tasked with defeating the other by the means of either achieving the maps objectI haves, or else killing all of the enemy combatants. Each player may customize their arsenal of weapons and accessories at the beginning of every match, with currency being earned after the end of each round.

EAM IJUEPUTAS DEJAME JUGAR CS
ay this game. It¬¥s awesome.
unter Strike, A game which changed the era of First person shooting game since it was born made in 1999 beta version Released on 2000 The Game Released on 2002 *I think*   I personally think counterstrike or CS made steam what it is thou Dota 2 and several others are there. This game has been ranked Number# 1 Since 2000 In front of my eyes. Ranked 1 by several industries and one of the most online server recording having more servers than any other game, Game  tracker.com  not rs.
 not 12 u idiot im 13. my dad works for valve and if u win im calling hacks and texting him on my nokia to tell him to ban your computer from the internet you noob. my mom owns microsoft so ill break ur windows noob.  if u use mac u need to die.  this game is ok
e mother of all FPS games! Although some may argue that this is a outdated game, I still love it. You get that awesome freedom of movement which you cannot get on CSS as much and on CSGO. In addition, this game nearly runs on all pcs even potatos with wires. It has a large modding team behind it AMXX, which isnt affiliated with Valve but nevertheless it makes the game 100x better, and adds amazing mods to it.
e best FPS game in history !
en though the new CS is out the old never gets old.
 i buy this game to become good at counter strike but i dont good because 1.6 is hard so i buy source to become good at counter strike but source is hard so i buy global Offensive have to become good at counter strike but i become silver 1 and realise game is not hard... life is hard and friend once told me to kys kappa your soul and i think it is great idea! Any way if you good at counter strike game it is fun if not deinstall game because if youre bad at game you are bad. Overall great game but also bad. Yes thank for read!  Btw Paradise Hillz is ugly shit. Thank for read!
e of best FPS games ever, its about 14 yrs old, but still getting updates. Thanks valve.
st Esport game of 21th century .   Good    easy to play no cheaters  maybe 10percent if you play on random pubs , in CSGO 60percent cheating. best game for tournaments as 5x5 not boring , you can play again and again to improve ur skill  Bad   VALVE did not support number one online action/esport game before die  was a lot of bugs   9.7/10  Recommend!
w pew since 2000, still works!
ce game...very nice
love this im old player
cellent, superb, babelicious game. Ruined my last year of Jr. High and a few of my High school years, would ruin again 10/10.  Excelente juego. Arruino unos a√±os de escuela, arruinaria de nuevo 10/10.  PS  I miss my WON ID.
ey copied the AK and other things from CoD 4. Bad game

d Good FPS.
at a greade game had real good times whit this
s alot of fun.
ah... the old CounterStrike.... Everybody know, what CS is.. CounterStrike  My rating  9/10   Why or Why not to play this old classic ?  PositI have  It¬¥s a legendary game, and if u playing games like CSGO etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library. Almost everybody played CS 1.6 from start his csgo career CounterStrike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase CS, u can play it, if u will download it, there¬¥s is some chance, that u cannot play it Win 8 etc.  Most of legens/pro¬¥s in CSGO played CS 1.6, it¬¥s like beginning, and it could be your beginning!   NegatI have No more good tournaments on CS 1.6 On CSGO are tournaments like EMS, Dreamhack etc. Graphic+Gameplay  Graphic sucks... but its still better then WarZP Gameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see CSGO, when is all so smooth, u will hate CS 1.6... but if u play CS 1.6 before then CSGO, its good for you, and u will like it probablyD  So... my opinion is It¬¥s legendary game, everyone, who likes FPS must have this in his/herP steam library.

And here is my thoughs...  This is the most entertaining video game I have ever played since 2007. I think I have played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day... I finally i bought this game and its worth 10 bucks indeed. I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it! By that i didnt mean online or with bots but i had lots of LANpartys in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lanpartys sometimes in my country ^^ The game is still fun and it never gets boring! I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER/MIX/PCW/CM/AUTOMIX/BRUSH/ARUSH and more and more and more... Its just fantastic! D  10/10 Would recommand it!

eatest game ever.
e best game ever
ll only a line its a life time addiction.
ashbang my face
e of the best classic multiplayer games ever!  Best gameplay in multiplayer games I have seen.  Most People, who play CSGO never played CS 1.6, which is kinda sad.. Not a single CS Game can replace 1.6.  Btw. Most Esport tournaments were held in cs 1.6.  So since CSGO came out, CS 1.6 kinda lost advantage. Mostly cause of the years it already has.  We will miss you 1.6 3 Thank you for all the love and fun you gave us ..   R.I.P.  Remembrance of CounterStrike 1.6  http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrUMZZiheLU 
st game in the world! 
e best of all.

is game is the Game of the Millenium...Its the only game that is played from 2000 to today. Every PC is capable to play this game, even the one that didnt got their drI haver updated on 2003Probably. So yeah, if you are a fan of oldschool, this game is for ya.

fter all this time?   Always. 3
unter Strike 1.6 remains an old school game. Is game of our childhood. No updates, no new things, still remain our passion.
ll forever and always be my first love
sically this game was released back in the year 2000 and still is one of the most played games on Steam.  So clearly it must be good because so many are still playing it. I definitely recommend this game and if you dont like to shoot terrorist or counter terrorists you can always try different game modes like zombie modes.  10/10
e of the best games and also my favorite 
ppy 15th Birthday to the best FPS
e best Action Game Ever
thershiting shitfuckt game
enjoyed so much playing this game 
s old game Bat steal playing all world.. 
nds down the GOAT.
have deleted all the comments on this because I wanted to gI have a serious review about this game and delete my older one, so here ya go  This is the older CounterStrike as most people know it. Some people usually dont find enjoyment in playing it due to it being either outdated or glitchy. I personally tend to enjoy this game from time to time because its an original game made from the first Source engine, and old school shooters in general aint too shabby either. Due to the game having a small amount of space to fill in your computer, it rarely ever lags, which makes sure of no interruptions to your enjoyment. Its also just as competitive have as the present CounterStrike games, though there isnt any seperate Comp gamemode, unfortunately. But thats something that Valve decided to save for later purposes I suppose. Still the King of FPS Games IMO, I would definetely recommend playing this if you enjoy tactical teamwork in your Online Gaming.
still dont know where A is on dust
d school! Played this game from the VERY beginning and I still play it. Not as good as I used to be, but I can still hold my ground for an old guy! D Recommend all players that like FPS games to get this and play it. Still lots of servers out there and still lots of players.
s an Awesome game... wud spend ma whole lyf playing dis game 
commend delete CounterStrikeSource &amp CSGO !
EN YOURE A COUNTER TERRORIST YOU SHOOT THOSE BAD TERRORIST AND STOP THEM FROM PLANTING EVIL BOMBS IN AMERICA,
 skins no updates good recoil control good servers less russians better servers old style  I love it .
ghly recomended it is very good game it is a game that takes you to our child hood actually servers are very good buy this game
e of the best games ever out there. Yes, it is old but it is JUST amazing. Much better than CoD and just as good as Battlefied 3 or 4 maybe P. There are many things tod if you get bored of the tactical playing in games. You can bhop, deathrun, surf and a lot of other things. This honestly should be a $60 game for how good it actually is. So just get this game as it is simply amazing!
like the gems cs1.6
masterpiece you wont ever forget!
e most classic and best online tactic shooter ever! Cheap, great and addicting  Unfortunately there are not many players left, since CS GO was released. And the big amount of cheaters is another problem to deal with.
s is da real shit, better than grape juice!

1.6 indeed the best multiplayer game in the FPS world. I have literally grown up playing this game and still have not got bored having played it for over 10 years now.
e biggest game changer of all time in the online FPS genre. Respect it.
have been playing this game since 2004, this game is mind blowing awesome. If youre not looking deeply into graphics, but just want to have fun playing, then this game is for you. Multiple gamemodes, will keep anyone amused. If you dont have it, then what are you waiting for? Get it now!
eat FPS game, recommended! 
d but gold! I like it.
 is a good Coop game for online gamers.
e of the classics of the shooting genre and precursor to most of todays modern shooters, for all the good and the bad that may imply. CounterStrike 1.6 is the second iteration of the original HalfLife mod and, quite likely, its most popular incarnation. The rather simplistic gameplay coupled with accessible system requirements and intuitI have controls make it one of the most longlI haved shooters today, still sporting a massI have fanbase.  A game that must be tried at least once by any shooting game neophyte.
e Best Game !

DIO Fire in the hole! You got flashed and got stuck in the corner by a teammate RADIO Fire in the hole!,RADIO Fire in the hole!,RADIO Fire in the hole! And both die from a grenade gg nice game will rush again with him
ill the best game ever made ... I dont think anybody can beat this engine ...
ath is a great teacher. Failure in CounterStrike is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldnt have done, and how you could have done better. CounterStrike players spend a lot of time learning  consequently, they are always getting better.
694 hours on CS 1.6.. No regrets.
ayed this game for the first time in 2008. Since then I have clocked more than 5000 hours, thats how addictI have its multiplayer is. Father of all FPS in MP. Plus has several mods deathmatch, hns, kz, gungame, scrim, zombiemod and paintball. Its been 14 years and the game is still going strong atleast in the Indian scene.

`s ok.2k14 EditIt`s ok?!That`s all i had to say then? Kinda unfair, gI haven that this is the game of my childhood.

But was i also a little geek who couldn`t wait to get back home from school and viciously murder anyone in my path of winning the match?Hells to the yeaah. Note Can you believe i`m in Medical school, after all of that?  Rainy day csplaying is the best thing in the world, hands down. This game never gets old.If you haven`t played cs, you`ve lI haved for nothing. Peace!^^

s a very nice game 
is will be more of a my experience with this game type of review, because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something I have experienced with CounterStrike. Here you go  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friends house and he was playing a game. I didnt know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friends house. When I saw the CounterStrike logo I was filled with gamegasm ? and I was so happy. I dont remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. CounterStrike is my first game which I played competitive havely and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitive havely made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like CounterStrike are the ones that lI have to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple  defend as a CounterTerrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of CounterStrike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I have lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I have played with years ago. I think CounterStrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today, if this game wouldnt exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CSGO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CSGO and modern games.

unterStrike 1.6 is one of my best games I have ever played even if I played alot of games, The graphics doesnt matter but the gameplay is the important !
 you search a good game which need skills and tactics this game is for you . Brilliant game I`m playing it from 2003 and still playin because this game is really really good !!!
assic FPS.
havent written a review in a while but Id like to do one for this game. Before CSGO came out I played this game every now and then after school but I normally played Source. I started playing this game after I remember the difficulty and skill needed to handle the aiming in this game and honestly after all these years this game is still amazing, if you get the These graphics are shit mindset and focus on the gameplay its amazing. Its fastpaced and some of the modded maps are insanely detailed. Amazing game with amazing replay value.
ayed 3k+ hours, pretty bad game wouldnt recommend to others Kappa.
nd blowing graphics, better than 2034 source 3 engine physics too.
d school badass timekiller,more than 3k hours of fun,rage,conversations and so on. Never gonna gI have you up, never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
e best of its time.
p old times game. So... what are you waiting for? just buy it damm
e classic CS game, cannot get better than this. 10/10
st classic game that I have been playing for years, if it wasnt for CAL falling apart, the release of other verisons of counterstrike such as condition zero, source, and global offense. I would still be playing competitivevly
is game is good.Really Good!!
st game 4ever, no game is gonna beat this
e of my first video games that I started to play. One of my favorite 3 D
ther of FirstPersonShooter games! This 14 years old game is still in the top 10 most played games, was and will always be the worlds number 1 online action game. Once you play this game, you will never get bored of it, even if you were unskilled in classic mods, there will always be a good and funny mod that will suits you. Still havent bought this game? Go get it! Fully recommended  10/10!
GO is good. CS is great.  I keep on playing, and school I will be late.
commended. Here is the pros/cons of this game in my humble opinion    PROS
 is a very good, classic game, which started the multiplayer shooter game series of Counter Strike.

y counterstrike 1,6
it!!
unter Strike 1.6 is a box with million unforgivable memories of mine inside. Great coop which you will never get bored by. Most liked deathmatch and zombie mode.
s a good game D
d game...But GOLD game!
ll, here it is. Some call it the mother of shooters, some call it bullsh*t. Well, I can¬¥t tell, whether you will like it, but the fact is, that it started one of the first big shooter franchises ever.   Pros  awesome gameplay awesome gunplay nostalgia teambased mechanics   Cons  a bit outdated though   I myself like the classic Counter Strike, but I think there should be big Skillbased MatchMaking Sites like FaceIt or ESEA if possible even free ones, because the competitive Mode from Global Offensive have is pretty good even though sometimes it sucks with its rank system.  I think, that it is a great game, but perhaps some players will be put off by the old graphics, but these are pretty good, if you imagine, that this game is about 16 years old.    Must Have for a shooter fan or anyone else who loves old games  9.8/10
assic is always Best 3
ch game Much love Many sweat
687
e best game for ever
 my opinion, its probably the best counter strike game out there and yes, better than cs go. 
s awesome!!!
atoNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
andard run and gun game that says it tries to stop cheaters and hackers out of the game, instead all it does is ban people who are having internet trouble trying to blame them for lag switching. It does not hitting those who you can obviously watch and see they are using aim bots by spectating after death and always aiming at people through walls at their heads ready to shoot the moment they turn corners.
g, This Game is 1st best games in 20092011. 3 i will never stop playing,  NEVER    
rfect game to play at school D
e of the best game I have ever played in my whole life! This game was the best ,this game is the best ,this game will be the best.
 I just played the original Counter Strike, CS1.6 for about an hour and after over 100 hours of both CSS and CSGO, this game is AMAZING! But so different! I love this game and its game series! It taught me tactical gameplay and how much communication is key but this game lacks a bit of that but not much. I absolutely love this and highly recommend it!
od old game, but time is up!
azing game . Totaly adictI have and loads of fun . Have been playing from quite long now. Never did i get bored of playing counter strike 1.6. 
Old but Gold
solutely outstanding game. beautifuly made and an absolute masterpeice to say none the least. If you dont have a good PC or want the old cs retro feel. Pick this up and enjoy yourself with some mates. Awesome game.
me which dragged me in gaming, as outdated and old it is, the best memories for me lies within this game. I mainly played because of mods, which were great, like Zombie Mod, Death Run and WC3FT Mod
eryone knows what this game is, i just wanna say it`s a big part of my childhood, like GTA VC. How can`t u love it?
me gI haves me 2030 fps D But the memories 
e best game that I have played for last 10 years, however cs go took my heart forever. Buy this game if you wish to come back to old days sitting in large screens and playing cs 1.6 all day.

ok son, a legend. y
t long before this game becomes yet another timeless tale of gamings glorious past, and far from dead is that past.   Newcomers to PC Gaming Point is, its a classic, and mandatory if you own a PC. So in short, straighten the hell up, ignore your idiot friends nagging you for a game of League or DOTA or BF4 or Planetside or whatever other garbage youve convinced yourself is good, and start from the ground up when you build your collection.
w years ago, we first heard that CS 1.6 is dead, some organizations have dismissed their CS  team, people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to CS GO. It seems that now it is not so! If you pay attention to the broadcast with IEM 6 WC, we see that CS 1.6 By Views prevzashla SC 2, not only is this game broke all past their records. So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS GO it grows, developers even began to read the Feedback, the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result. As for the keys to the CS GO, something Im working on that would get a couple of the key for you guys! I will write how I succeed!
riously im playing this game because of kreedz mod and climbing other than that is shit but still cool tho
is is the BEST FPS ever, CounterStrike was the game, which made Esports evolve big time and is the reason for alot of great games today. Without CounterStrike, i guess alot of good games wouldnt exist today.
n shoot terrorists and be terrorist. Can plant bomb as terrorist.  CounterStrike predicting ISIS before it even existed confirmed? More updates as they come.   UPDATE Valve has replied to my message, and only said Never email us again or we will ban your Steam account. Yes. So I wondered, what if I ran this through my decoder machine? So I ran it through my decoder machine. And it came out as this lonely message Trump did 7/11.  What could it mean? Im not really sure. Ill keep you guys posted.   UPDATE #2 I have done extensI have research, and it appears that this decoded message either means that Donald J. Trump owns a large chain of convenience stores, or that he is an international terrorist threat. At this point Im not entirely sure which it is. If you have insight into this topic, please reach me at  xXilluminartyboizXx@internetexplorer.com . Thanks.   UPDATE #3 This might be my final update. I found a note slipped into my underwear when I woke up this morning. It was adressed from Valve. I opened it, naturally. Inside was one, simple sentence Trump sees all.   Guys, listen, I dont know for sure if Trump did 7/11, or he made ISIS, or anything, but its been fun trying to figure it out. If I dont make it to another update, and they get to me first, just tell my hamster Poochins that I loved him. Peace out.

unterStrike is the best firstperson online shooting game. Because it depends only in your own skills. There are no advantages like in Call of Duty series, you will need to aim correctly, know the recoil of your gun and shoot your enemies to death.
esome game .. cs 1.6 longlI have

e best game ever P
e classic. If you havent played it yet gI have it a go oh the pun and dont let the lack of ShineyGrafix‚Ñ¢ disappoint you. I have both the later Source and currently latest GO versions but still come back to the original version from time to time because it is still fun and its classic style is still completely fine... and a lot of people who still play CS regularly shares my view.
e Best Game 
like this game very much and.. LOVE IT .. D In this game i liked strategy, team work and competitiveons, in specially i like to play with people, with friends
st shitin shooter eva ! _ \m/

mply.... perfect
d schooll
eat game, been playing for 11+ years.
is game STILL continue to lI have on, but why was that? Well it was quite due to that fact that CSSource isnt that much like by the pros since 2004 as CSS as quoted Too easy and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release 2003  2013 in which just kind of died out for CSGO, but still, because of its core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it.  Since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since.  It is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you dont have GNU/Linux In which I have, then you can buy Counter Strike  Globle Offensive have anyway, since it is newer and I think has more players and pros playing it now. But if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well.  Verdict 9.5/10  It still holds it place.
is Game Im Playing Forever! 
some game
e best Multiplayer FPS of all time.

dont think there is much to say about this game since it has been said already. I enjoy playing it even though I suck at it. A lot. Its much harder than CSGO for me but it has proven one thing a game with bad graphics can still be good in 2016  I apologise for my English.
 name is Commander Shepard and this game that ruined my grades

od Game! CS 1.6 Forever!
e classic action FPS CounterStrike, has made a huge impact on my gaming life, ever since I was a prepubscent,6 year old child. Enjoying various betas and versions throughout its development, the game has evolved from a mod for HalfLife, to one of the most viewed and played eSports.   If you havent already, buy it,play it and enjoy it. I have nailed countless of hours on different accounts I have had, and of course the nonsteam versions  10/10

st way to waste your fkin time! Love it!
will always enjoy this game. Best FPS I have ever played. Its 2015 and I still love it. BUY IT.
is is not a game I bought. This is a piece of my childhood that I paid to have back.
st online shooter ever!
l remind you I have played CS 1.6 into oblivion on another account. 101 hours is not the full representation of my gameplay in this game.   CS 1.6 is a classic game everybody almost knows what is, at least if you are an FPS player. Of course today it is very outdated and not something you would otherwise play as your main game, but it certainly is something to take a walk through every once in a while  especially as a trip down memory lane or as a fun little LAN game to take your mind off modern games, which can get tiresome after a while at least in my honest opinion.   I can definitely recommend this. I played it a lot, and all the while, despite my review of it, CSCZ had an end consensus that was a better smooth gameplay somewhat, this is one of the best games of all time. At least in terms of the FPS genre. No doubt. But if you were to play it today, youd have to be patient as the only people still playing this online are either veterans, somewhat experienced people or cheaters on VACinsecure servers which there also is quite a lot of. If youre lucky, you might still find that some of the best servers that kept the community going might still be up. Maybe.   Tread carefully, but definitely try it.
e game of my childhood. I never get bored of it,     OLD BUT GOLD   
 hours on it. Def worth it
ill a better love story than Twilight!!!
ayed just a little. its ok
e of the oldest CounterStrike games that is the best around.
od game if you have friends      I dont
ill fantastic after all these years. The game that molded a generation.
s an oldschool game but the only one I play. There is no reason for me to play some newer version of CS. I like the simplicity of 1.6 version
ay the worlds number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular teambased game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your teams success. Your teams success affects your role.
out CounterStrike CounterStrike is a firstperson shooter game from Valve, the first of the CounterStrike series.  Play the worlds number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular teambased game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your teams success. Your teams success affects your role.  Gameplay CounterStrike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you cannot just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.  CounterStrike is a good game. I recommend this game.  Thanks Valve Thanks !!! Old but Gold !!!  10/10 From Me Sweep Playing this game since 2004
is this mincraft 2.0

aying Counter Strike Felling Awesome with Steam...
res my story, I went over to my friends house one day, he was playing CS. I tried it for myself, I was instantly hooked and have been for over 10 years with the counter strike franchise. Best online action franchise ever for the pc in my opinion. Counter strike is like a drug that you will never be cured from, trust me.
st FPS game ever! It never gets old and it is always fun to play with.
tter than csgo =P
ly the best competitive have teambased FPS ever!
 entire childhood is laying beneath this amazing game. Always come back to it, no matter what happens.

unterstrike1.0  1.6  is one of the greatest esport fps gamesif not the greatest in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a gamer, gameplay does....

llas I have long been playing this game and I would recommend to you to try it because it is very intresting game for those who like shooters 


e most addictI have online game!
 not one to criticise a game but, this has to be a great title mostly for its Your role affects your teams success. Your teams success affects your role, system even if it had many problems. The gameplay is great with plenty of user created content to play. Vanilla gameplay is not advised as it gets repetitI have fast. Overall gameplay is a 8.5 out of ten. The sound isnt very good with its annoying tracks, the only way to fix this is to download custom gun sounds but thats a pain. The sound wasnt even good in 2000 when the game came out and thats telling you something. Overall 4.0 out of a possible ten. I know this is odd for me to review a game off of this but online community. The community if few and far between, there are BARELY any good servers up and sometimes the community is awful. still not as bad as team fortress 2 IMO XD Overall 6.0 out of ten. Graphics usually take the backseat in my reviews but, I do have to say the graphics are OK I mean in 2000 they still werent as good as UNREAL 1 or IDTECH 3 but they get the job done. Overall 6.5 out of ten. My verdict is that this game is good and still is I have to say this is a damn fine game earning my score as an 80percent out of 100percent BTW This is all criticism because, I AM A CRITIC. I go into detail about every problem a game has. Therefore I recommend. Monstercat signing out.
RY GOOD GAME  ADDICTED TO IT NOW STEAMER EVEN MORE ADDIDCTED TO CS

od The best game
ver get tired of playing this game..
at can you say about this game? Its shiting classic! 11/10 and its gonna never bored.
rings back those memories!
by the best game ever.
know if this game is so old, but many memories if you played untill long time  how to make friends in the game? played counterstrike in comunities keep counterstrike for your histories  thanks. 
nted a physical copy of this game , rather than purchasing it online, to leave my children a memoir of one of the gr8test games in history, but anyway... this will do the trick more or less. +1 , the only game i really knew how to play and i really enjoyed playing.
is is where history was written. the son of the big daddy HalfLife. Since the game was released, even with newer versions like Source and GO, it is still very popular. Example of a masterpiece.
ether you are a hardcore PC gamer, or if you have just bought your first PC, Counterstrike 1.6 should be the first game you buy.  Graphics dont matter, this game can produce hours uopn hours of entertainment.  10/10 Highly recommended.
ry nice old school game.
ere cannot be better than 1.6 throughout all these years playing it since I didnt even know whats steam. Buying the original game feels way better than nonsteam no lag experience as some of you say. Its hella worth the time spent its been almost 7 years for me playing this game since I was a kid. My childhood and maybe later would be my adulthood also being spent on it. The amount of mods/servers are unbelievable! all of them are amazing as I tried them all. I cannot deny that I am addicted to it but, yet! Its hella worth to reborn and be played like the past times! Tournaments and more. I cannot withstand the ignorance of valve to its amazing old games! Just remember that before cs go came out, your success was not in CSS or CSCZ it was all in this game. 3
 !
od Old Classic.
is game is pure jewel,i love it.
was sitting in CT Spawn in de_dust2 after I found my entire team afk sitting right next to me. I decided to sneak up on cat when I heard Bomb has been planted by the terrorist opposition. I proceeded to act like a Slick Ninja by avoiding all terrorists. Only to find out most of them went to look for our team and killed them in ct spawn. I went around on Cat Walk, Threw a smoke, and went to cut the wire of the bomb the Terrorists had planted. I almost cut the Blue wire, and it could have cost us the round. 5 Seconds goes by, and it says, Counter Terrorist wins.   At that very moment, I just realized I had won the game.  That is my story.  CounterStrike = Thumbs up!
e best multiplayer game ever. 3000 hours of happy and smile with friends.
CE RIOT SHIELD
y i have low fps   but nice game D
though Im keeping this a thumbs up. I never liked 1.6. Cool to see how the game evloved.. but I never liked the 1.6 update from 1.5.
me 4 life!
iting nice shooter game.One of the first FPS games I tryed in my life.
st Game ever. I love this game. I am playing for 4 years and now also i am not get bored D Best Shooting game ever D
 just here to post the 6,666th review for this game... get it.
is game... Lots of memories. Lot of spent time playing this game in childhood, still having nostalgic feelings. I still play this game sometimes and it still makes me happy. c
 the best if u want to have a good game . D
ally good game.. Its old but it is still good and funny.. Mostly i enjoy playing modes like Jailbreak/furien mode. I recomend this game.
 GaM 0n3 of my favourite GaM3s.
e game is very beatiful and full of emotions while playing online. All the gamers, harcore gamers, have to play it. It is just about skills and trainings.
st game ever made 33333333 HBD 15 years
e of the best fps games out there, tho the graphics arent as good as the current gen games but this is a worth to try game. Playing this game for like 4 years or so absolutely incredible game period.. 
great game!!!
re in the hole!

 first ever game was CS 1.5 , all i can say it has immortality , because this game is so awesome and nostalgic it will never be forgotten, shame that not as much player left, but still enough to play diffrent maps and modes 
riously the bestest game ever D
ww.fastcup.net 
ay it if you like mexicans who cannot afford a computer to play csgo
competitive. Easy to play. Can Include AI for training. Tons of servers/server plugins/custom maps/even custom guns. Fun to play, always.  Little repeating.  In overall, I recommend it to everyone, please do not judge this game for graphics and/or lack of military actions, GoldSrc engine is not Real Virtuality 3  Arma 2 engine , and this game is old school, typical classic so graphics are what they are.
unter Strike 1.6 Will Never Die ! Valve Created CounterStrike , and it found an amazing success , many legends appeared , Spawn , Cyx , Heaton , Walle . were legends ! NAVI , SK GAMING , Fnatic , NIP ! were legendary cs 1.6 teams ! , Spawn Was Legend ‚ô• But Took retirment in  26022010 ! Cs 1.6 lost a Legend , Cyx was Legend too ! but died in a car accident 29072010 ! cs 1.6 lost an other legend ! Walle too ............... ! , Eved Edward , king of pistols with his awesome ace vs Fnatic ! , &amp f0rest ! we wont forget dalpan ! in addition to many other cs 1.6 legends ! ,,, but now a days ! many gamers leaved the 1.6 ! because of the new Global Offensive have .... ! but what if everyone stops playing CSGO ! what if wa all comback to the amazing 1.6 ! to this amazing game , awesom game , real game 3 ! we will see new legends .. new 1.6 legends ! .... Here zneel D a new champion ! we want our old 1.6 back ! with old emotions ..... 3 ! share this status everywhere ! to incite gamers to come back to the awesom 1.6 ! you can be also a legend or champion one day  ! you can be as powerful as spawn ! or any other legend ! yes you can ! &amp we can return to the old  CounterStrike Stille a lI have &amp wont die D
 shitfuck!
 is the best counter strike ever
some game worlds number 1 game awsome
,I remember the good times when I played CS withouth even knowing what to do but still having fun. Now we got CSGO and CSS and CS isnt getting so much love. If i would play CS i would not play it alone,just with a friend. Anyways gets 9/10 for making my childhood beatiful 3
is is my all time favourite game. It is one of the first game I played. This game has been with me until now and I am still playing it with a big joy. It may be old but there is no other game that can replace it in my life.
st of all times
sy to learn. Hard to master.
pure masterpiece of an FPS
is Game Is a classic master piece. And has AMAZING replay value. As a young gamer my self growing up in a world where most casual gamers are xbox humping, cod playing, graphic shit‚ô•s. It is shameful that this game is not played. This game made and broke friendships and made a childhood for many people. Even if you dont play the game often. Please just get it for it to be in your library. 8/10 for some bugs and a now strange community. But nonetheless a great game.
e reason i started using steam D
 old, but gold.
ry good game
ll of Duty‚Ñ¢ ripoff
is game is shit.  5/5  Must have.
is game changed gaming as a whole. One of the best FPS of all time, if not the best. But its all about the gameplay. Its how CS plays that will get you. Huge online community, thousands of mods, nostalgic graphics, excellent gameplay, nice sound effects even if they r outdated. CS 1.6 is my favorite FPS and is much better than Global Offensive have in all aspects. I played this game so much before i got Steam, this game is just spetacular. Even in nonsteam gaming, lan houses,competitive have play, CS 1.6 is still incredibly popular. 10/10, congratulations to the developers.
, fall asleep love, loved by me... for I know love, I am loved by thee. Read more at  http//www.brainyquote.com/quotes_of_the_day.html#zvQY7U3Ax27DSMXQ.99 
used to play this game with my friends when we had to do military service it was a lot of fun pretending that we were fighting Russians while putting to use what we would learn during training. However, it seems that the only people who play now are Turkish children who hack and have bad ping so, I would not recommend this game any more.
eat game. I have no words. The controls, graphics, and the gameplay are really good, especially for the time. Its fun, there is a lot you can do too. Would definitely recommend this game.
ghly recommend this game to all..D
e chat was overfilled with people blaming for hacks.  I like it that way.
love cs 1.6 but in this one there is no bots  
e Best FPS D
00 hours in 2 years, ruined my life.
s CounterStrike ! The Best FPS Game Ever !  I always Play on this game its super cool !
is is a very fun game if you can find some friends to play with. There are a lot of servers with custom content such as models or even game modes that completely change the game. Even though its old there are still actI have servers with plenty of players on them. Its very easy to make a custom map if you wish to play one. Only bad thing is that the graphics and models are not that great. Also most servers are in spanish
is game is perfect and awesome!!!
ry nice 1.6 i like this game
assic game. Love it 3
er 6k Hrs of nonsteam version...And i didnt got bored.. Still one of best competitive 5v5 game ever made...   LOVE IT 3 3 3 3 3
ile starting to show its age, CounterStrike is a classic that you just have to play!
ught this game a bit too late... wish I wouldve been around to play it back in its prime.  This game is simply a classic. My first CounterStrike was Source. I loved Source a lot, and that lead to me getting CSGO. CSGO is now my most played game. ANYWAYS, I bought this game pretty recently and I love playing it. Too bad the servers are bugged I think, otherwise, still has an alright community. great gameplay and requires a lot of skill.  I love the wallbanging and the style you have to shoot. Not so much run n gun like the other games in the series.  I definitely recommend this game. Even though I doubt many people are still buying this game!
briliant FPS game. Fast Paced Action. Skill Required = Good FPS
f is 1 but CS is 1.6
is is the game that started a genre, every shooter since CS has copied its competitive have teambased style of play. Its the original to a legacy, and many people still play it to this day. It has older graphics for people who might not have an expensI have computer, plenty of dedicated servers, and the core gameplay that is known worldwide is right here where it belongs.  But obviously you know this already unless youve been spending your life playing on Xbox and playstation. Right?
d is Gold, if you dont have a superior machine, no worries you will still enjoy the classic
Very good game indeed..... proves that graphics dont matter, gameplay does
is game, is not a multiplayer game, is THE Multiplayer Game. This game is classic, is a monster! CounterStrike... I love those words. This is my 2 favorite game of all time. To be good in this game you must be a strategist, to have a good team relationship, and takes dedication. This game has tons of weapons to choose. THe game modes are PERFECT, the other community gamemodes are even better! You like COD with zombies, well, this game haved zombies before COD, and better zombies. In what game are you gonna do a deathrun, where you must be alert to everything and to have skills to survI have and kill a terrorist? In what game are you gonna kill zombies, while they run at full speed and all your teammates throw granades and shoot as if there was no tommorow? In what game are you gonna surf on wall? In what game are you gonna find this quantity of maps, and good maps!? In what game!? Battlefield and COD can have better graphics, destruction, campaing and more guns, but, they will never have the community that CounterStrike have.    We made CounterStrike, CounterStrike made us.  English is not my first language
Word Classic D
arted playing this game when I was 8 years old  2002 . Bravo CounterStrike!

 many years with us, but still the best game ever. 
ll play this for like 10k hrs, for sure
e of the best games I played and playing till now ^_^
 s good game.
ill the best FPS. Even after playing CS GO, 1.6 will always have a place in my heart.
eat game, tho graphics are not nowadays quality because its been made in 1999.
e greatest multiplayer shooter experience I have had since Quake 1. The esport scene also helped it alot, its the only computer game I have really followed when it comes to esports back when I followed the CPL etc. The design of the game was simple but very effectI have and delI havered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. The Call of Duty and Battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like CounterStrike.
is game is awsome and will be for sure in next 50 yrs 
ik is for real mans
st FPS game ever, if you are truly a gamer, dont miss it
is game will always have a place in my heart,I grew up with this one.It also doesnt require a good PC,you dont need to worry about ranks too,simple as that and dont be put off by the graphics...By the way you can still find surf/bhop servers so its worth it!
is is s good game
m. trying to earn a few batches.
What CS Has taught me over the years...   French shit‚ô• shit‚ô• shit‚ô• shitshit‚ô•‚ô• shit‚ô• shitshit‚ô•‚ô• shit‚ô• shit‚ô• shit‚ô•  Spanish shit‚ô• fuck shit‚ô•‚ô• shit‚ô• shit shit‚ô• shit‚ô• shit‚ô•  Russain shit‚ô• shit‚ô• shit‚ô• shit‚ô• shit‚ô• shit‚ô•  and many... many more.
d but gold !
ways good as a trip down the memory lane!
ce game, i recommend it!
ck when CounterStrike was good. Of all games in this series, the other games arent as complete as this one. Though this game maybe feels outdated, it does pack alot of fun for anyone who is a fan of FPS games. The FPS function in this game is superb and it feels great to get headshots and so on. If youre intrested in this game and if youre fully aware of what you are getting in to, then get it!
d school game.
99 is when this came out, but when I was born. Gladly though I grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. There was no other game that I played once I purchased this with some BDay cash on Steam. First time playing, I got mutilated like the noob I was, but when I started playing more often, I became better and everyone else can too.   This isnt like the CODs or Battlefields that I have played here and there today. No its much more different. CounterStrike is a Tactical FPS which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. You dont unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectI haves, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. Think of the game as Cops &amp Robbers. Robbers blow things up and the Cops dont them too.  On the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. There too much to do or put in here but I can slam a bit down. Zombies Survival/Escape Soccer Or Football for the Europeans Surf Bhop/KZ Climbing Zone Pokemod Gungame Those new may have heard such from Call of Dutys spinoff And more, etc.  So now that I have explained the game I guess I can lay down some pros yet cons to playing CounterStrike 1.6  PROS Fun/Unlimited Gameplay possibilities Booming community that has been alI have for 15 years Plethora of servers to choose from competitive and Casual at the same time Fun to play with a group of friends More skill based than many other games out there Cheap price   CONS Graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting Not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better May seem repetitI have after a while  I came into CS late. But, Im glad this was the first one I owned.
y the shit not?
esports 
ter 16 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayer games in the world. its one of the best shouter games ever made !! you cannot get bored of this one, trust me i have about 1.3k hours here on steam &amp more than 2k on the non steam version = but ppl left it to play modern games like cs go &amp battlefield &amp COD .. what a shame !! there still some alI have communities &amp servers so dont be afraid ... but the sad thing is that there are many cheaters you will get used to see them anyways, thank god there are many admins who can take care of them i love this game so much but after all maybe this its the right time to let it go. maybe one day i will comeback to find it alI have again like the old days, maybe one day  anyways, i totally recommend this game for everyone! dont be shy go buy it now if you didnt already do ! this is a must have one !
dont have to tell you what Counter Strike is right? The Steam version is better then a pirated one since the servers work perfectly and it got most bugs out since the days of Won. net
/10 Would review again.
e of my favourate game....  
aying with people within this game made me a bad person.  Playing with people within this game made me reetarded.  Playing with people within this game has formed a tumor inside my brain.  Playing this game will make you a homosexual.  And you will like it.
y this game
esome game! Never had so much fun with any other game!
e best CS ever made, in the history of CS. World class game. Only skill, no skins, no betting, no random spraying, no luck factors involved unlike some games *cough CSGO cough* D
ce game D
remember back in the days when I was called cyberathlete. This game was so awesome with wallhacks, playing on unofficial VAC servers hosted by Online Game Cheat community. The player with best cheat was master of time. I wish I was that guy when I had a car in Jerusalem. You know three wheels and stuff with aimbot on the roof, freaky oh yeas.
t in position and wait for my go !
e of the best FPS games of all time.
is is not a game. This is a life.  Im so sorry that there are too much cheaters on servers, but if Valve can make it better , it would be great D Remember old good times, waiting to start a new match between NaVi and fNatic 3 And all other teams... Then somebody made a cheat, and destroyed a game. This game changed many lI haves, many people. I think this game become the world best game ever. For me, its the best game. I play it every day, but it isnt like sometimes. Now graphic is important. Well, it isnt. I know that this game is dead already... I want to get it back, but there is no way to do that.  Cheaters are everywhere now. In every single game. You can buy cheat for CSGO for 5$ I think... My friend bought it. I asked him   Why did you bought that ? Isnt it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats?  He told me  I want to beat everyone. I want to be the best. No one can stop me now.   I dont know why are you doing it, this is beautiful game. When I played it for the first time, it was awesome D Finally a game that I can play with my friends on LAN. And, till today, Im playing it. I never downloaded a cheat. I dont need that. I want to learn how to play, to be the beast in the world... Now everyone is wanting money, money money... I heard about CSGO Lounge aka CS GO betting site. Now everyone is watching matches because of skins, to get free money... Well, when I was young, in 2005. I waited with my friends a CS 1.6 match. It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CSGO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90percent watch them because of f***ing bet...  It will never be like sometimes... Or we can change everything...  Valve please, get this game back to life 3  Thanks.

 you didnt know this game is the reason Steam was invented and for that reason alone I believe everyone on Steam should own this game. Edit. Nominated this game for the Test Of Time award because no game deserves it as much as Counter Strike.

d School Rules B
unterStrike  a series of computer games in the genre of team firstperson shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of HalfLife games.  You have to compare, so this game I will compare with –°S Source and CS Global Offensive have    Pros    1. Battle PVP.   The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game. The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceI have, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.   2. The atmosphere and realism.   In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed. It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life. For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in CounterStrike Global Offensive have with new sounds and they made a shitfuck.       Minuses    1. Cheaters.   Well, as without these shitfucks? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anticheat. Valve is trying to improve its anticheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.   2.Graphic arts.   She was good at CounterStrike as long as did not come out Source. Im not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes. Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.   3.Termination of support.   All good things always come to an end, and CounterStrike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for CounterStrike and does not support it in esports.     Conclusion     Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.  If you ask me, as you CounterStrike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to gI have me a lot of positI have emotions..  
u have it already.
ter years, it`s still very fun to play with friends.
st FPS game I have ever played . Rise above all
s very good and play again and again
e best FPS game to ever touch the PC industry, up to this day, no one has been able to properly replicate it, that is all.
love this Game , 20 years this game was released and still people play it .  addicted game 3
like this classic game! All textures,all weapons....I think this game was the first, and I hope to be still, the best!
e original CS.  This is where it all started, 1.6. While many forget about 1.4, 1.5 and those versions, 1.6 is a great standalone title.  Graphics wise, you have to be able to run this. If you cannot run CS at all, not sure why you have Steam. Simple, and basic is what a lot of people would describe the look and feel of CS to be.  If you havent played HL original it make look a little stupid, but the game is still great inside. Original cannot get more original here  when talking about the base game ideas.  Great for people with low end comps and internet like Link Freeman and his dial up. This game was made a while back so keep that in mind!  7/10
e best porn game 
unterStrike 1.6 NEVER DIE ! The base of CS . Go play it is very fun !

 you didnt play Zombie Plague Mod then kys pls.
eat Classic,still popular
COMMENDED JUST FOR NOSTALGIA, besides that, NOT RECOMMENDED!  Its the father to the modern Counter Strikes and FPS in general. Thats a fact, but that doesnt mean you should play this. We have CSGO now, it would be ridiculous to pick up a old, outdated and dying game like CS 1.6. Those who play it do so cause theyve been doing it for 15+ years, but no new players arrI have and it is too much blocky graphically to be even considered for purchase these days.  Great game, but too old/outdated and dying. Dont recommend, unless youre here to get some nostalgia from the old days. I still gI have it thumbs up cause its still a GREAT game and we cannot publish a analysis thinking on the time we are but on the time the game was made, to compare it to its days instead of current days
en your potato cannot even run cssource. 10/10
 1.6 is still better than CSGO
st FPS game of all time. Its a shame only a few people still play it.
st game of its generation!
unter Strike Is Best Game In The World*
ally Good Grapic XD More Than Csgo hahahaha SWFX
d graphic good playa everything you need to lost your school average 
Old but good game!

st favourite game of my childhood 3
 a CS fan I do like tis game. But I dont have that madness to the game as many other do. That could be because I grew up with CSS. So I feel like you guys do, just not to the same game. But I mean this game was the start of the cs history so this game needs love! 3
∞‚ú∞‚ú∞
e game of my childhood.
st multiplayer shooter ever 
is is my favorite game .
unter Stricke 1.6 is a great game.! Recommends all players! Counter Stricke is an action game. If you play for a clan you have a lot to think about stack areas. Enjoy these in it.! GG &amp HL
is is real good game!!!!!!
assics
unterStrike was one of the first video games I have ever played and will always be up there in my list of favorite games.  I had just installed it. It was my first multiplayer game and I though Im too new to play against players so I played only with bots slowly progressing from easy to to the hard ones. Then one day I joined a Dust II DM server. It was chaotic, but fun. I didnt even know the map then, but I learned it by playing lots of DM. I slowly climbed the integrated server ranks and made friends with one of the admins...then after a while the server disappeared.  After that I found out about deathrun. I was horrible at it, but the regulars helped me and I started visiting the server more and more. Apparently the same server chain had a gun game server too. Now that was amazing. Completely different people played there, but again friendly ones. After a couple of months the server chain was shut down...  I continued playing aim, awp, jailbreak and other mods. I didnt even play the classic mode, it wasnt of that big interest to me, though after a couple of months I stopped playing CS.  I cannot not recommend this game, because I have so many memories from it. Nostalgia.
is game ruined my life. Its an awesome title! I never knew a game 14 years old would be so good and still, its actI have in the community! Thats really nice! This game is a huge hit in the market and still there are lots of buyers.   It is a little thought for a guy like me who just plays non fps games.  But still, it is really interesting and amazing to play with friends and online too!
is game sucks.
ce Multiplayer game
s cs1.6 and your on Steam, if you dont have this then please follow these steps  1. Uninstall Steam. 2. Kill yourself.

ST GAME !
ined My LIFE P 
is was my time This is a legendary game of all time ...
ppy Birtday 17 Years....Old but Gold
is is a great game, I have no problems with this game and it is fun and addictI have. Also this is my favourite game and even tho it may be hard at first it is still constanlty fun D
ol and classic.who love this oldschool game.you can try!
ite possibly the purest form of First Person Shooter, only rivaled by Quake. In my opinion, it is undoubtedly the best game out of the CounterStrike series.  Only downside with this game, is that it has already had its primetime.
d, but gold! 9.5/10
remember being a younger kid, I had a brother take me out and walk for about 30 minutes to a gaming cafe where they have this game being played 90percent of all computers. Playing this for the first time as a kid, I felt it was so realistic lol. It was like being in a new world, basically. We came back to gaming cafe every once a while whenever we can afford it. One time, my dad came home early and we were not home, lol. Somehow, he figured out where we were at! Good times good times! This is one of few games that made my childhood memories.
 matter what they do to newer versions of the game, this will be the best one.
st hours I spent in my life arguably _, even after so many years Im still learning... Thats ok because thats what make Counter Srike trully special, the learning curve is so steep that youll never get bored, if youre up for the challenge of course... This game is the true tactical FPS multiplayer, many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what CS 1.6 did and fail terribly.  1.6 needs more love from valve, it was one of the games that made steam a thing, hell, back in the day it was the ONLY game to bring loyal users to the platform, the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance, to be completely honest we all hated steam, it was a broken nightmare.  Valve could show some love for their baby... adding trading cards, bgs and emos or even skins would be a great start... one call only dream..   tldr Steam was very broken and the 1.6 playerbase kept it going, valve should recognize that.
at is there to say, this game started the insane multiplayer fps mania. If you are interested in custom modes zombie mode, deathrun, bunnyhop or just want to check out the roots of this amazing series of games, you ought to gI have this one a shot, but if all you care about is dust2 24/7, you should get CSSource or Case Opening Sim.   9/10
 1.6 NEVER DIE

ill better then COD.
s ok
en you play cs go always remember where you started! 
en playing CS since 2003. Despite what the box on tactical ops says no really its not better than counter strike. CS is the best first person shooter in my opinion. The reason 1.6 is better than GO or Source is because its about player skill not graphics. The hit boxes are much better. In order to be a great player you need to know how to execute movement even bunny hop.   Best game ever.
d but good D D
ry much better tha csgo AND YOU KNOW
really like the game, but I couldn‚Äôt find the stupid cake.
 matter how many new versions of counter strike are yet to come, CS 1.6 is the best gameplay ever whatsoever it may be.

is game tell me, Graphic doesnt matter
s a perfect game for learning precision in shooting games! i recommend it P

e BeST oF The Best /D
is is my opinion your experience may vary  counter strike a name that almost anyone will recognize. Before I played counter strike I knew that it was a game loved by thousands even millions and that people play it every day.  =The Graphics=  this games graphics are good IMO and it may not look to good by todays standards, they hold up just fine.  =The Gameplay=  The gameplay in Counter Strike involves starting out with some money to buy equipment, you earn more mony by killing members on the opposing team rescuing hostages, deactivating bombs, or plant and explode the bomb, also 1 life per round so work together.  =My Verdict=  I love this game the people who play it are pretty cool most of the time and the game can really suck you in and $10 may be kinda steep in for a game this old but it comes with  Counter Strike Counter Strike Condition Zero Counter Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes  wich all come in the $10 asking price and I would gI have this game a 9/10
is game will always be the best out of all the cs
d, shit, just how everyone likes it. Its perfect.
is is probably the game that set the foundation for Steam. This game has aged quite well, with its balance of original team based strategy and maps like de_dust 2 are legendary. This is without a doubt one of the greatest computer games of all time!

is game is a prime example of how a great game tends to pass the test of time. Although the graphics are very outdated graphics arent everything, the gameplay is good enough that the game is consistently on player number charts even after 15 years the original mod was released.  BE CAREFUL There are a lot of FAKE servers out there. Be sure not to click on those.
st game ever. The joy it gI haves when playing with friends is unbelievable .
 is a fantastic FPS game. I am just in love with this game, the graphics may be not the best but for my opinion is the best FPS game.

at can I say? My teenage years were in a large part defined by this game pity about those hundreds of hours disappearing from record. This game is the reason I made a Steam account to begin with. This game made me love online gaming even if its a tough, oneway love. One of the first breakout esports alongside Starcraft and a significannot influence on the FPS genre. A piece of gaming history. Play it if only for that, and see for yourself.
 be honest, the only things that needs fix is the flash. I highly reccommend this game! THIS GAME IS AWESOME

t much to say, really. The pinnacle of firstperson shooters, that still manages to lI have on today. The community is not what it was, lets say, 10 years ago. However, this game still manages to be an enjoyable experience for anyone wanting a good old wholesome firstperson shooter experience. Highly recommended, though if you havent bought it until now, dont buy it, due to the lack of support from players, and the high difficulty of the online play.
HH this is best game number 1 in a world!
st Game for ever   This game will never suck  and will never be an outdated game

st.FPS.Ever. You may have noticed I have very little hours, that is because, as a young duck, I used to play this game 24/7 at cybercafes vs randoms who played it, basically a LAN there, brings tears to my eyes the experiences I shared with this game and the people at that 1 cybercafe _.

e legend of func_vehicle is eternal, all bless Nipper, mapper of ages.
e of the best classicFPS available. It is unique and makes so much fun. It is a quiet old game, but is recommended for every FPS lover and for everyone with wooden PC.
arted at the very beginning to play counter strike at 1.3 and since then it was my favorite online FPS game. Played it very long and have to say since than it was and still is perfect. Sad but its old, and lost its support. Still coming back to remember everything. But now spending time on CSGO.. If you have an older machine i recommend it to play, cause there are still many servers, and game mods actI have!
oD Game  Add Me  I abderahmane Lahroud I from Morocco
esome game been playing for years
still think this is the best version of any of the CounterStrikes out there, and its been a decade since it came out.  Yeah, its lacking graphics compared to the newer ones running newer versions of the engine. So what? Just got back on it recently and Im realizing how much I have missed it.
u cannot go wrong with counterstrike
ckers ruin the game, but its still fun af.
 will remain one of the best games in history of CS  Pitty steam cannot track hours from back in the day.
Truely Great classic FPS
d school out of time ^_^
esome game, you can get easily addicted to it.
rd as f***. Got destroyed by 12 year old korean children.  
great FPS game for people without a good PC configuration 
aying the original  kinda, after the modplay anyway  CS game in 2015 has a certain nostalgia factor, bringing back fun  &amp sometimes bleh  memories for those who played and supported it during infancy. 15 years ago, I couldnt have imagined CounterStrike becoming the competitive have FPSgaming standard that it is today, especially with its latest leap into CSGO. Global Offensive have, even while taking changes as they come, is the new favorite goose Carrying the Law of Newer, Faster, Bolder But even there, the core CS spirit &amp experience is true. And always slowly evolving...   Its good to look back at how far this franchise has come, as even with each controversial change or update, I know each decision is calculated with the desire to keep moving forward While  hopefully  staying as true to its core as possible.   LONG LI have COUNTERSTRIKE.  &amp LONG LI have DIXIE MAFIA.

lfLife CounterStrike contains all the elements of the popular online multiplayer game originally built as an addon for HalfLife. The teambased gameplay divides you into terrorist or antiterrorist squads. Each team has access to different realworld ammunition and equipment, and all players have unique attributes plus the ability to upgrade their gear after completing missions. Can you do it?
od game, most popular!
uld hack again.

 r8 revolver, 10/10 will play again.
esome game !!!!!!!! i have many memories related to this game . No words for this game really.
 you love the CSGO and want to see what CS is like you will love this game. The gameplay is good. The 2 things that suck about the game is the people that play in 5v5 servers dont speak english and I get kicked not knowing why. And the spray patterns dont have 1 specific pattern to each gun, after the first 5 bullets there are 12 different patterns the bullets can go
+++++
is will be more of a my experience with this game type of review, because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something I have experienced with CounterStrike. Here you go  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friends house and he was playing a game. I didnt know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friends house. When I saw the CounterStrike logo I was filled with gamegasm ? and I was so happy. I dont remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. CounterStrike is my first game which I played competitive havely and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitive havely made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like CounterStrike are the ones that lI have to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple  defend as a CounterTerrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of CounterStrike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I have lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I have played with years ago. I think CounterStrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today, if this game wouldnt exist.  I am sure many of people already have played games like CSGO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CSGO and modern games.  I am glad that I lI haved through the golden era of shooters and if Id have to rate it, itd 10/10 ofcourse,
ts my first game i`m play with nonsteam 500Hours !
d cool game 
is isnt a bad game. I played this game when i was young and learned playing this game with friends.

I played cs 1.6 downloaded from browser,i wasnt steam on,and i regret that. But i bought this game i soon as I have decided to be steam on and now im playing more serious and i know much more about this game  10/10 BEST GAME EVER

lfLife Counterstrike has redefined online play. This game has more potential and more online gaming goodness than any other game I have ever played. Finding good servers is always a concern when it comes to online play. As perhaps the most popular multiplayer game in town, CS features literally thousands of servers at any one time. Youll almost always find guys to play with.

IS GAME RUINED MY LIFE!
] +
rst online game ever that i loved!
is game is perfect i suport this , i love this i hope never to die this game D
od old times when i played this game for the first time. I had 5 years old when i tried this game for the first time. As you know, this game is a modification of HalfLife by developers and its a multiplayer firstperson shooter. You dont have iron sight how you have in CoD or other shooter games + you need to know the weapons because they dont shoot where is the aim. Its hard to explain, but this game has so many modes and is awesome because if you buy this game, you will receI have CounterStrike Condition Zero and Condition Zero Deleted Scenes for FREE. You can play a normal shooter games with instant respawn or without it, but you can also play deathrun, surf, bhop, gun game, zombies and so on.  Pros +The multiplayer is great +The sound is good +The graphics are very good for that year +So many play styles +So many maps +The gameplay is hard but great  Cons Hackers Players who will destroy your game Kids VIP Servers who will OBLIGATE you to enter on their servers  This game reminded me how was the life when i was younger, so many hours in the front of PC, how i played it with friends and at school, how i shit‚ô•‚ô• off for the first time in a game and so on. 10/10
classic which is still very much alI have!
s A superb game doesnt lags normally via steam i recommend to hav more plugins in this defaut game
unterStrike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of CounterStrike‚Äôs wretched shit‚ô•‚ô• to become the man I am today. And, now, I‚Äôm tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 530 AM, but then I started getting up at 430 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept! It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design which didn‚Äôt go very far. It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.  Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it‚Äôs time to gI have the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive have, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that CounterStrike remains an addictI have and rewarding competitive have shooter like no other.  In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 530 AM, but then I started getting up at 430 just to get a couple rounds in before class.

ats a BIG DONGER RIGHT THERE MMMMMMM YEAH BOY
went from CSGO to this after 1K Hours on CSGO and I still think this game is gorgeous. Im really sad that I started to play 1.6 just now, and also that I missed the 1.6 golden era. Even if the physics and almost everything else is really different and strange I find it more relaxing to play but at the same time harder then GO. A lot of players dont even know about this game, but people listen me! If you love CS in general you have to play this game at least once and please dont crack it...youll find only russians on that versions and everybody knows how they play at CS 
od game, would recommend
dont think I have enough ingame hours to review this.

vantages a good idea, an opportunity to play on a network Disadvantages poor performance, graphics, textures, defects. Collection of my reviews on video games continues. Today we will speak about the most famous firstperson shooter CounterStrike.  Igrushechki this appeared quite a long time, already in the year 2000 and won the gamers. Then all these shooters were a novelty, and of course all like this game. I knew about it a long time, I heard enthusiastic talks about it, heard the word bots, contra, headshot of, ks. And what is it, I managed to learn fI have or six years ago. Games then I was not tempted, but even then I have appreciated this game for three and a minus. Why? Ill explain later. Now the whole of the game. Created her notorious guys with the short name Valve. About Valves I will say this all of their games on the subject stopped fantasy and halfreal. And this game belongs to the second category.  So, the creators of the idea is quite tempting. Confrontation of the law against terrorists. They gave the game the proud name of CounterStrike, ie counterattack, but thats just shock, as such, no intrigue in this game. And that is? There are running with a gun, a gun, a knife. Oh yes, there is another grenade use 0. And you can take the shield not a bad thing. We can play for the special forces which I did and terror very few people want. Most probably the main thing here is that we can play a bot that is, our friends runs the computer, the computer runs our enemies, but we can play and through the network, where all have real people. Play over the Internet more interesting, but still stupid.  I do not want to talk about any reality or fiction, but all I will say. I have not seen, not in movies, not in life, to special forces, and the terrorists jumped as the hare, climbed the stairs, as if running on the ground. And finally, it is that even the slightest preparation is absent, the men can not hit no shield, no weapons, no arms / legs. The hostages, but here too there are, behave calmly, stand, no one is afraid of fear or cry.  So, I criticized a little, and now tell you about the features. Game modes are different, rescuing hostages, rescue VIPa, defusing a bomb, knife, grenade. A quest we gI have money, we buy ourselves, that it is necessary, for example, body armor a rare case when it is not worn in advance on fighter in reality. On the job, we allocated time, which is usually enough. Each of the men says that he wants and commands that it is possible to gI have no one is listening. By the way, there you can sprinkle a logo that can be selected in advance. Beauty is not gaining.

mme teach you about the CounterStrike family history CounterStrike 1.6 was the eldest son. As he grew up, people came to love him as a goodhearted, generous man that was perfect in every way. As he grew older and older, the public came to appreciate the work he put in for everybody else and he soon became a household name. Him and his followers became very eccentric and stuck to the old ways. CounterStrike Source was the middle child. Everybody expected him to follow in his brothers footsteps but somewhere he went wrong. CSS was a damn sight nicer than 1.6 and he was still loved by many but never achieved as much as his elder brother did, always in his shadow. CounterStrike Global Offensive have was the youngest child. CSGO was the child that Gooseman and Cliffe became ashamed of. They tried to hide the fact that CSGO was completely shiting autistic but eventually it seeped out and now masses have come to love him, even though 1.6 is the best.
en after 15 years this is in top ten most played games on the planet. GG Valve.
e best FPS game of all generations
st Game Ever gotta go fast russians

e Game itself might not have the best graphics a game could have now days but people still continue to play this game to this day because of how much fun it is. Online has a ton of game modes you can play including Kz,bhop,HnS,surf and casual along with many more.

 good game, here, in CS 1.6 being a CS legend is so easy! You only have to play this game and have like 10h on record  thats all!
 was ok
unterstrike 1.6 is one of the best competitive have FPS game to this day even after the release of CSGO it maintains a good community which is quite well populated still bearing in mind this game came out in 1999.  10/10   P.S Alot of veteran players still play this game so you will get smashed, but bear with it.
is game looks like potato. This game runs on potato.  10/10

en its like 15 years old or more , it still leads the way for us , maybe not on classic modes , but for custom gamemodes its ... the perfect game , so many different ways to script plugins , ideas that attract people ... It may be underrated due to newer versions of CS , but as I said , you cannot get the same , great and satisfying result in modding the game as in CS 1.6 . A great job , since 2000 
is game is reccomended for cheap or crappy pcs!  Are you a random guy who is just looking for a game that dosent lag, realy fast and great? You are in heaven right now boi! Counter strike is a great, fun and cool game that is great for competitive have! If you get counter strike, you get counter strike condition zero for free!! Thats right! FREE!! Despite the fact that the official servers have been shut down, you will have never ending fun and i may not be valve, but this is what an ad should be like.  BTW 100percent reccomended.
ill better love story than twilight 11/10
d gaem plei dis evriy day after shoul bud meni chets
is will be more of a my experience with this game type of review, because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something I have experienced with CounterStrike. Here you go  I remember back in 2010 I was at a friends house and he was playing a game. I didnt know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didnt have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friends house. When I saw the CounterStrike logo I was filled with gamegasm ? and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. CounterStrike is my first game which I played competitive havely and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitive havely made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current esport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like CounterStrike are the ones that lI have to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple  defend as a CounterTerrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of CounterStrike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I have lost since 2012. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I have played with years ago. I think CounterStrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today, if this game wouldnt exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CSGO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CSGO and modern games. Its harder though.
e of the best FPSs of all time.  10/10 would play again.
e best egoshooter ever
e best version of CounterStrike!
rds cannot explain how great this game is. Upon the release of HalfLife, I was privileged enough to have this game as well as Team Fortress Classic come included with the game. I played both A LOT more then I did with HalfLife which I felt no need in playing again after beating it and the multiplayer left a lot to be desired. TFC brought me many great years of fun but like so many great games in the past, it just mysteriously died out and now I am anticipating the release of TFC2 next year. CounterStrike, however, still has yet to die. Infact, it is a still ever growing community and easily the most popularly played FPS out today and still will be for quite some time, at least till CS 1.7 is released if ever. I began playing this amazing game from the day the much anticipated HalfLife was released and havent stopped since. I was what you would call a *pubmaster* for several years where Id just walk into a pub and have fun pwning noobs but for pure enjoyment. The following years, a friend and I got into competitive have play and joined CALeague. The rest, I guess you can say is history. I have played many seasons of CAL and yes, I have been out of CALO for several seasons only played open for two seasons.  All in all, this game is still easily the best FPS out there even after 7 years. Pick it up, and you wont be disappointed. Do not be fooled about CS Source, thinking it is better or that it is the future of CounterStrike simply because it is newer. Its a really, really bad game.
Classic Counter Strike Game That You Will Have So So So Much Fun Playing It With Friends I Really Recommend Buying It If You Have A Weak PC And Looking For Real Fun .
ry nice game =
 many years and still the game is alI have 
just bought it recently in steam But I have been playing it since my childhood It was my first FPS Game  simply... THE BEST 10/10 3 XOXO
ll yeah
ce gamer 
loved this game. Everytime i see old videos of it, brings back good memories. Got few friendship for a life, so much experience. I still love to play a little bit with this game, but only with my old friends. Masterpiece.
its tight. 10/10
d but gold 3
 russians to delete my last brain cells
Bad graphics.
ney in my mind
 least the sounds are still the same on this game after 17 years
/10 good throwback
IS IS GOOD GAMEEE !! 
thinks its best to say this. Theres still 16k people playing a day. That has been said enough. Buy this game now  at least no russians ·ë¥ Ãø·é≤ Ãø·ë∑
ayed more than 2000 hours, still not getting bored from it.
d is Gold
have 1.6 hours recorded of this game.  i can never play it again
 1.6 is love, cs 1.6 is life.
od game cs 1.6 but steam make back cs beta V1.4  and make new maps beta maps and skins Beacuse the betamaps so good for cs go and cs 1.6  I just like this game but the maps are not fun make more plz  I thinks its good idia.
is game is juste, simply, clearly perfect, no game could ever get any close to it, i have CSGO and yet i enjoy a lot more cs 1.6 then CSGO  good points  a classic but amazing gameplay suited for thousands and thousands of fun playing  a load of modifications and moded servers with a multitude of skins for best looking game possible like Zm mod,ZE or BaseBuilder....  low requirements for it, but yet it allows to play with soooo many people on internet on many servers, as anybody could run this game  very amazing low download size making it pretty much portable 400~Mb of download is still much less then other games  and ofc, the nice spent hours with friends killing each others as well as working together RIP to old friendships broken by this game too P  dI haversity of communities to enjoy a sociable envirement and getting new friends Bad points  graphisme are not good for those who are getting used to nowadays games some people might overcome this point by simply loving the simplicity of the game  presence of annoying cheaters on servers and the small management of such problems  no single player mode and even if you fight bots, its not fun.  i think thats all for my review, I have been playing this game for like 4 years now and i still freaking enjoy it and i really recommand it to anyone with powerfull and low pc, it creates unbreakable friendship relations v
ll i dont own the game and i can still review it so there valve i review it
love this game.  All of my teammates always say nice things about me. They never tell me they slept with my mom. And the best part about my teammates is that if I get bored of them, I can reroll new friends and even gI have them cute names. I can even convince the other team to only use knI haves while I mow them down with machinegun fire. My teammates even protect me and use their body as bullet fodder. And if I get mad? I just type something in the screen and they all die for me so I can win.  Its the happiest and friendliest game on earth.
love this game its a wenderfull
en over 15 years and its still alI have. Never tired of playing it. Original gameplay has been great already and now with mods created by players. CS never dies, it respawns.

ined my life 
 Fovourite Game
This is Amazing Game I Love It I am Playing Since 2009 
eres been a lot said about this game already, so...Ill say some more anyway, both about this entry and about the entire series.  CounterStrike was created as a modification for  HalfLife  and quickly took on a life of its own, eventually meriting a standalone release by Valve. Its development process more or less invented the concept of the public beta. At one point around its public release, Internet traffic for the original surpassed the entire traffic output of Italy. The game itself across all its iterations can be described as easy to learn yet hard to master, like so many good games. Unlike chess and  go  however, CS primarily revolves around shooting people.  On the surface, its simple. Counterterrorists must stop terrorists from planting a bomb at a strategic location, or rescue hostages that the terrorists are holding. Theres a handful of other modes included with the original, but theyre almost never played. Players earn money over each round more for winning and killing to purchase more suitable guns and equipment.  In practice, rounds can sometimes end with one team being killed before any objectI haves can be seen to. Apart from a couple of series quirks that people have learned to love  or exploit, if theyre Actual Pro Gamerstm  CS is pretty realistic. One shot, one kill and all of that. No real story either, either explicit or in subtext.   One thing CS has going for it that I havent seen mentioned much is that you can play in bitesized chunks if you want to. As far as I know, the reasons for it not being mentioned much are that the latest game  Global Offensive have  has a competitive have mode that encourages playing for entire matches, and that more dedicated players will often play for hours. Strictly speaking, I recommend playing in chunks CS can get tense and difficult depending on your skill and the skill of your opposition.  However, the pacing is such that its not exactly the hyperactI have bulletfest most of todays shooters are matches can end up as deadly games of cat and mouse as often as they erupt into firefights. Related is the fact that there is no prestige apart from matchmaking rankings in Global Offensive have or killstreaks or what have you for players to literally level the playing field with. It can be frustrating to miss an opponents head by a hair only for them to not miss in turn, or to be oneshotted out of the blue, but its reassuring to know that skill is the primary factor here.  Another interesting thing is the individualism you usually see on display. Most players, especially Real Pro Gamerstm, place a high emphasis on very skilled aiming, but a wellcoordinated team that knows how to position themselves on a gI haven map will generally have a big advantage against a team of lone wolf headshotters. CS doesnt exactly encourage team play or punish a lack of it like  Insurgency , but I will. Encourage it, not punish the lack of it. Much.   This particular entry in the series still holds up its aesthetic is more classic than dated, and you get the nofrills base gameplay that made the series what it is. If youre looking to get into the series I would still recommend  Source  or the cheaper, more modern albeit probably more toxic Global Offensive have over this, but thats more a matter of preference and polish.  The main advantage this first entry has over the rest of its series is that you can play it on pretty much any computer these days, although Source is only a  little  more punishing on todays computers. Theres a fair amount of mediocre if somewhat classic maps and no default bot support, but unlike the beautified expansionslashsequel  Condition Zero , youll still find a lot of people in multiplayer even more than in Source!  Please avoid CounterStrike Nexon Zombies though. It may be based off this game, but it is bad.
unterStrike is the mainstay of competitive have shooters, with the kind of prestige the likes of Call of Duty strI haves so hard to achieve. A number of gameplay modes ranging from what used to be the highly popular VIP to the traditional hostage and bomb maps, to eventually leading directly to two nowreleased sequels and one upcoming release leaves plenty to keep one busy.  Remember your roots.  With simple designs to keep things tight and easy to practice yet nearly impossible to master, CounterStrike proves that a good shooter can stay in the forefront for over a decade.
e birth of school shooters
classic is a classic. Long lI have 1.6.
st game I have ever played in my life.
e best game made to date  No mechanics alike insanely amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
beit being over a decade old, its still an amazing game. I have played it both non steam and on steam, making total number of hours played well over 1500 Counter Strike 1.6 does not come with built in game mode like deathmatch. Hence servers employ  amxmodx  [amxmodx.org]  to create new game modes and modify game experience of existing ones. Some of game modes that I came across are  ¬ª   Deathmatch 
ve this wonderful game, its also my first game on steam and still its my favourite.

ally worth buying it if you have some friends to play it with. Doesnt matter how many years have passed, you can always put togheter your old buddies to play some Counter Strike 1.6
is game is a timeless classic. Its one of the perfect FPS that will ever be made. The movement, wall spamming, hitboxes, and map choices are what make this game the best. I have been playing this game since around 2003. Have played tournaments, been an admin for many clans, and strat caller for matches. This game takes serious skill to get good at. There is a huge learning curve, and thats what seperates this from other games, and noobs and pros. The people who will get good at this game, are the ones who put the time and effort to learn everything. While the game can be a pick up and play game. Expect your fuck to get handed to you, as veterans of the game still heavily play this, and theyll out shoot you 9/10 times. I have been called a cheater countless times in this game, and it all comes from me playing this day and night as a child, and my skills has also transferred into other FPS games. If you get good at CS, youll more than likely be very good at other FPS games like Over Watch, CoD, 007, etc. Thats why I nominate this game for, The ‚ÄúTest of Time‚Äù Award. My friends think Im dumb for playing a game developed in the 90s, but theres a reason for it. As I said, this game is the perfect FPS. Its a game I will play until I die. I can buy any new game on the market, and Ill be returning to this game shortly after. Take it from someone who has invested a lot of time in this game to get good. Its going to seem scary at first, as you will get rekt. But you will develop friends from within the various communities, and you will get better over time. And this skill set will make you better at other FPS games. CS 1.6 forever!
love this game, this is the best game i have ever played!
e game that started it all..
Simple Lan+Mutltiplayer game

The thing why we all love this game and we all feel the urge to say this is the most fav game is that once this game starts , the human element takes over and we actually game with our friends  and strangers and thats what gI haves us the enjoyment the feel of competitive haveness and who is the best  to be in awe of some good player and the list goes on . The game itself is not great but the way in which it just lets the human element takes over and be the silent spectator as we enjoy and have a good time , just speaks volumes of the greatness of this game ! The game is like a silent Guardian which governs us as we enjoy our life in the 1.6 way ! GG
is game is a proof that games do not need to have good graphics for it to be fun &amp addictI have. Its one of the games which gI haves you the oppurtunity to go online &amp have fun with your friends D
is game makes my chizzle wizzle

esome Life Time Game..
is game sooo awesome!!!!!
lea
ill the best counter strike ever
fantastic game that improves your fluency in the foreign languages. Every server you visit has the charming alure of Mexicans and Brazillians an honorable bunch of players who praise your skills with phrases such as filho da shit!!!!!!, xiter!!! and jajajajaja. They are also very skilled players ingame I often see a single player moving at the speed of sound, headshotting everyone in a blink of an eye, and getting all the praise from his fellow brethren, usually in the form of xiter fdp!!!. Overall, I recommend this game to all individuals seeking to have a fun, nonhacker, nonenglish gameplay experience.
tter than Source or even Global Offensive have. Traditional old game that comes from another awesome game, HalfLife. You can not end your gamers life without playing CS.
is is the Best Game i ever played in my life

st ever shooting game played in my life i 3 with this game.....
s a great game, best for good
 my opinion, CS is the single greatest firstperson shooter ever created. Complex, addictI have, challenging, intense, precise, and infinitely replayable, CS was the defining game for an entire generation of gamers. But be warned, this game is absolutely brutal if you are new to shooters.
od action game D
e best shooter,period.No game will ever come close to this one.Love it!
unterStrike is a firstperson shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counterterrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objectI have and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.

en it boils down to competitive have long lasting First Person Shooters, Counterstrike 1.6 is king. The unique money system on a two team map design is what puts Counterstrike apart from other Run and Gun FPSs. Many custom maps and mods are available, while still boasting a steady player base even 15 years after release.
ll spent money!!
st competitive have FPS ever. Still fun to play even now with multiple other versions of CS out.

uely a game which signifies the value of Old is Gold.... This shows that Graphics doesnt matter but Gameplay does.... The Parent of First Person Shooting Multiplayer... Even though its been more than a decade since its release but Its still one of the most favoured online games in the world. A must play for any diehard First Person Shooter lover.
e of the best older Games.  Thumbs up for Valve!!!
ch an addictI have game! y
E BEST AS ALWAYS! D
e Best Game Ever !
beacon of online gaming, that despite being a dated title, so many players come back to it because of the well defined game mechanic. Theres no great depth of content, just a simple yet enjoyable platform for team deathmatch with map objectI haves thrown in. Years ago I spent atleast 1,000 enjoyable hours playing it.
ve everything about this game 3
 old cs 1.6 game that almost every gamer played.
t the first fps i played, but one of the big ones. Anyone new to CS can go and play the orginal and see how much its changed. Dont forget to crouch when shooting on this one.
me cool
y needed to kill this game? it was and will be the best fps shooter ever, feel like CSGO just a shit ...   i think the worst idea ever is the promod delete, thats a greatest game than Global    Im playing since 15 years, had 30+ lan event in Hungary, and i think just should have to use global achievement, LOUNGE skins,trading,betting,etc.. and matchmaking functions, we have been a great geam what every counter player like, and want to play in any event...   the real counter strike will never die! and original half life engine is the best ever!
st of the best 
ved this game for years!!!
eat game, best FPS of all time.
have played over 2.000 hours of this game and I really gotta say I love it. CounterStrike has always been one of my favorite games to play, and the only thing is that the graphics are outdated, but that comes with playing an old game. competitive have playing is the best here. You really get to build up some teamwork and make some strategies to win games.  I can totally recommend it 9/10
e best game ever $

have played this game off and on for the last 15 years, and it is still easily one of my favorite games of all time.
ran out of spawn in a map called de_dust 2 running for b bombsite and got awped in the head, 1337/10 would run again.
unterStrike modifies the multiplayer aspects of HalfLife to bring to it a more teamoriented gameplay . CounterStrike provides the player with an experience that a trained counterterrorist unit or terrorist unit experiences .

a awesome game 3
unterStrike destroyed my life. I had been playing HL deathmatch, and was waiting for team fortress 2 some of those early TF2 screens are still etched in my brain I came across a new mod called CounterStrike, it had just been released, Beta 1 there were only 3 maps I think and the player models were so similar that in the darkend corridors of Mansion you couldnt see who was what, so there was team killing galore, even a console command for extra money, but it was awesome, Id never played anything like it. So I played it. ALLOT. Id come in from college stick it on and play untill I was ready for bed, screw school work I had people to shoot in the face! Anyway I failed my Alevels and got stuck with crappy jobs, but looking back, it could possibly have been worth it, because damn I had fun! I dont know what its like nowadays, I did get fed up with the bunnyhopping AWP gits and from what I gather that is the way the game went, but this was it, where it started for me, and if you havent played it once then you should just so you know where all your call of duty and all that balls came from.
eat Game 3
unterstrike1.0  1.6 not source is one of the greatest esport fps gamesif not the greatest in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does...D
eat game. registry is awesome.
unterStrike is a firstperson shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counterterrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objectI have and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectI haves vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones  Bomb Maps The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counterterrorists before it explodes to win. The counterterrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage Maps The counterterrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP Maps One of the counterterrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.
 far the best FPS game ever!

e of the best games, not to even mention first person shooter games, of all time. After 16 years or so since its release its still got an avid actI have following. Speaks volumes for its addictI haveness and replayability.
od game mother shiter
ter all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that cannot be ignored. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive have gaming so popular.
st first person shooter to ever surface on to a PC or console. Counter Strike 1.6 is an old game but still very popular amongst PC gamers everywhere in the world. There are many clans and communities that still support this game, so its not hard to find a group of friends that enjoy playing. You can find various moded servers that include Warcarft  Call Of Duty Moder Warfare  Zombies, American Football, Prop Hunt, Paint Ball and many more!
e game where walls are made of cardboard and are penetrable by everything except knI haves, and grenades are bigger than a seedless watermelon.  10/10 would recommend to play with FODDER and I and completely and utterly find the game unenjoyable after being constantly wallbanged.
6 is the best game of all time.

ally Good Game!
e of the best games
er a decade later and this game is still the mostplayed game on Steam and for good reason solid gameplay, controls, usergenerated maps and mods the list goes on.   This FPS personally serves as a model of comparison whenever I play any other firstperson games.
st game known to mankind. No enhanced engine captures the reality of this original. 1.5 was even better. Per. Headshot boxes have NEVER been the same and since VAC I miss seeing the cheaters getting caught RedHanded and added to the International blacklist. I still keep a black book of every IP at the scene of any crimes. If you want to experience the original AWP trying playing OP4. Shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! If you are still mad that they Cliff and whoever took the silencer off the Colt I got the SOB back. Visit  ANTPLA.NET  to get skin pack II. Original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as General Sphinx Brothers of Steel BOS skin pack. I was there playing UKs Ganstawars Last Man Standing Gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get CS skins on Gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. Sort of like a prank. If you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a Luke Skywalker bad a$$. Skin pack II has the Starwars lightsaber replacement for knife and the AK to plasma rifle from 1980s movie Alien. The skins out compete CSGO any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. I got a duocore up to 1200fps. Well I should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [AU] DeathWish settled it when it got to CS with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. My first game was CS Canyon_Siege and I was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. I am not the Prodigy Inc SPHINX. I have only made autoadmin called 3 forms of punishment. It was for Admin Mod then rewritten for AMX. Lost. No need for it anymore anyway. People still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. GI have them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. Essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buZz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. Talking crap about admin was a slaying. Lag was a slap. It was based off Trinity and the server was the spirit. If trash talk is about the spirit, that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. That resolved major breach of security. Suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. Most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plugins such as STATSME.
 was the best game ever made before valve shit it up!!!And yes i still hardly recommend this hardcore shooter!
EASE HELP ME I FAILED WHEN I WAS MAKING MY GRAPHICS IN MY COUNTER STRIKE 1.6 I CANY SEE ANYTHING AND I cannot MAKE IT RIGHT I REINSTALLED IT AGAIN BUT IT DIDINT WORK SO PLEASE GOVE ME CHOISE I HAD SUCH FAIL AT PAST AND WHEN I CHANGED WINDOOWS AFTERWARDS THERE WASNT SUCH PROBLEM SO PLEASE GI have ME CHOISE ABOUT IT 
unterStrike...  This game is the reason to why I got a Steam account in the first place. I got this game six years ago from a near friend of mine. Everytime I was at his place we used to play this together in turns he played for a while, maybe 23 deaths then I played. We had such a great time. But... the problem was that outside his house we couldnt play the game together.   At the time my dad didnt allow me to buy the game, so my friend ended up giving it to me as a christmas present. Since that day we played it all the time. One of our favorite servers was Eropid HS Only. He my friend ended up beeing in 45 place for a while on the server.   Overall, I have had a great time playing this game, and still enjoy playing it today. The game was the start to my FPS gaming interest and since then I have bought every CS released.  I recommed this game to anyone who wants to start play FPS games as it is a great starting game. I also recommend that you play it with your friends that way you will get the most fun out of it!   Thanks for reading, and enjoy!    nit√©  
ah, its perfect game. Old school. This game didnt have life term.

obably the best damn game ever made!
game in which you can always come back too. With CS GO and Source also being great games, CounterStrike 1.6 is always a classic in my book
w Top Games
is is the good game 
    this is best game in my life  and i love my cs
od for basic skills at CSGO.
tter than the latest and greatest cod. Would play any day.
aphics dont matter. Just play the game.

like this game! playing since i was 8! played a lot... fine graphics and other stuff.. no.1 game in fps world!!
E BEST GAME. D
me lag spikes only when I have a headshot lined up. AWP or whatever its called is one shot kill to the foot. Fire in the hole is yelled constantly. Grenades kill nothing. Everyone is Russian. I would probably love this game if It was still played by millions and I could figure out what the hell causes my frequent lag spikes. Pretty fun game though, great way to kill time. Ill be playing it more often as long as it stops lagging.  9.5/10 Would get killed by a AWP to the foot again.
e best of times and now it has passed 10/10 for years of gaming.
e only game i liked to play cool nice1 just disappoints me due to fps dropdown on flash light and smoke
is is Best Game in The world i love it and never game its before or after will be rise 
aly good
esome game . You must play!!

ol !
e and only CSgame out there
ll,what can I say about this game,that hasnt been said before? Its a classic. If youve never played it,you dont know what a FPS is. Its just an amazing game,created by amazing people. When those slow years of learning how to properly play pay off,you just travel into an another world,filled of headshots,screaming people,who dont like to lose,russians screaming at you for being a shit shit‚ô• NUB. Its just one of the greatest games ever made.
ill havent found how to buy mines or incendiary.
e better version of CSGO
unterStrike Source, CounterStrike Condition Zero and CounterStrike Global Offensive have are great games but lets not forget about the original one, the one that made them, that without it, they probably wouldnt exist or would be different, this, this game is a gem I tell you. Now, youll ask, why play this game when we have Source and Global Offensive have? The answer is simple, either for nostalgia or to see how great this game was back in the time and where it all started, of course, the game version is 1.6 so it is not the oldest version but it does not matters, there could be many reasons to play this game, It got maps that arent on Source and/or Global Offensive have, It has a riot shield even if Im not too fan of this tactical item in Multiplayer games and a different gameplay than CSGO and Source, If you think Source is hard because of the recoil, of course, its pretty similar to Source but its a little different or maybe It is just me but anyway, you will get used to it quick, Its not like it was Arma... or real life.  I would suggest it to any CounterStrike, semitactical, counter terrorists and FPS fans except for those who are COD hardcore fanboys but who knows, you may change and prefer CounterStrike to COD.  And remember this. This isnt the killing house anymore, this is real life!  9.5/10
play this game since I was like 14 years old . Teamwork game in most of the times .  Solo game if you are pro . 
classic game
started playing this game in 2008 as a boy in Sweden, everything changed from then on. I always remember all the countless hours I spent playing this game. Note i played this game on non steam and a seperate steam account. I think the total amount of hours i played was around 2000
is is the best game ever. Stands the test of time.
e legendary game ever made
assic old school game. Still worth it! One of the first and classic FPS games EVER! I highly recommend it and even after at least 15 years there is a playerbase of over 15 000 people. 10/10.
eat game, too bad its not competitive have anymore
st of the bEst
rst CounterStrike game and the best in my opinion. Everything from models, sounds, game modes, maps is terrific! I recommend this over new installments in the franchise 
is is one of the best game. The excitement to kill after getting killed is just awesome D
assic, never change 1.6. Pls. I went back for a few hours and man it felt good. I played 1.6 first when I was 6.
eatest FPS of all time.  Nothing else needs to be said.  5/5
e best game, 100percent recommended.
st First Person Game with low graphics Love it 3
e of the best multiplayer games out there.
cellent game. I have enjoyed this game for years.
ce loved it, now, full of cheaters, VAC doesnt work like it should, people uses illegal CFGs, scrolls, scripts, ducks right in front of you, you were once a great game... 10/10 would still play it if remaining players didnt turn out to be such illegal noobs.  Back in 2002 THIS WAS THE GREATEST GAME
is is the best game i have ever played in steam 
s nice game,buy it and make sure
s not a game, Its a LEGEND!!
azing game, was great in the early 2000s but sad to see it die down. At least the CSGO community has grown.

nce I grew up with CounterStrike Source, I cannot gI have a full review on how I feel about this game. But concerning that I am very into the CounterStrike series Id have to say this would be a legendary game for me if it was in my time.
s a fun game
ally enjoyed this FPS. Was the first game i played on a PC and loved every minute of it. Great for first time and more experianced players. Easy controls and have to say that the game runs very smooth. Will highly recommend it guys moving to the PC world from console as I did.
 1 of the best game in steam account
like this game .
s is a raep off of Blackops 3
ry nice game and very old school FPS D
ry Awesome Game. Sure you will be addicted to it... 
 game!
e first Counter Strike in the franchise and the community is still there and there are plenty of people who still play it and they are not toxic at all.
eat Game 
e original Counter Strike came out in 1999 and is still good. El Classico. If you can find a chance to play it, I would highly recommend it. Unlike it successors, you can feel and hit crisp shots that just arent available in latter versions of CS. 10/10 Would recommend.
like this very much,is a good game!
e birthplace of a great idea.
havent really played this much compared to CSS and CSGO as I, probably, wasnt old enough to actually start playing with the GoldSrc engine in a competitive have way when CS was super popular. I mean, now its still incredibly popular for its age, but since I am now smothered with the creations of CSS and CSGO, I will probably never play it properly.  But from what I have experienced  skateboards you can drI have! I simply recommend it due to this!  lol jk Ill edit this review soon
get sexually aroused while playing this game.
 you want sorce its all people play anymore
ce game! D
riously Luv This Game....
e best oldclassic game walls are made of paper and you can cross with any gun a doublefloored concrete but I rly rly rly rly laaik you CS1.6 
od ole CS. A definite classic and first installment to the Counter Strike series. Its worth a buy if you want to play with some Mexicans, Brazilians or Russians cause thats all that play this game now a days.
AMA
ry nice game. I play it since I was only 5 or 6 years old. 3
n play hours on the game. There are better alternatI haves but for low graphics this is a good game D P
esome game  Most fun fps game ever TRUST ME
is is the worst star wars game I have ever played. Theres no force powers, lightsabers, clones, droids, NOTHING. Its like they took out every element that would be in a star wars games. This would only be the best game if they later renamed it to counter strike or something along those lines.
am glad they only started recording playing hours in steam games when i started working full time. I have spent so many hours in this game... Only multiplayer game that I played and still play from time to time.
e Best Game ILike it
sy game for relaxation
 recommendation required D
en playing this game since it came out and I love it. I wanna take some time to thank the original developer for this exiting game.

 THE BEST
unterStrike! Awhh what can I say about this master piece? well, Its one of the best firstperson shooters that have ever been made, still today you can find tons of peeople playing online! Dont be fooled by how many ours I have got playing this game on steam, I have played since early 2004, this game is practicaly my childhood. LOL You cannot compare this game to CSGO, with modern graphics and shit, yet both of them are incredible on its way. I love the fact that you dont have scope blur when you walk, the fact that M4A1 and USP have enough bullets. Love it!   I rate it 15/10 
en after over 16 years on the video game market, Counter Strike claims thousands of followers.  Guns feel just right Maps feel just right Graphics look just right and isnt outdated at allYoungsters not accustomed to late 1990s PC graphics might disagree.  You will play CS 1.6 FOREVER. Ill probably play CS 1.6 zombie mode until the I have arthritis.
is game remembers me my childhood  Best fps ever 
Best game for all time!!
e game is so dead now, all the good servers have long since been shut down....

mparing the game to CSGO.    Pros      Variation in lighting darker rooms, along with flashlights and nightvision.    No background/ambient sounds in most maps clear sound easier to hear footsteps and gunfire.    You can wallbang most things/walls in most maps.    Buying amunition more depth in economical strategy.    MP5 nuff said    Movement is much smoother and bunnyhopping is much more consistant and fluent, you feel much heavier in csgo.    You can run the game on a toaster.    Character selection I just think its pretty awesome.    Spraying spray paint, boobs make for a great strategical distraction.    Customizing textures, maps, models ect. is great, you can mod almost anything you want, unlike in CSGO.    No marketing system skins, this one is a bit of a debate, personally Im ok with skins I have even spent money on it myself, but I prefer to mod a game rather than having to pay for a nice looking gun. Skins, simply put, are a way to milk the players money. Im thankful that CS 1.6 doesnt have this.    CS 1.6 has a classic/nostalgic feel to it, some people will like that, some people wont.    People still play the game, proving the game isnt dead yet.    There are many different and interesting modded game modes in 1.6 such as surfing, zombie, bunny hopping, jailbreak, deathmatch, gungame.     Cons      Matchmaking in CSGO is better, it is simpler and places you in a server with people around your level.    Grenade physics are awkward and hard to learn.    Viewing and casting games is much better/easier in CSGO.    Few weapons are viable in CS 1.6, mostly just the AK, M4, AWP, Deagle and MP5    Sometimes bad/terrible hit registration.    Tactical shield.    No ranking system, personally, I dont care about having a pretty symbols with a bunch of arrows and stars, or having stupid rank names like SERGEANT MASTER ELITE SHOOTER PERSON, the only reason Im putting it on this list is because ranking helps put players with other players that are about the level. In 1.6, any new player will find themselves playing against people leagues better than said player.    I did mention before that modded servers were great, but it can also be a problem, there are few classic CS 1.6 servers that arent modded, most of them being deathmatch servers with 32 players, its hard to find normal CS game modes.    Hacking is a issue in CS 1.6, worse than in CSGO. Its harder to get VAC Banned in 1.6 and there arent any features like Overwatch in CSGO, to make it easier to detect hackers.    Servers can change your bindings and send you to other servers, this isnt a big problem as there are ways around it but its still present.    The game no longer gets any updates, I know this isnt the games fault but there are still exploits and bugs in 1.6.   Some people will agree these pros and cons and some wont. Im not saying this game is necessarily better than CSGO, but it sure is a fun experience. I would definately recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games, especially people who play CSGO. The game takes a while to get used to but once you do, you will find yourself playing this game for days. I havnt played this game too much, so theres probably a lot Im missing. That concludes my review.
fe is 1, but CounterStrike is 1.6 
s a great game, join us! =

3 love it *__*
/10 Game, even If its a little bit old. xD
at is a very interesting game, a very nice shooter game.
is Game Will Never Be Bested, Still fantastic after all these years. Growing Up Playing This Game Was Amazing. The game that molded a generation. Best. Game. Ever.
at i like in this game Gunplay, good gun sounds and they gI have suitable physical impact, although animations havent aged well  Teamwork/cooperation aspect, not very complicated, no real different player classes, but obviously a sniper wont go to assault tasks with the primary weapon at least Highly customisable, skins, sounds, textures, makes this game fitting for so many different kindsa players with a relatI havely little effort  Then, things i dont like in this game Graphics, thats the only thing really, but the good thing is the simple old graphics make everything clear to see and distinguish
rd and very fun game!!
sterpeice in FPS. Old FPS game with fun gamemodes, maps and community. Unfortunately there are too many cheaters, even Steam players started to cheat. But still an alltime favorite.
CS 1.6

Valve and everyone else who made it thank you for the friendships that i created and how many hours i put it this game on my other steam i have like 4.5k hrs ,ruined my grades in school but well sweet memories. Game had a really good 12 yrs of professional scene and community ,also today its big community for fun and having a tears of an amazing time of a life.  Thats all from me i hope you all enjoyed reading this.
6!!! I have played WarZone version of it for 34 years... Steam version is totally better  You can join servers where your friends are at and even bots are good at this game D
he best of the best

 R8 11/10
ve this game. CS 1.6 3
st CS of all time, fast pace, accurate and even after all these years still fun to play! If you play any CS game I encourage you to get 1.6 so you can experience more of how it began!
ere is no better game 
is is a good game
eryone says FIRE IN THE HOLE
ough fun for you to ignore the outdated graphics!
rever the best counter strike
 the best game ever!
st CounterStrike ever created 1/1
ill an Epic game !
is game is one of the best fps games ever. Its hard but its definitely rewarding and for those who seek a casual experience in a shooter game, there is always custom gamemodes made by the community to play. Some of the best game modes is surf, bhop bunny hop, minigames and jail too. There is even more. The guns is very balanced even though an AK47 can oneshot if you hit the head, but thats hard to do.
1.6 so much good memories and still better then BF4 and CoD Ghost
is game is better than csgo.....This game only skill no skin D
at is most successful game ever produced
s old but great game for multiplayers......
would recommonend this game it is a very good game there is stratagy and teamwork
have been playing CS 1.6 since its release in 2000 and I havent stopped since, its a great game.
ank u valve for this game
me Of the Century It is.
p
llo,i have been playing this game for almost 8 years now,and as it seems,the game started to be less popular due to cheaters and hackers! I would recommend everybody to purchase this game and try it out,there is a lot of servers that use WH/AIM Blocks and are not able to cheat on the servers. Valve is banning more and more people with Valve Anti Cheat so yeah,keep up the good work Valve!
classic.
e classic. Although the graphics are an eyesore to some, they have a charm to them for me. Beyond that, I would say this about it  Pros Nice community Nice mods func_vehicle Excellent maps Great server variety Good gunplay Nostalgia Riot Shield Cons Graphics may bother some No official servers No bots No source engine This runs on goldsrc, resulting in some missing features compared to CSS or GO, both graphics and gameplay wise.
it shit‚ô• 10/10
love this game is my life
st game hai *_*
citing, fun, addictI have  CounterStrike is an awesome game, but Id recommend buying HalfLife Game of the Year Edition then simply downloading CS rather than purchasing this more limited release.
unterStrike is beutiful game when i play with my friends and i get more new friends
liked it and used to play it a long time ago but I dont know how many people still play this.
luv this game 3

.55
is game is still on Steams popular list. That says it all.
unterStrike Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cannot stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I have met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally GOLD. To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highly recommend on this. I have got with steam record 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP. And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always, GL &amp HF 3
ooooooooo Russians like in CSGO no silver noobs, no shiting bizon ,no shiting molotov the old classic game But shit graphics and shit movement.
st fps game D that can run on any laptop or pc XD

great game to play, if you are used to CSGO this game will have a massI have learning curve to it. The style CS 1.6 has developed is very different than from what CSGO needs.
e of the best game since 8years, that i have been playing. No praises are enough, no time spent would be too much. One of the best game of all time. I have get tired, and if are playing it, you wont be bored of it too.

Like This Game *
 first true love of video games, provided countless hours of fun on Gamespy anytime I pick up a new FPS, even if its a CS sequel, I compare it to CounterStrike, as it was perfect in everyway.
classic in the genre. Still a lot of players playing it. Not the best looking multiplayer FPS out there, but very fun to play.

rld BEST FPS GAME EVER MADE
s freaking cs and 22000 people still play it.  Need more reasons?  Didnt have it on this new account and I felt th√© need to replay it. Worth it
got banned from a server for using my flashlight  gg    All jokes aside, game is fun, but the community has been godawful now. Game also has a steep learning curve, so be prepared to die a lot as a beginner.
od game! The best game ever! 1 Of the world!
e same as CSGO but without the toxic community.
d, but gold ! 3

ere nothing but to say, ITS COUNTER STRIKE 1.6 best mlg game that ever lI haved! jk its not the most, but you know its really good! 8/8
st FPS ever made for gamers with brain and good dexterity!
od Game but is Hardcore to the core
 is a must have for every Steam player.
 is literally the granddaddy of onlineFPS. CounterStrike kick all other genremates in the but with exelent ballancing, skill on skill fights and multiplayeraction wich still captures many players. Iconic weapons, modding opportunities and a large community made the CouterStrike francise popular for many players. A big contra is the many hacking and the fact that Valve forces you to use the Condition Zeroskins wich are not bad but dont fit in the game as well as he original skins do. Its old but that dont stop me playing the game exesI have for many hours.
 is the best
unter strike 1.6 !

ce game but RIP
is is a classic, online action shooter, one of the best out there.  10/10
esome game and is the rawrest of FPS you will ever get!
st of the best game
is I suggest you buy instead of CounterStrike Source if you have a slower computer and you want the game to work fine. Even though its age, it is still very fun. One of the best, if not the best multiplayer you will ever have on PC. If you have ever heard of rumors and whatnot over hackers and and people who will kill you with an AK47 from half the map away. I have yet to see a hacker in CouterStrike and if your new, you will play on servers with less skilled people like yourself if you are new so dont worry about that. Great buy. Get it and enjoy 9.8/10
assic game.
e bomb has been planted.
mply My Life Is CS , Still the best fps game
fe is 1 but cs is 1.6 .....
y are you reading a CounterStrike review? You should already own it. Just buy it. For yourself. Now. 
 you want a first person shooter that takes skill. this is where major first person shooters started.
e love from 2003  Nowadays!
000+ for my new comp and all i play is CS 1.6
uld love to see how much time I spent on this game 58 years ago when I was a big player of 1.6 back in the day. Easily in my top 3 games of alltime! 10/10

w, whats funny is that I bought this game like 2 years ago, and sadly I have not been able to write a review about it, but Ill say, I remember like back in Elementary school like many years ago, I remember it was titled HalfLife CounterStrike, and during that time, I was always crazy about Military FPS PC games and had an obsession with them as a kid, and when I saw people playing this game, I had no clue but to think that this was some kind of an Army Game like many other, but until I delved deeper watching people play it, I finally came to realize that this was not some kind of an Army Game where you go on missions and do your thing, but turns out that it was some kind of an online shooter where you do the mission with other online players around the world, but when I began to finally get to play it back in my old elementary school years, I would still recognize it as an Online Army Game.
e Of The Best Games !
s aweomse game!
st of the Best  Master of all FPS games
at is there left to say when a game which is over a decade old is in top 10 of Steams most played games list? Timeless masterpiece.  Graphics are temporary, gameplay is forever c
ay Hard Play fair Go Pro

 you like shooting the bad guys then this is one of the games for you. When CounterStrike was originally released in 2000, I didnt play it because I was like 1 year old. I play it now because of the fast/slow paced actions and the guns. There are a bunch of guns in CounterStrike that you can use. There are little guns that are cheap, and big guns that are expensI have. But here lies the problem with CounterStrike... people dont even use all of the guns! Whenever I find onto a server, all of the players are only using the black gun, the brown gun, the silver gun, and the green gun. Even though there is a bunch of weapons, they arent really all used much of the time. In the end, I play CounterStrike because my computer is afraid of CounterStrike Source.
is game is a very addictI have FirstPerson shooter, which even by its age is still played by thousands of players and I personaly find it very relaxing to its multiplayer and singleplayer capabilities. I recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS games which can be played alone or with friends, casualy or competitivevly.    I r8 it 8/8 m8. 
 first FPS game onlinr, awesome experience,best maps, overall really loved it
 you thought people dont play old games anymore, youre wrong. CounterStrike is still a game with LOTS of players playing, despite the game being 15 years old so far. If you have a bad PC, dont worry, because CounterStrike can run on almost any computer!  With excellent controls, skilled players, good graphics for its time, a big variety of guns, the huge amount of servers, the anticheat system, good level design official maps, CounterStrike is one of the greatest FPS of alltime, and I think everyone should get this game as it is cheap.   If you are a retrogamer and you never played CounterStrike yet, you gotta do it. You wont get disapointed. Not at all.  I dont have much to say about CounterStrike... its just so good... everything about it has already been said by others... what should I say now?   if you think CounterStrike would be a bad purchase, youre commiting a serious error. Just go play it. Go! Go! Go!
is game has shields O.O
rprised theres still 5vs5 competitive have servers. This game is still alI have.
ry Nice! Great time! 2006 best dreams...
 old hours were not counted but still is a great game to this day.
s super hard to play if you have played csgo before it
e of the best games of all times.
is is one of the greatest games I have ever played, full of modifications, actI have and cool!! cannot say more.
st game ever... fact
ry nice game ! much better than the new !
en playing this game for 5 years plus and it isw still absolutely fun. Quite in fact a better game than CounterStrike source or CouterStrike condition zero. Great Gameplay Scrims or for fun Many mods I have played are quite good like Zombies, Trouble in terrorist town, surfing, and jailbreak. All are very nice to make the game relavent and quite new. I highly recommend thisw game.
ic and oldschool shooter , the best in my opinion.
r low computers is this game oldschool,but still GOOD classic game.If you have good PC you are playing csgo. If you have a bad pc you are playing 1.6 üòÉ
tought wanna buy weapon. so press B what da f*ck doesnt work Buy key i check cfg file bind b connect  cs.metin2gajik.com27015  its like s*it
h u can rate this...surely cannot...just awesome...the pioneer of fps gaming and still has its hold ..simply awesome 10/10
vent played it enough to make a good review but it is an alright game from what I have experienced
is is a great game! Nostalgia! D
nder if this game will get old...
e best game ever made by man!
s like the most played game ever in the history of fps games.
just love to play CS 1.6.. one of my favorites...
ill a great game, worth playing for anyone who likes the Counter Strike games. Dont let the outdated graphics turn you away from this, who said graphics mattered anyways right?
1.6‚ô•
e of the best FPS ever. X
cent game with low price!
unter Strike is the most popular fps game we played in windows pc.
 Game that shit‚ô•‚ô• Gamers off Back in 2000
ry very nice game D goooood job
assic FPS
s shiting CounterStrike. What are you reading this for? BUY IT ALREADY.
ally fun and cool you should buy it its really fun
e next best version of CounterStrike after the now defunct CS 1.5.
assic FPS! A musthave for every FPS player to explore the roots of FPSGaming!
comand!
erything from here onwards was downhill, but CS GO was like a shiting cliff. Itll never get better than this. Best FSP game ever made.
s like csgo but it isnt fuck and you can get away with micspam and wallhacks and all kinds of goofy mods without valve forcing you to use viewmodels so you can see their fancy skins
dless fun i could end up with over 1000000 hours on this game XD. Everyone sucks at first because with this game its all about practice and trying things out, seeing what weapons you are good with etc etc. Anyone can be good at this game its all about how much time you put into it as long as you have some very basic FPS knowhow you could master it for sure.
nds down the best CounterStrike ever made. It have the fun in it that no other game have. The feeling when u play for a example a Warcraft server. The time you put in and playing that game for so long. Dont buy CSGo. But this sh*t 10/10
assical... online gaming started with this game =
e original CounterStrike. The one who gave life to both CSS and CSGO. I first played this game when i was 7 over 10 years ago and i never forget how difficult it was for me to kill an enemy. However, this is great game and game that certainly belongs in the Top 10 Games of All Time.
u cannot strike a counter, but you can strike other players with a knife. Or just constantly get one hit killed by enemies with deagles, aks, and awps.
u are a pro gamer? Want to play against other pro players? This is for you!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game deserve a golden medal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10 out of 10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In the early 2000s college freshmen would go to each others house and set up split screen or system link Halo, while true devoted gamers played this.
e, thats prettu guud
s fun in the 2000s. Not playing anymore.
st shooting game ever!
ople are like Bad Community but its because they wernt here about 10+ years ago, when the community would help you with anything you needed. Its a good classic ^
cheap and simple FPS shooter. 10/10
s shit‚ô• by Mexicans on the only servers that have players called hacker whenever I killed someone  Learning Spanish through this game is better than actually taking a language course in school 10/10 classic game
assic and yet still the one of the most entertaining FPSstyle shooters that has ever set foot on earth. Gameplay mechanics are fun and yet challenging. Game provides many different gamemodes from regular deathmatchbomb plant mission to platformer style of gamemodes. Overall an awesome game and I recommend it to anyone who has any cs experience or has any interest in FPSshooters 
hh! Good old memories..
 an nice game
 a CSGO guy so i was skeptical when i played this, but its really fun and mirrors my favorite game in the series well 8.5/10 cuz u cannot beat the GO srry if im shitfuck ppls off, i love this game too
es this even need a real review?
ST CS EVA
ve been playing this game whole my life since 2009, played many other games including CSGO and still playing most of the time and will play in future. BEST GAME EVERRR..
st game ever cannot believe its still alI have.
 my opinion Cs 1.6 is the best shooter game ever.
unterStrike is only available to play in multiplayer no bots. So youre forced to connect to someone elses server and put up with randomness and repetitI have maps. And of course, its the GoldSource Engine and all that entails.  CounterStrike Condition Zero is considerably more fun, in my opinion. You get all the same weapons, but theres a pseudostory mode, AI bots to play with, and different objectI haves and a variety of maps you hop around, all of them challenging you in new ways. Kind of like the current campaign contracts in Global Offensive have and Team Fortress 2.  Get this game package, especially if its on sale. If not for the classicness or nostalgia, then get it for the great singleplayer experience with Condition Zero.
ly kids from venezuela play this game.
eaternoob
nnot beat a Classic... unless you just kill it with a bunch of bot servers. Still the king of the online fps.  For the record CS1.4 on the WON ID system Way before SteamIds was the best version.
.619
re cancer i like it
e Granddad of all shooters! This game is the definition of Excellent.   This game may be old, but its still a great game to play. Also, its really cheap!
dest CounterStrike is the best, because people play 4 fun, they want to be better and better. People dont play to upgrade their ranks like in CSGO.
is Is The Pinicle OF ALL SHOOTING GAMES
s a 2000 game style but it steel like old school games. Low quality,low pixels thats the reason why this game is so popular.
esome game. Best fps game ever... you are gonna need some serious skills for this game.
esome game. First FPS I ever got good at and still to this day I can load it up and have fun playing this game. This game has a lot of history behind it and it probably the foundation for a lot of the new FPS most notably CoDCall of Duty. Thanks to this game I learned how to play an FPS properly and will alway enjoy playing this game no matter how old it is!
y this if you are a winner
e best game in the world, a child ‚ô•
en though CS go has taken over cs 1.6 , 1.6 will always remain in my heart , the Bhop , the mp5 sound , buying ammo and the most favourite the elite crew model D 3 . I love this game .

st game..Start playing and you end up having addiction to this game..
it
e gameplay is oldfashioned and fun. The community is casual, immersI have and usually lacking the children. Its everything you want from a game you play in your spare time.
 OLD SHCOOL!!
 you like classics, here is something you should probably get. A mod from halflife released one year after halflife it is still one of the most played games in the world bringing players from all over the place to enjoy together. It has a rather simple gameplay and youre able to get most of it in a few minutes but at the same time it requires training if you want to be able to play well.
meless classic! Counterstrike1.6is one of the greatest esport fps gamesif not the greatest in the gaming history and is still worth buying today. Graphics doesnt matter for a good gamer, gameplay does...
tter than Source, better than GO.   But for some reason, people always prefer graphics over actual balanced gameplay.
e original was the best but this is a close next.
 name is Bob.
 one day I was chillin on de_office when terrorists came in and took over. Then counterterrorists showed up. There was swearing, and people started spray painting on the walls and people were getting headshots by switching from one gun to a sniper rifle really fast. Then some idiot lobbed a grenade at me and blew me up. Now that Im in Hostage Heaven I have plenty of time to slack off and not do my job.
commended
love this game because way to gI have headshots better than cs go and sometimes players in the severs calling me hacker if they dead by me Imfaooüòâüòòüá∫üáøüôèüá∫üá∏
ayed.
, you are a bloody hacker and i cannot shoot you through your heart. 10/10
is is an old game. but its good and have some multimod servers and its funny game and i also play it , any 1 rich in steam can buy this game soo easly because its cheap
stalgia Nostalgia! There is no nostalgia in that it sets good to have this life counter strike!
e good old times, a classic upon classics. Looks horrible, still plays superb.
st game, my first fps game D
ay this for 67 years and its still good 10/10
e original just simply cannot be beaten
16!, And still half world is playng CS 1.6 3
some 
ll i played my first game got in a lobby FULL of cheaters every single server a cheater. Other then CHEATERS its a Fine !! game
 amazing game with an abundance of hacks to choose from for those that want more from their games.
d classic  if you starting with CounterStrike adventure, start with 1.6  its a good start From Zero to Hero!
is game is fun. It have got bad graphic but that is ok . I recommend It.
en though it happened to be made back in 2000, I enjoy the game even though it has bad graphics D. Played like 1k hours of it back in 2008.
re in the hole simulator 1999 edition
re, hardcore CounterStrike in its rawest form. The godfather of shooters. If you truly love competitve CS, you will love this.  I love this game and have a lot of respect for the fragmovies, but it requires skill so Im unfortuantely shit at it. Maybe one day.
other one bites de_dust
do believe this was the first FPS game I ever played and I remembered I really enjoyed it. This was the game who started esport growing, with players as Heaton, get_right, etc, and you can really tell how it has embarked the industry and media. CS is the top esport game in the world. There is reasons for that!  Great gameplay, voice, maps, gamemodes, servers and many fun things to explore in this old FPS game.   If you want to play serious or just want to have a fun, this game has it. Id recommend to buy it if you want to be apart and feel like you own something that has revolutionize the gaming industry and the esport genre.   Or you could just buy CSGO, thatll work aswell..   
e best game there was and there will be! Great balance and impressI have legendary games.
s even great in Early Access.
ry good game trust me i been in this business for years.
at i can say ? Just lovely classic counter strike.  You are not player if you havent played too mutch hours on nonsteam.
..
od game gave me a good giggle 
is game was the shit its the shit, dont shit with this shit cos this shit‚ô• suprerior to your shit
is is what todays FPS games are based on, in one way or another. If the community was as big today as back in 2004 than this would no doubt be ahead of alot of other skill based reaction times, sound direction skill FPS games. I would certainly suggest this game above others.  The only negatI have is ofc the age of this game. This game is about how good you are, not about how fancy it looks.
e best classic FPS game !!! 3
st recently started playing this game. But so far it is so much fun, have not played it with friends yet but when I do it will be 10 more times the fun.
e Best D
dest in the class, still the best.
sthave if youre a FPS fan. This game has started it all.
ck to the classics! Never forgetting the thousands of hours I played this game, looking through every mod and searching for tons of unofficial versions of the game, because I couldnt afford it. I started playing 5v5s in Source and now I am searching for PUGs in 1.6 too. It will be so fun when I find some!
e Best GAME ever! 3
e of the best games ever made  Definitely in FPS Hall of Fame.
e first game I ever played... And Im damn right GLAD it was the first game I ever played. Nostalgia...
e best game valve made after CsGo but the updates made the game very poor  wish it could be like in the past
te this shit.
od game.Classics !
e of the best games ever!
/10 would play again!
min will ban players and support hackers.   Best game I have ever played.
really like this game.Its old but so good!
have played this game for 10 years now since I was 6. It was not on my Steam until last year due to using nonsteam version which I regret. But hey I was little. I still play it even though I moved on to G.O this game is still fun to play with friends or in mixes/pugs. I believe this game was and is one of the best FPS games out there and there is no reason for you not to buy it. Enjoy.
st FPS of all time.
ined my life. IMHO best online FPS shooter game ever made. 10/10 would start playing again.
ry addictI have game üòÉ
 you are an fps gamer aged 25 and up, then chances are you played counterstrike 1.6 excelled at it and was able to relate to it with pride  this game paved the ground for so many shooters, crossfire, alliance of valiant arms, left 4 dead
tter than CSGO Why? Less Russians  No Hackers Guns does not do fast aims Less rage than CSGO But bad graphics and low quality 8/10
think this version of CS need BOT update, so i can play offline bots
remember skipping school and going to internet cafes to play this game... good times!

re was my childhood went.
st oldschool game ever, and still playable... but only one think is frustrating me is cheaters...
e of the addicted games.. like it D
vaded by ethnicities with bad computers and awful ideas with their server management, it is now impossible as of today to get a decent match without paying for ESEA, even in PUG servers.  Not being racist, this is what actually happened. Surf servers and Fun servers finally died around 2011, whilst vanilla servers that aint running dust 2 all day long died before Steam even came out, and all thats left is a bunch of latinocontrolled servers with shitawful maps and enough plugins to gI have you a seizure and a thousand hats.
 Old damn game, but you know, Old is Gold. Its a whole lot of fun when you play decently but sometimes irritating on pubs, Servers with limted slots, like 15, and everything unlocked, trust me, with some basic understanding of the game, it will be more enjoyable than masturbating.  **BEST THING ABOUT THE GAME** The netcode of this game is perfect, is very enjoyable and gI haves decent hitreg even with bad internet which gI haves you lag spikes upto 300ms. 
is is perhaps the first game that I play on PC
at are you waiting for? BUY IT AND PLAY IT.
LOVE.CS This Game IS SOOOOO FUN Too Bad The fanbase is dead for this game but i got csgo and cscz but when i hit Z,X,C It crashes So i recomend CSCZ

u better have a really beefy pc to run this game
highly recommend this game blablabla

 God hadnt a name and that name wasnt AWP I would gI have him 1.6 seconds to tryhard again yo.
ill one of the best shooters ever
 The Best Shooter
ing someone who played CSGO before this game, I must say I was pleasently suprised. The gameplay was great, and the community was quite helpful and much less toxic. I love Half Life, and this is very similar. Really fun to just do some deathmatch, I find it to be much more enjoyable then CSGO. The bullets go where you shoot them, and hit reg is not awful. There is a much greater spread of maps here then in GO, and they are all great. The visuals and core gameplay are so simple, while providing incredible room for skill, which is rare and something I very much enjoy. The only downside and negatI haves of this game is that servers are often empty, but the core mechanics and gameplay are stellar.  Great pick up even for us modern gamers. It will gI have you a little taste of history, and what fps use to be like while providing an excellent gaming experiance.
unter Strike is a great game. Even though it has outdated graphics it still has great gameplay. There are different game modes. 1 is where you have to defuse a bomb or plant a bomb and the other you have to rescue hostages and thats just to name a few. You will definetley enjoy playing this game.
rst at 8 years, since in 2007, A friend comed at my house and installed me a cracked version of Counter  Strike 1.6 . Well I played it like one thousand hours , my friend moved in other country, and when I was playing someone destroyed my CS. I didnt know how to install it again, so i watched on youtube ,I reinstalled it again, That story with the destroy repeats like 23 times. I started to be an admin at 10 years, yes 10 years baby, I was doing requests to be an admin and i was telling them i was from 15 to 25 D Well servers that i was an admin closed , get to the next one , when this closed , to the next one and like that. I always knew that servers close because there is a lot of money to pay to have one. At 12 years i discovered Steam. The first year I didt have any friend on steam because i Haved a shit laptop and i was not able to play call of duty 1 on 30 fps. I continued to be an admin on servers. 1 year ago I discovered an server that I love, I have some great owners that are very nice, and some day the owners decided that the admins need to buy CounterStrike 1.6 . I dont planned to buy Cs 1.6 on steam because i already have it cracked , but i loved the server so much that i buyed it on steam! I think that i have like 5000 hours of play with cracked CSs   I totally recommend this game! 11/10  Love CS 1.6! 3
ught this game CS anthology bundle back in 06 from a gaming store in Lamington road and it has been fun playing this every now and then whenever there are good public servers for this game. This game introduced me to STEAM platform as it was a very popular mod of HalfLife. It has been worth every penny to buy this game and I still play it more than I play CSGO.  I get reasonable pings 50 and I am on MTNL in Mumbai.  If you are newbie lookin to buy Id recommend you buy the Valves complete pack during a major sale.

/10 Best Game With Good Graphics but need to update
e of the best games.
still play it sometimes.
ayed it for just a bit ...
ROS  + great gameplay + big actI have community + great choice of weapons + huge amount of mods + lots of community created maps, weapons, AI, soundtracks, etc.   CONS   rare issues with graphic cards especially for laptops  has replacement in form of newer CS games   Comment  What is there to introduce? This is a FPS game that most gamers know and the ones that dont should. The laughable half an hour I have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game. In reality I have played many many many hours with my friends. I played it in high school. I played it in college. I played it with friends after work. While the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time. While I am no longer able to get my friends together and play this , this game will always be a fond memory for me. And who knows maybe I will pick it up some day again. What I can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy. The basic concept of terrorists vs. counterterrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless. So grab it if you can, it is very much worth it.
The best game i ever play
e best game ever played  enjoing abou 12 years  thanks valve
st way to get a nostalgia boner, must buy.
e first game that struck down like lightning, stole our souls and maked us fight with parents to make them understand that you cannot PAUSE an ONLINE game.  I remember the early days of playing and the less than professional LAN parties we arranged in someones house. I cannot think of ANYONE in my hometown that did not play this game BEFORE STEAM even existed This was the game that brought us all together on weekends, schoolbreaks and we even went as far as moving large CRT monitors just to game. I would like to see the lazy youths of today arrange a LAN where everyone had to carry a large 19inch CRT monitor with them   All the drunken insanity of 20youths in a basementLAN NO INTERNET!, killing eachother and sharing files on DC++. This was GOOD times or maybe Im just nostalgic about it...  It stole my youth, costed A LOT of keyboards J√ÑVLA AWP B√ñG?! and drove our parents insane. AND NO UPDATES BREAKING THE GAME ALL THE TIME LIKE CS GO.  What you bought was what you got and not a different game every month due to updates...  10/10 would waste my youth on this game again
e classics and one of the best from my childhood.
is is my childhood game  thanks Counter Strikes developers for developing this such a great game!
Very fantastic game Very fantastic game
is game is old but still as enjoyable as the first time i played it.
dont know any game better than this...
 is love.
is mod game is the reason I bought HalfLife. It had that certain formula that elicits all the right neurotransmitters to keep addicted and craving more.
ere is only one CS
is game made me who i am now. Amazing player in FPS games. I really love this game and i hope you do so
od game to waste ur time 
esome game. All computers can open, but you will have skills and play so much time this game. Soooooooooooo I cannot say anything.  This game is all times mutiplayer!!! D
ayed it for 10 years, then I decided to buy it on Steam... 10/10 would get banned for being too good again!
Legendary team shooter of all time!

ry fun fps game
 overwhelmingly great shooter. This game takes skill and tactics, and lots of teamwork. The community isnt perfect though. There are lots of dumb trashtalking players and people that whine whenever they die. If you can ignore that, then you will have an amazing experience.
d, but still a great classic. If you like classic FPS games, recommended.
ere are the cases, and no knI haves? 0/10

Are you looking to impress your crush with shooting skills although you dont have any? Do you want to appear like a whiny edgy shit‚ô•‚ô• in front of your parents while giving your friends lessons on when to rush A or B?  This is the game you play.

P 45 the best weapon!
Clasic, it will never die !
s 4 life
esum game loved playing it
od old CS its a good game if youre looking for nostalgia.
 you hate this game, visit the doctor.
at can I say?  Its just the best game I have ever played, and its my favourite game. So simple, and loads of fun, many mods, exciting, entertaining, utterly exciting and addictI have, and theres always new maps.  Theres many new games with better graphics, but Counterstrike is the best, and will still the best firstperson shooter ever.  Oh, and I knew Steam by this game.   +10/10
s classic FPS shooter game which I have been playing since its been released and I still play it. cannot let it go entirely. If you are looking for a game with many different modes available this is a game for you. Example of available modsservers with special modes are available online are zombie mod, plague mod, paintball mod, soccer mod, jailbreak mod, gungame mod and many more!
member ! if u shot to wall on de_nuke or whatever map, u will get double kill or annother lol kill on annother map xD fkin hilarious &amp bay for noaimed pro players, this can be callled start ramp to csgo. Coz u dont need aim there &amp csgo also.
ce Game =D
ast
is game was nearly the first one I have ever played and still is in top 10. Dont be surprised that I have so little hours played onto my account, becouse I am still playing onto my halflife version with official cdkey.played like 1000+ hours. This game is totally worth buying if you like playing in cooperation with friends. 2 team are tying to kill each other with one life. Point is Terrorists are supposed to destroy a bombsite and Counter Terrorists are supposed to defend it. It works the same in hostage rescue, CT has to take hostages to safety. But if you are looking for a counter strike and good graphics, dont look here. Try CSSource or Global Offensive have.

1.6&gtcsgo&gtcss&gtcscz Best fps! On cs1.6 ns i had 2000 h!
 I really writing a recommendation for this game?  CounterStrike  or CS 1.6  is a classic game which started off as a HalfLife 1 mod way back in late 1999, and was later sold in 2000 which required both HalfLife 1 and the game itself. Where as now, you only need the game itself on Steam.   CounterStrike was one of the biggest multiplayer FPS games ever made, due to it being playable on many computers, and just an overall really fun game. It has no doubt made a huge impact on the world of FPS. Especially in the competitive have scene such as esports where 1.6 is still being played today.  However, it has aged. A lot. Especially in comparison to CounterStrike Source. So a lot of maps are quite spacious and dont look as realistic as many would expect to todays standards.   I actually prefer CSS over this game as I just like the feel of it more.  I honestly dont know why Im reviewing this game, as Im sure everyone on my friends list here has played it. But just incase youre that one odd person out that for osme reason hasnt played it  try it out, and see whether you like it or not. 
is game will always be played 
W THIS GAME JUST NEVER GETS OLD  ONE OF THE BEST EVER! EPIC!
spite all the yuears that have passed , CounterStrike is still one great online shooter that is fun and challenging to play . However be warned  You will be killed countless times until you master this game .  Final Score  8/10  Great   Full video Review   https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap_HeTcwY2c 
is game is a HUGE reminder of why PC gaming is a beautiful thing.
s like CSGO....but losing isnt even that bad in this one. which makes it better. no ranks which is also nice
 my friend says this is a game where you must use your brain and where you need to be a team player, not playing for yourself so I recommend this game to everyone who loves good teamwork
ill fantastic after all these years. The game that molded a generation.
st a classic game to play  .
e of the best FPS.
!!!!!!
st FPS ever. I have a lot of memories with this game.
e oldschool CS... Very much players and I like it! cannot hate it for too long.
rld best game 
s the best game in history .
h after a lot of hours on Warzone my opinion hasnt changed.This game is great.
nce CSS is practically a graphics overhaul of CS 1.6 all my good and bad points apply to this game.  Only unique problem is that is kinda poory optimized for systems with specs well above the recomended.  8/10
h this game deserve to bee free on the store cuz it sucks af full of cheaters.
been playing CounterStrike since 1999 and its 2013 and it still hasnt gone out of date. i dont think there ever will be another fps game like it.
assic! One of the most fun older games that I own. The community is still large and thriving! GI have it a try!!!! 
ople really complain of hackers, I have never encountered one. its a really good game, Get Condition Zero if you dont have access to constant internet, its basically the same game, but its singleplayer and better graphics
ry good game, you should try it D
etty cool game, old school
buy the AWP and I win.  I recommend this game whole heartedly.  10/10
actually have 4200hrs of play time on this game and started to play it since the Cybercafetimes to play it against friends on a very old version.  This past predicted me to choose just one option. This game is greatest game, which ever was developed. Thank you Valve for your product. It has been stolen my childhood in a postI have way.  I collected alot of great and horrible experience on that game.  Storytime After learn of the systemmatic of the game. I learned how to shoot. Located the best spots. Choosed the best mapsdust/2, assault.. and rised up to landscape of custom mods as been known the heart of CounterStrike It begun with Only Knife maps and bringed me up to Surfing, Kreedz.. And after hours and hours of learning. I became extremly skilled. This was the best highlight on this game for me, to stand on a point where you reached the point and can finally say You unterstand this game and his shematics  movements, angle, strafe, and much more..  *Nostalg* I might be coming back to this title ... maybe not today or tommorow.. someday, it will happen...
ssians everywhere.

L...the worlds best game.......   LOVE THIS GAME THT TOO IN STEAM&gt&gt&gtWAH WAH   3
st FPS Game ever, I will never chance my opinion. 
s the year 2015. This game was made in 2000. 15 years is alot in terms of technological advnaces. You only need to look at the break throughs, inventions and so on to know this. So im bought back to my original question why do so many people,play thos game now, the graphocs look terroble as they would seeing as it was 15 years ago and so on. I would assume becaise it is because of how succesful amd popular the counter strike franchise is. But they mechanics, movement,graphocs and many more wouldnt be good in todays 2015 gaming standards. Do u just play it to try amd revI have the good old times or to simply run away from children?
is game is still awesome.
assic. Never gets old. Great mods, Good times. Much wow.
 iconic game, perhaps the best game of all time, please buy it. 10/10
is game has the best weapons with hard recoil and very hard to master them Its a teambase game so you have lots of fun with friends or random players on the servers Many game modes such Deathmatch, gun game, zombie plague, bunnyhop, jailbreak, climb, etc. Also it has a great range of tactics and many more things that make it the best FPS and hardest    This game was released in 1999 and people still playing it       Ill probably say the same for CSGO   
nnot find any people who speak english. Thats okay, because Im Osama.
e game is great. Has the full potential, the graphics and gameplay are doing it.
 story began with the CounterStrike of 2007 to the end now
is game I will never forget Cult and even now current Retro also present.
d School is always the best.
ough The graphics suck the multiplayer is awsome... Largest in the world... a mustplay game !!
riously Counter Strike is awesome all of them Go,Source,The original all amazing! So go on buy them...im serious....do it...NOW.

e good old Counterstrike never seems tiring and boring. I still play it till date alongwith Counterstrike  Global Offensive have. Valve should release update for the remaining bugs and glitches and revamp the graphics keeping the gameplay same.
ill Popular I think  ^_^

tter than csgo the bullets actually go ware u aim
e oldest game I have, and its great. I played a bit of it recently, and the maps have certainly changed since I went looking for maps om used to in CSGO, which are Inferno and Dust II. So I do recommend this game, but if you want better, get either CSGO, OR the CS Complete Pack.
love this game.....this game having best performence in online.....cannot stop playing when i start it........
tter than CSGO for sure
m I guess this game is good? What to expect is trolls tryhards and bads and umm..nope that sums up all the people who play this 11 + year old game.

 you didnt play this but play CSGO, you probably like to pretend you did.

ver before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competitiveon and sweatsoakedshirt anxiety as well a CounterStrike CS. You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for HalfLife. Its been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless youve got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a highspeed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a fullblown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $10 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.  Let me start off by saying that the CounterStrike pack is a standalone product. You dont need the original HalfLife to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is CounterStrike.  There is a singleplayer component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counterterrorists. As a terrorist, youre goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counterterrorist, its your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the illfated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.  CS is an action lovers dream, with games lasting only four or fI have minutes if that in some cases because, unlike HalfLife, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fastaction and realistic damage. You cannot just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while youre in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.  Its the teambased tactics that make CS so fun. I cannot stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensI have side youll all benefit by creating a cohesI have strategy. If you team is on the Offensive have side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. Im sure youve seen movies or television show demonstrating this Conga Line style of infiltration. Well, thats exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. Itll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.  Visually the game will not disappoint. While the HalfLife engine isnt the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you cannot tell who it is then you probably wont be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if youve purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counterterrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.  As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your hearts content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, youre off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the wait and watch feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again  you dont just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alI have and completing your objectI have. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldnt have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.  Not surprisingly, the user interface is very HalfLifeesque. Gamers who have played HalfLife or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the Update on the server page. Firsttime users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negatI have comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was gI haven to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, its hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well weve been playing this game for over a year now and we still cannot get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! Were still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little schoolgirls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess well just have to get them next time!  In a nutshell, if youre looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfyingthis game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!
ce game for low graphic
ayed it for like a minute or so, its ok.
s ok, i guess. 10/10

od Game and i Loved it so much
e game is fun, but unless youre trying to go pro, it gets boring after a while.
Worst game Eva
I was playing online and some ranndom kid stole my car.. It was a car server dont ask  Since black people tend to rob, I called him a N I G G E R and he laughted at my face and called me a shit  End of story is.. I got banned from racist mod  0/100000   Out of 100000 points it got 0 points.
u shoot people
best game but csgo better
G YES!!! This is the real cs not like CSGO wich was ruined by valvE. This is still 100000percent no mod game at starting and you decide if you want mods. If you want to try Counter Strike YOU HAVE TO buy this game at first!
st game in counter strike series
e best game in the world ^_^
assic. One of the best and most competitive First Person Shooters ever made.
 has been 2 years since i played counterstrike in my other account. I have at least 400+ hours in this game on another account as i loved it very much, As far as i know, I have CSGO now and i play that instead. I missed this game very much. I hope to get it again. This is just like the other CS games, You play as a Terrorist and Counter Terrorist. The objectI have of the Terrorist is to use the C4 and blow up 2 areas, Either one could do. A or B. While the CounterTerrorists objectI have is to Stop the bomb from being planted, If it is planted, They have to eliminate all Terrorist and Defuse the bomb. It takes around 5 seconds or 10 to defuse, It depends if you have a defuse kit. Its a good game and i recommend it.
eatest Game of all time!
 frend borowed account and cheat, i play alot and can i have a new acount or maybe team can look into problem and not vac ban me anymore? cs is very good game please help 
unterStrike 1.6. Not One of the Best, Nor One of the Worst.  ‚òÖ Good Gameplay ‚òÖ ‚òÖ Bad Graphics, as it was Launched in 1999 ‚òÖ  If youre going to buy this Game at this time, I Suggest buy CounterStrike Global Offensive have.  7/10
E BEST GAME EVER!!!
CounterStrike is one of those games you can just love, coming from a guy who got CSGO first I think Source beat it by the longest shot in a lofe time.
 1.6 ... That Game!
is game is very hard for beginners like me. However, I recently watched a guide that upped my skill by like triple  https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS5tRoVYFtg   So if you plan on buying this game, I definately recommend watching this guide before doing anything.
e best game forever...
e of the best shooter games ever ! You must buy it !
st game of all time
d school fun. LOVE IT. Reminds me of my first childhood PC games.
like this Game D
ve this game to be honest, great game which has its ups and downs, base of my PC gaming career, best game franchise based off of HalfLife what can i say.
ic game really , maps made by nipper are awesome u can drI have a car also but the fandom of this western anime was really big in 2001 year
tter than global Offensive have 3
u have this game to thank for modes like Call of Dutys Search and Destroy. CS is arguably the most widelyplayed online shooter of all time, and its still got a thriving community going on 12 years later. Its got simple, easytopickup gameplay thats spawned a massI have competitive have community. Unfortunately, its extremely stale thanks to the fact that there are 3 game modes. Luckily, there are tons of customization options available online. Still, worth checking out for the sake of history.
ayed this since 200 addictI have game.
Still better than CSGO.

unter strike global Offensive have may be good  but counter strike 1.6 will always be the best
w to be csgo pro  1. Buy cs 2. Launch it up and leave it on for 2 weeks straight 3. get over 100 hours of cs and then brag about it on your next csgo comp game how you played with the best pros back in the day  10/10 still best game and shitshits better than csgo
e of the best games ever, really atmospheric and fun game, but i have to say its dead now and csgo is a way better nowadays 
ounterStrike, in all of its versions, is just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy. Its a great game and all, you just cannot stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days without stopping from doing it. The huge weaponry options, which you can choose, the smoothness of the gameplay and sound of the game, its just really addicting. With this game, I have met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally GOLD. I recommend this masterpiece to all the passionate Action &amp F.P.S. players who are looking for a good, cheap and fun game to play with their friends. All I can say, as always Good Luck &amp Have Fun! 3  10/10 
Ruined my life.

 you want a good time, youll play 1.6. Game runs in 1080p with insanly amazing graphics. playing 169 1920 x 1080 allows for the best visual settings. Although many russians own the servers, there are a couple US servers which has limited russians. Good luck playing this game with your potato of a computer.
 has FREE, unlimited custom sprays, unlike Global Offensive have, lol
recommend counter strike is good shooter and also a good game
is CounterStrike 1.6 is really nice game but however its dead right now because CounterStrike Global Offensive have is out. This game might still play little kids and russians because its cheap and good. In my opinion this game was really good, but try it out yourself.
have played this game for many years dont look at my hours and i can say that it is possibly the greatest game of my genaration. i have played every game ever and like it a lot thank you good day

mper Fi CS Classic #1
unterCstrike 1.6 is one of the best FPS games. You can do almost anything in it, which is pretty awesome, at least for me, when the player can modify things to his/her liking. You can choose from many modes, ex. Knife, Awp, Aim, Deathmatch, Surf, KreedZ, Zombie, CoD MW2, W3 FT and so on. You can change models/skins, try almost anything if not everything. It is a shame that so many people did not see its potential, but ofcourse, the time goes on &amp the era changes, but no matter what, CounterCstrike 1.6 will always be my n1 OldSql game. Frankly speaking, I reccommend to try out this game to any FPS game lover, because I think he/she will not regret it. It is year 2o15 &amp its community still lI haves, maybe with one foot in grave, but lI haves on. Thanks for any reader &amp his time reading this.  Regards,  iMIND‚Ñ¢ 
is one of my bests game, the game is so good. You have differents modes of game like a Zombies, Capture the flag, etc.  I recommend this game? Yes but not to low graphics computers, the game looks like a poop in software mode.
e Best Online Game.........It Never gets OLD!!!!  EDIT  My Bad, Its Old Now P
at did i just witness medic op gg
, the original CS. Currently outweighed by CSGO,go buy that instead. This is still a good game though
u will be missed
unterStrike 1.6 is a very old game and i still playing it because it is fun. ts just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. With this games I have met so many different people and unique friends   It is just a very good game to play with friends
This community is better than the CSGO community  10/10
assic P
is game is not bad but still better than Twilight
e most classic shooter you can find.
unterStrike is one of the most popular games in the world, and for me, one of the best games ever. It doesnt have a beautiful graphic if you compare with other games, but who cares? Its so fun when you play with your friends in a LAN. This game is awsome!

 love with this game, everytime I play it  3
dont like tactical shooters but counter strike is one of the best fps games there are tons of peple playing fun mods on servers it is hard for new peple if you played call of duty or tf2 you can go in as a one man army but in this game its not like that if you go by your self you will get killed one problem i have with the game is if you die your out for the round and if your new you will get killed alot overall 9/10 great fun game but HARD
s CounterStrike, why wouldnt you buy it?
y CSGO instead

O better then CSGO
d grahpics. Still a good game though.
e second pc game i ever played
nally i buy that game! Awesome! D i`m not a VALVE`r now &gt
of my favorite games and the first game I bought on steam.Its worth buy u will never get bored of playing on the servers.
 NOT buy this game, if you do, youll never see the sunlight again !
t this game if you love repeatedly hearing sounds of Fire in the hole!, not respawning after you die and having to deal with players hundreds of times better than you when you first begin playing. If you enjoy a game of frustration with a terrible community who will look down on you for not having reflexes like a cyborg, this is the right game for you. Also, if you dont already have this game, you are a shit‚ô•‚ô•. Please either buy it or leave Steam immediately.
mply the best

is game is THE best action shooter ever made, its gameplay is very well balanced and you have many options and tactics to do.    Actually, if you play CSGO, then this game is exactly the same except that the graphics are from 2000. But this does not matter. Gameplay is far more enjoyable then graphics!   And if steam was built aound this game, well, then it must be some good stuff.

It works like a true Russian Language Speaking and German simulator should,   8/8 m8.
 is still a nice game to playD
 years ago, a boy named Joe visited by his nephew, his nephew bring some flashdisk that included A game called CS, Joe Was so Hype to play that game.  ~2 years later he keep playing that game, but he never know that the game that he was played was Pirate Edition. The Community was Great untill someone asked him to create steam account, so he create it. but he never know who is the man that tell him to create steam account. poor him, he still dont know how to use it and abandoned his steam account.  ~Finally this Day Joe can buy a copy of Counter Strike Game that was launching at 2000.  My steam account reactivated at 2013/2014  Thanks Valve, Sorry back in that time i was 8 and dont have credit card to buy this game. . . . .

very good game you get a lot of cookies and potatoes
unter strie is a good game 
ayed first time 13 years ago and got totally hooked up, awesum game.
wise man once told me Maybe you should load up some CounterStrike 1.6 and shit around on some pub servers for a bit.. And that was what I did. And it was good.  Then I entered a server with a bunch of shit‚ô•‚ô• plebs. Sometimes there would be a player or two that could challenge me and wed have fun little fights. Wed make jokes back and forth with the radio but when I started asking for nude fuck pics no homo, the dude didnt respond _ . Two hours later, I noticed a player wouldnt stop trying to jump on a single ledge. Failing, he would back up and then try again and again and again without end and never shot back. I just sat there are watched him. That was when I realized the entire server was just bots and my conversations were with the rare amount of human players. Didnt know what to think. 
e most intoxicating, the most classic CS ever. Best for oldschool players! 
rst a mod. Then a game. Then a series. Now, a legend.
it, what is this? CounterStrike?! Yes.. Its CounterStrike.. the old FPS Game.. I have loved this game very much.. Its my Childhood Game.. This game doesnt have its amazing duper 2014 graphics, but instead.. Its the gameplay were talking about... So the Gameplay.. Its very fun but bit serious if you can ask me.. this game made me very serious at some period of time but the gameplay is still pretty fun.. and to derp around with it.. such as editing its textures and etc.. I have seen people having troubles playing this game online because full of tryhards or any pros out there.. well theres no bots included in CounterStrike but you can go practice at CounterStrike Condition Zero, it has bots..  This game isnt free and you have to buy it. Ill only suggest people who really likes Old FPS or competitive have Gaming around here!~ Game on mates! I highly suggest you buy this game for the people who really likes FPS here..
assic, Buy this game.
is game fun when i stuck in russian internet cafe in forest but now i lI have in glorious european i can play csgo!!!!   only poor chinese and russia play this, sometimes a german
at game is only the best.... I cannot say anything more...

ry nice game, would recomend [ better than csgo ] 10 / 10
is game is the past, this game is the present, this game is future!.   This game is everyhing.   #Life4cs #Cs4life #MavBravado #BravadoGaming #SouthAfrica #Canada  #5900+hrs     Maverick Clark
really good fps game that will never get old 
ayed this for like 7 years before steam was even created. great game.
st Game of ALL the Time
dictI have 
obably my most favorite game ever. The original is still so amazing, great servers, mods and tons of activity still!  Edit 2016 Update, still amazing. 1.6 FTW. Clutch. Dying community, classic original. 1200 hours easy.. I guess? Oh, em, gee.
ill playable
ry fun game from the old school times 
î
 keep me alI have. is the best game ever
6 was a revolutionary shooter inspired by some of the greats like Team Fortress Classic. Theres a reason why Counter Strike is practically a household name now, and why its one of the most popular multiplayer games. Because its a powerhouse of effectI have design and balance.
6 is fun but try out CSGO.

think its fun. Havent aged very well, but still runs on modern computers without any problem. Worth picking up if you find a good price for it.  Was also my first Steam game, so what can I say?  This game gets 7/10. Still better than CSGO
e best game D
unterStrike has changed a lot from 2000 to presentday 2015. Even with the release of CSGO, CounterStrike 1.6 still remains a favorite for me. There are still many dedicated servers with ten or more people in them. The graphics are outdated of course, especially in maps like nuke, but they still look decent on a few maps . This game is the beggining of one of the game series out there. I would gI have this game 8/10 and would reccomend this to any retrostyle gamer! 
Love This Game 3
e good old days.
me is kind normal .
 a casual so i refunded the game as soon as i saw that you had to buy ammo
lp, this game keeps reconnecting me to another server while i am playing a particular server. and the screen is not full screen, how do i fix this. i think one of the problems are that i have shit‚ô•‚ô• internet
e oldschool!
e tip to be a pro Your role affects your teams success. Your teams success affects your role.  Games Description
 be honest, I started playing CounterStrike 1.6 when I was only 15, and today the game, I am 22 years old, yet I have not left the game, it is very hard even if it is old, still plays currently this CS 1.6 The best game in the world !!! 10/10 !!!
st game you can get on Steam, but it was better on WON.
HAHA, you guys think that CSGO is hard?   casual gamers

assic. 10/10
st shooter of all times
classic. That is the best way i can describe this game, but if you only played CSGO or even CSS and then you decide to go on a nostalgia trip to test the game, prepare to feel like you are in a very alien environment. The 2 hours that i tried, yes tried, to play the game were filled with learning the controls, adapt to the different recoil and aiming system in geral and then dying over and over again by the more experienced players  I recommend the game if you want to expand your gaming history horizons and gI have it a try, but you can expect frustration and rage. Its a piece of gaming history and it should be preserved as such, but new gamers will probably never get it.
is game costs real money
e reason why you should be using Steam in the first place.
tNever used green text before.  &gtUsed to hate this game.  &gtWent to a cybercafe to meet some friends, they were playing this game. Couldnt wait for them to finish playing, so I decided I would join them, even though I never really played it.  &gtDied 100+ times with 4 kills.  &gtMy ego got injured. &gtGot home, downloaded the game illegally then started playing. &gtGot good. &gtBought good gaming hardware. &gtGot even better. &gtGot to my friends level while they were getting better as well, then got better than them for a while. &gtNothing else really. &gtBought this and the other CS games, couldnt get into them, so I got back to this.   Now I hate my friends for stealing my social life.
Ö ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ ‚òÖ

r real!
will never forget these days and months that I spend to throw grenades on de_dust 2x2 or killing zombies with machinegun and run for my life. Goodnight, sweet prince.
feel like this is overrated. though it is fun csgo feels better to me. almost all the servers on 1.6 were spanish lol
e most popular online game 
 I has a plan   
t VAC banned 11 years ago. 10/10
st FPS game ever since 1999
rlds best game, sad were not able to play this game anymore. RIP 1.6 2003~2012
e of the best competitive have games of all time. You really feel great while playing this game. Addicting and brutal!
u need to have this game !!  really enjoy it
Good price + Good models + Fun + Good game for shity PC   Toxic community zzz
is game is the beginning of my gaming
st FPS game of all time 10/10
is game... Is great. No, seriously, this is an awesome game. However, It isnt quie worth 10 bucks, maybe 7.50, so either wait for a sale, or buy a retail copy and use the CD Key.  PROS Extremely fun Balanced weapons Except for the AWP Lots of servers &amp players Its classic Its not that big, its only about 400 MB.  CONS Learning curve is a cliff. Thats on fire. Not the best graphics Can be fixed with a texture pack No bots  Overall, I gI have this game an 8/10. Now buy it, NOW!
 youre looking for great fps skill shooter with nice community, this game is for you

e best online shooter i ever play, but after AVA P
this game never loses its fun old is gold they say, and holy hell were they right.
st FPS out there, no doubt. With so many different mods, maps and time it takes to get bored with this game, I just cannot think of a better FPS game. Best of all, its all fun usually  except when you get kicked from a lithuanian/polish server for speaking english or asking to ban a wallhacker.  9/10  ...because server list is so big and many of the servers are full of bots, only serving purpose to redirect players to join someone elses server. It can be hard to find a real server.
tter than source.
rst game ever rip off of call of duty and has really crappy graphics and weres batman in the game like seriously screw all yall people who played this game 0/10 WILL NOT RECOMMEND

unterStrike makes you work to enjoy the content, and youll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.  Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CSGO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and youll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.  What makes CounterStrike such a popular series  and what will no doubt make CSGO the next big PC shooter  is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better  and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.  Global Offensive have builds on the CS series by going through a significannot checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. competitive have capabilities built in? Check. Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.  As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical  laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.  The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gI haves weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesnt sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.  Its what doesnt work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive have has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gI haves the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.  If one assumed this was CounterStrike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.  Theres also now a split between casual and competitive have servers  however, many players arent yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isnt made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.  At times, arranging games in competitive have Mode feels like a chore. Joining a fI haveonfI have war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and youll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive have game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.  When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.  CounterStrike Global Offensive have is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as same old to us.  This is elementally CounterStrike Source with some finetuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.  And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valves objectI have with Global Offensive have was to draw together the actI have communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.
e terrorists returns,  play with the p90 and scout assault rifle to demolish your enemy, or use the usp with silencer to feel like james bond.  play 2 factions in more than 10000 community maps, or demolish bots on your offline playtime.  8.42/10

is is the beggining of what we call modern FPS. This game is pure skill. If u are a CoD aim down the sight fanboy, dont try it, youre wasting your time. This game is for skilled players only. No aim. No help. Just your and your target.

great game of catandmouse where you either play as a terrorist plant bombs or hold hostages or counterterrorist defend bombsites or rescue hostages. Either complete those objectI haves or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round.  CounterStrike is a fastpaced, realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend its also more fun. The graphics hasnt aged well but the guns still looks authentic. One thing I hate about CounterStrike is when you die, you have to sit and wait until the round ends. Even if the rounds are usually short, its frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alI have. Fortunately, CounterStrike has tons of mods available so youre able to play the game in many different ways. This helps the game from becoming monotonous and keep the game fresh.  Theres also not a lot of detail in the sound, other than the guns, but thats a minor complaint. The mods, dedicated servers and competitive have nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and thats why millions of people still play this oldschool game. Although there are many better shooters on the market now, CounterStrikes unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time.  8/10  GREAT GAME

is old cs. Also like to play some times
assic game
s a great action game , my early playing game. I like the action, the maps but I dont like sometimes becase all players are buying AWP and then the game is so boring. If I were the programmer of this game I allowed only AWP on the team. Another thing is that in game must be a leader , to focus the action of all team.
mories...  You cannot call yourself a gamer if you didnt play this game.
little better than PacMan.
e best and most original FPS of all time. Bow down to what has overtaken over 10 years of my life. GG
cided to try it out to see how far along the CS series has come along and well it came from a rough beginning based off of my experience. I couldnt find a lobby that wasnt full except for one lobby with only a single guy playing with bots in a TDM game. Now this guy was either really good at CS or hacking but I have never gone 15+ deaths 0 kills by the same guy. Another interesting thing to note is how the maps are vastly different from their counterparts in CSGO which isnt a bad thing just interesting. Secondly, there is a lot less spread in the guns than there is in CSGO a long with a different types of weapons...well for most the only difference was the name of the gun. Also there were more options for CT and T teams. Interesting to play probably wont play again but hey i need it for GMOD reasons.
en with the small amount of hours that i have i find the game fun, the only reason i have a small amount of hours is because i spend all of my time playing csgo.  10/10

ther of all Shooter games.
od old times!
ck when I was at the age of 4, this is the very first game I played. CounterStrike 1.6 is still one of my favorite games. This is where I started tho. From CS 1.6 to source and to CSGO. But, Im still a trash in CSGO  Yes, I do really recommend this game  10/10
os  no skins no russians cons c4 exploits everywhere ak47 is op

Guys, help me, i cannot uninstall it, its so hard to unins, im so confused
 is a great game franchise, and suprisingly this game isnt dead
esome game spent more than 2000 hours totally
ve that game!
good game that will probably never die out
0,000,000,000 Times better than csgo, cancer is almost non existant in this game, everyone is friendly, if ESEA, ESL or CEVO still had a pug / scrim service for this I would uninstall cancer strike  p90 Offensive have in a shiting heartbeat and play some proper counter strike!
played this game for 909131 hours, steam is liying, and I must say COD Advanced warfare is infinitly better than this pile of crap. If u want to be a proper gamer dont touch this low skill ceiling pile of trash and play proper games actually only COD .GET GUD NUUBZ.
ke csgo, but worse graphics
is game made me go Lesbian.
could find more honour in fighting an enraged bear whilst simultaneously eating the fuck of my cheating ex. Buying bullets was a good idea 15 years ago, why are you still playing this game? Go get shot in real life and die if you enjoy thinking youre that hardcore.  my review in the style of the baiting you will learn to love when you play this game.
st game. There is no skins, no dirty matchmaking, no bugs like in CSGO. REDDIT 11/10

e first game in my life I started playing in this game since i was 7 years old. I remember everything... How i was spending days in this game Having a good time with friends How i was playing it on the bad computer in the village.  I will remember it and never forget it This game is a legend and thats all i can say about it.
n and remerberable game what has the classic feeling of Half Life. Fun since start and worth all money. Some bugs in the audio but ill deal with it. I recomend to people who likes classic FPS games. 9/10 cause setting are not so optimiseable. 
 guys im holding a private server tomorrow with my family we going to play around, anyone wants to join?

lp! i open this game and it frezzes at a screen of a vertical rectangle of part of it and the rest is black? plz help and comment so does this happen with counter strike source counder strike CZ CSCZ deleted scenes
st online multiplayer competitive have game ever made. A game with such masterful dynamics where both brilliant individual skill and team strategic ingenuity play equally important role in the final goal of triumph. Perfect in all aspects. Definitely wont get a decent successor in near future.
asy to learn, hard to master.

e of the best FPS shooters, that combine both playbility and realistic close combat action. Recommended for all that want to experience most iconic title 
 childhood is here! 1000000/10
so recommend this game, this is the type of FPS. There are a lot of servers online, where you can have fun, and feel like a Zombie or jump on deathrun. I would recommend the game 11/10!
asic and good game D
6 will always be 1.6 and the best CS game 3
s been 7 years i still play this game. I dont know why but i attracted towards gaming because of counterstrike 1.6. This game gave us many great moments in cs history. I know people nowadays play cs go but they should know 1.6 is father of cs go. PURE OLD IS GOLD !
 years later, still playing this game. Lots of nostalgia in this game and also I have yet to see a game series like this.
ere has the time gone wish people still played this game like they always had .
s iconic ...

s great game
azing i would make more snipers tho

ecision FPS. You are rarely rewarded for spraying your weapon, its all about controlled firing for headshots somthing that is unique to this release.
is game is FPS its soo cool
st game on the worlds
is game is oldschool. Im always playing on HnS or Kreedz servers, so its the thing i like here, the physics to play HNS here. I have played this game for like 5 or more years already, and it feels great. Feel free to play with me, have a good time! PEACE.

ry good game!
de by Valve Software in 2000, originaly a mod for HalfLife in 1999. The most recently update is known as version 1.6. This game isnt balanced the Desert Eagle is TO overpowered, USP too, rest of the pistols are mostly useless. The SMGs are quite good, but not as good as the Assault RIfles thoe. If you play this game right now, then expect little kids, russians, or just some wierd guys, who somehow see trough walls and always kill you with a one shot in the head... But renember this game is amazing, alot of nostalgia for it. I would recomend to buy Counter Strike Global Offensive have, because it is more balanced, better movement, actual physics, and renember you CAN earn money!! when new cases come out, just play the hell out of it, there is a good chance that youl get it in a drop
y i cannot config video. Now more large.

zing game jst loved it!!!!!!! * cannot lI have without it!!! 3
spite my hilariously low count of, 0.6 hours, on record, I can attest to you that, nay, I have played this gameand its sequels to the ends of time. I have literally sunk close to 15,000 hours into the various derivations of CS over the years.  I found out about CS from some #IRC chat I used to frequent back in the dayit might have been an ICQ chat with one of them. Namely, I started with the first ALPHAyea, not beta, ALPHA. I can recall the loading screen and everything. From there, I progressed through the initial betas, introduction of maps, and various weaponsanyone remember the OLD cs_siege, complete with working apc and sniper tower?, etc.  I then became a player in various leagues I wont name drop, but I was a baller at one time.  So, yes, this game is good. Some people recommend CSGO as the modern return of 1.6, but I disagree. CSGO is better than CSS, yes, but still not onpar with 1.6, nothing will ever be   Goodbye WONservers.

d but still gold D
credible for a game released in 2000. Being the first Counter Strike game, it contains items, physics, sections that cannot be found in CSGO. This game is what paved the way to my personal favorite CSGO. I would really recommend this game to see what it felt like in the early 2000s.

e best game I have ever played and will continue to play
fe is 1.  CS is 1.6   
e game doesnt require much graphics, hence, runs on any machine. Although its years old, the game still keeps you entertained.
 childhood game, a very nice game, with good graphics that I enjoy playing even today when Source and GO is out. Very good.
o even plays this nowdays? hehe xd

etty good.  CSGO is better.
obably the best game in the world.
e game is good, but not a lot of people play the original anymore. If you dont have any friends who play this one, stick to CS Source, because the few servers in the original that are populated are not exactly your standard modes usually. But a good competitive have shooter nonetheless

tter than a F2P game, not saying what it is though.
 childhood in nutshells
ns of fun, but theres a couple newer versions now.
ahhhh, best FPS game.. 
st gave i have ever played in this 6 years,this is the game of my childhood i love it ! 
s gaem is run by romanians and hakkers and stolen copies of the game. lol pley a better gaem like kuntterstrik condishun ziro

e of the best fps games EVER.buy it
od ol 1.6, many memories, not really. I havent played it that much.
GO on cocaine
s k for a gaem with low grphics. Lol 69 fps
aphics are kinda bad but overall its a great game if it were not for this game csgo would be nothing.
love the game just one question, why did valve change the old models? heres the problem the guys hand model in the beta is fine but the steam 1.6 version his skin is to pale to be skin. the old player models were fine but in 1.6 they are just blah. the old title screen it looked fine in the beta it always reminded me of the map de_dust but 1.6 it reminds me of like a news report thing about to come on TV. the hostages sure they look better with the bland orange suits and the white suits with ties, but the scientist models for the hostages look better because for example would you see a guy in a orange suit in a freezing cold place like office? alright i think i am done with saying all the problems with cs 1.6 now
 Words to express !! Just download and enjoy each second of the game play. Highly Recommended !!
s a good game. If only I could stay alI have for more than 5 seconds to play the game. 
 you like shooting that is not just all run and gun and take a little thinking, then this is the game for you.

...its only the best team based first person shooter of all time.
e real OG, compare to others, and they aint shit.
ll yeah!!
e Original that started it all. V1.6 is still the best counter strike around. CS GO might have is fancy new engine,but in my opinion still does not beat this classic.I will say though at least CS GO is better then CS S by a small amount. This game however rolls all over CS S and CS GO. Call me a puriest all you want but its still damn good and has lots of mods.
is is a good game i recommended to you. This game is old bath a good game for nolifers. If you play this i recommend a server Ladie.lt this is a good server. This server is of Lithuianian country.
 favorite game , alot of mods good game 10/10

is insightful and damning critique of the militaryindustrial complex deserves to be highlighted for its trenchant social commentary as much as for its streamlined, highly polished gameplay. This is a multiplayer shooter with two teams, terrorists and counterterrorists, but tellingly the player shuffles between the two with ease and there are basically no differences between being on one side or the other, save for their objectI have, which is often to plant a bomb on nothing of value or rescue hostages who disappear immediately when rescued, as if they were created solely to sustain the conflict. Both teams purchase their weapons from the same supplier with money they earn from fighting each other endless soldiers fighting an eternal war drI haven not by ideology but by the military industrial complex, where fighting simply leads to more money and more fighting rather than an eventual peaceful resolution. The graphics could use some work. 8/10!
red at a person and I actually killed them  10/10, already more polished than CSGO
E FIRST IS THE BEST! BUY IT!!
great classic deathmatch game that is very fun. Pick Counter Terroist or Terrorist. Its the most fun classic ever! 7/10
es anyone knows this game? ^^
ill an awesome game. 8/10.
ill better than cod
 first a thirdparty mod for HalfLife Deathmatch, Counter Strike became one of the most recognized and accoladed FPSs amongst the PC gaming community, and 1.6 is still going strong with hundreds of servers available freetoplay worldwide, even after the release of Source the newer version of CS using the HL2 engine.   Nothing comes close to the intuitI have physics and control provided by the oldschool HalfLife 1 engine. Clever map design, in combination with a wide but not overlyacclectic collection of firearms and equipment at your disposal make for exciting deathmatchstyle firefights as well as situtions requiring strategy and coordination with teamates.   The beauty of this game is its simplicity, and dI haversity of action There are no classes, no upgrades or bonuses, and nothing giving any player any sort of ingame advantage over another, save for skill and knowledge of the game. A large arsenal of uniquelytuned weapons, CSs worldwide appeal and player base, and a plethora of every map type you could possibly imagine make for some very memorable gameplay experiences.
 years of pure fun 3 10/10

y does this game cost 9.99...?
 russian shit shit‚ô• screaming like in GO, no skins, no r8, no cz, whats a tec9  i r8 8/8 m8
is is still one of the best games on Steam, its just people fail to see that anymore since newer games have came out. But this is a CLASSIC and personally I love it, if you havent played it, youre missing out.. Big time. 3 100/10
rvers are too far fps and are not  
ere are more people playing on this 1.6 than Source
at one game where a bullet can pass through a 2 foot thick concrete wall and a 5 foot long crate, and the assault rifles have 12 random recoil patterns each.
is game is one of the most addicting games and the most fun games on steam.
though it has poor animations and graphics, it is still one of the most played games, and its still running. This game is created to test out players reflexes. With great skills, comes great VICTORIES.  Put your skills to the test with this Counter Strike, one of the best first player shooting game ever released, with more than 1000 of servers online 24/7.
s CS
t arrested at the air port because my headphones came out and everyone around me heard ‚Äúthe bomb has been planted.‚Äù  10/10 would get arrested again

PER FUN old but gold broken  super smooth XD

unterStrike  I started playing cs when I was just 4 years old .  Sometimes the most simple games like CounterStrike are the ones that lI have to this day. The gameplay is very simple  defend as a CounterTerrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.  CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. Very AddictI have Game p

ter 6 years of playing it in cracked versions from torrent, I finally bought it
he is Very Good Game
unterstrike is a good game for the most part, adding characters and stuff to the half life franchise and unI haverse... there are several canon discrepencies, but they can be ignored for the gameplay and overall storyline and even how that fits into the orignal half life game D  overall its worth paying for and playing...
 might look like a tiny Half Life mod, but look closer and youll see that Its got a lot you can learn. Takes time to be skilled at this game. Really fun to cooperate with your friends. Please, if youre a CSGO player, try this game out!
e Best Game 4 Ever Nice Fps Nice Gameplay  D

Taking back sunday? Thursday? Pffftt this is way more garbage tier than that.

Oooooh, its classic. Classic means the best! as my music teacher says

CounterStrike officially abbreviated as CS is a series of multiplayer firstperson shooter video games, in which teams of terrorists and counterterrorists battle to, respectI havely, perpetrate an act of terror bombing, hostagetaking and prevent it bomb defusal, hostage rescue. The series began on Windows in 1999 with the first version of CounterStrike. It was initially released as a modification for HalfLife and designed by Minh Gooseman Le and Jess Cliffe Cliffe, before the rights to the games intellectual property were acquired by Valve Corporation, the developers of HalfLife.  The game was followedup with CounterStrike Condition Zero, developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2004. Later that same year, CounterStrike Source was released by Valve. Released only eight months after CounterStrike Condition Zero, in November 2004, the game was a remake of the original CounterStrike and the first in the series to run on Valves newly created Source engine.[1] The fourth game in the main series to have been developed by Valve, CounterStrike Global Offensive have, was released in 2012 for Windows, OS X, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. Hidden Path Entertainment, who also worked on CounterStrike Source postrelease, helped to develop the game alongside Valve.[2] Several spinoff titles have been released for Asian territories.

Never have been a huge CS fan. Never used to be a legitamate player.  Thats where CounterStrike 1.5/1.6 comes into play. Among the other CounterStrike games I have cheated within them, multiple accounts, and have been banned more than my 2 year old sister can count. By the way, she can count to 22. After been gI haven the opportunity to try the very first, at least on Steam, CounterStrike 1.5/1.6, I have come to realize that I have no need to cheat. I can play this game on a competitive have skill and strI have to be better.  Do I recommend it? Yes.  Much more to say besides it turned me to be a legitmate player? No.  That should say enough.  Buy it, its cheap. Good for its price and it will make you play legitmate.

CounterStrike is a game that I recommend because  is one of the legends from the category shooting  is cheaper than the rest from the category shooting  is a method to banish boredom   is a good method to increase your performance at aim  you can easy change the type of default skins by the skins from internet  have a fair VAC staff  and... why you dont try?  Enjoy!
Good old game. AddictI have still to hard to quit it.
Dust, the video game!
  #LittleLycanOnSteam
The Legend!
Graphics are crap, but its a good game.
*_* 
dont play it
simply EPIC, a game which words are unnecessary to describe!!!  I gI have  10000000/10
CounterStrike is a tactical firstperson shooter video game which originated from a HalfLife modification and features realworld weapons.  CounterStrike pits a team of counterterrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objectI have or eliminating the opposing force. The game has both individual and multiplayer options. Bots can be added into the game. The onlinemultiplayer option is activated via Steam.  Other than similarities in basic gameplay, CounterStrike is not in any way related to HalfLife. The original version was marketed as a commercial mod, but since then it has grown into a separate game in itself.
It copied CSGO
Well Ruined My Life.
Its just a very old game, but its still one of the best games!  First king of FPS Games, bestseller.. what else? Brilliant!
I have spend bajilion hours on this one. Best game from the series IMO.  Remember its not all about the graphics  gameplay is what matters. 8/10
The best game. 
and weve got the biggest nades of them all!
CRapp but i will play it more and more and more and will teach my kids to play in that crap more and more and more.
Most think CS was released in 2000. It actually was released on june 19, 1999 before HL opposing force as a GoldSrc mod for free. Later when Gooseman joined valve it was released as a retail game for about 10 dollars. Overall you cannot deny the fact that CS was one of the best games of all time and in my opinion it is slightly better than GO but thats my opinion.
One of the best games I have ever played, having spent more than 1/3 of my gaming time easily on cs 1.5/1.6 alone.
great game... got VAC banned from it cuz i have a non steam and steam version installed and used hacks and steam found out lmao
I like This Game.... Also going to buy Cs GO
Cool game, played few times.  420/10
Simply the best fps game ever !
ct is cute
you know it
The best CounterStrike currently released for competitive value/integrity.  It highly rewards the skilled players, unlike CSGO and Source.
Its okay but needs more memes
Old but gold and the start of the FPS genre back in my childhood
best of the best!
Badass game of the year 1999. 9/10  + weapons + mods CTF, DM...   Community cheaters, cheaters everywhere
old memoriesssss. 1.6 is always going to be the best fps shooter!
best cs ever
Spent 80percent of my early life on this game 5percent of the people I have met there were russians  100000/10
.....
The immortal legend...
Addicted since cs 1.6
[]  []
Nothing to say But Best Classic FPS!
this game is the 1# online action game is awesome, its better than Team fortress games and other mutiplitplayer games
The Best FPS series began from this game, and it continue on. 11/10 best classic game
  cool classic game D i like this
üíØüëèüëåüëà
The game that singlehandedly started the FPS genre on the PC  and were not talking about CoD. Thats a different mess. Especially around BlackOps3.   What more do I need to say?
This is the Rosemarys Baby of video games, a videooffspring of demonic potential...the best multiplayer game of 2000, bar none.
Old School Game One Of The That Make My Childhood Happy 10/10
Hello people, i would like to spread the world about this game. Graphics kinda bad, but its about the action, eh? So, it is mainly based as a game, terrorists vs counterterrorists. Terrorists have to plant the bomb,at de_maps or secure the hostages at cs_maps. Counter ones needs to do the opposite, defuse or deny the bomb at de_maps and get the hostages back at cs_maps. There are a lot of mods, if you dont like the classic mode. But i really think that everyone knows about this game .  P.s. Im doing this for a steam badge D
¬°Good game!, one of my favorite VALVE games.
Wallbangs everywhere. 9/11 would buy again.
Worst game ever, worst graphics The graphics are that bad because the game is older than your mothers fanny and the game is awesome itself. Brings all the good memories back. For example when I was 7, installing the cracked version of that game and then just shooting anyone who gets in my way without controlling the recoil. ‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª and lol traded this game for some crappy AK47 in CS GO. Huehuehuehuehue. I gI have it 8/8 m8. pls liek no hate no homo tenks. Oh and btw the funniest thing about this game is brining your CS GO skills there, doing 1 hit kills and then getting banned from servers for hacking Like I have joined a sever once, done 7 headshots in a row without dying, then some speccy shit is sayin wh and aim off or im banning you. So yea this game is fabulous 8/8 would rate again.
This game is sooooooooooo fun special when u play the custom mods
Get this game is beastz
Would not really recomend because new players cannot even get a single kill because everyones a pro but still can be fun at times.
Good game when it game out. Super Toxic now
this game is like 10 dollars get it
Its still a masterpiece today in the new generation.   CounterStrike is easily one of the best military FPS games of all time. And when it comes with Condition Zero also a fun game for ten bucks, it is most certainly worth getting.  Take that COD!
My parents dont accept that Im gay 
The origin of addiction... One of the most fun games I have had the pleasure of enjoying and the one who threw me to the vibrant world of FPS, my favorite genre til this day. Now, important information do not be fooled by the amount of hours marked by Steam. There, when the beta versions were launched in 1999, when the game was free. Then 1.6 was launched until about 4 years ago, I had it in a different account, which I do not own anymore. Over a decade of gaming, several hours every day, which certainly have accumulated thousands of hours. By far the most played game throughout my life... You see, the first sentence that illustrates this review was not chosen at random. I had to stop playing completely, cold turkey, or I would fail high school. Just decided to buy it again and play for nostalgia sake. Im not afraid, Im much more self controlled now and the fact that Im not even half as good as before, kinda takes away the compulsion to play. By far the longest relationship I have ever had and we are getting back together... this is a good day.
Recomand!!
an excellent game...but sometimes is laggy...
good game for play 
I spent 2k hours playing this game NonSteam since I bought it on steam I dont feel like playing it. / 10/10
CounterStrike is a firstperson shooter game in which players join either the terrorist team, the counterterrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objectI have and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.  The objectI haves vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones  Bomb defusal The terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counterterrorists before it explodes to win. The counterterrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. Hostage rescue The counterterrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. The terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. VIP escort One of the counterterrorists is chosen to act as a VIP and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. The terrorists win if the VIP is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion. A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models four for each side, although CounterStrike Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten. Players are generally gI haven a few seconds before the round begins known as freeze time to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment some custom maps included neutral buy zones that could be used by both teams. Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.  Standard monetary bonuses are awarded for winning a round, losing a round, killing an enemy, being the first to instruct a hostage to follow, rescuing a hostage, planting the bomb Terrorist or defusing the bomb CounterTerrorist.  The scoreboard displays team scores in addition to statistics for each player name, kills, deaths, and ping in milliseconds. The scoreboard also indicates whether a player is dead, carrying the bomb on bomb maps, or is the VIP on assassination maps, although information on players on the opposing team is hidden from a player until his/her death, as this information can be important.  Killed players become spectators for the duration of the round they cannot change their names before their next spawn, text chat cannot be sent to or receI haved from lI have players, and voice chat can only be receI haved from lI have players and not sent to them. Spectators are generally able to watch the rest of the round from multiple selectable views, although some servers disable some of these views to prevent dead players from relaying information about living players to their teammates through alternatI have media most notably voice in the case of Internet cafes and Voice over IP programs such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo. This form of cheating is known as ghosting.
very nice game! Grew up with this! 3
old school
Nice game, Just nice
the nostalgia is real 11/10 
Played with BOTS So lonely Never listen as well  10/10
This game is basically just CoD with bad graphics. I rate it 10/10
Old school game 
Still great game I hope CS will lI have on forever D 
Source &gt 1.6
One of the best childhood games i have ever played! 10/10 !
Owsome Game 
For those who, put negatI have reviews, well not for those but for all of them, you write negatI have review just because game lags, its only your problem, much of the people has no problems with this game, this game can be ran easily on potato pc, same if you got a VAC ban thats your problem, thats your problem if youre stupid and cannot play legitimately, many cheaters in your opinion?? Find another server dont sit on one server, or go to Steamonly server. People play this game only for fun, there are no ranksnot talking about servers specific ranks, thats the most important thing. Of course teamgame on this mostly dissapeared, people play only by theirselves, but thats good, you know why? You will never get nervous if your teammate fails to defuse the bomb or something like that, because you play by yourself. Talking about game modes, oh God there are so much modes, starting from Surf ending with Zombie Plague. You can play this with your friends easily, cause there are no rank restrictions. The ban system and other things like amx_ban or amx_kick are highly fixed and upgraded at maximum. You can put whatever skins you want from CSGO and so on, and use it without any restrictions. This old  school game is being massI havely played for 16 years now and i think that after 10 years hes going to be played still.  Highly recommended!
Just amazing. Many mods. Just fun.
The graphics might be bad, but who cares? People said that Wind Waker was bad only for the graphics, but once you played it, it was AWESOME. Same with this game, the graphics might be bad, but what do you expect from a game that was amde in 2000? But once you play this, its really fun.
Its Ok i guess
I recommend any CS game
well christmas sale is here and the best online game ever available for 4.99 usd   go ahead   merry christmas and a happy new year
A classic and always will be! must get for classic game lovers!
  Its really good game. I recommend this game for you.
Best FPS for Valve. I love this game. You should really buy this epic game and its franchise.
old and shiny 
Its okay, i guess.
This Is The Best Game In The World I have played I LOVE THAT GAME   
It got at least 10 times better love story than Twilight and CounterStrike Global Offensive have.
Its csgo without skins.
Ok, I admit, I played this game back in my childhood on my original Xbox, and had so much fun. Not too long ago I reinstalled it for my computer, but when I did, I HATED it. I couldnt play right. People would one tap me from the side of the map, others will just be an absolute pro with the AWP making life so hard. Theres no mercy for new players, theres no official Valve servers, only the community servers which take away the classic feel. I have probably only joined 2 servers that have none of the stupid annoying Quake sounds. No double kill or dominating just classic CS 1.6. It was aggrovating for me, my favourite childhood game gone to waste, or so I thought. I was just bad at the game. I was scared to do anything. If I pushed in first, I thought I would get destroyed immediately. The guns felt weird and ridiculously inaccurate, the game didnt FEEL right, and anything I tried would ultimately fail. Well, until a couple of weeks ago.   I played violent. I played smart. I played gruesome and unforgiving. Getting 4 man spray downs and onedouble tap headshots across the map. I was ruthless, relentless, and I enjoyed it. This game was starting to be fun for me, not as annoying, not as frustrating, only fun, as I always wanted it to be. The thing is I learned not to be scared, the same with CSGO. I played CSGO, sucked at it, played horribly until I just began to not care if I died. That was when I began to play better. CS 1.6 came, and I began to be horrifying. Enemy teams would scream at me, I would laugh and continue, their unfornate moments was fuel to my wrath, until, of course as it always happens, a pro AWPer comes towards me and 420 swagscopes me in the face. Rage quit.  11/10 would get Blazed it again.
Its shiting CounterStrike.
The games dead. Its basically worthless to anyone in USA unless you want to play with third worlders. Even then theres only a few servers it looks like. I would rather die than play with South Americans. Anything south of the US border is just hell  I have never had a positI have experience online with these people and if you know anything about geopolitics I need not go into that, so I advise not dealing with these peoples idiocy and just going with CSGO these days unless you want to LAN this game.  One of the greatest FPS games to ever come out and will forever remain a classic but also a game that can still compete design and gameplay wise with games released in more current times. We will never have the natural form of support from players and ESPORTS ever again. This is before ESports was just a way for devs to market and shill a game. This was from when people who liked to play a game competed and not just a bunch of rich kids trying to win monetary prizes like ESports is now who else could play CSGO all day erry day in this economy?  People got behind this game because they liked it, instead CSGO is all about market manipulation and human psychology manipulating with less consideration about gameplay because they want the most monetary return. If the idiots will pay hundreds for a digital knife skin then why would any company invest in gameplay that wont have direct returns like a digital nongood would have?  The video game market is full of idiots who will dump money into anything now just so they can distract themselves from the politcs, economics, and slowly declining living conditions of the western world. Bread and circus in its truest form.  CS 1.6 is from better days, more honest days. When people who wanted to make games, and people who wanted to play games were very closely related and the average IQ of someone who was online was higher than now. These days every idiot has an internet connection. That is to say, the target audience then was just better than the target audiences of todays games. This is exampled many times in economics. Mediocricity Sells.
yea the best game .....
Best version of Counter Strike. For ME. D
sitdown you little shit‚ô•‚ô• im going to tell you a great story

CS 1.6 the best game of all times !!!
You know a game is doing something right when after 15 years millions of people are still playing it. Getting old sucks though and the only things dating it are of course its visuals and zoomed in FOV if you arent the sort of player used to using the 43 aspect ratio.
just buy this shitfuck masterpiece and love every second of it.
Well .. what can I say.. This game is very nice since CSGO was developed thanks to this game.. A lot of memories when I was a kid P and real fun to play
Whenever I want to have a break off counter strike  Global Offensive have, I play this game! ^_^
Havent found any russians so far.
My old school tactical fps.Its still have a classic atmosfere and gameplay.My best game from 90s.
I can never stop loving this, whether Im playing a fan game from somebody like Nexon, to a american football mod, to finding and playing the very nostalgic old beta editions, this game is still awesome enough to be one of my favs!
The first version of CounterStrike... play it, youll know later why it was the worlds number 1 online action game.

Legendary! Counter Strike 1.6  as it should be.  The game has stood the test of time, an yet still out does Counter Strike Source, as one of the most remembered, well designed, fun multiplayer shooters of the last decade.  9/10
Seinfeld is an American sitcom that originally ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattans Upper West Side in New York City although taped entirely in Los Angeles, the show features a handful of Jerrys friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza Jason Alexander, former girlfriend Elaine Benes Julia LouisDreyfus, and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer Michael Richards. It is often described as being a show about nothing, as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life. 
Best game ever, good old times 
Love It 3
Howdy partners, y all shitshitshits need to grow da shit up and play some GO.
One of the best FPS game.
Vary gud hax. us all tiem n VAC ban within 3 daiz. GG m80!
Obsolete ever since blaah, gaah, etc. became impossible to find. Used to spend hours on this, not anymore though.
Cool game. I like it because of bhop, knife, and zombie mod on modded servers
Well this is my childhood game.When I was like 5 my dad instaled me the multiplayer one. It was nice but I didnt get a kill so I closed it and never open it again until now. 3
Basically grew up playing, especially the simpsons servers.
I shoot bullets at a person, and they die from it.  Sometimes they do not.  Sometimes they shoot me.  Very deep storytelling.
MP ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ
I dont own this one either.
omg this cases skol shotings b&amp it plz   nvm it cool game play it   dont shot ppl in the irl tho   guns r bad mkay  
A days and moments to remember all the time fuck
I played this game not in steam got the cd and install it and have fun I played it since 2009
running this at 60fps doesnt really help seeing as how the animations are at about 15fps. gotta respect the classics though.
THE PHANTOM, EXTERIOR LIKE FISH EGGS INTERIOR LIKE SUICIDE WRIST RED I CAN EXCERIZE YOU THIS COULD BE YOU PHYS ED CHEAT ON YOUR MAN HOMIE AAAAH TRIED TO SNEAK THROUGH THE DOOR MAN cannot MAKE IT cannot MAKE IT, shit‚ô• STUCK DOOR STUCK, MAN DOOR STUCK! DOOR STUCK!
 I love Counter Strike, I should end it here. But Ill be honest and say I grew up with Source, wasnt old enough to experince 1.6 sadly. But giving it a try, its very different, having to buy ammo, see what the original maps looked like before being changed in Source. And dealing with pros that somehow can deal with the game choppyness and inaccuracy. Ill stick with Source, but great game!  9/10
Many people in this game have been playing since 1999+, and certainly have the skill to prove it. This game changed the gaming industry greatly, and is of very high quality, though ages like anything but a fine wine. Only get it if you have someone you know that can teach you how to play it. Otherwise stick with CSGO.
Bought it at 2004 best game!
injected speedhack.dll and ran cheat engine. still not vacced 10/10
Good Game but dont play if your donald trump lots of mexicans kinda unplayable cause whenever i join a server i gotta revert my controls or i get sent to another server and will do it mid game sometimes kinda annoying

Counter  Strike 1.6 is the most original first person shooter I played in my life. Counter  Strike is an absolute fun game with action  packed maps full of different varieties to choose from. There are tons of weapons from automatic to semi  automatic, shotguns, handguns, and etc. It will definitely gI have you a blast of fun memories and its a good game to enjoy for a long time. Check it out !
I am gonna counter your strike.
Im awful at this game. 11/10.
The game is good. 
Best FPS in my opinion 3  Old but gold
By far the best FPS game ever
Take yourself back to the good ol days with Counterstrike 1.6. FPS Multiplayer over the net, simple and easy to play, though not complex. Choose to host or join servers on different maps in either Hostage Rescue or Plant the Bomb scenarios. Theres no class distinction, how well you play is based on your skill level, choice of weapon/gear and a lot of being in the right place at the right time. Good, quick fun. ***

This game is old, has not many multiplayer servers and has graphics that arent the best, but I assure you that you will have some fun with it.

A clustershit of prepubescent children. Famous for the useless shit people stick on their servers. Also home of shit‚ô• shit and according to Hilary Clinton causes the most school shootings after Doom. CunterStrike is a MassI havely Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter mod for the hit online electronic computing internets machine game Halflife made many years ago.   It is aimed at brainless 13 year old boys and lifeless nerds who think its cool, not knowing its a secret recruiting tool for the special forces. Though of course no one can actually get into them, and real tools who cannot distinguish between gaming and IRL bad ideas join the army. Please note, if youre playing this game, you are gay. There is no hope, other than learning how to play better.   Note Requirements include being a fuck and looking like Brian Peppers.
The last time i played this game was at 2004. Now the shooter games have changed. Better graphics, better annimation and of course better physics. But this game even if passed 14 years, still remains in our hearts. 10/10
One of the best FPS games!!!
1 Of The Best Shotters After Years This Game Is AlI have  A Giant Community   10/10

Part of my childhood right there!  Playded it on a old fuck computer for about well over 100 hours  10\10
I think this game is great. It is a old game so the graphics are not as good as some of the newer fps but its a fun game. Its not a game you would play for hours day after day but it is great for playing when you get bored or to play now and then and i would recommend buying
Best childhood game. I wish they would bring back the silly maps like Nipper made.
Mannn fantastic game, hopefully the game keeps getting better and helps younger generations to enjoy the gaming scene.
The best game of 2000.
Counter strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential. You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought. I have NEVER enjoyed a game as much as i do with cs.
Most rage inducing game of all time 10/100
Spent so many hours on this game during high school! Now that GO is out, Im playig Counter Strike more.

Classic, it is!
  Underestimated it
Best oldschool FPS shooting game ever, we never forget you 
still the best game ever!
Its a classic, would recommend for life.
Finally switching to play CSGO, loved you.
Headshots, Monsterkills, Rampage! It is STILL after 10 years one of the best FPS defining games mods D ever created. Due to its age is not very demanding on your PC so there is absolutely no reason for you NOT to have fun, addictI have, balanced, competitive have multiplayer shooter.

Pretty good.
what its a classic
Classic. I and much of the community moved on to Source or CSGO, but this game will always be fun. Back when this game wasnt on Steam, a couple of friends and I played this on LANs. I still revisit this game from time to time, half of it for the fun, and half of it for the nostalgia.  There is still a very actI have multiplayer community so youll definitely get your moneys worth. Get some mods, make some friends, have a blast!
Like this *
This year , 99 is make a best Multyplayer shooter ever , realy , good job VALVE ! D
Hello. I play this game for more than 14 years and still happy and would be grateful for your gift to me in the new year game CounterStrike 1.6 thanks 
Pure classic  you must buy this game if youre a fan of FPS compared with TeamPlay.
Although this game was made 100 years ago, it still retains its core value being a great FPS shooter that requires team work and not just 360 no scoping. This game wouldnt mean anything to a 13 year old because the graphics arent great but to a person my age this game holds many hours in my heart. 8.5/10
14 years at still playing. If they drop supporting this game, I am going to lose my mind! Best server ever 64.74.97.10827015 friendly people NO cheaters located in the US join now
Great shooting game, of course like any game it has its flaws but this is a personal favorite of mine. Much better graphich then counterstrike 1.6. Game from 2006. but with excelent graphich. 10/10.
Still a great game after many years!
Old classic, fantastic game  A lot of servers with mods
The only extremely good CounterStrike game, unforunately they updated it and things got a bink wonky, but its still more impressI have than CSGO.
Dont..... P
Best multiplayer online FPS game ever? 
the bomb has been planted
The game is very fun for its age and I have had a lot of fun playing this. This game means a lot to me and to some of my friends. This game was my first ever multiplayer game when I started playing it in 2007, when I didnt have steam and had to pirate it, sadly. Im fairly sad that it is dying, but it had a good run. 10/10
Best Game in The world shit‚ô•essssssss!
This will be more of a my experience with this game type of review, because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something I have experienced with CounterStrike. Here you go  I remember back in 2002 I was at a friends house and he was playing a game. I didnt know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friends house. When I saw the CounterStrike logo I was filled with gamegasm ? and I was so happy. I dont remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. CounterStrike is my first game which I played competitive havely and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitive havely made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.  Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like CounterStrike are the ones that lI have to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple  defend as a CounterTerrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of CounterStrike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.  I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I have lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go  more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I have played with years ago. I think CounterStrike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today, if this game wouldnt exist.   I am sure many of people already have played games like CSGO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CSGO and modern games.  I am glad that I lI haved through the golden era of shooters and if Id have to rate it, itd 10/10 ofcourse,
Simply the best fps game.
One of the best old games ever
VAC is shitfuckt RIP CS /
Good clasic game
Best game in the history!  Join HidenSeek today and be awesome!
THIS WAS THE START TO ESPORTS
Its a world filled with racists, 12 year olds, drug addicts and Mexicans. They call it  CS 1.6
This game is so fun. I have almost 150 hours in it. 10/10
The real pillar of all FPS games ever to sprout out into the competitive have scene. Its been around for as long as I can remember and has literally changed the eSports scene. Very balanced and runs on one of the smoothest engines every made for a first person shooter. The game is outdated now and its successor CSGO is doing a good job at satisfying the professional scene while maintaining a very challenging and exciting gameplay
this game is AA VA SOME mast game hai
I dont need to say anything about this masterpiece.   CSGO has been out for 2 years now. As a long time CS fan Yes the hours on STEAM are short but if they logged the data on my game disk there would be at least 3000 hours on it CounterStrike 1.6 just gI haves me a certain feeling none of the later CS games gI have me. Listen, if you happen to be reading this because you are thinking of buying it, get it. It will be one of the most actionpacked amazing $10 youll ever spend.
LIke this game !
I started playing this in 2002. This is completely addictI have. Even at this age i like to play it when ever i have some free time.
Welcome to the world‚Äôs most fun over rated pile of shit.   Since I first got a PC nearly 3 years ago all I have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. And, after about 15 hours of play time I see why.   Right away I can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and I can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. For the first maybe 3 hours I played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. I figured I‚Äôm new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than I have been so I began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later I had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. And then remembered that that‚Äôs stupid, I shouldn‚Äôt be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while I have 5.  Another problem is the weapons  I can understand the weird names, Valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt still make fun of them. The damaged ratio is also complete shit‚ô•. The sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and I was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. The knife is a bit under powered but Thats better than it being a light saber. And For some reason the only guns that are ever used are the AK look alike the M16 look alike and the sniper rifle.   I should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. Its for sure a sextillion times better than any Call of Duty ever made. And I will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends ADHD kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. But it‚Äôs also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat. 
Legendary game with absoludly fantastic gameplay  I spent about 2000h on nonsteam version of this game and then i bought it, becose i got a respect to the developers and becose i loved and i still love this game. 11/10 there wont be any same and great game as 1.6.
3 this game
Itsgood
You should know this... it is the game to change all games of its type. It will be a part of my gaming forever! 
Its a very nice game. If you play with friends.
We all now Why? xD
It`s the great game. I love it and everything in this game. I recommend it everybody
the best!!!!
Do not hate the game becouse of graphics. When it was created it was HD but its time has passed.
To Jest Gra shit‚ô• D
yes nice game!!!
The reason i started gaming 3
Awsome.
Killed myself with a grenade.  moron/10
very classic game this is one of my memory from childhood
One of the best alltime multiplayer competitive have games.
Best game ever played!
The best tactical fps of the century!! a must have!
due to its special gameplay back in the time 10/10 .  now its just 2/10.
Awesome AddictI have game D
I like this game so much
one of my favorites!!
Trying to be the best
Dont let this Game Down ^_^
Best Game Ever Played. 
It still is the best counter strike
Old, but Gold
Nice Game But Not As Good As CSGO
Its nice.
Top shit
This has been one of the best and most competitive have FPS for the past 17 years. Its slowly dying, but still has an actI have community of 30,000 players daily.
EAC is trash... CAUTION
Counter Strike 1.6.... the game that set the standards of shooters and paved the way for new video games. On my old Steam Account, I racked at least 1000 hours on Counter Strike and Counter Strike Condition Zero, and all for a good reason, because it is probably one of the best team shooters in the world.  10/10
Almost 7 years of playing this game and still goin on! I hope it will not die because of global Offensive have. It will be a good idea to introduce steam achievements/trading cards for it, because its a very played game
CS was the very first FPS game I was introduced to over 10 years ago OMG, and I have been in love with it ever since.  Makes me a lil giddy sometimes, and compared to the graphics and simulation of todays shooters the quality is pretty shit Im prepared for some flak, but really, its like that bottle of wine that has aged and mellowed on the beloved alcohol shelf *hic*...NOTHING can beat the classics.  A bottle of the finest Chardonnay for this veritable *hic* shooter! And another just for me.  *Collapses in drunken stupor*
Classick!!!
i love headshots
Why does this game dont run normaly on my macbook 2008 Aluminium model? WTF. Frame rate is super low, i cannot move the mouse, its glitching as hell. This game should run perfeclty on my old tetris!
game is activated in particular region... now you are not in that region so you cannots play this game...! how to resolve this..!!
Even if CS 1.6 is old, I will continue to play it until my hands wont help me anymore. Not 2015 graphics but its one of the best epic fps in the history of the gaming for both kind of players, pros or for those who just play for fun.
very cool game XD
The only one game which could be named like sports event.
Since ~ 2003
Counter Strike 1.6 we love you !
Its old and the graphics are outdated... But screw that! This is really fun to play, even though there are tons of pros
Nice 3 Its so better then WarZoNe
My first love when I was 8 D
Awesome D i love this game D
CounterStrike is one of those games that still has people playing on servers 15 years later and probably still will due to its addictI have and competitive have gameplay. Strongly Recommend it. 10/10
the best game until csgo release
a verry good game and verry old !!!!!!!!
CS FOREVER
One of the best shooters ever made. No levels, no accessories for your guns, no cheat guns... just you and your skill.  Lots of hours spent in this game and so much fun I have had with it.   8.5/10    Uno de los mejores shooters de la historia. No hay nI haveles, ni accesorios, ni armas chetadas... solo t√∫ y tu habilidad.  Muchas horas jugadas en este juego y me he dI havertido mucho con √©l.  8.5/10
This game gave me swagger
I have spent so many hours playing this game, meeting new people.  I youve never played this game... whats wrong with you?
What better than a classic, theres nothing really left to say about this game. Its wonderful, totally worth of its entire price, that isnt that much either.
  The game is a godlike shooter!!! 3   The graphic is bad but in this game the graphic is not important^^...   The fun that you have in the game is OVER 100percent =   MUST HAVE *^*
Counter Strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential.  You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought.
nice game. runs without any problem on my laptop.
This game is so good man 10/10 IGN Even Counter Strike Source is more dead than this even here in 2015 its still funny Man trust me so funny!
Best Game ever made  HIghly recommended game if you are searching for a online game with so much popularity
Classic~
This game ruined my childhood pretty much
Very Good Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I really liked this game because its very good, Many Many servers and players you can play with I have some experience,but more memories when i first started to play this game. So i recommend it!!!!! to all its not some strong game that you will be in lag or your computer is weak and you cannot on this game,so this game is very small and everyone can play it!
So this game was released when i was still a sperm and still it has a huge popularity wich is insane no other game can do this EVER. counterstrike ha totally changed all gamers lifes amazing.
Classic CS doesnt get any better than that.
Its an awesome game. Have been playing it for years and still not fed up with it. CounterStrike 1.6 will never die! 
`1
my very first fps, been playing for 8 yrs now and i still love this game! imo this is one of the best games ever. Various mods make this game really addictI have, so you just cannot get bored.
Just a fun old school game
  10/10
Man awesome game been playing for years now thats all i can say 
I found that once I lowered my resolution to 640 x 480 I became 70percent better at the game. Makes heads bigger and easier to aim at so its pretty similar to CSS. gg ez noobs get rekt fgts easily 9/10 go buy it
very cool game D
so many memories.
This has to be one of my favorite CS games of all time !
This game is not only the best game of the fps gender ever made but it is also the best game ever PERIOD. It is literally hundreds of games in one. You can drI have cars, fly helicopters, fly planes, fly tie fighters, shoot lasers, play volleyball, play soccer, play football, play hide and go seek, ride bicycles, play dodgeball, immerse yourself in the warcraft world, be a superhero, be a surfer, be a rock climber. Oh yeah, you could also be a terrorist or counterterrorist and plant/defuse bombs on dust 1 or dust 2. There are other maps but you dont really discover them until 10,000 hours in. But once you do it opens you up to a whole new world of wonders. This game gets a 10/10. The only games that compete are other version of counterstrike, Team Fortress Classic, and Day of Defeat. I would gI have it an 11/10 but there are no killstreaks.
Bought this game on sale for 3 bucks. Never thought I would go back outside again. 69/10

The years have mold this game very nicely for the past 14 years this game has gone down as the FPS that started the series off with bang this game has everything from tatical game play to zombie infection modes. The game is made for all the FPS junkies out there its 14 yrs old but still puts smiles on all the gamers faces as they play this forever great series of games from the gaben overlord all hail the valve group for giving us this amazing game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cool game!
The old games its the best!!!!
awesome game u should gI have it for free to pro players 
AddictI have,But...Awesome!
Buy it! Best shooter game! For Me..
this is a old classic and i love it and its all around funn
juz loved it itz really nc
This is such a great MMOPG. You can play it if you keep getting wiped out in Half Life &amp Half Life 2. Though it would be better to get Counter Strike Source because it has the same maps as the original and has completely better graphics based on the Half Life 2 Source Engine.
I played this game when it was just a third party mod for half life. I cannot tell you how many hours of my life I spent fragging my friends. It is still my old standby and even though steam took it over eventually they preserved its life for an online game. I recommend you play the classic whenever you get a feeling for nostalgia.
fun to play with friends D
cannot get enough of this game, even after 12 years!
My Fav. game...i love it..i play daily.
One of the best games in this world !!!
played 75 Hours  
Classic awesomeness. Thats it. No need to say anymore
Best game 10/10 . If you have time you should play it  Worth its money,even for an old game,still rocking the shooters market.
Wery cool!!!
They broke the mold with this one.
this is a MUST if you want to get better at CS GO!  cs series has improved so much over the years now 
only game worth playing.
ABOUT Counter Strike 1. Amazing Gaming Experience. 2. Your game play will surely change with Proper Original Steam version. 3. Its an ORIGINAL GAME. Dont even do a second guess before purchasing it.   Couldnt Have Expected more
3 this game p XD D
I have wasted my life on this game, They might as well call it cocainestrike with how addictI have it is. I would strongly recommend getting this game
I can think back to the days when I had this game on CD, It was amazing. This game IS still amazing.  The game is refreshing to play and is jam packed filled with fun! It is my favourite game from the series due to the fact that this game relates back to the times when I first started computer gaming and is a classic which everyone will enjoy!  Pick this game up now!
This was the most awesome game I played for the first time, and still badass!
shit‚ô• the bombdiggy.
played more than 300 hours since steam is counting. this is a mustplay for everyone, an absolute classic.
Best first person game ever....^_^ Do u love first person game..dont have graphic card....this is the game meant for u.......^_^
Mexicans, more Mexicans, and even more Mexicans!
A simple 3D shooter game. Needs a lot of skill, some strategy and some brain of course.
An ncredibly fun, longlasting game, with a decently large playerbase with many friendly servers D I would definitely recommend this game.
Old is still Gold. Best online action game ever!
The best ever
great one!
 http//i76.photobucket.com/albums/j8/guv_is/fullteam0lpju3.gif 
Evergreen game .Still play it with friends
wish i played this a few years ago tbh
Best of game!
If you havent played it yet your not really a gamer!
The Best of his kind.
CS 1.5 or 1.6 was the birth place for me, to be a PC Gamer  10/10 !!
Nice Game.The Best First Person Shooter Game! 3
Old school player ! Love this game.
C.S. has got to be one of the best FPS of all time. It really was the game that made gaming what it is today. I still remember at high school everyone going to the internet cafe and paying to book out the whole place to just play C.S with all our friends. A great game which will always be an epic part of FPS history.
Awesome game.. A must play FPS
Great game, proving graphics arent everything. Recommend buying the game and enjoying the PRO experience!
One of the first Firstperson shooter games I ever played, and Im so glad it was. This game was amazing and I easily clocked 1000 hours over the years of playing. For its price now, you should definitely buy it. Source is good and all, but the original of the series is the best, by far.
Jumped into a game, got shot, respawned got shot, respawned got shot. Although this happened i probably should of looked at controls and realised i could buy other guns and stuff. still a good game 6/10
The best FPS game I have ever played. Many people are leaving this version of game saying that it is not upto the mark, but this is best base for all FPS games for which I respect this game and will play it forever.
NIce much better than valve!
this game is simply great and skill based the problem though is that most people who still play it are super experts litterly shooting through walls and kiling you when you spawn also the population is not to high but still there for the price i think its worth a buy
Good ol CS 1.6, best played on LAN.
im the best bro
Best shooter game  I love it ! D
Very cool and balanced game. Superb gameplay and unbelievably good for tournaments. Once youve played it youll never regret it. The only bad thing about this game is the community. Its full of scrubs, lamers, scammers, spammers and hackers. Its very hard to find a good and clean from all those dudes server, but when you do find it, you will forget all about them and will enjoy all your hours of play.
The quentissential competitve FPS. Get it you wont regret it, unless you suck balls.
The best realism HalfLife mod as its the one everyone remembers. Causing incalculable rage in dialup users for years and years. If youre bad youre a nub, if youre good youre a hacker, if youre just mediocre then youre just right.
BACK in the dayy!...
The best ever.
Probably this game doesnt need any introduction, old and good, still played by a large number of gamers, on of the best online shooter that was created. Still remember my first days finding a good version of the game and playing with bots.
Always a pleasure to kill you 
You have to own CounterStrike if you even have the slightest interested in First Person Shooters.
Well, what can I say? You know what to do.
Alltime classic game. Will always be my number one counter strike version.
Rating 10/10  The game which basically brought me to the world of gaming. From 1.05 to 1.6 I have spent enormous number of hours playing this game and even its now getting old and pushed out by CSGO, I still have nostalgy. Best nonstory FPS at that time and still better than many modern FPS moviebased games.
Its 1.6, nuff said.
Same old CS... Good game, one of the best shooters of all time.  Nowadays its graphics seems a little outdated. But HL engine still works pretty nice.  Still better and less robotic than CSGO.
May be old but still worth it to get it.  
$$$
The best &gt
really awsome game really recomend it
The Greatest Game of All Time
Pretty Dope
Its very drake.
Great game and classic FPS game! Should play if you like shooting and..shooting D
The one that started it all.
Oldie, but far more than goldie!
So good, Classic FPS game. AlI have for decades!
CounterStrike is a FPS/Tactical Shooter where two teams are fighting Terrorists and CounterTerrorists. Multiple game modes like Save Hostage or Explode/Defuse the bomb. The action is very fast. It is one of the most played game from gaming championship.
Best Counter Vs. Terro game
If you pick up this game now, you will most probably get wrecked by people who have mastered the game. Just a warning. Bloody good game though.
One of the legendary games which is still fun to play after 15 years of making .   Proves even without graphics and mechanincs what a game can achI have. Those who love multiplayer and have not bought this game  totally worth it !!  I recomend you try it out  ..   Gamplay centered game.  If you have friends to play along this game is totally worth spending time on . Extremely addictI have ...
Great game. Spent untold countless hours with it.
Greatest game ever created.
Greatset of all time
This game legend!
Enough said  BUY IT!
Pew pew.  Grew up with this pew pew so I cannot say anything bad about it. I do think it has aged a bit and that CSS has preceded it but I also know there are people who think that there aint no better CS than 1.6.. or 1.5... or 1.3... well to each his own.  Pew pew with a ROUGH difficulty curve. If you come from the casual CoD MP crowd you quite possibly will hit a wall straight away. But this game is far more rewarding to get into. The better you get at it, the more enjoyable it gets.
cannot wait for CounterStrike 2.0
I have spent over 5000hours on this game, how can I hate it? 10/10 best cs ever made hl1 3
Very good game the mother of all FPS games !
Very fun and addictI have game
Nice to all who like a Classic online shooter in which u can play against good others. Allthough like all other online games there are some idiots. but if u dont care about them its really nice to play
CSGO IS THE BEST 3.
good graphics, great fun!
One of the best FPS multiplayer games out there, a must buy
First game I played. Only game I loved so much.
old school if you havent played this game you suck
Its a good game.
15 years on and this is still the best First Person Shooter FPS Game in the history of Gaming which formed the base for all the new FPS games developed so far!
In my opinion 1.6 has less hacker than CounterStrikeGlobal Offensive have. Then again 1.6 is made up of a few servers with small coumminty base and more than likely has an admin in game. Best physics in any CounterStrike game. Probably not top notch graphics.. Just get your friends and have a shit
A classic that should not be overlooked.
Beats Call Of Duty crap every day of the week.
Classic oldschool
lot of hackers ....bt gg!!!
Its Counter Strike.
In love with this game 3 #GodSlayer
Just amAzing 3.. most complete first person shooter game D
Best fps for life! Have been playing it since 2002. Never gets old!
Its ight.
Who doesnt love CS?

Best multiplayer FPS D
Fun classic game involiving alot of strategy and team tactics. Hard to get used to.
old school.
Best online game D......
Simply, the best fps game ever.
counter strike is a game that teaches you how to use your eyes to there full potential. You must be a fast thinker and good at stratigic thought. I have NEVER enjoyed a game as much as i do with cs
alongside unreal tournament 1999, quake 2/3 and natural selection as the greatest shooters of all time 10/10 i got one clicked through a wall
nice game, great gameplay, graphics is poor as hell
This game is OG
Check out the real one! Not the ones, where they increased movement speed. The Hardcoregame.
Play the game.
CS 
Bored of CSGO? Nothing beats the original!
have a bug 
My favorite game #1
I think it`s the best of the CounterStrike. Graphics aren`t good but it`s not most important part of this game.
Is the best game i play in my childhood
Very recomended.
One of my first FPS game shame that now is somewhat filled with mod and hackers this game is still fun and double Sin mind I spent with that crap out of call of duty on this game people spent years of their lI haves becoming stronger but even if you dont and the height of certain people youre still awesome
No doubt this is the best online game
Good old times
legendary game but the sad thing is there are so much cheaters.. =/
Skill Teamwork Tacticas Fun
Great game with an actI have community! Just dont expect to be playing any normal missions any time soon, i also enjoy the smoke in this installment, you can see through it if you walk right through it, also it is suprisingly difficult for the first installment, maybe im just bad, i dont know, so anyways get this game if you like team based FPS if you dont like that genre, i reccomend you skip this one, 7/10
AcL.CsBesT.Ro //  www.csbest.ro

The best game ever made.
Awesome !!! I enjoy a lot playing it! 
0_0
Awesome Game Y
There really isnt much to say about this game that most people dont already know. It is a classic in any and every definition of the word. Although the graphics are now considered quite dated, it somehow doesnt change the appeal and visual accessibility of the game itself. Perhaps newer gamers and people trying it out for the first time in todays gaming world will never develop a bond that veteran CS players will forever cherish with the old school counterstrike, but for us, this game will always be the goto first person shooter and will endure as the trendsetting sage of all future shooting games to come. Rivaled only by the likes of the Battlefield series though obviously not comparable as they are essentially different games albeit being firstperson shooters both, counterstrike is an absolute treasure and for the pennies you could snatch it for, it is definitely worth your while as well. If you do not have this game, please buy it.
Addicted to CS. Hell Yeah !!!
Cs for life, 10 years playin cannot find a replacement.
this is a good game for kids as its not real life graficts. and servers with mods are sometimes good.
This game is super!!!!
this is the one
best game of all time
one of the best firstperson game that exist
Awesome game to play still after so many years
You Kill Someone They Die.   You Get Killed You Die.  Heart breaking story
Still the best game ever made.
The Game that every hardcore gamer wants to play
Its not a game... Its THE game. Simple as that!
its a very good game for relaxation and even for joy... the best part of it is defending others!
cannot express it in words. The Best Game ever played in my life. Have soo much memories. Must play. The best online multiplayer game ever. D
Great AddictI have Game. This is the ultimate 1st first person shooter! Did you get my pun 
the best multiplayer game ever  . .. .
CounterStrike 1.6 is most popular game i think, i like community of players , simple game, definetly recommending to play it, more joy 
Kreedz for life yo
This game is for nabs
One of the best online multiplayer games of all time.
Potatoes have skin, I have skin, therefore i am a potato
Simply classics.
shit‚ô•
Good one !
The mother of all.....
The best of the Best
I love this game its such a classic that stands the test of time I highly recommend it
In short way, this is the best game! D
Best fps game before csgo 
nothing to say 1.6  classic
Must play game.
Got to love this game man. Counter Strike 1.6 Forever D
I highly recommend this game if you are into FPS games. This is the legendary game that started it all. Trust me, if you buy this game you wont regret it. Its graphics for 17 or more year old game, are pretty good. It has good servers and alot fun minigames to them. 
One of the most groundbreaking and legendary Multiplayer games in the history of video games. All created by 1 guy in his college dorm, in this spare time. It doesnt get any more awesome than that.
Ingatoze tresury machuqet ketilo bidzieboo D
Best game in the history of ever 3
5/5
Its a fun game that used to be a top multiplayer game, but got overshadowed by its source remake and CSGO
The granddaddy of FPS!!!!
Much better then the new counter strike games.
Great game..
One Word. Amazing.
Best game ever made... Domination of movemenet, shooting mechanics  recoil... Exaclty what a FPS game need... When developers of this game genre learn that this 2 things are the most inportant for good FPS, they will make a game as good as CS 1.6 is... CSGO does not have these major aspects, and doesnt deserve name of CounterStrike IMO. As a third very important thing for FPS game, I would say the animations... The animations of player models such as runnig, walking, crouching, gun holding/fireing/reloading etc... Graphics isnt so important, doesnt need to be sooo good, but decent due to visibility...
Oh yes this is the best game to play with friends!!
Over 1000 Hours and still playing!
Really nice game!!!
The most popular FPS ever After UT/Q
Best game ever , I played it since 2004
This game is the game that started the CounterStrike series. It started as a mod for the game that started it ALL, HalfLife. Like Team Fortress, CounterStrike became a standalone game after its popularity as a mod. If you enjoy the old HalfLife engine, GoldSrc, and want to play a shooter that doesnt have a complicated story and chapters, CounterStrike is the game for you. Condition Zero is the same game but with a campaign mode that allows you to play with bots and unlock maps as you go.
Great and cheap multiplayer awesomeness!
The best game ! 
Its the most ultimate game a person can ever play !!! Love Everything about it !!!
The best miltuplayer game ever. Love it always.
Good game, but keep in mind its hard to find pcw now when cs go came out!
A Classic shooter that everyone still play and enjoy, A game that almost any male person in my country has played.
Its decent.
BEST MULTIPLAYER GAME...csgo is the 2nd best multiplayer game
This game has a odd aiming system compared to CSGO and CSS so this is a true classic and it is still fun today but it does show its age a little. 8.9/10
True good memories , couldnt forget it ~

HELLO I HAVE PURCHASED CS ANTHOLOGY ,BUT WHEN I AM TRYING TO INSTALL TO UPDATE STEAM IT ALWAYS SHOWS FATAL ERROR ,THERE IS NO INTERNET CONNECTION ,HOW CAN I RESOLVE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IF I DO NOT UPDATE IT ,I CAN NOT LO GIN TO PLAY .PLS HELP ME.
Highly recommend, the hardest CS to play due to a unique way of aiming which was new when the game came out, and the dodgy rego.
LOve THIS GAme!!
Doesnt need no intro.. I mean come on, this is CS1.6. The godfather of all competitive tactical shooters! Best FPS to date. _O_
its bit old now , but it was the best game i played as a kid ...i loved it and i have my Copy
fun to play wid frnds
Although most of the servers are full of allcaps spamming people from foreign countries talking smack to one another, the game is still excellent. You should be learning how to play on this before making the switch to CSGO.
a oldy but still a goodly
Best game ever...spent more than 10 happy years playing it. Beware of cheaters tho. GL &amp HF
Best fast shooting game ever
One of the Best First Person Shooters Ever  the thing that makes this game so awesome is that you will always have competitiveon and theres no excuse for losing or winning because the only thing that can make you good in it is experience there are no ingame purchases and its really hard to get pro or even decent as it doesnt have autorecovery as many FPS nowdays Highly Recommended
The legendary 1.6. Worth all the money, eventhough there is csgo and css. BRILLIANT!

Great game and what I suggest is getting it on steam because it comes with condition zero and its better like that because condition zero has a campaign and normal counterstrike is great with multiplayer so get this game
good game but can be frustrated! D
Buy Valve Complete Pack 71.99Euro i Buy or Counter Strike Global OffenZI have
Best game ever made, even better then cs go 
this is like , old is gold 
I really like the game...
Do I need to say why do I recommend this? Because this is freakin awesome! Thats why...!
Better than CSS and CSGO
Whenever I play this game I have the urge to go back to high school then smoke some dank buds and tell my mom to go to hell. Linkin Park 4 ever.
One of the best games of all time. A staple in competitive have and casual gaming. It pretty much paved the way for competitive have team esports.
The old Classic CounterStrike. The best CS, and the game that got FPS Gaming on the map.
i never played it
The original hard core multiplayer shooter, still played to this day, steep learning curve but nothin can replace the classics, simple, quick paced and unforgiving, just what youd expect from the CS series. 9/10
preety much the best game of all time
Awesome game always worth it
One old, but good thing 
The OLD is GOLD  This Game is amazing
Got old but still good ^^ recomanded
best game but to much cheaters
Very Very Good.
Well, when it comes to an good old fashioned cops n robbers chase, it doesnt get any better than Counter Strike. Sure some might call the 90s graphics outdated and the weapons unbalanced. Thats why some just buy the other games such as GO or source. IF you doesnt have any problem with sweet and smooth nostalgia, then Counter Strike is for you! D
Best Tactical, competitive have game ever. Its almost about 15 years old and the community is still large.
nice and awesome game...is was and it is the best fps game for me..although it is not in competatI have arena now..but i enjoy this game the most P
No Classes, Bad Level design, no fish AI. Its horrible.  11/10, srsly buy it, its better than Call of shit‚ô•‚ô• Money Stealing shitfucks Modern Season Pass.  Its the father of todays fpsgrandfather being the quake and doom games and its still fun.
AWesome game!!! one of my favourites.
Can enter only original, new mode surf ski server manages a unique mode Who publishes a candidate for Admin Ielhhh join now =] 84.94.214.17320889    $$$$$$ Cs 1.6 $$$$$$
An absolute classic which is a must have for any young boy starting his gaming life.
its a cool game 
i dont currently have much hours on the game but from a beginers standpoint its a really solid game. just has a pretty steep learning curve and i still die more than i kill but when you do kill someone its pretty cool that guy has to wait like 3 minutes before he can play again. 8/10
Why do you not already own this? 
Nice game ..!

20052012Legendary game, regular online. 20122014Dying soldier. TodayOldschools carousel. You can get some old feelings, but not much more. So, thats not a useless waste of money.
like the other CS games but can run on any potato
Love this game 
Hii , Why do not I see the publication of the counter I play .. and I see the table several killed up no picture .. Why ? Ndirr this game .. and someone could help me please?
history, best cs ever
SImply a classic game, nothing will ever match the tension of being the last terrorist on your team and trying to detonate the bomb, has it aged well? Pfft no, but if you want to experience what got many people into online shooters then buy it. You honestly deserve it. Unless you have the new CounterStrike.
Gold Edition
Its a really good game if you are good at it and got time to spend!
classy
The one and only yeah..
Worth every penny! Great game!
This game is immortal.
Is aight
CSGO NEXT GEN shit.
game for nerds ,bad story line.
Having only played CSGO for the past year or so, it is really nice to see what that game was rooted off of. I now know playing 1.6 what all the hype about Counter Strike is and the history behind it. 1.6 for its time period was such a benchmark game. Really awesome!
Best moment of chldish age D
This is the only PC Game which I play till to date from the time it was released. I am playing this game for past twelve or thirteen years and I am still very much addicted to it. The game play is phenomenal, highly challenging and had a very realistic feeling during then. The recoils are amazing and very realistic. This was the only game of its period to have gun recoil. The whole game playing skills revolved around the ability to control the guns recoil which was its best feature.   Great game of all times !!!  Cheers!
Legendary Game. Nothing more to say xD
The most beautiful game I have ever seen!
 https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=WujdtsHUWVg 
after reinstalling steam ALL SERVERS ARE LOST!!!!!  Sometimes cannot find servers...
game,that made‚Äã‚Äã history!
This is best game in all world online games    lalalala
Absolutely speechless, is what I am when I think of the CounterStrike series. Look at this game, it was one of the most detailed FPSs for its time and it still has it. No game series has been able to remake CSs addictI haveness or its smooth gameplay. This game is one of the few titles that still requires skill, every weapon is earned and every weapon requires its own type of mastery. A truly great title that me and many others will return to play for a very long time.
Cheaters paradise.
This game is good... ...But be owned by professionals who have been playing when it was on WON.
this game is the shiting good damn son shit‚ô•
1.6 the best
The classic shooter upgraded with modern controls CounterStrike was something unseen, yet highly needed in the late 90s and early 00s. It carried with it the idea that you didnt need a single player story mode to make ripples in the video game industry. As future competitors would attempt to reflect, all CS needed was an incredible skillbased gameplay with a startoftheart ability to play against players from around the world. Toss in some alternate gameplay styles to help break up the chance of monotonous moments and throw it all over a large assortment of levels for good measure you‚Äôll end up with a dish that, for years, has been best served with a dedicated server and a good group of friends. Its no wonder that CS gave birth to some of the best online team play the world has ever seen and continues in that tradition to this day. If you havent played the original CounterStrike yet, youre missing a small part of your soul... hurry, go get it back by quick scoping with an AWP down Long A on de_dust2.
Pfff.... Nothing much too say the games old odseivly I dont reccomend it anymore but for the time this game was realised it truly shined.
CounterStrike, it is literally impossible to be a PC gamer and not know what this game is. Theyre all great. Go play them.
nice shooting game
What a fun game. As a single play mania it was a little bit shame to see no bots in Counter Strike but there were still many servers running so youll have no problem playing it. Since there were no actI have asian servers because Nexon got hold of asian market with Counter Strike Online I had to play in a Brazilian server which made me go through horrible lag but even with the lag it was still enjoyable. Gear up, You can still enjoy the beginning of Counter Strike series.   + Easy and straightforward game play. Shoot on sight. + Optimized Aiming.
Nice OLD School Game 
The best game 3....
Old School 3
I dont dislike, like, love or hate this game,
Best online FPS ever. The simplicity of this game makes it one of the most fun to play, with a match never the same to another. The Steam version has no changes or bonuses whatsoever.

Very Nice OldSchool Game
This game is awesome!!!!!! Just got it last night and brings back soo many good memories, I recommend it to everyone!!!!!! =P
So good 10/10. Played this game when i was ten. IST MAGNIFICENTLY!!!!!!
A very fastpaced shooter with great gameolay at the time when it came out, today occupied by a small pack of hardcore Counter Strikers that will not forgI have a single move of the mouse that is slower than theirs.
Good classic shooter, and followed up increased players, very low specs needed, hugely populated and simple fun.
good game, one of the best made in its time 10/10
This game is the most impressI have game I have ever played since I was a child . I recommand this game to all of you .
I played this game for over 5 years when i was young, brings me back so many memories!
#SoEasyForMe
Its a good game
this game is always fun! 
this game is my favourites game D
The best.
Its a game very interesting . Im very happy because I can play it.
Best FPS Multiplayer game ever. Better Than CSGO. 333
Good Game for ever!!!!
Classic FPS of my generation. Enjoy 3
i really wish for this game to be mine , a very competitive have and teamdependent game, with lots of action , really good to relax your nerves , i played it for hundreds of hours not the original , of course 10/10
Buy Steam accaunt 6 $ 
Very good classic shooter game.
That is so good  !
D WOW. its so F***ing old game. I mean every body is just counter GO now. but i still love this game and love its bugs.
A timeless classic. This game got me started on steam. I wasted many nonrecorded hours of my life on this game. The buggy vehicles are the most fun vehicles I have ever played with in any game ever. I cannot believe they left vehicles out of the source engine games. I also miss nipper maps and the community surrounding them.
Am ban pe eac xD
It¬¥s counter strike, just buy it.
First, and best game I ever had on steam. I dont like csgo at all, I only play cs 1.6 4 life 
The first FPS/Game I played on PC and to be honest those years playing CS1.6 5+years were simply AMAZING !  At the time the gameplay was perfect ! the game was really easy to handle and understand, the graphisme ? When it came out it was really good and enough, then the game never grew up and we never had patchs / new versions. But it was still fine as long as we could all developpe our skill and create new strats.  We got a lot of mods like zombie deathmatch gungame jail and for me the best mods HideNSeek, Kz, Deathrun etc...  To be honest those years were truly a pleasure to play.  Thank you so much to create a game like that.  Without counting that now we have new versions and eSport is growing everyday!
Easily the best FPS game ever made, ever.
Its an awesome game.I wish for a long time to buy it on steam and finally I did it.And now I am enjoy it.I have more possibilities and more doors opend
Back to basics!
BEST GAME OF THE WORLD
The developers of the HalfLife Mod, CounterStrike really knew what they were doing when they said they wanted to construct a mod like no other. It was, like HalfLife, something new for the public to lay their bored eyes on. There never before was a mod about Terrorism vs Counter Terrorism, and thanks to the two developers of the game, it happened. Why Terorrism vs Counter Terrorism though? It was only something new and that is it. It was something to literally wow the public with intense competitive have multiplayer gameplay. It was something people actually payed attention to and thought it off as a sport. So fourth, this mod has been recognized so much that more installments have appeared, and that is an amazing thing for a game that once started off as a mod. Just like Team Fortress and how that continued on into Team Fortress 2. I have yet to play Global Offensive have but I will do that some time in the future.  Its games like these that always amaze me with their originality. And I believe CounterStrike is one of those games that deserves to be noticed and introduced to FPS fans across the world.   This is a must buy/play.
,,Need Help I need Cs 1.6 Set launch setub please help me.    
Good game, most popular,
Good old game.
Cool + rep
I think the hours speaks for itself.
The Best 3
99,9percent of the players cheat. I recommend this game for cheating since VAC sucks. 
It hasnt aged that well, but it still holds a lot of nostalgia. It also lacks offline deathmatches with AI bots. Otherwise, its a great game.   FINAL RATING 82 out of 100
shrek is love, shrek is life
Well its an oldschool csgo, i would recommend this game to the guys/girls with the .... not so high tech computer!! 
The best FPS of all times! No doubt about it.
Counter Strike everybody know what this mean.
Probably best action game ever! This game is so old and still so popular!
Is a good game from our childhood
Best game, I hope the competitive have scene comes back again!
Realy realy good game
OLDIE BUT GOLDIE !!
i like it its nice have a nice day
This game is just.. LIFE. Especially the mod Hide n Seek
Best game ever. Too bad noone plays it anymore. CS GO is alright, but this was the bomb.
Defining FPS since 1999.
The game is very good but the cheaters are the problem. 
Old but gold, definitely the best game ever3 
Best game since rocket league, uhm no wait
still better gameplay and servers then cod
CounterStrike 1.6 is easily one of the best shooters out there. I have good history of making teams and playing against other teams or just having fun with friends in public servers. It was out of this world when it came out and in my opinion had the best professional scene at the time. I played it on and off for about 7 years.   Bud sadly CS 1.6 doesnt hold up for me. Until playing CSGO I was still very into the game. After playing CSGO for few months I tried playing CS 1.6 again, but the graphics and shooting mechanics are just awful at this point, it just doesnt hold up.  If you are new to gaming or just CounterStrike, you should probably skip this game and just go right to CounterStrike Global Offensive have. Its an amazing upgrade from an amazing game.
Masterpiece of an FPS! This game revolutionized FPS gaming forever. With some of the elements still being used today. For a game released at 1999, this aged surprisingly well, with over 1000 servers still up. Still as addicting and fun as in 1999
Cs 4 Life
1.Buy this game 2.Try this game 3.You like this game 4.Play this game 12/24 and repeat one

Old is always gold 
Great game, best cs
Best shiting game ever. This awesome.
0ld But Gold.............
Death is a great teacher. Failure in CounterStrike Global Offensive have is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldnt have done, and how you could have done better. CounterStrike players spend a lot of time learning  consequently, they are always getting better.  Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive have, especially if youre coming into CounterStrike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skillbased firstperson shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you‚Äôre a Call of Duty player, you‚Äôre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. CounterStrike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it‚Äôs always done best. Global Offensive have modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.  For the uninitiated, CounterStrike Global Offensive have is a smallscale, teambased firstperson shooter with permanent death. When a counterterrorist kills a terrorist planting explosI haves in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesnt respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objectI have, meanwhile, gI haves everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will gI have the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.  Pieces of the CounterStrike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive have is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. Theres an addictI have justonemoreround quality to it, because theres a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they cannot sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim CounterStrike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best  the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.  Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive have doesn‚Äôt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to CounterStrikes aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it bruteforces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive have game is that killing in Global Offensive have requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or onthefly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if youve bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machinegun fire.  Consequently, killing in Global Offensive have feels good. Theres a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know theyre not coming back. Its also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players arent watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, theyre more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when youre getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.  If youve played CounterStrike before, Global Offensive have probably sounds a whole lot like CounterStrike. Like CounterStrike Source before it, Global Offensive have exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive have shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.  Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. Theyre particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode arent as big as classic CounterStrike arenas ‚Äì entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location ‚Äì but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout  theres a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players cannot buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast youll need to be quick on your feet.  Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. Its the most chaotic and carefree mode in Global Offensive have, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. Its a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race  a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC.  If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience CounterStrike Global Offensive have. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PConly options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about longterm PC support  it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2s level editor was PC exclusI have. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive have is the same great game.
Best Game Ever, This game fill me with my all history from this game 3 I fill now so good. I remember how I play this game when I be like 79 years old  This game still hard to me  I better in CSGO   Thx for reading. Max
Best team fps ever.
Took 2 steps, was murdered by hacker Respawn Took 2 more steps, killed by air  CS in a nutshell
2 minutes of silence for all the deaths in de_dust2
Steam would be nothing without this game !@&amp!
I come back to this game as often as possible. Truly the best shooter out there and a timeless classic.  10/Bomb has been planted.
I do not have much to say on CounterStrike/CS1.6 but with it being the first standalone game modification for Half Life using the Gold Source Development Kit it turned out pretty well even in the 1.0/1.5 mod, oh yes and the hostages on 1.0 where scientists, due to the fact the developers didnt make some hostage NPC models in time for the release and the Hostage models where still NPCS and came out later in 1.6. And during Beta Version 4 BV4 Valve became interested in the game that was being developed, hired the developers for valve to help make it better, and in a few years the original developers quit making the game and let Valve take control of it. If you like the classic First Person Shooters from around 19952002 this is basically the game for you. Also you can shoot through almost every wall with every gun in the game. I gI have this game an 9/10
best game for all of lovers y
Hi i bought the game couple days ago but it`s not working if u can`t help me i would like my money back ! Or if some1 can help quickly with some advice, Thanks ! 
It was, it is, and it will remain the best Counter Strike ever.

Played this game like it was my crack for a couple years in college...still think its one of the best games ever modded/created.
Counterstrike without russians!!
CS CS C shitING S! NOSTALGIA + LIFE = COUNTER STRIKE
1. Install 2. HEAD SHOT 3. Uninstall 4. Repeat  buy to suport this great game, 2015 and still top 10/15 in the current player count in steam
A classic mostly got this to to play GMOD. Had a bit of fn playing online, people still play!

The daddy of tactical fps titles. Still as playable now as it was back then.
90s
The best game in the world. Thats all. B
I have been playing CS Source and GO for a while now, I bought the valve pack and thought itd be fun the play those games since I have always been a HalfLife fan. I have played it when i was younger, and it brings back memories.  The game is really nice, still to this day. I love playing new maps, do scrims and have fun with my competitive have team.  Would recommend! Although most servers are Spanish, its still fun if you dont know the language.
The best of the best ! From 1999 to  3333 !
Need to fix Viewmodel , Cuz Used to other cs things , Rest  Awesome  Old is gold , yeah 
Best Multiplayer shooter
This game I dont like because they are all using a cheat... Otherwise its good 
Best FPS Game ever, but i can say its already dead for 2 years now cause VAC cannot hunting the hackers anymore.. Visit My Server  94.23.30.17927020
BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE I MOSTLY PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS ONLINE LOVE IT I WOUD RATE 5 STAR OUT OF 5
Better, more addictI have, and easier than CSGO Alot of people still play it, and its counterstrike. So buy it.
Best cs i`ve ever played. You need strong aim, hard brain and not the best computer to master this game. Played this between 20022009, old graphic but perfect balanced and maps with clearly edges .  Its my favoured shooter between 20002010. Buy and play it
This first person shooting game is quite good. but the developers might have worked on the Bugs. Its pretty much addictI have. Best for LAN gaming, less suitable for Internet gaming in India
Old school fps game,
Its a must have, no question asked. If you dont own it, go to the nearest mirror, slap yourself, look how stupid you look. Once youre done with this bad advice I gave you, return to your computer &amp add the game to your Steam cart &amp purchase it right away. [Dont do tomorrow what can be done today.]
The best CS of all. excluding 1.5  that was the actual best
the one and only, forever 3
This game is LIFE! 3 CS 1.6 forever green !
!!!!!! 
What is there really to be said about this game? Its CounterStrike! Its where all games get their inspiration from. Its what all the best shooters aim to be. Its been out since 1999 and is still more popular than all of the current games out there. This game will never die, will never lose its fan base and will always be the best. If you have to think about buying this game then chances are you are some Halo or COD fanboy who cannot handle REAL gaming on PC.
Love CS!
CounterStrike is a classic teambased multiplayer game combining fast gameplay with a simple map system of planting/defusing bombs and rescuing/holding hostages. The game established many basic multiplayer features that are now taken for granted in newer multiplayer games.
Best of the best! ^_^
ok, i love the game, but i kinda messed up the resolution, and now it makes my game huge and i cannot see most of the screen. what do i do to fix it? 
This games community is not that ruined as its rivals
go back in time and play this pile of shit game, yes please.
Graphics Doesnt Matter
lets come back to the best game D 
Quite simply the best first person shooter.
I think this is the game I have played most in my lifetime of gaming and I thank Valve for keeping it updated throughout this whole time. You will always be remembered!
its very fun game , but its hard for newbies
The Chess of FPS
A classic. cannot beat it
If you love intense, enjoyable, and competitive have FPS games then this is the game for you, Why you may ask? It is one of the most decorated Shooter games of the 20/21st centuries.
Still great, after so many years.
Very fun game, I played it a lot when I was much younger.  child memories right here
Great game! I never played it much because of other great counterstrikes but I wish I had, out of all of these I have enjoyed this the most, high fps, decent graphics and simplistic. Good game to enjoy with friends and is totally worth the money, if not it is worth more! Just because it came out in 2000 doesnt mean you have to stop caring. CSGO is good but no game is ever better than this!
i love this game but now iam going to cs.go bay cs
this game is made by gods never take many hours to multyplayer mmorpg games exept but esteque fps truth is very good game
Classic and still played
The original that started it all, CounterStrike paved the way for future competitive have onlinemultiplayer shooters, as well as the modding community. It may not be as big as Global Offensive have, but it sure is fun in the current year.
one of the best cybergame!
Nice game for people who have got a wooden PC like me...
I liked this game
Still playing!
Almost all the games that I have in the library  excellent. In a review on CounterStrike GO I have already stated my opinion.
Very nice ... oldschool game
.. 
This is a great game. Very different from go
My favorite game of all TIME
old game, but still good. 3
AWESOME GAME !! IN THE WORLD LOVE TO PLAY IT ! D
.132
Thanks for the memories.. ‚ô•
The most classic FPS game. CounterStrike is a mod of the legendary HalfLife by Valve. Even if it was released at 1999, people still play it due to its essential playabillity. It contains a lot of different gamemodes and you can easily learn how to play it. I recommend it.
Its bestial game!
recomand !
Its very simple and is the best
Best game in the history!  1.6 Never die!
The best action FPS game ever made. Hands down. 10/10 Would play another 1k hours.
Better than source
15 years later and its still kickarse.
The Greatest Game Ever Created, My Childhood. Ill always have a spot in my heart for 1.6 If 1 review has every lead you to try a game, let this be the one, youre not a gamer until youve played CounterStrike 1.6 PERIOD.
.3123213
PROs KA ADDDDA... P
Ahh... Good old times.
rekt.  play cs go xD
First game i got on steam. played it so much. best version of counterstrike no doubt.
This game is classic. 10/10 RamboBiscuit
Been playing CounterStrike for years, although I have never seen a CounterStrike game in which the Terrorists are caucasian I must say theyre still fun games. The XBox version had the terrorists be oriental, which made me question the game slightly, but it does not ruin the fun factor. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys games. Why buy COD when you can buy this wonderful timeless game that doesnt cheat you of your money but makes it worthwhile, get bored? Lots of custom servers to play. Enjoy.
Skins are free. I now have a Bayonet. 10/10 better than csgo
Probably the best shooter ever.
if only people played it
I really miss this game 
old school 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Every one that plays this game is not english. period.
this game totally isnt outdated!  1/10 would fire in and/or outside a hole again
Heres my 12 word review for this beautiful game. Every time i play this it takes me back to my childhood.
.12
not as awful as the other ones
My Love 3
Best game ever confirmed I gI have it 9/11 doritos ALAHU AKBAR
The definitI have shooter that pioneered the online genre as you know it today...
Wat can i say, if u love fps games, playing with friends, having fun, crusing people and saying evey better player who is better than u a hacker....then this is the perfect game for u P
now thats a classical childhood game
this game is so gud i just luv 2 play with my friends  this game is intence fun not easy but not to hard easy to get the hang of  i think counter strike is like the mother of shooting games its everything realistic  no regen health bullets kill fairly fast 2 forces doing many objectI haves  and i just luv this game so much i can name all the good reasons 
Fun but when i try to move it doesnt let me but when it does its fun it lets me move5percent of the time
lots of fun !!
My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately!. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me Dont ever smoke. Please dont put your family through what your Grandfather put us through. I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
THIS GAME SHOULD BE REQUIRED ATLEAST 100HOURS LOGGED BEFORE ANYONE CAN PLAY CSGO.
8/8
This game is 16 years old still has all its glory as the old days still one of the best FPSs ever and second on my list of all time favorites, and even after 16 years the game is still being played at a large rate, Highly recommend this game, if you can master this work of art you can just about be a master at any other FPS
Good old CounterStrike... We wont forget!
nice oldschool game D
This game is a bit old, sure, but it was revolutionary back in its day. The first time I played this, I was hooked  both into CounterStrike, and Steam as a whole. I love the simple yet complicated gameplay. Brilliant, fastpaced multiplayer action, with also singleplayer and coop missions for CounterStrike Zero lets you experience quite a rush. If you enjoy this title, be sure to pick up the later CS titles, too Global Offensive have and Source. Definitely recommend this to everyone, both young and old, new and experienced.
Worlds Number 1 online action game.
good old 1.6 love is in the air 3
Wordless... 10/10
bought it. played it. got it taken off me for some reason.   I would buy again.
Classic, simply beautifull. This is where it all began.
My childhood in this game 3
You never heard about CounterStrike? wah, lol.
This game actualy take my Life v i cannot stop playing it since i kicked my enemys a$$ out ! to all who say 10/10 dont make me laugh it deserve more than 999999999999999/10 you fools !  its all about good memories 3 love yA
Servers that include boats, but sometimes...
Wall banged through an entire concrete building. 10/10
I hate this game. 10/10 would play again.
I have been playing 1.6 before, now its kinda memories for me.
A classic. Amazing game
The best shooter !
PLaying it for 15 years years and will play it for 15 more!
Best childhood Game Still Playing with Homies Still Better Than COD And Its Better Than csgo
You should get this game not the best graphics but its fun.
Nice Game 3 I Like It D
after the many hours I have spent playing this game i can say for sure this is definately worth your time and money
*_*
Lots of Fun in this classic CS, brings back Nostalgic days when i played it back in a LAN room, EXPECT A CLASSIC FPS FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!
I heard that when i was made it was a huge succsess and now its still popular. D
I liked it, but now it lacks a player community. Fun, Good and aweosme! 
BEST GAME OUT ! 
Good game. Classic 
Time to say goodbye to the grandpa!  However, it is one of the most popular online games ever.
Greatest game of its time!
Based off of the acclaimed HalfLife mod, CounterStrike is one of the most beloved FPS is recent memory. A team based tactical shooter with a simple concept but complex way of using it. For any CounterStrike collector, you have to get the original!
One of the best first person game
counter strike is my life.
AWESOME MUST HAVE D
Fells good to play the original. Still hard at times because CSGO is many years after this game, but fells good to play!
Is incredible game!!!!! 
shit !
Although i have minimal play time on this game, its because i play CSGO a lot more but this game was a blast to play as even though it has low resolution, it brings fun in a nutshell however if you love CSGO this one is a bit more complex. The slight lag you may get doesnt matter as its minimal. 9.5/10
if you like team based strategy and some good ol fps shit, this b the game for u mon
the most legendary game of all time it was released in 1999, but players do play in 2015 so the game itself tells alot about it. moreover its version r updated about every 4 to 5 years latest is now i think is COUNTER STRIKE GLOBAL OFFENSE . some of the most famous players were markeloff,potty,get_right,guardian nd some famous teams were  NAVI, SK GAMING, etc. in india there r teams like NSD who won asian champoinship from 2006 to 2012 till cs go released . it was now suffering from DDOS attack in india nd because of that players r shifting to csgo.  THANKYOU
Anyone else feel the need to Look through the Ironsight, or Downsights ? When playing a CS Game ?
This game is very good to play on lowpower PC since it is old and it even can make you better at CSGO since the basic gameplay mechanics are extremely similar. I use this game as something to do with my ADHD hands while listening to music which i find to be great just turn the game sound down and join a Deathmatch Server
Humm.. #REKT?!
Great shoot game!
5*
playing since 2009 3
Old aint bad!
I have made screen resolution to widescreen so i m not able to reduce it pls help!!!!!!
One of my first games, I LOVE IT  but still I prefer csgo, because its refreshed version
og cs is god
I love this game 100000 / 1
ITs Really FUN
An original classic, CounterStrike. Even though on my old account I only had 400 hrs compared to my 1,200 on Source, This game was still amazing. Now, CSGO will take over, but I still enjoy playing 1.6 every once and a while.
gr8...still needs better graphics
* this game
classic and still fun to play
I really like this game.
Awesome game, luv it
Been playing it since it came out...
I spent a better part of my childhood playing this game, back before Steam became the ubiqitious gaming medium read Valves moneymaking lovechild for shut up and take my damn money. How can I describe this game? What one phrase summarizes the ostensI have thrust of epic time sink that is CounterStrike?   Easy  just one more round! And the whirlpool of regret washes over you as dusk turns to dawn and you realize that you didnt study for your freakin biology exam. For shame. Too bad this box isnt large enough to contain my stories of grand LAN parties. Needless to say, this was an amazing game.  Though after years passing, the humor lies in sadness that the same 13 year olds that I left behind are still playing.. Worse yet, theyre being domineered by server admins who are exactly 1 year older! I figure a bedtime extension merits you the ability to ban &amp kick players.  So yeah, before the new CS comes out, spend some time acquainting yourself with this FPS tour de force.
pretty fun except for them hackers on gun game.
I have been playing since the days before steam. I have spent hours upon hours playing and I still talk to some clanmates from our CAL days. Great times, great game.
! 
Legendary game!
I played it a lot many years ago. Now, I returned to it. Since I am grown up man, I feel like computer games are not important in my life anymore. BUT!!! I played CounterStrike again, after 6 years... and... its still on. Its still so brilliant and addictI have and genius. Really, I like it, I LOVE IT!!! I never forget about it. I am acting like a counterstriketeenageboy again and I fell I made a right decision, returning back to this game...
Amazing game for very fast FPS actions !
Still the best CS
250 hours of playing pixelated CSGO.
eah
RussiansThe game
It can run on my beast Windows 98 Machine 10/10
The best game of all times
greatest fps of all time. rip     
any one help me my cs is not installed any one suggetion me.................. P D 
Well, best game ever. cannot stop myself playing it.
The CS 1.6 Community is 90percent Mexican, 9percent Russian, and 1percent English
CounterStrike is just simply one of the best FPS games out there in the PC Gaming Industry! Trust me, its really worth buying! same goes with its sequels D
Before there was a Call of duty. Before there was a Battlefield, Before there was a Halo. There was one multi player FPS that reigned supreme. Because all the new comers migrate to CS GO, the community is made up of mostly older, more mature people.
old school rocks ofcourse 
Had over 9000+ hours on this game on an alternatI have account. A really GREAT FPS i totally recommend a game like this, any CounterStrike actually is good.
I have a lot of hours on nonsteam version. COUNTER STRIKE FOREVER!
¬®One of the best shooter games in the world, the master piece that made Valve go to the stars and kick some Treyarch asses¬®
AHA POLECAM TO GOWNo
Wow.  This is a game I grew up with and its one of the most popular online firstpersonshooters out there, or atleast it used to be. The game was everywhere, and it had its reasons to. This was the game that was seen on the computer screens of the LAN parties, tournaments and other major computer related events.  Its actionpacked, skillbased and it had a huge following. Even today you may find lots of server filled with players. The gameplay surrounds around you and your team. If you play the DE maps youre a terrorist, you must plant the bomb and make sure that the CTs wont defuse it and if youre in the CT team, you must defuse the bomb before it goes off. If you play the CS maps you must rescue the hostages as a CT and if youre on the terrorist team you must keep the hostages heldup and eliminate any CT that tries to stop you. Any round can also be won by eliminating the opponents.  This game spawned a franchise and will always be remembered as one of the starting grounds of multiplayer, teambased firstpersonshooters.  The game is from 2000 and is outdated by its succesor Global Offensive have. But if youre into old games, you should check this out but I highly doubt you havent heard of this game before.
Legendary.
Rabadabum. cs is still alI have.
fun for the 3 seconds of each round im alI have for.
i remember when i was in high school playing this ahhh the good ol days where you could play a match without being threatend to be swatted anyhow carry on playing the game
After a long break i decided to download CS and see if its still alI have. It is... barely. All these years on and still the best game ever created. Good memories! Better than any CS games that followed. They just dont make games like this anymore. CSGO is a joke next to this classic.
The original classic at its best!
BIG UP, stole 10 years of my life
This game is one of my all time favorites. 10/10
5 years back was really addictI have game. 10/10
THIS GAME WILL REMAIN THE BEST FOREVER! Trust me D
A Classic Combat and Strategic VideoGame, Everyone remembers playing CounterStrike after School.
i cannot find the skins i bought valve why
Great game for practicing FPS skills
This game is realy good! Old but gold!
The mother of all FPS The gameplay is so perfect giving the player the whole control over the characters movement at all times that it tests the players skills. Its a perfect example of a game which is easy to learn but hard to master
ABSOLUTLY GOOD GAME! I can jump now 255 CountJump 3 Strafes 100 Sync!  Good game with bugs F
Get on a nonsteam server. Wreck everyone. Get banned/destroyed.  10/10 would gI have my soul again.  P.S these hours are just on steam, I have recently purchased this game, I have played since when i was 4 years old, like 20 hours a week, so 602 hours is just like a .. extra I have played, now im 16 years old.
Vey interesting and good fps game, you all should try this classic game
I Love This Game D Playing Since 2010
One of the best FPSs ever created, while obviously being old &amp CSGO being the new stuff, there are still small &amp nice communities left on 1.6 making it worth playing still.
Great classic created by good developers, the CS community is still strong today.
Best shooter from 2000 till now. Like everything.
Played with middle aged woman from Yorkshire, UK. Thought I was playing Second Life.
Its nothing like CSGO as far as mechanics go. I say this because of how you control your character and spray control seems to be very different. The AK47 has completely random spray pattern. Its not consistent! However the game itself is good, and provides a fair challenge for those who consider themselves to be good at CSGO. Trust me, you will struggle at first.
Best shooting game ever 3
best Counter Strike out there screw CSS! even with CSGO i still think Cs.16 is still the best
Best work till now from valve D
Nice game!!!!!!!! 
A very well made FPS. The grand father of CSGO  It has a lot of bugs indeed but sometimes its cool to play with a bunch of old friends 
So, this game have poor graphics and its really old, but it still awesome.  This game is based on strategy team work game, thats why i love Counter Strike games.  Yes ... almost all FPS are based on teamwork. But Counter Strike 1.6 is special, you play just for play no rewards, here you can improve your teamwork to play other games, for example! Or you can simply kill players with no reason... The community have already sent some funny mods for this game and its currently running in some servers you can join Zombie Mode, Deathrun, Jailbreak,.... RepetitI have? Well it depends on you, if you play all time in the same map in same gamemode, of course is repetitI have, but if you make pcwteam/clan war with your friends in alternated maps, the game will never be repetitI have.
may be old but still fun if ya want to play CS GO with out the items and just play then ya better get this or source its way more worth it . the graphics suck but the gameplay makes up for it
Awesome GAME ! 3 y I LUV THIS GAME 3 THE BEST GAME EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR !
I shiting love these maps. SV_GRAVITY 0 *yayyyy* Brings back memories but Im glad I got to play it when it was first released. Definitely unbeatable.
before switching to CSGO this was one of the best CS ever 
Running and shooting has never felt so easy.
Cool oldschool FPS game
I dont remember how I managed to log this many hours into this, I do not remember at what point in my life this was. Irregardless, timeless classic from what I remember.
Good multiplayer shooter! Very fun.
Spent thousand hours on the good ol 1.5... Nearly failed several school years, I regret nothing
the game of heros
its ok game
BEST GAME EVER MADE, with the exception of previous versions like 1.5. I have been playing this game since internet cafes were prevalent and I STILL cannot get enough.
Doesnt crash in 4k 10/10
10/10  Would get wrecked by Russians any day.
OH MY GOD BEST GAME EVER I HAVE SPENT MORE THAN 1000 HOURS ON THIS AND IT CLEARED MY RECORD TIME OF HOW MUCH I WAS ON PLAYING THIS GAME AND I GOT VAC BANNED FROM THIS GAME TOO OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS GAME ITS THE BEST
The first ever CounterStrike game that started it all ! The game that marked a generation and taught us that we can run faster with a knife,you will not regret buying this game.   Score 10/10
No matter for how long you play it.. youll end up playing it everyday! D
Might be the best game ever made in the history of FPS shooters! 10/10
Its alright so far
this game is not bad and a classic
One of the best game ever made!
Awesome FPS game. Low graphic requirement and nice controls.
i like this game so much but sometimes there is some noobs who cheat in this game who will make hate this game
Nice game .
Counter Strike is like Life to me ,,, i am nothing without it and the best part that because of steam it makes it more safer to play thanks valve For making such an awesome game!!!
reakemduyou bleat
this is the best game i play before csgo  i recomand it because it has everithing do you need when you are tired
1.6 the game i was competitive have in 
Second best game
Classic. Probably the best CS.
GooD Game. as wellas one of my fav games..!! Nyc work..!!
The hand models, animations, weapon textures, and custom maps all make this game an enjoyable experience. Oh yeah but just add functional bots so I dont have to download shit‚ô•‚ô• ZBots, which, are not realistic in any way possible aimbot, movement patterns, staring contests with enemies.  Although the game is a classic representation of how modernized tactical shooters should be produced, the hackers are always going to be there to ruin the fun. Also, some seriously dysfunctional hit detection occurs during most matches. Also, not trying to be too judgemental, but the game would have been a lot easier to play if the crosshairs had center dots. I say this because Source and G.O. have center crosshair dots, which make aiming much more persistent.   ***8.5/10***  Final Statement  Its a damn ugly game, but thats what makes it good. Once modded, it can look like it runs on a completely different engine. However, the detail and missing physics are not present due to the limitations of GoldSrcs dated capabilities. Oh, and this game does not deserve to be ran with mods. Just simple and complex retextures of the weapons provided within the game. I would like to tell you that this game is better than Source and G.O., but half the community sticks to the newer iterations rather than the original.
Good Game Played It 56 Years In old acc
Old but good D
BEST GAME! 
544hours on record, not for nothing, best classic ever
WooW ! So cool ^^
I missed this game. This is the best game of all time!
I laughed, I cried, I lost 10 pounds!  If you loved the book, youll love the movie  10/10
A game where you can relax with your friends
4ALBET 3LIYAAA
Play hard, go pro!
Quick action game for everyone 
i was told to be done with it through  Closed shutters, flooded floors, i wanted to sail out the front door.  morning anew Im counting the texts you sent me  Im trying hard to take this well, but the cradle has been rocked and my feelings are a stir.  and Im not really sure how to approach this landing despair  and so many eyes on me, i felt like commiting suicide  open the door, 40mph, dead forever more  and so little time, we we kids just exploring,  trying to find a way out of this surburban story   And that my friends is an Emo song straight out of the state of New Jersey. Taking back sunday? Thursday? Pffftt this is way more garbage tier than that.
I would put this game inside of my mouth, and then i would molest it and love it forever keeping it in my basement for 10 years until finally gaben finds it and returns it to the valve habitat in which i will be sent to prison. In prison i will be spending the majority of my time molesting my pillow dreaming that it is actually counterstrike.
shiting neopets is better then this piece of shit game
old,cheap,fun and purely a classic cannot go wrong here!
A real classic. One of the best first person shooters of all time and my favorite game of all time aswell. This game is so good that it will for sure never die! D 10/10
No FPS game will ever come close to the original CounterStrike. Its a shame the days when everyone played it are over.
SEM IGUAL CS 1.6 !!!
This Game Is Best
In my opinion the best of the three partsi am excluding condition zero because it was not really well known at all..
] 
CounterStrike amazing. Play it.
this is a very good game  reviewed for steam badge  but really its good
It s forever legendary game in my memory
Still the best FPS since Doom2
after a decade of CS CITY shit‚ô• from beta release to 1.5 to 1.6 to source to CSGO there all AMAAZZZINNNGGGGGG. The 1deag evolves as do we!!!!! CS is what the foundation of steam was even built on... if you own steam and no cs city shit‚ô• you dono what you got yourself into D
i dont know why this game so accdicting
Old but still gold
I put Counter Strike and Battlefield as my two favourite online fps games. Now those two are way too different to say whos better but this is definetly a very fun game that every fan of the franchise needs to try out. The fact that it still has a tone of competitive have servers make it still a relevent game and as fun to play as its ever been. Id recommend CSGO for higher end machines, but if youre playing on a lower end pc like me this is a must have game
Hey there! Remember all the good old gaming days? Searching for mix teams, joining up with some random dudes playing all night long? Totally missing some school days here and there? Then you probably, like me, played this game countless of hours.    You know all the default maps better than your first name and have surely tested out thousands of custom maps, hundreds of aimmaps, hundreds of KZ/jumping maps, Warcraft 3 mod a mod to a game that was a mod, how ironic?, Zombiemod, gungame mod, evenly and evilly slaughtered all your friends in deathmatch, met thousands of players from all around the world, even from Africa and pwned unimaginable amounts of hardcore and noobplayers.    This game will absolutely never die, players will keep trying to find and therefor create new servers and the old PCW/mixgames are still going to be played in the silent even though the competitive gaming scene has gone over to CSGO. And thank you scene for doing that. This game really needs the cult status in the shadow of newer and more refreshing games. Let it still be there, reminding newer generation of players how the good old times were. Let all the videos be there on youtube especially of the bigger contests. It makes me happy.   So, what is this game all about?  Well, it is simple. The main theme of the game is either bombplanting terrorists vs bombdefusing counterterrorists, hostagerescuemode or save the VIPmode. A competitive first person shooter game that has immersI have actionpacked gameplay all over your screen. You will most likely be flashed, smoked out, shot from far away by a sniper, spawnkilled by your sister, knifed by your brother, exploded by either a bomb or a thrown HEgranade or camped to death by a noob. Sounds good? Then join in the action! You are not just late, you are very late!
One of the best games ever made.
pLay On DuReX
Best game in the genre!
This is the game that started it all for me. When it was a mod for Half Life and Steam didnt exist, those were the days. Since then the CounterStrike franchise has only expanded and has only increased its esports realm. The original counterstrike may lack in graphics for todays standards however for its time it was awesome.  I enjoyed AS_ maps like oilrig, arctic, and various other maps that are no longer in the mainstream csgo scene.  10/10  Sometimes I play this to remember the good times. I wouldnt pay more than $2.50 for this game, or buy the Valve Complete Bundle to get this great game and more great Valve exclusI haves.
old school game. She is beautiful, but time has passed 
The best CS game of all time obviously. No talk. No questions.
I have been playing CounterStrike for 10 years and never got bored, best game ever !
Its K.
One of the best FPS games in history. Its one of a kind. Easy to run and fun to play.
4/5
Classic..
Till date, the best shooting game ever made.
Awesome fps  gamehttp//store.steampowered.com/app/10/#  too much competitive have 3
.....cs is life.....cs is every thing.....
Wins CounterStrike Source and CounterStrike Global Offensive have
Best FPS Game ever. I fart everytime i play it.
Cannot beat a classic, if you love counterstrike source or counterstrike global Offensive have play 1.6 if you havent original always
This game is like male genitalia. It starts off soft, then as you progress through multiplayer experience. You soon realize that your soft genitalia becomes hard. Then there are the people who use AWPs, and Para. Those people have permanent small genitalia.   Dont have small genitalia.  By the way, you made have heard this game refered as Headshot Simulator   1 Genitalia/0 Genitalia
Old but very beautiful game
This games is an epic one ! It makes you either the perfect Terrorist for Osama Bin Laden , either the perfect AntiTerrorist for missies Barack Obama !!   I played so much as a Terrorist , that I can kill both Bin Laden and Obama in the same day.   09.11.2001 / 10
Inventor of the First Person Tactical Shooter genre a.k.a. MMORPG. Also the first known instance of anger came from this game.
Im really bad at this game but people seem to like it. I think I paid like $5 for it.
Verry cool, verry nice, i like it!
started in 1999 still people love it and play it a must game for every FPS player
CS 1.6 is the best version ever made. The best FPS game ever made. I have spent thousands and thousands of hours in this game. Still today it will be a bliss to play this game if you like FPS games. Definetely a  MUST  have.
Why are you here reading this review? There are bombs to defuse, hostages to rescue and noobs to headshot with an AWP through the double doors on de_dust2.  I dont care if its old. I dont care if theres CSS or CSGO. Play a round of this and get your nads handed to you by angry Germans with an AK47. Play 4564 more rounds and you *might* hand their nads to them instead. Intense multiplayer shooting at its finest and crudest. Not for the faint of heart.
I didnt even play this game when I first reviewed it what the shit why did I review this  CounterStrike. If you dont know what this game is, you should probably slap yourself and stop playing games because this shit literally founded multiplayer firstperson shooters.  Okay, not founded, Quake did that first but it sure as hell helped them develop into what they are today.  While the graphics definitely havent held up to standards today kind of obvious since this game was released in shitING 2000 AND STARTED DEVELOPMENT IN 1999, this game is still fun. Why? Theres a lot more maps in the game, and as a result of low graphical quality, its a LOT easier to run on old systems or just bad systems in general. And the gameplay is still just as fun as CSS or even CSGO.  This game used to still be the 3rd most played game on Steam next to Team Fortress 2    and Dota 2, but that changed when CSGO actually started to become a good game back in 2013. Now theres really only the most dedicated CS players that play this game.  I dont recommend going into this game unless youre a dedicated CS veteran who wants to relI have the history of CS and see what the first game got everyone hyped for. This games great, Im not going to lie, its just the learning curve as of right now is STEEP. And that can be good or bad for some people.  Im definitely going to be spending more time in this game in the future just so I can get hours in the game and act like Im actually good at CounterStrike for once. Thats about it, though.  
dis gaem is like gabens mouth, nice
The Alpha and Omega, beginning and the end. One of the finest competitive have shooters of our time.
NICE GAME ITS BEEN ALOT OF YEARS SINCE I PLAY THIS GAME NEVER GETS OLD D !!!
This is first game when i play. Best game ever! But, now, its time to go far away, CSGO. D
Reminds me of old school gaming
The most influential FPS game of all time. Probably the best one too.   11/10 i shiting love this game.
play this game shiters
Best game, thanx
in my opinion, this is the best game ever made. LOVE IT.
classic that never dies because of custom map modes etc
Counter  Strike Is a game which most off the ppl play in india.... its very intresting game.. I Like Counter  Strike Very Much... xD
After all these years this shooter remains to be a classic that cannot be ignored. No other shooter is as accessible, easy to play, simple nor skillful as this. It can be enjoyed anywhere with the 64MB portable version for LAN parties. Its all about aim, accuracy, quick reflexes but does have a strategical element since it is a tactical shooter and theres no respawning. This game was a major turning point in the history of FPS, and this game is what made online multiplayer competitive have gaming so popular.
Game is Love!!!!
Better than Source i3
idk how can i review this game i dont even have it in my library i have no idea whats going on
One of the best shooter i played when i was little i love this game i know i played the game with bots only bu still the game was amzaing when i was little i didnt had internet XD i love this game best game ever still better then cs go im kinning cs go is good to, with shity ranks
You can not describe this game, simply the best FPS EVER! AMAZING !
CSS is better, this is MUCH more complicated i.e. you have to buy ammo after you buy the gun
The best FPS Firstperson shooter video game ever!
This game is probably the best game on steam. 10/10, Absolutely awesome.
knowledge is power
Let me just get my Windows 98 up and my dial up ready so we can play with the new 3DFX card better than software rendering
this is a great classic from the 90s
Even though its a pretty old game, its still fun as hell!
Theres simply no game like cs1.6.
10/10 still better than any call of duty game 
Do i really have to review this game?
I have played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has gI haven me more entertainment and enjoyment than CounterStrike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason I have only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drI have a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has drI haveable snowmobiles.   1337/10
Ahh CS...For many of us born in the 90s, this game took our FPS virginity...Writing a negatI have review about this game is like writing a negatI have review about sex...Im sorry if you had such a tragic experience...
Thumbs up mate.
a Good Game ... Best game 4ever
The classic genredefining FPS. CounterStrike may be 16 years old but there are thousands of servers with an overflowing amount of players. The difficulty curve is no joke. But once you get used to it, you never get tired of teabagging dead players after a headshot. Since it is only multiplayer, you get practically infinite replayability.  8/10  A Big Heavy Dose of Fun
I like this game because it is one of the best games I have ever played.
I dont know why but I cannot play on my own preferred resolution. Very annoying. When I load it up with my black bared resolution It just goes black and I have to Ctrl Alt and Delete. 
Endless game. Buy this game if only you are immortal.
Old, but gold. Overwhelmingly better than CZ.
Good clasic game to revise on and realise how far this game has come 
Good Game, Good Times, Have a lot of hours piled in non steam C.S 1.6. Must buy steam for stable and mature gameplay online
Classic CS
This is one of the best Fps game i have ever played and bring me back to the old good time of the Counter Strike.
Probably better than GO but I have 1.3k in GO so..
Old GAME but very good!! still a lot of people playing

Old, but gold a.k.a. timeless classic. 10/10 would bang again and again.
I purchased the Condition Zero Pack and I am very impressed by the game. The only thing is that You shouldnt charge the same price for this as just the standalone game. Still one of the best games ever though!    10/10
this is what started all the counter strikes
Gr8 old game, the best one.
CounterStrike is an old and challenging game that requires skill and is incredibly addicting.
Joined a server and heard many shit‚ô•‚ô• sounds. 10/10.
classic shooting game, loved it since the first minute
cs.wargods.ro
Great game...I probably.. ya i have about 20k hours in this game. they didnt start counting hours until 2009 so I have been playing since 2000... I played alot of leagues during this era. Been called a hacker more than 1000000 times... Times has changed so time to move onto csgo... If you dont have a mic dont play this if you dont have common sense dont play this if you are hard of hearing dont play this game if you have lack of teamwork, dont play if you dont want to spend 1000s of hours on learning how to play the game.. dont play. takes years and years to become even half way decent...  10/10 would play this all over again from the start of cs.  Now since its 2015.. the game is still alI have sorta.. just get csgo and good luck on ur adventure. hope all the best.
The OldSchool first peson shooter  i like this game
Really great game 
Classic. Never gets old. Possibly the real beginning of internet gaming for the masses... awesome cult following.
old and best !
Coolest Game ever!
Nothing can ever replace, how i loved to shoot the face of stupid n00bs, and legit crews oh how i miss, cs 1.6
Best Game In the WORLD !!!

The best team shooter game ever!
This game is awesome.
The only game that lets you have a 5 kill streak and a defuse with 300+ ping
I one of the best Online FPS game I ever played..
That moment of pure passion when your enemys lifeless body slumps to the ground, and to the topright of the screen you see your name and feel your score increase.  You might have played this game for 50 hours, or you might have played it for 5,000 but it doesnt matter how experienced you are, because its all about that moment.
This game is a legend in Poland
Its old but timeless. I dont like this game as much as team fortress but its no doubt a great game. If you like oldschoolish shooters, than this is for you. Theres still over 20,000 people online too!
So many memories 3333 Totally worth the money 3
Simply a timeless classic
awesome game 3 
Awesome since ever
Game is good enough and cheap too
best game ever... brings back many old memories 
That was a good game..nice story !
Best game on earth
Old but still played
First of all, let me start by saying this game used to be my religion 10 years ago, so I am probably biased.  So many years after its inception, the graphics for CounterStrike do look pretty dated. of Compared to the quality standards of most of todays shooters, the original CounterStrike and likely its predecessors, which very much lI have in the same vein may feel a bit rough, unpolished or even at times a bit corny hostage sounds p. Still, at its core, the game is a fastpaced, triggerreflex shooter.  Edit I forgot to also include that you can use high definition skins, textures and remodels for pretty much all assets in the game, so the game does have some degree of leeway and customization visually. Back in the day that was one of the things that made this game the bees knees for me. Swapped out my ingame AUG with the model and txt information an LA80, hell yeah! Not a fan of desert eagles? How does a .44 magnum revolver gI have you the feels? You can also edit the sound files. I remember downloading some sound pack that made Rob Zombies Dragula play as the round start sound effect and it was almost a month until I finally changed it, to the point where now, 10 years later, I still expect to hear Dragula when I play Counterstrike. These are the things that make me feel nostalgic and think of the late 90s and early 2000 they became iconic for me.   This game is all about making your shots count before the other guy gets his in. Deaths come quickly, wins feel rewarding. The games are split up into objectI havebased permadeath rounds. If you are a terrorist, you may have to plant a bomb edgy, I know, but remember how old this game is concepts came way before 9/11 and the explosion of modern terrorism, etc and if you found yourself on the Counterterrorist team, your objectI have would be to find and secure or disarm the bomb before its detonated. Each round can also be completed deathmatch style by wiping out the enemy team indeed, this will usually happen in most cases as each team pushes towards their respectI have objectI have  Occasionally, due to the respectable size and intelligent layout of the maps, there will come situations where there are only one or two players left alI have on each team and both teams must aggressI havely pursue the objectI have. Youve never experienced tension until you have 40 seconds to defuse a bomb and you dont know where the devil who planted it went. You attempt to disarm it while theres still time. You hear footsteps behind you. Your hair trigger reflexes can save you. Will you come out on top?  There are still hundreds, maybe thousands of public Counter strike servers available, and a good number of players to populate them though many servers are ghost or bot servers also. Most of them 95percent will run some sort of addons and plugins but they install automatically on the fly as needed on your client so you dont have to worry about extra downloads. These addons will range from subtle things that enhance game functions like realtime stats, to comical sound effects I have heard the HEAD SHOT! callout from Unreal Tournament in CS more than I have from playing any UT game to absolutely ridiculous and gamechanging, to the leveling Warcraft 3 hero addon where you can get a chain lightning spell XD to being able to deploy a parachute whenever you want to to avoid any fall damage.  It is a bit old, so if that word alone scares you you may want to avoid the original CS and possibly the newer ones as well, as they play very similarly but if you enjoyed the HalfLife series the engine and you like modern shooters and want to try one with some good pace, try CounterStrike. Where a game of Call of Duty or the like would typically degenerate into a full on bloodbath where nothing is sacred and everyone is shooting you from behind, Counter Strike has pacing every round can play out completely different from the last, depending on the tactics used by each team and the route they choose to take towards their objectI have.   Its far from perfect, but it will always have a special place in my heart. 3  There was a time, when, if you wanted to flashbang your team and hear their cries of anguish, this was pretty much the only game you could do it in.  10/10 for flashbang memories
what a great game
One and only. The roots. First love.
Cel mai tare joc 3 The best game 3
one of the best games of all time
Cool game, old but good.
I prefer a preemptI have strike, so I start each match by swatting all of my enemies.
try all of them out
Better than CSGO .
Great game love it.
its like csgo but it doesnt suck
If you have ten dollars to spare or if you get it in one of the valve bundles or in a humble bundle or something to that extent DEFINITELY check it out. I may only have 75 hours on this as of now but I used to play it all the time before I knew it was on steam. If your a person who doesnt mind graphics but likes counter strike I would definitely buy it because, while I dont necessarily like classic on this version all of the custom maps and game modes make well worth ten dollars. *Alert* A lot of the gun names and the amount of guns is pretty different from CS GO but there are probably guides and once you get past your first hourish its fine.
Cool game !
This game is awesome. Especially CSGO.
When nothing goes right.  Go left...
This is a good game that can run on bad computers.
I lost my life in this game, best admin ever seen xDDDDD
Theres a lot of potential in this game, Valve please dont leave it, we need your patches. Gaben, please add skins and destroy them cheaters with your almighty power.
Its better than GO and will run better on your shit‚ô•‚ô• fuck PC
TO many cheats for this childhood game ! 
This game was my childhood this was litteraly the best FPS ever. you should get it on sale its worth it.
The steam version is the shit‚ô•iest. Dont buy plox.
master piece!  one of the best iconic games in fps genre
Yes yes good game. 3
Cool and Evergreen game. Love this game
Very good game so much mods 8/10  reason not good graphic i know 1999  and much ns kids a noobs
The best game of childhood
This is the game I grew up on, and it still has actI have servers! If you needed a hint, there it is. Go buy the game and at least see what old games used to be like 
I get CS1.6 because Im to impatient to wait for CSGO to be on sale I play for a couple of hours on my piece of shit laptop, 70 FPS! Oh boy my laptop is good so I buy Witcher III shit!! it wont run.
Is Nice game!!!
Very good game, 3 oldtimes, played it alot!
LIKE OMG THIS GAME IS LIKE ANCIENT. IF YOU STILL PLAY IT shitING KEEEEEL YOURSELF!
the game is the best thing out there with low graphics .
The golden classic. If you havent played this game I dont know what is wrong with you. No, seriously... just buy this masterpiece and play it. The original CounterStrike is still better than CSGO. There, I said it. The player base might not be what it used to be but if you have a game that has around 50 000 actI have players a month on steam and is over 15 years old at the same time, you have a really great game. The graphics do not hold up to todays standarts in any way shape or form but that is to be expected. Either way the gameplay is still amazing and most of the maps are balanced.
oustanding
Public  CT  TT Kill or die Furien  Knife SuperHero Deathmatch Deathrun ZombiePlague ZombieEscape Soccer[Football] HidenSeek CODMW2/3/4 DD2 only ETC ETC ETC if u like atleast on of those try the game  the mods are awesome  been playing this game for a long time now I finally bought it tho  and it looks better with steam trust me
I bought this game because of memories when I was playing CS 1.6 and all I can tell is that this game looks bit different than 1.6 D but that doesnt matter.    PROS
Same opinion now that I have bought them all again. Counter Strike is legendary.
Its good but im not really in to it.
Best classic game ever, for sure.
favourite CS better than cocaine lot of hours played uhm..addicted graphically its not like one of these modern shooters hahahaa with the best leetgraphics,but for a 16 years old game its still perfect include the basic sounds! after 500.000 defused/planted bombs its still funny and it keeps you entertained for tons of hours a game worth more than it costs after 16 years I stopped it to play, because at some point u have to say goodbye old times  old but gold 
Nice to play .
Its a nice game, a nice multiplayer game, you can buy it if you want, very cheap.
I will own old hardware in 2040 to play this game. 11/10
to valve  the game cs 1.6 have a glitch  the glitch is a network glitch  if i am come to server its fail to insert the server  fix it.
No R8 revovler, 10/10 would play again.
CS 1.6 is my fav CS of all time CSGO is gaining in popularity everyday but i wish people would start playing 1.6 more
cannot beat a classic.
First game where I was addicted as a kid. Great gameplay and a lot of mods gI have me Thousands hourse of gameplay. Since I was a kid and didnt know much about steam I played this nonsteam and even now after I have newest games to play I just buy it cause of sympathy. If you ever play this game nonsteam or just looking for very good shoter similar to CS GO this game is for You.  I totally suggests you to buy this beauty game
My childhood fps shooter 3
It reminds me the great old times when i used to play it with my friends.
Will stay the best tactical multiplayer game for ever. 10/10  BEST GAME EVER.
10/10 Would fire in the hole again.   Game on my friends!
This game used to be awesome. But now , everytime I try to play I get redirected to fake servers. I have reinstalled. Formatted my pc 3 times , but nothing bears fruit. I please urge Mr. Dave to look into this matter. I dont know but after the launch of GO these things became frequent. My friends and me are very unhappy and disappointed at this. I want the old game back. Please help , making this game secure , so that this goes on for generation without harrasement by slow hackers. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. KEEP THE LEGACY GOING.
Absolutely great! Im really dissapointed I didnt get this game years ago!
Its a classic. played it for hours back in the day when steam was born ^^ dont buy the shit‚ô•‚ô• csgo, this is the game form guys, csgo is just for the kids.
10/10 better than CSGO, no knI haves.
Its a very nice game, and its one of the clasics, a pure gold mine.
Cool game.Still from 1999 but still cool.
Best game ever in PC games history, love yo play !!!
No shit shit‚ô•.  11/10
One thing I need to comment on. Why cannot I customize a game and play with bots? Besides that this game is a gem obviously. Playing on the italy map led me to buying csgo, and I cannot even get bored of it. My gameplay was on another edition not from steam so dont pay attention the gameplay hours.

the first computer based fps game I ever played. Still one the best, if not the best fps of all time.
Old is gold as always
Classic, though Id reconmend one of its newer conterparts at this point in time.
Played this game for far too long, sad to see the community die out but it was the most fun I have had on a game in my entire life and nothing will top it
I like this game 
best cs there is!
Best FPS ever, no other fps comes close to the amazing movement and gunplay in cs1.6 high skill ceiling and very rewarding gameplay
Best game ever made. Nowadays the graphics are exceeded. But it requires dexterity, ability and intelligence.
This is my first game review, and I am glad it is a good one. Personally, my favorite feature about this game is you dont have to play online all the time. You can easily play a campaign mode game against CPUs, which is not all that bad. The gameplay is great along with the graphics and a good weapon selection. The only thing I would say that is bad about it is it can be hard to find a multiplayer server to play on.    9/10
Open game Activate your cfg Find a server And b 4 3 b 1 4 if u r ct If u t b 4 2 b 1 4 GO! GO! GO!    After 3 seconds   Me  U hacker.

the best game ever!. still oldschool
Best for aim....this post is for steam level P
Still one of the best FPS.
The legendary and the best FPS game ever!!
Counter r0x ¬∫¬∫
Every online game aspires to be conterstrike, and why not?
Accidently discovered this game when I played half life in the early 2000s. A few years later started playing lan with my friends and I have never stopped playing since then. CSGO will never replace the beauty and classiness of 1.6.
LIFE IS 1 BUT CS 1.6
Its certainly a harder version of CSGO and since it still does have servers/ESEA support, if you wanna try it, buy it. For the price, certainyl a good and enjoyable game
After countlessly playing CSGO, Counter Strike original called me for no odd reason. I decided to buy it and wow, the game does lack graphics and resolution, but brings so much memories to almost 45 years ago! Its a classic. I hope they could remaster or somehow bring back Counter Strike original so its graphics do get improved and see how different they both looked from year 2000 till today   11/10 D awesome game, brining back heaps of memories.
This is a Good Game!! The Weapons Good The players Very Good 
The old shit!
Its good game and always will be.
Great game....
This game is no working!!! And is shit i need my money back !
Classic! 
its cs
full of indonesians and the wallbang is just so realistic 10/10
THE BEST GAME FOREVER !
Good game high skill cap, grand father of CSGO or Great grand father, is what I should say.
awesome game which was which will be evergreen  #RESPECT for those who created this game
Clasic.
Best cs game of history
guys who did negatI have reviews kids angry players  who thinks that 1 error=bad game noobs and the guy who wants a second chance
This game is very good despite it being so old, but hey, you know what they say...old is gold.
One of the best video games I have ever played. Love it. 69/10.
NO IRL MONEY KNI haveS 10/10
Very gud
Beast.  5/7
Good history 3
Best game you will ever play.
The Best Game On The World!!! P
The classic that set an entire subgenre of FPS games. I played the beta, and played that for YEARS before buying and installing 1.6. Thats when I first got my Steam account. Then I got CSSource. Then, it was others. Thirty games later, I still love the original CS. I was a member of 76th AD on Day of Defeat, and I regularly hung out on Virs Pub in Vancouver long after the release of CSS. Theres a reason this game has more hours logged than any other for me over 1400 hours, at last check it never gets old. I sometimes have to remember to buy ammo, since CSS tied ammo to the weapon, but this game was truly my first love in the FPS genre.  Seriously, just get it. Its always good to have the classic. And seriously‚ÄîI only play CS and CSS in the series CSGOs paytowin system is not what I look for in a game. Bide your time, build up your funds, and then unleash the fury. Its that simple. No, Im not good enough to do pro gaming. Im not even really good enough to make it on the amateur circuit. But I did get good enough to be an even match to my friends‚Ä¶ all without paying for deus ex machina.   I dont play WoW for similar reasons I refuse to pay a monthly fee to play a game. Yes, there are free libre servers out there. My stepson runs one. But the point is that if I buy the license to the game, I should be able to play all I want without having to pay a fee. Paytowin is arguably worse than paytoplay it creates an unbalanced play experience, and I refuse to participate in that.   Bearing that in mind, thats why I love CS and CSS. Its just you, your skill, and an adversarial challenge. Theres no buying your way to victory. I hope Valve can get back to that in future releases.
10/10 Better than csgo
I have not played cs 1.6 for many years. I realized that really missed it.I did not download it from steam at that years. But now , I downloaded it from here and I saw that there is no bot packs in the game. Is there anyone who knows how can I find a bot pack for cs 1.6 steam version?
CounterStrike is a cool game. I play this game in 2015 and its still good.
Its awesome D
What can i say about this game, works fine, a lot of players are still playing this game because its really addicting and enjoyable!
dont run crack programs you can get vac band i got sow i know
It¬®s one of the most played fps games ever,  With Gungame, kreedz, deathmatch, Jailbreak, hide n seek.. and much much more! If you consider buying it, i think you really should!  Good luck, have fun, gamers 
This is the Rosemarys Baby of video games, a videooffspring of demonic potential...the best multiplayer game of 2000, bar none.  A heartpounding, visceral experience that gets under your skin. The just one more round addiction factor is very high. When you play it properly, with team work that clicks like a welloiled machine, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing.
Good ! Very Good ! Excellent !    OW JUST BUT IT ALRADY!
Be the best, shit the rest
good game ! action !
The best of the best 10/10 
Awesome oldschool Game! In the past i played it over 10k hours and its just Awesome!
Second version of counterstrike i tried, and this is one of the best versions as far as I know. If you are reading this now, you should try out the new version of counterstrike instead, CSGO!  Counterstrike 1.6 was the best, now its old and outdated.

Great game for that good, proper skilled shooter experience. Not like the new cods nowadays. Great game that will last for a long time.

Oldest shooter game. The best game of my childhood.

BEST GAME FROM 2000!
Best game gr8 10/10 lonnie , spoopy lenny would play it.
purty decent
My kids will play this game until their eyes become raisins... and if they say that Counter Strike 1.6 sucks, they will be grounded until they move out.
10/10  original game finally a game without 10 years old that have slept with your mother no ragequit for stupid reasons no senseless lags  no mlg or such shitfuckt  just skill or no skill 
I would like to write a little review for this game and Express their personal opinion. We all know the most popular and everyones favorite FPS game is Counter Strike 1.6. What is it so good? First of all its dynamics. The scene, when you get out from behind the corner and clamp in fI have, watching as their lifeless body falling dead to the ground, is fascinating. Not many will wail my rating for the game 10 out of 10.
This Game Is Awesome 3  I LOVE This Game 3 Well Job Valve
 Joins a game  Gets tons of kills  Checks scoreboard  50 kills and 2 deaths  10/10, would get a 25.0 KDR again.
This game will always carry treasured childhood memories.
An old classic!!!!!!
great way for a starter game to csgo! and all the other cs games peace
The best game of my childhood. Love it.

hello this game is too good 3 D
coolest game ever
Best old shooter game ,
This was once a popular FPS mod for Halflife, a popular game of 1998. I have ever single Counter Strike game including a steamed version of Counter Strike 1.0. But I do not have the Korean version of Counter Strike and CSGO is mostly because of its toxic community, anyways I gI have this game a 10/10.
One Of the BEST MultiPlayer game.Have every kind of MOD giving a special touch in it Strongly Recommended and Its CHEAP as well P
Ok, so i have been playing counter strike since i knew of my self, i would gI have strong recommendation for this version of the game if it wasnt so spoiled with cheaters, the game in the days rocked!
 A must. If you dont have it, buy it. Test it. Play it. Master it, and love it.
bring me the old times, thanks
Time to get off garrys mod or CSGO and look at this sexy beast.  Play it and love it. CREATE BOSS SERVERS. NO NOOBS WELL THERE I JUST SWAGNESS IT COST MONEY BUT GOOD
Good Old times. 
The best game in the world.
this game never gets old
I love this game I always have and always will
the best game for me
best cs ever!!!!!!!!!
This is best game ever
One of the best FPS ever made, its still so popular despite its 12 years old now. What I love in CS is that your skill is much more important than in other games such as Call of Money, which is even more rewarding when you kill a lot of people in a row , that means youre a good player at least on the current server ! I have to admit that its graphics are bad but hey, thats not what makes a great game ! Anyway, they can be improved by using nicer models or detailed textures.
Old games the best D
I rememeber first getting my Xbox. I was about like 5 and my brothers would be playing games and I would play with them. We would play Sonic Adevntures, House of the Dead, and Counter Strike. All classics. I have loved Counter Strike ever since this time. And playing this CSGO, CSS, and CSCZ is amazing. It reminds we of the greatest times of my early childhood. Counter Strike is an amazing game and expirience. Counter Strike is the one game that all humans should have the right to at least play. This is in my top 5 games of all time.
OK!
So while I havent played this game long. It taught me one things Graphics dont mean shit
Great game. Great hitboxes.
10/10 Best game in the world xD
First game=Death Second game=Death Third Game=I suck at this game.

Unchallenged Champion of the Classics!
good game, but dont buy it cuz csgo is better + there are lots of wallhackers on this game so just buy CSGO
This game, this game, this game.  This game is still alI have at the moment im writing this.  This game is amazing and should really try it out. I bought a counterstrike condition zero disc in december 2004.I lost it in 2006,found it in jan 12 2016.Wrote the code that was found in the disc,then i got this game and condition zero and counter strikecondition zero deleted scenes.  When i found this game, i couldnt be more happy in my life.

Worth every penny ! The nice thing about this game is that it can be played on almost any PC system requirements, it has very poor . That makes the most popular if not the most popular game in the world shooter . Graph &gt 6/10 Optimizing &gt 10/10 Game &gt 10/10
Old, but awesome
dont be a baby like colty, buy this game. came out 16+ years ago, im not a veteran and even I enjoy playing it
Where it all began 3 !!!
bought it twice 20/20
Propably mother of most tacticFPS games, classic and perfect at the same time, includes alot of fun moments and makes players want to sharpen their skills.    The game that teaches us that you run faster with the knife .   For some reason scout sniper rifle appears to be the lighter than knife. Doh.
Pretty Interesting game to say the least.
Old good game.  +quality +gameplay +without skins
Finnaly returning to the clasic, best game for 10 years, I would love to see the game returning in main scene, but seems it is not possible Anyways 2010 9/10 2016 10/10 Old but gold
dont change the screen to wide screen it just zooms in and you cannot change it
Good old times S
Great game alot of fun nice gameplay   
Could not find hw.dll , pls help  
shiting hard to play with all hackers, but still fun as i remember when i was child... very good =3
best mod that became a standalone game
Eventhough its a pretty old game it still is the best fps shooter of all time
kind game you need to teach your sons dope
It will never get old D
Oh , the memories ...
Belongs in your library. Once in a while, take it out, dust it off, and remember how we got to where we are now.
CSGO but with less features, more Russians, and graphics comparable to the original HalfLife.
I have played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has gI haven me more entertainment and enjoyment than CounterStrike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason I have only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.
CounterStrike is a multiplayer spinoff game to the Half Life franchise. Set in the same unI haverse except focused on the HECU Marines themselves. There is no plot to this game, its purpose is to establish a fun coop multiplayer game that allows gamers to either fight it off or team up around the globe. There is a selection of different locations for the areas and different types of game play to create endless possible features wether you play as the marines or the terrorists is all up to you. This game was so successful it established a large fan base and spawn a few sequals. If you want to play a classic online multiplayer, you cannot go more classic than this. If you manage to gather some friends who have their own Counter Strike games installed on their PC, then you will be all set.
plant the bomb and get to tha choppaaaah
just reviewing for the achievement
one of the best game i ever played, i hope csgo will ever be that fun as cs1.6 was ..
 ‚Ü®
I own a lot of games on steam now, but this was my first ever purchase. From 1.1, to bunny hop in 1.3, to the lovely 1.5 then 1.6, I have spent thousands of hours on this game. Worked my spray kills in CalO upto hacklike headshots in CalP. I could have done so much more with my time in high school, but this game probably saved my life, virginity, and from weed.. actually that last part is a lie   Im redownloading this as I speak so I can altf4 when I get killed and claim it was a hacker, only to restart the game seconds later cuz wtf else am I gonna play.
Good Game But Need Upgrade...
Nice game for a pleyers is play fer....
amazing game 100percent action
worlds best game ever
Old but still good. 
best shooter on earth!
most fun you can have in online it has jailbreak zombie and many cool other serers
Nostalgic, Classic, The Best, Legend
Completely skill based shooter, a lot of teamwork and strategy. Old jem thats been forgotten.
Good Old Game, When I play this game let me remember my little past.
Best Multiplayer Game Ever ^_^
just buy the game.
best game ever tho its 16yo game
The game is perfectly designed and its graphics is incredible. The Counter Strike 1.6 game is specifically designed to offer shear fun and excitement for all young and old generation as well. The game tactics cannot be judged at ease as the targets and tasks change as per the assigned map location inside the game. In this game, the real challenges are like exploiting the opposition, diffusing the bomb, killing enemy with mere knife as a weapon and rescuing the hostages which are trapped at the weird locations. All in all, the tasks assigned in this game are never achievable in a time span of 5 minutes.  In some map of this game, the task is to win the round within 90 seconds which is quite impossible if you are playing the expert level. Also some of the team members dont follow your commands during the game which adds more delay in achieving the tasks. In such situations one has to have the accurate skills to win this game. So it is obvious that this game will take near about 2 months time to complete all the four modes like easy, normal, hard and expert. But if you love this game, and there is proper audio settings present at your machine, then there is no stopping and all modes of this game can be completed within few days or may be in few hours of time. Now in terms of speculation, it is seen that parents worry about their child playing Offensive have games and counter strike 1.6 is no excuse to this scenario. So childrens should keep in mind that playing such games is for fun and they must themselves have control over the time which they devote towards this popular and addictI have game.   The game is full of action and I feel that one who plays a counter strike game can perform the tasks like studying and other home related duties at a greater pace. But it is necessary that the gamers spend a lot of time on studying since balance between games and study has to be maintained at any cost. So the students who play this game should take care of home duties and study at first. At last if they find time, they have to invest it while playing this incredible game.

The most important multiplayer game of the millenium!
Its csgo but without skins and worse texures. At least it has the Mp5
Literally the best game of all time. Needs a ban wave of hackers to clean up the game.
3 this game and miss it too D
Joined random server.  Got rekt by old cs players.  Looks online for tips and tricks.  Couldnt find any and still sucks.  10/10 would get rekt again. RIP 
This is a multiplayer game that takes some time to learn to play it! It takes a lot of skill and you can play it with your friends. The price is very cheap for this kinda game
its great
I played a couple games, seems fun.
An old mod with infitine posibilities. A graphic overhaul might make it more popular than global Offensive have. But alluminati...
Best counter game ever.
An absolute classic. Love it, get addicted. To this day still the best games in the series. Love the cs1.6 gameplay and the missions in cz are so good. Well worth 10.
It is awesome game

This game is old as dirt, yet I still like it.  10/10 better than Countershit Global Trash
I have been playing this game since june 2014. I really enjoy playing this game. i reccomend this game to everyone who enjoys playing computer games. Also the GSU server is the best. GO Gsu!
Great Choice! This game is excellent when you install bots in your game. To me personally, I love the graphics more than the newer counter strike games.
hourboosting this game so people think im not cheating in csgo
CEL MAI FAIN JOC COUNTERTERRORIST ! DIN LUME
Still love to play D
A must have game for lovers of first shooting game.
Once upon a time there was a masterpiece made.             WHAT THE shit ARE WE PLAYING NOWADAYS?????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
One of the best games of my childhood. Love it And THE SKINS ARE 100percent FREE
Best competitive have shooter ever!
The original CS that turned me into a life long fan. 10/10 back in the day...
no r8 would play again 
Nice training for GO.
Flashbanging ur own team is no fun, said no CS player ever D .... 9/10
The best online and lan mutiplayer fps game in the world that won millions of hearts. 3 Long LI have 1.6
shit‚ô• thing sucks!
best childhood game
Just the legend
Best game to play if you have a potato. It still is a very fun game despite dated graphics. However, if you have a good computer and can run the newer games, then there isnt much point to playing this one, unless youre like me and enjoy playing older games. The gameplay is rather different from the newer games. For one, this one is much harder. It feels like the first Rainbow Six at times.
Remains an old classic. The mechanics of the movement in this game is simply art. The way that you can gain boost by using a simple technique called bhoppin aka bunnyhopping is just overwhelming amazing. The graphics brings you straight back to the childhood, sitting there jumping around with your DesertEagle and AK47. As said, an old classic, a must have game,  As the old 1.6 player I am, I am proud to say that if you havent played 1.6 you havent played cs. Simple as that.  Go play it until your fingers hurt of bhoppin and spraying.
classic counterstrike
NNNIce Game #!23
start the game  get into a serverfirst roundall the server starts to say fire in the hole fire in the hole firf rifrifrfirfirifri  the awp scope is made in paint app guns are useless sub guns are useless too  the game is AWP and m4 and ak47 any thing els suck  but still love it 10/10
Classic Game, where CS began!
CounterStrike is the best competitve game ever made. Thanks to CS, I traveled many countries around the world and competed against the best players.
10/10 Because this game never gats old, its still interesting after 17 years... Audio 10/10 Graphics at that time  10/10 Community 10/10 Matchmaking 8/10  It was created in 1999... Still best First person multiplayer shooters of all time!
Must have game for a gamer.
As bad as I am at this game... I cannot stop playing it.
For me  The best Counter Strike game, by far. Personally, prefer this then GO. 
Oldschool. Old, but gold
Where can I buy the skins??? 0/10

need more chickens
THE BEST FPS?
Yes!! awesome, best childhood memories. 10 years and still playing.
Still has people playing in 2016. It makes for a nice break from CSGO when I want to take a trip back in time.
CS 1.6, the best game of all time. You should rather grab one copy of a new CSGO game.
Good game, but buy csgo instead
Fun game to cheat in
My highend gaming PC doesnt meet the requirements
I love this game v
Its verry cool!
One of the best game ever, i will play this in 50 years to!
This is the legend,sooo yeah...
Its just awesome D
play counterstrike 1.6 and enjoy the game D
The game functions just like halflife with a few twists. Realy good game but CSGO better. This game still has players today if your intrested in purchasing this game.
Easy to learn, hard to master
Pretty nice game!
This is always going to be a great game in the eyes of CS fans

Wikipedia  Initial release date November 8, 2000 Series CounterStrike  Publishers Valve Corporation, Sierra Entertainment, VI havendi, Microsoft Studios  Developers Valve Corporation, Turtle Rock Studios  Platforms Microsoft Windows, Linux, Xbox, Macintosh operating systems  Designers Minh Le, Jess Cliffe
Sometimes I come back to this game just because it is too good to not forget D
Great graphics... ‚ù§
counterstrike 1.6 is my favorite game i first on played shooter game wheen i start playing shooter game 3
Fun shooter !
The best CounterStrike that has ever existed.
Great game, it was originally a mod for halflife 1 but valve picked it up and what a great choice that was, it has now become one of the most successful PC series to date with CSGO being one of the most played PC games ever
really good game can be played for hours the nostalgia is real with this one
My very first game on Steam. Never gets old, 10/10.
Old School...
.,,..
  One of my favorite game.
Great game, better than all others CouterStrike series. CLASSIC.
Old but perfect 
Great game, extremely entertaining. 5/5
never gets old still on the first game to be played by any gamer in his life .
Classic FPS!
I can speak spanish and portuguese fluently after playing on NA servers.
‚ò∫‚ô•.‚ô•‚ò∫‚ô•.‚ô•‚ò∫‚ô•.‚ô•‚ò∫‚ô•.‚ô•‚ò∫‚ô•.‚ô•‚ò∫
A classic FPS which I spent more than my whole lifetime on nonsteam version. Still the game can be played, the servers are full most of the time.  10/10 would make a rebirth of this game 
Wow this game was not even the smallest bit shit
Very good skilled based game!
Best Game Ever Played! 3
Where can I start...this is one of the most iconic games on Steam. Even though it came out a while ago and the graphics are horrible, the game is incredibly fun. Very old school and will take you back to when gaming was starting to flourish.
  fire in the hole
cannot run CSGO? Get this! Unfortunately the FOV looks really low when on 169 resolutions, and a lot of the servers are spanish. Still fun though. And you cannot waste your money on skins in this one!
  CS All the best of all time
Old But Good =D I Like It
Just one problem, every unmapped button makes you join another server for some reason,  
All I can say is WOW! Has anyone tried this game? Its an FPS game but its so sweet! Just shoot um in the face mang!
The best game! = 
great game mate
The dead wish is come to cs 1.6 p
its good yes
Without a doubt the best counterstrike tied with source.
Good old game. It can be used by servers as sandbox for creating FirstPersonShooter prototypes which does not work in CounterStrike Global Offensive have. It has simple mechanics which you can learn in few seconds and you can keep getting better for example with bunny hop. There is only one big problem  cheaters. But it can be solved by playing only on VAC secured servers.
I buyed the game and i dont have lol
Tbh I have spent more time in De_dust2 Compairing with my Parents D now you know how much I love this game
Mm need some changes ?
Best first person shooter game ever.
Simply the best FPS game ever, no matter how good are the graphics nowadays, this one still own them in gameplay + teamplay
My favourite game D 3
Nothing will ever beat the original.
Great game, so much history behind it.
10/10 best game. consumed my lief 10/10 ign
  Good game ! Nice work ! The best game
Cool game D
Athough this isnt my first counter strike game nor my favorite, I still get this huge sense of nostalgia towards it. That late 90s FPS feel and the gritty nature of a lowbudget mod gI haves the game its charm.   Some things have not aged well, such as a search bar for server and the lack of customization options for your crosshair i dunno, maybe Im just spoiled.   This is probably the most difficult in the series for newcomers to get used to, but once you get the hand of the often clunkey controls and movement, itll be an enjoyable experience.  
The best Game forever
Played it a bit. Its ok!
I have player CSGO for a while and also CSS for a couple of years and by far CS 1.6 is the best.
the classic
Classic, only beaten by the new CSGO, and still have a good player base, even after all these years.
The best of all time, and cheap also  5/5
This game is legendary. This started back in 1999 and havent got lost the pleasure of playing it. The graphics are not the best, its an old game, but its FUN! That was the point of the game! Its one of the best first person shooter in the world, its not me saying that, all over the world people consider Counter Strike 1.6 one of the best shooter games. And it had lans and big event until CSGO showed up in 2012. Its still played by LOTS of people. 17 years old and still rocks!!
A real classic from the 90s, this game is still MUCH better than newer titles, like Call of Duty and Battlefield.
  I dont speak English but this game so awesome for me becouse I am hikka
Definitely the best FPS hands down!
......
  Nice Game And Famous
timeless classic
This game is awesome! I was playing this game when i was younger and i really enjoyed it! I really recommend this game to try out! I know this game is old but good!
I could only connect to Spanish speaking servers. Lag is bad. Disconnect is often. But there are no Russians. No shit shit‚ô•? 10/10
Old great game, with a better story then pocahontas.
Play every single game out there,  Eventually u will go back to CS 1.6
Although the game is more than 16 years old, it is still a very nice game and many people play it.I strongly recommend buying it.
even though steam says i only have 36 hours. Its more like I have spent 36months in game. This game is the reason I got a steam account back in 2006.
I really love this game. The best Lan Game ever. I love it since 1999.
very fun game! have so much memories from this game and will never forget 3
Probably the best oldschool game ever. I play it after 1 year pause again.
Havent played too much of this, but I can see why alot of gamers were hooken on this for years and still occasionally come back to it. Its completely worth it.
My #1 favorite action game! I love how the game looks! The community is fun, and so many servers to join! I enjoy the experience! The games is just so amazing! I highly recommend playing CounterStrike! Trust me, its fun!
Best shooter ,ever !
One of the best fps games made .
The best one  The beginning
Awesome Classical Shooter Game 5/5 Still love to Play.
  Nice and fun!!! 
I love this game...Its old but good. Valve makes super FPS games
192.168.1.127020
Best classic games of all timeeee....3 
Trumps president.... Well you know how they say, Only a 100 nukes needed and you can cause a nuclear winter causing mass famin, have fun sleeping this week
  tpo 1 game in the world !
Had this game as a kid alongside Half Life without internet connection and no bots. Basically had nothing to do with it except roaming around.
.1111
Better than GO
Its Very Nice Game 
Very nice game ma friends, you can shoot peiopple and duck veri nice, jumping is aLLso avibiible very nice. i gI have 5 out of 4 stars tri it out
Good old classic! This game makes huge part of my life
CS is love,CS is life. 
My old crush 3
the best shooter the history of PC
good. i paly after school becouse have 0 frends 
Where to begin? I was fortunate to be there at the beginning.   I downloaded CounterStrike, the HalfLife mod, in August 1999 during Beta 3 after a kid at school recommended it. My group of friends fell in love.  Hostage and VIP missions were my preference, with Militia, 747 and Oilrig absolute favorites.   Sixteen years later, here I am, still playing the series. We may have left the first game behind, but the memories stay with me always.
      Question   Answer       Can i spray    Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞ yes if your a girl Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞       Curry   Yes 100percent the curry was magical       Should you buy this game   not really get cs source     
*.* ! 
Its ok i guess....
the best game *_* i love it so much
  welp cs is an good game and it still for now cause its keep the idea of FPS &amp fun &amp ect .... aaaaaaaaand i suggest to ppls of FPS games to buy it  
to the world
Theres no need to be an expert in FPS to know this game. Its a classic that marks a generation of online gaming and competitive events that still last to date.
Just gI have me a reason Just a litte bits enough Just a second were not broken away Just bent we can learn to love again
Old School shit 3 
Great game, even though its graphics are not the best, gameplay is what most matters here
When you have a really sh*tty computer
Absolutely one of the best fps games I have played. People still talk that CS 1.6 Counter Strike died, it is a lie it still standing up. Of course, is not a swarm of people who still play, but some still play the game.
I cannot MOVE MY MOUSE!!!! WTF IS GOING ON!?!?!?!?!?!?!
This is in my opinion one of the best games ever to exist in history of video games. This game is balanced as shit compared to cs go. This game is a lot more fun and requires skill and dedication and not luck. 10 / 10 This game gave birth to legends we got today such as GeT_RiGhT, F0rest and Neo!
  Nice game
Why i cannot refund this game I purchased accently 
Best game in the wolrd !
I like how this makes me feel like Im permanently in S.W.A.T and cannot get out. 9/10
counter strike 1.6 aka nostalgia strike 1.6  since this is a classic i would probably get ddosed, hacked and many other horrible things done to me if i were to talk badly upon this magical game   Le Good stuf good old maps dust2, vertigo etc. the riot shield im probably the only person who likes the riot shield night vision good for camping in dark spots with an awp while eating doritos you fat russian actual sprays not the BS that you have to pay for in csgo  Le bad Stuf  no bots  though this can be easily fixed through Zbots, just google it up and it shouldnt be too hard to get working  in the end i gI have this a 9/10 really good game, not too shabby graphics, and a fun waste of time if your bored 
This game is so good
old but gold amirite?
Its is an amazing game really enjoyable! it is also fun playing this with friends! 10/10 RECCOMEND
This my best game ever 
  The best fps game in the world.
Although the community is dead and probably will never come back to its previous state,it is worth buying the game as buying cs 1.6 will allow you to try to master a harder version of csalthough deagle is easier to use.trust you will meet great people while playing this game i played on a server called pga although there are hackers they are usually banned by admins in a day or 2 and playing 1.6 is like a fresh experience.you may ask how i know this,it was how i felt when i bought go in 2012 in this account
Amazing .. I love this CounterStrike ..
my life D 3
very good game best FPS game of all time
I Looove This Gamee

Olg but good one 
Counter Strike 1.6, its neccessary to say anything else...
Still a legendary game, one and only..

Back in the day, this was one of the games I spent the most hours playing. All day, everyday.
Legendary Game...
One of the best game ever made.
Never get tired of it!

Best FPS ever made. Still good to this day.

The game is 16 years old and is still the best CounterStrike. Eat your heart out Global Offensive have.

I dont care how old this game is. Its still my favorite, I played it when I was 9 and Ill keep on playing until Im on my 70s.
You arent a gamer if you never played it.
Nice Game   CS1.6 LOVER GL HF
One of the best online shooters ever. Very few shooters did what cs pulled off. Cs managed to cater to pretty much every player whether you played comp, pub or were a casual player like me, cs did it all. Comp players had one of the best games to compete in, pub players had a great 2432 player experience, and casual players like me had as_crazytank and mod servers.   Shout out to anyone who played on the daves custom funmaps server back in 0405  
Spent my childhood playing it, why not the rest of my life as well D.
everyone should buy it, a fantastic game!
bou le vgames yesh pickup
Good and old game . D
Best game of all time. Make sure to use the AWP
  Still the best game i ever played.
Vote this for The ‚ÄúTest of Time‚Äù Award
This is the place from where most of us started.
One of the greatest game of all time

Old AF
Alright
Still unsure about how good of a game this is!  Edit. Why did i lose so many hours over the years??
The game of the games. I was growing up with this game!! What can i say about it  10/10!

Well, long term classic. + Rustic graphic + priceless physics + grenade size of your head  Nowhere to be found Countless hours off steam, but pssst
  The CS1.6 is the successor to Thiels CS1.5, a denizen of this magazines Recommended Components listing ever since Sam Tellig enthused over it in August 1994. He also wrote about it in May 96, while Muse Kastanovichs November 95 review included a full set of measurements. Like the 1.5, the 1.6 is a floorstanding twoway design with a slopedback front baffle. Thats where the resemblance ends, however, as every other aspect of the 2002 speakers design is new.  Whereas the CS1.5s baffle was flat, with stepbacks for the hefty grille, the 1.6s is elegantly sculpted with a CNC machine to optimize dispersion, the minimal grille fitting into a shallow depression and held with concealed magnets. With the grille removed, the most obvious visible feature is a long vertical slot beneath the woofer, surrounded by a machined flare. This slot acts as the reflex port, but its geometry is claimed to minimize wind noise and any modification of its tuning by the grille.  The 6.5 woofer, designed and manufactured inhouse, uses a 3 voicecoil to drI have the metal cone closer to its perimeter than usual. This is said to increase the stiffness of the cone, pushing the inevitable breakup modes much higher in frequency than with a conventional cone and voicecoil. The large coil allows the neodymium magnet to be housed completely within the voicecoil former, inherently shielding the magnet. The 1 tweeter uses a metal dome and, like the woofer, features a short coil with a copper distortionreducing ring, operating in a long gap. The tweeter dome is recessed slightly in a front plate with a short flare, which will increase its onaxis sensitivity to match the efficient woofer, at the expense of restricting the units dispersion in the top octave.  The crossover is, as is usual in Thiels Coherent Source designs, a phaseoptimal firstorder type. This and the sloping back baffle allow the sounds from both drI havers to arrI have at the listeners ears at the same time. In a welcome departure from earlier Thiel speakers, the CS1.6s sturdy terminal posts are sited on the rear of its cabinet rather than the base.  Sound  Setting up the CS1.6s involved finding positions for them that gave the optimum balance among four nonrelated aspects of sound quality. The speakers bass region is intrinsically shelveddown. However, moving the speakers close to the sidewalls to gI have some boundary reinforcement of the low frequencies also emphasized some residual hardness in the low treble, and resulted in a balance that was too bright with the speakers facing straight ahead. Moving the speakers well away from the sidewalls gave a sound that was clean and clear, but with insufficient bass. Keeping the speakers where they had the most extended bass but toeing them in so that they faced the listening seat reduced the hardness, added some useful topoctave air, and gave a soundstage that was superbly detailed and stable. On the downside, the overall sound was still a little bright for my tastes and system.  Ultimately, I moved each speaker forward along the line joining its acoustic center to the listening position, noting how the drop in bass weight was balanced by a corresponding drop in lowtreble hardness. This sounds more straightforward than it was because the CS1.6s overall sound changed more during the breakin process than I am used to. Thiel recommends 50 hours at moderately loud levels, but at the end of the month during which I used the Thiels for my everyday listening, I was still not sure that theyd reached equilibrium.  But what had begun as brightness had been transformed into superb resolution of detail. What had started out as a lightweight, not too welldefined lowfrequency register ended up as a balance that worked well on such superb doublebass recordings as Edgar Meyers new disc of concertos, by himself and Bottesini, with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra Sony Classical SK 60956. Meyers Concerto in D starts with some Estring grumbling and portamento slides, all rendered perfectly clearly on the CS1.6s, without any boom obscuring the instruments pitch.  
Absolutely insane... this game is eternal... playing it for almost 11 years and theres still community.
Old but gold but slowly dying

This game meant some unforgetable memories for many.
This was such an amazing game!
Great game for everyone, fun to play, find new friends and learn new skills.
i play since 2006, so this the best fps that I have ever played D
  I woke up with VAC ban, for no reason
This game is my favorite game of ever....
Mostly doing this for getting fake internet points.  But seriously, the jump aka kz mod is the main reason I play this game even today.
nice game for fps game players
This game will always be 10/10
The game that changed my life. Started to play pc games when this amazing game got out. I still miss the days on the internet cafe playing with friends.
Old but gold!  This game was the best experience in my past. It won many awards and was the world number one in online gaming. I played it over ten years in many clans and 5on5 teams, in few leagues and many cups.  My best experience was the 6 months in Electronic Sports League Pro Series 2005 and in Electronic Sports League World Cyber Games 2005 Qualifiers.  This old game never had so many cheaters and players under 13 as the new one CounterStrike Global Offensive have...  I miss the gold old time!
Fun and interactI have. &gt
Still the best Counter strike on Steam 
10/1
What a game... Private servers, no russians. What could you ask more from the humanity?
Hey, thats pretty good. This game has stood the test of time and is still one of the most popular and wellknown games.
You can shoot things.
I love this game, my childhood
What is there to say? The game is   legendary
You wanted to know what your big brother did in your old pc? Did he watch porn all day like you? did he play something?  This is the answer 
When _orange_ maps were but a far off concept and NIPPER ruled the world.  Seriously, get all the NIPPER maps. Especially the crazytanks.  9/10/10
The best multiplayer game of 2000, bar none.
One guy called me u suk shit and then he kick me from the server 10/10
Still the best game in the series.
Just the legendary FPS wow so old much graphics such hs rushing B for ages and never gets old
Why are you even reading these reviews, you already know what this is and waht its like...
enjoyed the game for only a few minutes..
Really Good Game.
CounterStrike 1.6 what an awsome game! This is so nostalgic! If you are looking for better graphics go for CounterStrike  Global Offensive have.  10/10 for the nostalgic
Good game, set it as soon as it came out and did not regret nirazu, Counter Strike is a classic of online shooters.
ABSOLUTELY BETTER THEN NERFED CS GO.ABSOLUTELY I PLAY CS FOR 11 YEARS AND I GUESS EVERYBODY WILL SAY RECOIL CONTROL WAS BETTER IN CS 1.6 THAN IS CS GO RIGHT NOW.shit CS GO.6 HITS 98 WITH shitING SILENCER ARE U shitING KIDDING ME
Best First Person Shooter game...Counter Strike 1.6 is best game in the world...I love this game 3
This game is pretty much just as good as Counter Strike Source just with older and outdated graphics and sound. You can play Counter Strike 1.6 with bots by getting Podbot MM  http//podbotmm.botsunited.com/main_pb_page/index.htm  . A great game!
Best Game ever created? Of course...
HOW TO PLAY competitive have IN COUNTER STRIKE 1.6
Ah, the memories..
In a nutshell 10/10  Really good game for being what it is, an old classic.  What is CounterStrike?  This is basically SWAT team simulator 2000, its a pretty competitive have 5v5 FPS shooter where you must stop the terrorists from a range of objectI haves, such as rescuing hostages, defusing bombs or killing terrorists before they plant their bomb, even escort missions where you must escort a buddy to a helicopter! As terrorists your goal is to well, kill the CounterTerrorists, to put it bluntly.  Will it Run on my Computer?  Considering my cheap Lenovo G580 with integrated graphics can handle this at 60fps, unless you use a really outdated PC like, a computer made before 3D games were commonplace Im sure your fine.  Parents Guide  Id say FPS games are generally a nono for parents who care about what their children play, and actually, this game, if you go into settings and turn blood off, its actually not too bad, Id say 13+ is appropriate.  Graphics  Note This game was released in 2000, excuse what is terrible graphics nowadays, pretty good graphics, all the characters are in pretty good detail and the guns look nice and pretty realisticlooking.   Gameplay  I will say, its quite fun, but I will tell you, this is a game meant to be played with friends or meant to be played with players who are good at teamwork, your entire team could lose simply from one player on your team not going with your teams plans.  Is it Worth The Price?  Yes, absolutely, if you want to see where CSGO started, get it for sure!
  Its old, but its still actI have and still fun. I would make a Yo Mama joke off of that, but nah.
This game is still no.1
  ..11111111
First time I have played this game was on 2008 or so.. I still remember how excited I was playing this game for hours each day.. Even if I dont have many hours of CounterStrike on Steam, I played it Non_Steam Mode. I recommend this game to any person who like shooting games! ^^
I love this game D been with me for years!
When will steam sale start?
Old game but still very fun to play when bored.
I was so young when i play this 1st time... no i am old but i remember... god old times...  i try it again and it is still good 
Dis shit still better than CSGO
The best game possible and impossible game in History is CS 1.6 3
Just a great classic Counter strike, I love it ^L^
Game of my childhood... worth every cent 1.6 forever!!!
Old but still good
Writing a review for CounterStrike....

10 years of playing this game, and I come here now to review it. Thank you Steam awards to show me my inconsiderate self. XXXO
Almighty Game of All time !!
One of the best oldschool games out there.
Really good game
Best shooter game of all time!
I used to play that game.

still a great game!
This game is just a good game overall i like this game a little bit more than CSGO right now since its a classic, and its really easy to pickup and play and practise for csgo since they are the same game basically
This game is the test of time 100percent! 
15 plus years and this game still holds up as well as the day it came out.
The game is the ultimate FPS challenge for the most skilled FPS players, If you think you got what it takes, GL HF
Review or update your review for a game youve nominated Steam awards 2016
bring me back to the 90s!
what can i say
Still better than Halo.
CS is truly one of those rare games that defines a generation. As an FPS, its mechanics still hold pattern with modern technological marvels, and it is doubtful that a single game will ever have the same effect on the culture of gaming as a whole to the same extent as this masterpiece.
The game of my life
Right in the childhood
The greatest fps in the world I still miss the old 1.6 when playing CSGO
Best classical game ever.
The game that started it all. Forever a classic.
Counter Strike 1.6 was the very first CS game that Iv played. Me and my friends used to bring flash sticks to the computer room in our high school and started a mini tournament.
Probably the best team FPS game to ever exist
This game is bae
  Good Game, the shooter game for excellence
love it 3
The best game of all time.
all timegreat counter strike game...its been taken over by csgo but still can play this to remind yourself of old times D

One of the bests of all time, 10/10 since always, ill never stop playing this 3  G.O.A.T.
Best and most classic CS game to ever exist IMHO. Love the nostalgia it brings to me just for looking at the screen shots. This piece of art is a loving part of my younger years. 10/10
Still pretty fun when there arent cheaters.

Replaced by CSGO
One game one love CS 1.6
i always love counter strike
game even if not played by as many people as before not played at tournaments, and releasing updated version of it still has this something, that surely would catch eyes of many people interested in that sort of games. dynamic gameplay and not too bad graphic are for sure advantages of cs 1.6
high community game, simple and easy shooting 
A pretty good fps. Poorly to graphics compared to CounterStrike Source or Global Offensive have. I recommend.
Ill love this game ever!
My fav game of all time. Love youuuu CS 1.6

one of the best multiplayer game must buy if u buy it even buy for me lol cause even i dont own it xD
Nice game , bra ! 3
I lost years Im really not exaggerating here to this game. There are better games out there now but for its day this was a trailblazer. Still a lot of fun now.
The better version of CS compared to Source  Rating 8.5/10 
Its is a lot better than non steam .. dont lag
An absolute classic to say the least. One of the coolest shooters to grace the point and click medium.
Simply the Best!
Oh God I love this game D
For many, the original CounterStrike remains the definitI have online shooter. Tens of thousands hop onto servers every day to continue the eternal battle between terrorists and counterterrorists. CS is an almost perfectly balanced mix of teamwork and individual skill with enough depth and nuance to inspire countless esports competitiveons. Valve have attempted to improve on the formula with CounterStrike Source and CounterStrike Global Offensive have, but the original remains the goto choice for online action gamers with top twitch skills.
All of those highschool feels
upgraded to mac os x 10.9 and it broke it.. the mouse dsnt work anymore. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling 
PUTOOO CS ME CAGOO LA VIDA!!! 3
Nice game! AddictI have as hell and you never will be tired playing this awesome game!
Thats game that will never die
4th world graphics with a free spririted romp through illustrious landscapes makes this game a thumb thats shaking around and about to fall off after being shot with a glock so its still there but it hurts so good
Reomand 
I played this game back in 1.5 before shields and before VAC before steam had the GUI overlay. Im a OG CSer. Had alot of fun scriming using MirC, CAL Leagues, CEVO. Retired team aG and clan SKj. I blame this game for getting me into a computer profession. haha
A very good game! Maybe its a bit old but its still good. If you dont care about the graphics or have a crappy computer and you want to play a really good fps  This game is for you
Cool game 3
The first CounterStrike Mod for HalfLife is here, and it is pretty fun to play the mod that started it all!
Great gameplay. First played during CounterStrike 1.4, was awesome then, still awesome now. Highly reccomended. The CounterStrike series is fantastic.
awesome classic.
Greatest game ever
Play and keep calm.
this game is verry good as I am a HUGE fan of the counter strike series. Only the bad thing was it took me ages to actualy get the hl1 games to work as of a compatibility glitch
No life 
I put probably 5,000+ hours into this game between the ages of 12 and 14.
Classic FPS after Quake and HalfLife. This was the game that brought PC gaming to mainstream light Behind Starcraft. Professional tournaments sponsored by large tech companies was the tip of the iceberg. Strong communityran servers proved to be invaluable when considering how easy it was to find a place to play without hackers.  Purest First Person Shooter game I have ever played.
Old school FPS. The one that started it all when it comes to modern shooters. Still fun, fluid game play. I cut my teeth playing CS, my first fps game I played. Takes a bit more skill. Many, many good times!
this game was unusual of its kind. Now its has its era gone, dont know why. Its an awsum game, i am quite unhappy for it as its been officially removed from esports gaming. Its a must play online game.
The Game Is shiting awsm!
Good ol school CS 1.6
A verry good and old game . Actually is verry populated , considering the age .
Is a nice game !
Classic, a must have for shooter fans.
Best game on Steam Store!
CounterStrike 1.6 is a wicked fps Multiplayer game to play on. very much fun. played this when i was a young kid. and well still do at this day now  very great game! one of the best pc games if i must say. 
Old school pew pew pew.
Try Badges P

The best FPS shooter ever.
CS 1.6 For Life 
Play the worlds number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular teambased game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your teams success. Your teams success affects your role. Also zombies HnS jumping kreedz jumping  deathrun run through obstacles and crap 
Best game ever, ever. Destroyed by hackerscheaters.
. 
This is my very first game that I played on Steam, CounterStrike. This game brings back good memories. Very addicting. Its probably the only game that people are playing today on that isnt running off from a source engine. If you never played CounterStrike 1.6 before, try it out. Its one of the best FPS game of all time. If you dont like it, well, you didnt paid alot of money for it.......or did you?
THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME. BUY IT
The Best Multiplayer FPS Game Ever Made.
the best online fps game ever 
This is game caused the revolution of FPS games so it gets 5 out of 5 but be warned if you are not MLG you will be mocked and called a noob.
It is one of the best FPS games ever made. Graphics does not matter, it is all about the gameplay 
The coolest game i`m ever played !!! 
Have Low RAM? Have No Graphic Card? Care Only For Gameplays? Want a First Person Shooter?? Well Sir This Is The Best Game You Can Run On Slow PCs
very good this game.
Nice game DD

Oldschool, but still awesome, although there are some cheaters. I suggest to buy this game if you havent, dont be a pirate D
i can,t play it. does anybody know how to restore setting
I love counterstriker
Some old school shooting D
my favorit game!
ok game but not good HD GRapics
Loved the original CS, actually quit playin when csSource came out, wasnt as hooked to it and missed it ever since. Came back to try csGo
Awesome game for a multiplayer experience where you are competing with several other skilled players. Really awesome.
Really awesome game..  CS is my life.. D PLAY HARD... BE PRO.. 3
old but still a nice game... I miss the old days when you could wallbang p
best online first person game ever. y
A very goob game that lasts for years and years. Keep on the good work.
Oh i miss the good ol days
I miss the countless nights wed play this together, Chris.
Classic. Very well made game
Ahhh, the old faithful.  Work of Art, timeless classic, masterpiece, timless work masterpiece of classic art.  They say several things will survI have a global nuclear meltdown... Cockroaches, the Sun, and CounterStrike.  !!!COCKROACH FI have MAN, COMING TO A TOURNAMENT NEAR YOU!!! COCKROACH/10... 8/10
awesome  play from long time but always seems new new new
Good game to learn how to aim 
very nice game..

the original cs
Awesome, oldschool, easy!
Best MP of all times!
The one true CS.
Very addictI have game
play hard go pro!!!!
This game really proves that graphic does not matter but gameplay does...cs 1.6 3
Why did it update ?
The classic. The original. The first and last of its kind. The beginning of a legacy. Or just hours upon hours of time wasted while your brain controversially shouts to you Just one more round!  The excitement of a firefight is a standard of most FirstPerson Shooters but CounterStrike is different. The game tries to focus on communication and teamwork coincided with skilled aim and complex maneuvers rather than just freeforall deathmatch game. Failure to comply with the games train of thought winds you up in the lovely thing we gamers call Spectator Mode. Gotta love that! Although becoming proficient at the game will take a lot longer than most games it is worth the time put into it!   Gamers that are looking for a game that requires teamwork, skill, time, practice, and communication will not be disappointed!  Presentation 8/10 Gameplay 10/10 Graphics 5/10  Sound 6.5/10 Difficulty 8/10 Lasting Appeal 10/10  Overall Rating 8.5/10
In the 80s my tapemate Richard D. Reynalds disappeared down my extra 8track speakers clutching opiate presciptions and blues mixtapes. I remembered his parting words FUc k John Coltranes Newphew  Id tear my Pseudo Goldfish in that Flyinglotuseater. Take my Taxicard, Im off. But three avenues deep, I regarded his winter jackettas nothing more than a Sony stance. My firstdraft redeemer is a real VB! Wow!!   And dont pose me a steam, you neglector Flying Aphex! True Macho  What did we teach?ageispolis is famous for its slowburning ziggurat. Check it, mountainchair gig at 2!!! 
better than the original!
It truly was one of the best first person shooter games at the time. I still play it to me graphics dont matter, the playing of the game matters.
the best game ever ....
The best fps game in the world.
This is the best game ever made. EVER.  
Wasted tons of my time. 10/10.
The best FPS ever!
Best FPS in history. Enough said.
Hands down the best multiplayer FPS ever. Even 12 years after its official 1.0 release, its still the most played action game online. While other big online multiplayer FPSs have come on gone with a lot of fanfairi.e. Battlefield 1942, COD 2, Battlefield 2, UT 2004, CounterStrikeSource, Quake LI have, COD 4, etc etc etc this game has remained a constant favorite in ESports and amonst FPS fans. Lets hope CSGO can continue the CS tradition of teamplay, great maps, competitivevness, and unmatched gunplay. LONG LI have CS!
really fun competitive gameplay
Undying legend....thats it..
Whats good its good and its the best !
classic shit‚ô•‚ô•
I am not a Pro But yea 10 years ago i bought it and I 3 d it so much , I still do
Amazing game ... cs forever...will never let u die \m/

Its a fun old game with flaws but worthy of a buy
Original game will always be number 1 !! before cod and after cod ! 100/100

Verry nice game 
Best Game Ever And this Game Proves Graphics Doesnt Matter!3
A Game For All Professional CounterStrike Players!!
try an see!!
i play dis game for about what? 6 years? well yes i do, and i absoltely love it. its amazing, it doenst have singleplayer but the multiplayer is what keeps me here. i can play the same map over and over again, but it will be still fun because ur playing with friends or playing with different guns or strategis, thats what makes it amazing
best in the world
Just nothing to say, than thank you.
Great FPS game.Yes, it has not the best graphics, but if you want to have a nice aim, —É–≤–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ 1337 –ø–∞—Ü–∞–Ω–æ–≤, nice game collection and etc. you should buy this game.  It doesnt have any achievements, but i gurantee that you will have fun there!
One Of The Favourite Games Of My Life .. 
Original game that has progressed over the years. Has dI haverse population that has grown outside the box. Now coders not affiliated with Steam/Valve coding new mods for CounterStrike 1.6 After over 10+years, this game is still on strong. Come join us while you still can.
Old School if you see what i mean 
Remember where all of us played this game in cybercaf√©s?
Hell yes!
What can i say, game which will be always in my heart at numer 1 place.
Short and sweet An fps classic, shame on you if you dont own it...
Its the best game i have 3000 hours on it!!!
Great game! I started with source, and felt that this was going to be a downgrade. After playing for about four minutes, I learned how competitive have the game was. I learned I wasnt good at the game, and trained for once. That was something I had never done on CounterStrike source.  Now its time to talk about the bad things First of all, although there are more servers than TFC has, there is still hardly any servers. You can find a server and join it, but most of the servers have custom maps and free guns. Obviously the graphics are a downgrade, but who plays games for graphics? I sure as hell dont. And for the year 2000 the graphics are great!  There is a misconception with this game where people think that Bunnyhopping is still in the game. Its not. They removed it in 1.4 and it is now 1.6.  Overall, BUY THIS GAME!
I love counter strike. I have played it since my cousin nickname Mafia Al Capone showed me. I now have played Counter Strike off and on for about 8 years now. Keep it going Valve and Steam.
If your computer is a toaster, this game is for you. While challenging, you can still pick up and play this game despite the assumption that youre 10 times worse than literally everyone else.
The original and still the best.
why did u took my game from steam 
always the best ! 
the best multiplayer game of them all!
Probably one of the best games that I have played in my entire life and I think it will always hold a place in my heart no matter how many other games come out and try to replace it. WON WHAT WHAT?
Best fps team shooter . A lot of weapons to buy and very many gamemodes to play
This Is A Great game and i personally love it 333
Good Game for lan/pub/automix/clan
Best online fps ever
cannot aim. 10/10 Best game out there IGN
the standard in FPS.
The biggest competitive have First Person Shooter there ever was and ever will be. Extremely Skillful and Team Based Tactic.  Amazing,  10/10  1.6 Forever  Buy this over CSGO
I like this game. Cs 1.6 is best game 
Been Playing this game for 8 years , cannot Stop playing it , One of most Played games , Best FPS game and first person D    Respect 3
*
Long time since I have played it ! Cs was/is the sh#t !!!
I strongly recommend this game. Awesome graphics, cool modes at very cheap price $ . And one of the best multiplayer game I have ever played
Still a great game
This is most skillfull game!
We all know CounterStrike, and we all played it at least once. We all love it, and we all still play it nowadays. Great, fun, working on any PC, shit‚ô•‚ô• or new gen. Great game.
One of the great competitive have shooters that started electroic sports. High props to valve for making a legendery game
Brilliant gameplay, lots of options, graphics are very good for a game thats old and made 1st November 2000. One of the best firstperson shooter games aroung its time 10 years after HalfLife.
Why not buy it? Its classic, it requires low requirements, and more importantly, its FUN! People who are new to this may be frustrated when playing this but eventually when you understand how the game works you will be good at it. Its always good to have games like this that has low requirements, so if you go play on your friends pc or if you just simply want to play this, i can pretty much guarantee that this game should work well and will not WASTE your time. In fact, itll KILL time if you are bored. Just have to get yourself hooked up into this and you are all good. Just be sure to also find good servers, mostly with alot of people haha! So, gI have this game a try!
Awesome, good fun
Fun times in the good old days.
only 11 hours listed on my account, I played hundreds if not thousands of hours before they started tracking game time.
This game is the best Counter Strike game EVER!
Good game 20  21 century and FIFA
The most popular action game in the world !
The best fps game ever and the most addicted ! XD
The one and only D
When you left click, you shoot. 5 stars
After so many years the game is still playable and enjoyable, its one of the first most competitive have fps game that I known and it still have pretty good player base.
It is one of the best games I have ever played.
Its the original
CounterStrike its really amazing, but today really its bad we cannot play good, just before are good. Server are Sh~# PPL are Shpercent$ really its BAD  People Play free, Play Clean, Play to your mode, and OFF HACK, OFF cheating , OFF Scripting, OFF ALL    Play Fun 
The Best FPS ever D
Yes , this is awsome game
Play this game now!  Join us!
Very nice game .
Why should I even recommend this game to anyone new to this if they get their asses kicked by the real CounterStrike professionals who have been playing this little bad boy since it was released. I think theyre the only ones who actually play this game anymore. Its not even played in many eSports tournaments anymore since there are newer games out there sad tho.
This is a good game if you like fps shooters.....
all time favourite game till this day.
AddictI have.
Love palying this game.
Who cares on graphics if you get the still most tactical action shooter available.
 http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBjd60TfTsA 
Play this p
Possibly one of the greatest first person shooting games ever made. Try it out and see how you like it. Too bad that numerous number of hackers are around these days, but not a probem if server admins are present.   You can try maps like dust/dust2, assault, or even fy maps like snow and iceworld. Awp maps are also great if you like scoping and killing opponents with one shot.  Maybe even go for some of the fun surfing maps that are still around.   Lastly, fyi it does take some time to find the optimal sensitivity setting that you play the best with.
This game is so good 
Very nice game!
Nice game!!!
The counter strike 1.6 game cannot be quit. Easy to get used to the people so that he is unable to switch to CS S, or CS GO. Maybe the reason I think my favorite FPS game.
I left my Xbox 360, FB just because of this game.
For OldSchools!
Playing all counter strike from the date it was released. Still one of the best games ever made.
Classic never dies!
This game will never get old!
Sick game, enjoy it alot
An amazing classic! It excels from killing zombies with a violin to flying around a knife map using a Pidgeot!
old classic
EPIC Game Better than all other fps games exept CSGO but If you dont care about graphics and love the competitive have scene then play this game 
1.6 is still goin strong!
bad file consistency a rha h cnt play /
Great game. Bring back memories
can never go wrong with this. ever....
My First CounterStrike game if my memory doesnt fail. Must have ha hours of fun with it!
Pretty much the best game ever. period.
simply the best game I have ever played and possibly will ever
Its a great game first version of counterstrike and the best of them all, 1,6 ftw pro game
Most fun I have ever had playing an fps game on pc. So much better than call of duty, and probably has better graphics too.
I fully recommend this game to any FPS player who wants a challenge and a fast paced shooting experience.
Still the master of all tactical shooters out there! 3
Always in my heart. An all time classic that I can never forget. I still love to play the eagle catch the chicken on de_dust 2. This game is just FUN! I dont gI have a shit about the graphics but this is better than all of the other.
What built to CSGO and made it into one of my favorite game
Best FPS game ever! Legendary... a lot of fun!
yup, still works
Joined steam just for this game.  THE best multiplayer FPS experience you can get! UPDATE shifted to CS GO D ~#CS Fan

Best FPS in human history. Source and GO is volvo shit scam.
Man Simply Awesome Game 33333333333
Most classic game of all time?
KEWL and easy game D
Almost 4000 hours spent in this game, never gets old, 10/10
VALVE HAS PATCHED CS 1.6 GO BUY IT NOW!

Nc game but old
Old but Best game ever 
Old but gold..
in boats we love swag forever Jennifer Lopez
A game that became legend.
one of the best fps games
The original mod from half life 2, I grabbed this when it was free way back, been playing ever since, with tons of user made content, a large community to play with this game is still a great buy. Wheter your camping or lobbing nades, skill and teamwork are a must to succeed, mics are even better, this game can be as serious as you want it to be, just dont get mad bro, lol.
CONNECT 46.174.50.2927211
Best online Shooter I have played also because you can mod it for fun. This game takes more skill than a multitude of other games and for anyone to ever miss out on this game is doing a complete disservice to onesself note to get the original onscreen multiplayer skins set the game models to not be HD in the video options menu
Id gI have this game a 65 because of the outstanding gameplay and because i am a great teacher who gI haves fair grades
best game ever ctreated Y
This game gave me a serious addiction until recently. Its like a drug. Dont play it D!
The original game that started it all.   InnovatI have, challenging, and teambased multiplayer.  It takes years to master, but once you do, its an amazing feeling.  9/10
Fun game , but outdated !
i am die hard fan of this game.. !!
I Love it...!!!
Best FPS of all times, nothing can beat this game.
BEST GAME TheDoctorE
Very good game love it!
none of the games out there on lan have facinated to the extent this game has, hats of to creator of counter strike 1.6 the best ever build
Hackers everywhere,every server.Do I recommend this Game? Yes and No. If your going to play CompetI havely your out of luck because of this games VAC. If your buying this game for offline play I recomend the Zbot and The Offical CS Bot mods.Fix this game Valve it was perfect in 2001
top games
best fps ever.the best counter strike gamefollowing GO on 2nd place.the hardest tactical fps out there where the guns have actual recoil and you need real teamplay and cooperation to win
probably the best game ever
If your reading this, that means you have a steam account. Which means theres no reason you shouldnt have this game in your library already.   Btw dont waste your time with CS Zero
The game that started it all.  I have been playing the CounterStrike series for as long as I have owned a PC. The name is even known to nongamers around the world. If you havent tried your skills in this peice of history you are missing out.
Cs for life
Best and most played FPS of all time! What else do i need to say? GI have it a try if youre not already addicted P
Great game that spawned a great franchise
This game is the best 3
What are you waiting for!! Go Play!!
What can I say about it ? It was my first love, we spent countless together... This game is for sure the best game of all the time!!!! Its been 13 years since the first headshot, and still got the same excitation!!!!! 
Mesmerizing passion for real gamers!
A classic that you dont wanna pass by
Very Nice!
ofc i do the beest game ever !
Cs Go time
Counter Strike 1.6  In order to be good at this game you will need to either do research on how the guns work or put plenty of time practicing. If you spam a lot, take note of exactly how the bullet spread goes.
Amazing LIKE Awsome This Game Tellzs... us The Old Generation Is Not a Joke This IS A Game Which Change More Than Millions Of people Life ******************************************************************* Unlimited Stars ********************************************************************
One of the best games that I have played in my life. Goodbye sweet 1.6.
This is the best CounterStrike ever, ruined my life. 5 stars 3
great game so fun get it if u love cs and want to see what the first is like
The grandfather of all modern First Person Shooters!  This is the game where i learned the fundamentals to being a good team player.
One of the best game EVER!
Very cool game. Lately the book club has been trying to learn to communicate with Mexicans and Spanish people so this game really opened a new world for us, letting us dI have into the daily lI haves of a Mexicano and their struggles in the virtual world of Counter Strike. I will be recommending this to my book club and spanish class.
BEST GAME EVER !!! from 2000 to 2014 ! 1.6 is still in the top 10 games in steam ! everyday we see more than 40K who play cs without forgetting the nonsteam guys ! its just the best game ever ! i hope the same for csgo to be the best game ever like 1.6 used to
CSSSS
What can I say. The game that made competitive have FPS what it is today!
i guess its good but its a old game 14 years old but it has okay graphics
Long played counter  what to say just CS !
this is the best game i have ever played p lol
After many years of being out. By far one of my favorite games. I have purchased it many times for myself and friends. Even tho the graphics are shakey. With a decent modern computer and recent HD features this game looks remarkable. The physics in this game are remarkable, relastic and complicated. Its a hard game to get a grasp off, but now that you cannot just spray at ones head and get head shots. This game alongside dota, and starcraft. Were Pioneers in online competitive have play and this game should recieve high acolades for its contribution to esports.
olldd but golldd the best game ever!!!!
Ehmm you know 
For some reason it does not work on my fresh 13.04 ubuntu installation with wine. When I want to join ANY cs server I get the message, that blabla map is not  correct.
An old timing classic. But gets quite bored in the end...
Best game of all time!
Movements much more better than the new fancy schmancy CSGO movement!
Why are yo playing a game over a decade old?
Legendary...
It is and always will be the best and most addictI have multiplayer game ever created!
Best gameplay, the biggest base of players and modders. ExlusI havely modes like Alien, Zombies, Jumps, Football or JailBreaks! Simple but legendary! Who didnt play this game, he cannot call himself a gamer!
For the love of god, let a newbie at least get a few kills before headshotting him with the pistol from a few miles away...sheesh...
Toomates 4 U, enough for me ! O
The reason why Steam is alI have. The reason why Valve is what it is today. Still CS 1.6 is the best our there.
One of the most played and known games in the world. You cannot get bored of this game. Really recommand it.
=]
This was my very first PCGame and also shooter. I started playing it in 2006, needless to say, this gem is for me one of the best games ever. It is a lot of fun playing it with friends but playing alone can also be very nice. It may be a little bit difficlut to learn, but when you know how to play you will sit there and play this game for hours and hours. I guarantee it.   10/10
No matter how long I play this game, I never get bored  #CsForever3
I love this game, kill people and then win the match
One of my old favourites.
ULtimate game Ever got adiccted to it!!!! 
Easy and fun. Check how good your reaction is.. 
hmpf...
awsome game just loved the gameplay 
!!! OLD BUT NICE !!!
awsome game too old D it have nice settings D and more players who loved this game D 10+
Probably one of the best works of Valve Co.
This is the most beautiful game I ever played!
This is awesome!
this is really fun
The best game.
This was one of the first pvp first person shooters i played online back in the days of 56k modems, when a ping of 200 or lower was considered very good. I played this game for about 5 years, i even made some of my own levels for the community. Those were fun times.
best ever  classic
Thats a very nice game and its a pleasure to have it
13 years play this game and i never get bored.
The quintessential modern combat FPS multiplayer. Often imitated, never duplicated. I spent the greater part of a decade enjoying this game. Much of the fun however came from the great friendships developed over years of online play.
play for funn
One of The Best multiplayer game ever.
i Recommend this game because is the besssssst game evaaaaa
The most Amazing FPS EVAR!!!!
Excellent action packed dynamic game, where you get to test your reflexes and meet and play online with your friends!
counter strike me to mai sabki.....
COD IS JUST A BETTER VERSION LOL
I actually never payed attention to this game due its so old. But some days ago I installed it just to see if its still actI have and it actually is! Thats amazing. Nearly 20k still playing this game even though its pretty old.   For the time I am playing this game I am in love with it. The community is so nice. You dont get matchedup against shit loads of hackers like it is in CSGO atm, its a very fun game to play and I probably will play some hours too.
classic best game
BEST Shooter I have ever played. Tested by millions of people. It left only good feelings
My first game in 2000.
legendary shooter
If you are not into achievements, unlocks, stats and all that bs then this is the best fps out there to date. Pure tactics and aim skills are what matters.  Too bad its been dropped from esports and overtaken by GO and its awesome weapon skins, and soon to be TF2 hats. 
Classic, but still fantastic
coooool and awesome game! worth the money!
Spent many years playing this game and it was amazing. Console commands and the simplistic gameplay makes it a great game. Mods such as WC3, UWC3, SHERO make the game half fps half rpg which I loved . However, like most fps, hackers ruin the game and is probably the main reason for the low population aside from the repetitI haveness.
fun fps but there is a high learning curve. Suprisingly fun after 15 years.
Classic, functional FPS multiplayer shooter that everyone can enjoy. Although its showing its age now that modern FPSes have the aim down sight function.
This is the best game I ever played
This game is a must buy. If you dont care about graphics and such, this game is a gem. The community is pretty.. died. Atleast the competitive have community. Anyways, this game is a must buy!
Old but the best !
Ruined my life. FI have Stars.
What can you say about this game...
Neverending story  CS 1.6 rules! Other newer versions dont even measure up to 1.6s ankles!
Played from February 2000  September 2004.  The one that started it all. The original.  G.O.A.T.
nice best game of the world 3
doesnt need a recommendation, if youve played you know its the best FPS of decades
Best fps Game ever known
Its an oldschool classic!
It is so classic and so balanced that you just cannot go wrong with Counter strike. 5/5
de_dust is still a blast after all these years. The game runs well even on laptops!
I stil play this game today its that good, anyone who dont have this game should get it immediately!
My First Loved Game and still is awesome
play this its badass
The best shooter ever made 3
This game is really good 
Counterstrike 1.6 is absolutely one of the best games ever made  ALL PLATFORMS. Soon to be 14 year old game, this game is still the most popular game in CSfranchise. I would recommend any new player to CS, to actually first buy CS 1.6/Anthology, because this game is golden.
Most Addicting FPS of all time
Life changing game gI haves birth to a new, game changing life!
old school game 
Steam has been born on this game, few years later still one of the best FPS game n ofc graphic doesnt matter in this case.
Destroyed Gaming/Avadis
ok im not amazing at this game but it the best out of all of them. i think it takes A LOT pratice to get decent lol well to me im not great but if you got a couple of friends, hey might as well play this game
shoot people in the face and not get arrested for it. brilliant game concept for people that struggle with anger issues.
Buy CSGO instead of this  its a good game tho
old school time... the best game ever made very simple and competitive have
Really good tactical game, balanced and very fun to play, an old but gold. Get it free by reediming HalfLife 1 retail versions code.
Ill say one thing... its a challenge and like that im sombody that isnt really good at this game but i can still mange to get that rewarding 3 kills or headshot.imo i think that this a good game challenging but rewarding in the for me that is. Im 13 years old and i just came from CZ and i like it. More severs than CZ so more fun.
Really good game for its time! if you have a time machine, go back in time when it was popular and buy it!
Simply the legendary mulitiplayer first person shooter.  It has now become reduced to thousands of servers full of tens of thousands of CounterTerrorist and Terrorist bots in a perpetual endless war spamming their radio commands killing each other mainly on de_dust2  The only full servers are shiting BR spamming the chats U GIB ME MONIES OR I REPOT U HUHUHUEHUE HUE HUE HUE JAJAJAJJAJAJAJAJJA JAJA JA JA
SUPER COOL GAME
Stress out
Love this game....
tb
Very Good Game Like It

Hello, my name is Jesus, I will now proclaim that this gaime is ok. Have fun in life cya in heaven byebye pls no coperino pasterino
This game is great, but you can not put the gun target. I think that is the only downside the game is well thought otherwise.
Old, but stil good game. I realy do like this game, but im tired from it  Thnx valve for this amazing fps game 
GREAT OLD FASHIONED Classiscal Game from VALVE 3
Highly recomend if u love FPS !
Fun game, playing for blakecoins n such
This is what got me into FPS  with my pentium 3 750 mhz, 128 gb ram, geforce mx 32 mb video card...  ahhh the good old days
Epicness Redefined!
I would definitely recommend this game for CounterStrike or FPS players.
Awesome Game.. love it
best game of counter strike by far nothing ever compares to it
yeah marvallous game..!!
Great game, most time plaing this P
Most playable game ever
the mother and father of all fps games!
This was my first game that I bought on steam , this is a clasic piece , a Counter Strike that you can mod all you want . God old times , ehh 
Great Game! Its Old But Worth Buying!!
The Game Like
Well I guess since I have 117 hours clocked into this game *cough cough* steam bug *cough cough* I am obligated to write a review for this game. So this game is most definetly timeless as it is basically super smash bros melee to CounterStrikeSource/CounterStrike Global Offensive haves super smash bros brawl. This game is unique as when you die you dont respawn until the next round meaning that your team can lose by having all of its members die. As well, you need to buy your weapons or take them from the bodies of your enemies instead of just finding them scattered across the battlefield like other games of its time did. Today the game can seem a bit outdated with a lack of ragdoll physics making aerial deaths look weird and unnatural as well as the obvious outdated graphics which can be fixed with a hd patch that just looks weird and unnatural compaired to games made at the time of the patchs creation 2003. Overall I would recommend this game if you buy the retail copy or if they fixed the bug that is the only reason why I have logged 117 hours into the game.
my non steam no lag but steam lag . FOS IS ONNI 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i love it...awesome game...play hard go pro....P
 yea! the counterstrike superhero mod is fun
NU IMI MAI MERGE COUNTER STRIKE CS 1.6 INTRU IN JOC SI IMI APARE HALF LI have MA POATE AJUTA CINEVA?
I recommend this game because the great gift pile asked me to. Also because its still the best shiting shooter out there. Thats right, shit Call of Duty, shit Battlefied, shit Halo. 1.6 peoples.
Good old game.. Stil alI have! Gathers, or other servers.. MIXes, IRC chaneels... Good memories 
cannot PLAY GAME COUNTER STRIKE PLZZZ HELP FATAL ERROR 
The first and possibly the best Counter Stirke. Over a decade later and still thousands play it a day? Other than Nintendo nobody has been able to master something like this as well as it is here. With a huge install base, small game but wonderful gameplay, this is worth your $10
yes a good game if played in a good computers, awesome experience at 100 fps. Will suggest a gaming mouse and a pad for best aiming
Its really a one of the fabulous game i have ever played
yes...i have done it...and at last i wana say this game is like a drug addiction.many ways to play in this game clan,pub,gungame,base bulding abd all kind of zombie games...simply i like clan play...its not enough to gI have your 100percent in game..you have to do more better...this game is really awsm...i have no words to describe the game cs 1.6 specially
This is the OG game. #Classic. #Oldschool. The godfather of FPS shooters. Theres a reason why it still has a strong playerbase, even stronger than its successor CSSource. Even with CSGO out, it still has a healthy number of players. The gameplay and balance is still unrivaled. This was the platform Valve used to become the powerhouse it is today. Highly recommend even in 2014.
Itz A Superb Game Since 1999.......................................................................................JUSt enjoy Playing This
Very Nice Game  !
Nice game,love to play it, best online gaming experience ever i had with it 
Good old game , Altough its old , we still love it , and we still play it. Its counter stike D ! GI have a thumbs up if you agree with me
Amazing game from my past and present. Its a classic that I will always love.
This game is fkin awesum. Just bought it and already hav 4 hrs on it &gt. its addicting dudes
Still one of the best shooters ever.
greaqt games for the nancys
Old but still good! playing since i got my network connection !

the best game in EU
I Love this game very very much man.But can anyone help me out with a laggy flash light problem and nightvision haha. Also Is there ANYWAY i can get the HD models that look F****** cool Thank you guys SOOOOOOOOOO MUCH
This game is such an original classic, its graphics were ahead of its time back in 2000 and still dont look that bad, the gameplay is what that makes this game such a hit, the gameplay is straight to the point for a shooter. The gamemodes are addictI have and i think all of them are just as good as the other
This game is still going strong after 15 years. What more is there to say? It has never been done better than this. Easy to learn, but can take years to really master.
why it! wruth me  failed to initazile authentication interface. Exiting... 
It is impossible to play this.  Gl if you try, I even tried noob servers and still got owned.  Any Fps looks like an EZ pz game compared to Counterstrike.
Recommended 10/10. Everything , i really mean everything in this game is great. except for the graphics , but if im not wrong this game is from 1999 ,sooooo... yeah , just buy it
The Classic Counter Strike , this is the old shit‚ô•!
THE BEST GAME EVER ...
this game although old still is very good game and it takes actrually some skill in it to 
10/10 nothing more nothing less. 
This is Great Game   Lets play Togeter
simply nice
what can i say ? most played fps ever with a reason
If you want to learn spanish,russian,swedish language play this game.
1.6.... what a classic! Still owns some games!
i remeber when this was a free Mod for halflife
SYT B3tter
cs 1.6 one of the best and addictI have fps games ever made
Very good game still, this game is still fantastic, undead 3
the best online multiplay action game
The best competitive FPS game ever.
Actually retired
If i could find out how to play this game it would be awesome i click on cs and then i see a black screen and then steam main menu is there ? 
absolutely !!!
cs 1.6 4ever !
first game i played competitive, enjoyed, good watching the professionals play
Very fun game, graphics are disappointing and just not nice, I personally lI have in Israel, Israel has a lot of multiplayer servers and their sons loads admit most enjoyable so it makes up for the graphics ...  Also has the option to fight against bots you can practice with it or simply pass the time, I wish there was such a nice single player.  So in short, if you are looking for a game with many Indians, multiplayer servers, easy and fun then this is the game for you!
Have been playing since 6.5 and there are still 12 year olds flaming me in voicechat 10/10 for tryhard authenticity
its simply best 
You know, I dont mind this game.
nice game     i love it                      best game                          absolutely best

I grew up playing Cs 1.6, this is one of the best games late 90s !
check out this hot game!
One of the best FPS out there!
GREAT GAME! MUST TRY!
Check out those 2 hardcore shitfucks on the cover. That should tell you all you need to know about the game. And what kind of name is Counter Strike? Did they name it COunter Attack and realise that sounded too genreic and decided to name it something off? Or maybe this game is about the strike of countertops? We may never lnow. Like i said, look at those two hardcore GSG9 and GIGN operators and that should tell you all you need to know  Money and time sink, like the Philadelphia Experiment only with less GOvernment coverups. I should be studying SS what is this   0/10 struck too hard would not counter
Best game I haver ever played!
Best off
ill highly recommend this game fun!
Probably the game that kickstarted the Steam success, Counter Strike still is a game of choice of the Top Worldwide Electronic Sports Leagues and Championships with a vibrant and huge community of players and tournaments. No one gets called a true gamer until it plays it.
Classic Game. nuff said
BEST EVER CS 1.6
A classic from the heyday of Quake, Warcraft 3, and Brood Wars. The game that gave esports a face and a true legend in its own right. Still rocking 13 years later with one of the biggest communities on steam. The One, The Only, COUNNNNNNTERRRSTRIKKKKKKKEEEEEE!
Classic superb multyplayer game, But till STEAM the hot air is out. Is it the servers? the players? The stupid fanmods? I don¬¥t know....
OH! The classic CounterStrike... the first and best FPS I have played. It just brings sooo many memories playing with friends, so many laughs, etc.. If youve never played CS, please, just quit life!
Mother off all first person shooters. You have to buy this game to show respect to valve and shooters. It`s ORDER!!!!! 
The Best CS Game in my childhood

The Best Game in My Life D

Here we are 14 years after the game Relase.... And tull this very they i still pick up the game and play hours a day. For 9 dollers this games is a great buy.
Cool game. 
A clasic. Tied with Source as the best game of all time.
.
Fun game. Worth the buy.
One of my most favorite games. 10/10
Probably the best shooter ever made and it will probably stay that way. This game literally changed the way how shooter games are today. Well done Valve, well done !
This game is the best shooter game and the game that i liked the most!  But There is nothing for non steam players that hack in the servers!
Good, old Counter Strike! One of the must play games.
This game started the FPS franchise. Well technically it didnt, but it started it for me dammit.
i have played this since i was 10 years old, what a classic game !!, always enjoyed the Lans and clans involved, very enjoyable, shame its gone downhill so much though!
Awesome to the max =]
this game is a legend! CS 1.6 For Life!
The Granddaddy of all FPS Multiplayer Games, CS is unapolgetic and based on skill alone! Its a game that not afraid make you feel like you really suck.....but you keep coming back for more everytime!
Literally inspired Sandy Hook.
The best on the world
This game is a classic and it is highly competitive have. It is recommended for all who are new to the FPS genre or just want to improve their skills. It even tops many FPS today. I rate it 9.5/10
This was, is and will be the most popular First Person Shot game ever. I rly dont like the new one GO version of Counter Strike. This is legengary game and it will be actI have and popular for many years from now on.
... just play the game! Without cheats plz?...
This game played a huge role in my childhood D Still the best fps for competitive have play, but unfortunately steam ruined this game with the latest updates 
Call of Duty is back again with another smashing hit, but its not called Call Of Duty.  You can shoot guns in this one too, and thats swell.
Theres nothing about CounterStrike 1.6 that hasnt be said already, the game will always remain flawless in many gamers eyes throughout the world. Tactiacl shooter at its finest, Cs 1.6 offers not only perfectly balanced matches and good maps but intense sneaking, real quick scoping, amazing weaponry, strategies and SO much more! It is the easiest game to just pick up and play, and it would totaly fit in Things any human beings should try atleast once. list.
I have some problems with this cs I have added many servers to my favourites but none of them are coming in Find Servers tab + my connection is working fine. My humble request please fix this issue.
Umm been playing it for 10+ years i like it
recomand 
Its a great classic first person shooter for its time

great game, i miss it competitively
The best FPS team based tact shooter on the market hands down. if you dont believe me just check its history.
Who can not love the good old classic CounterStrike? I played this shit religiously when I was younger, had some good times. The game has gotten pretty outdated, and theres large traces of hacker shits. Regardless, still a monumentally epic game.
This is simply a legend. Who never played and enjoyed this game, cannot call himself a gamer.
I will shiting kill myself if I end up playing it 
Nostalgia ftw
my best game of all the time 3
shitk this game i love it c
CounterStrike is defiantly dated, so I recommend getting the newer ones, but you are not going wrong with this one if you decide to pick it up.  7/10
this is top Game Y
The wonderful classic that sparked a legendary FPS series. 10/10
Excellent game, thoroughly enjoyed it back in the day.
Okey,Good story. 
cs 1.6 is still the best
Play hard, Go PRO 
Awesome game.FPS lovers must try it
A musthave. This is the granddaddy of online shooters. GET IT.

Its Counter Strike, nuff said.
This one here is a winner.
Play hArd Go Pro ... \m/
A nice game which requires cooperatI have playing because of objectI have like placing/defusing the bomb or killing Terrorists/CTs
Ah, CounterStrike. What can I say about you that hasnt been said already by your millions of fans. As one of the most popular HalfLife mods to become into a full retail game by Valve, I surely can say this...  CounterStrike 1.6 started it all.  As an original mod from Valves game HalfLife, CounterStrike grew increasely popular til this day, spawning updated verisons such as Source &amp Global Offensive have. Even the overly repetitI have Call of Duty has been influenced by CounterStrike, even thou Activisions changed its view after Modern Warfare 1, but now Im getting off topic...  In conclusion, there really is no explaination from me to describe this popular game. CounterStrikes gameplay explains its self to the community.  10/10.
source is better still fun tho
Awesome Game Play Thsi Game Friends
This is the classic and the best iteration of cs by some metrics, personally I really liked it I highly recommend if your pc is slightly less powerful.
Play CounterStrike and be convinced that CounterStrike is the best game ever.
play hard go pro! D
this is my favorit game. got best moments 3
hello games cs 1.6
dis b a boss g4me 4 every1
Classic action! One of my best games ever.
cs go player must have skills from this game! 
What could I say about this that hasnt been said already. Im glad I have this in my collection and 11/10 for the memories of playing this game!!!
Just play it!
The BEST game for ever ... 3
This game may be old but its still one of the best games on steam.
Best game on the PC, game 13 years ! the audience of players still be numbered in the millions. The perfect game engine provides unlimited possibilities, a large number of modes Zombi, Biohazard, Surf, GunGame, Jump etc make the game varied and exciting. Only here you can with one clip to put entire opposing team, then plays the role of your skills playing shooters. The only game in which you can play for years and still have fun.
The best FPS game ever. must have
Is there really necessary to say something about CS? I dont think so. Legendary multiplayer action game that lI haves for decades!
You just must play this game if youre fan of FPS games.
wtf, how is this game still $5?
Still playing.. 
Game on!
Public  BenNghe.net 
One of the most awesome games ever to exist. I recommend it to everyone who likes FPS games.
Best of memories...
I played this for 2 hours back when I was 15 or something. I sucked at it and people yelled at me. I think if I had spoke on the ingame vent thing they would have treated me differently, but Im no shit‚ô•.
Without a doubt the best multiplayer game in the unI haverse! Will probably stay that way for at least 10 more years!
The best shooter of all time
One of my favorite games! Great job Valve!
Amazing. Although many pro players play it, and nobody speaks english.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What is there to say.. its counter strike, the best shooter I have ever played, forged COD, CS forever.
one of the best fps games ever. still play it till this day never gets old.
This is a peanut butter and jam sandwhich with the crusts still on the bread and missing the peanut butter.
Awesome and exhilarating D Play hard, be a pro!!!
This is my latest account so i dont have many hours on this, but this game genuinely is one of the best games ever made and its the source of many beautiful games.
Basically my childhood. I spent hours and hours late into the night playing this. Very fun competitive have fps with great maps and great gameplay. 10/10  PS. Hit me up if you want to play this.
It combines the best of team based gaming with an authentic and therefore exciting approach to tactical ops.
best game  i playing cs from 2007
You cannot describe CS. Its CS!
Good Game!!! Epic!
GET ON MY LEVEL.... One of the best FPS Games, the 1.6 Version will stay always in our hearts. I recommend it for everyone who wants a tactical/action shooter Games!! 
loshedo
Good old counter strike  a lot of good memories
awesome game love it best in the whole world
classic but great
Childhood.
classic fps game, everyone knowing this game CounterStrike since 2000 until now this game still famous !!!
Highly addictI have 3D oldschool FPS game. Everyone should know this game.
  GOOD COUNTERSTRIKE. THIS IS CLASSIC.
Still good after all these years
Buy the complete pack for $7.50, nuff said
Old School Awesome!
my counter strike 1.6 doesn t work why???
Still the game that has had its share in building the foundation of multiplayer gameplay. Really one of the first games which demanded tactical gameplay, good aim and sometimes a bit of luck to be victorious.  Though the community is not that big anymore, you should ask yourself Can you really call yourself a gamer if you havent played counterstrike?
^. ^
Really good one.
cs 1.6 = Addiction 3
One of the most fun and natural feeling military shooters ever made. There is a good reason people still play it nearly 8 years on...
Grande counter!!!!
the BEST ONLINE FPS game. not as good as v1.5 though. but since 1.5 is no longer available, this will have to do. 
Best FPS game, its so awesome get it its totally worth it
Addiction 
Old game is gold game D
THe best game ever played!
love it3
For more than 10 years this game still has billions of players playing it including me. Possibility to create and customize your own game arena. The textures may not seem the best, but the gameplay and strategy really sucks you in. My first shooter game I have bought, only because of respect to developers.
as
this is the online game that started it all for me, its slowly dying but always always I find myself going back to it. 
If you need to be told what this game is, Id prefer it if you werent on my team in any FPS, ever.
still a awesome game!!!!!!!!
#ftw......Its the best online, multiplayer, LAN and FPS game ever if u ask me, so I am not even going to rate it !! xD  For those of you who dont know, there are a lot of professional matches, competitiveons, tournaments and leagues held for this game and the prize money is also pretty handsome, so dont underestimate it   #The million dollar question  CounterStrike, a sport or not ?  I say  A BIG yes !!
One of the greatest games ever made. Not actI have now, but in its prime this game was amazing.
Did anyone not play this game at some point or another. As elusI have to me as football and stock car racing in its ability to transfix the lI haves and minds of some shall we say, unenlightened gamers out there.
This game is just awesome!
The simple fact that this 10+ years old game still shows up in the top played games on Steam clearly says something about its quality. I feel like I shouldnt even recommend it, as its name speaks for itself. Easy to pick up, difficult to master, CounterStrike is one, if not the best multiplayer FPS out there, and itll probably remain that way for many years to come. The fact that this game rivals it sequels in number of players worldwide only shows how great this game is.  So, do yourself a favour and get it.
Good one
Counter Strike 1.6 ‚ô•  What else their is to say?
This is CounterStrike 1.6, the latest version of the original CounterStrike. The graphics are far inferior to the source version but the gameplay is considered better by most CounterStrike veterans. This has some maps not found in the source verison and has the riot shield which is not in the source version either. The riot shield allows you to avoid bullets but you cannot have a primary weapon if you have it equiped so you can only use your sidearm. This version also features a gamemode not available in the source version. The gamemode is where you must protect a player controlling a VIP while they make their way to the rescue vehicle. If you want to see how different this is from the source version then go right ahead, its only $5.00 on steam so you have nothing to lose.
This game is one of the best games i have ever played!!!!
This is just a classics.
The multiplayer FPS that started it all. Might be a old game, but its better than COD, also, even though the graphics are shit, that doesnt mean the game is. Instead of picking your loadout, you get ingame money to buy weapons from a menu. There are no attachments to the weapons. There isnt THAT much to say, but its still very good. Final Verdict 10/10 Classic.
Game is great bro... too great
Either everyone uses Aimbots or I really suck. Probably the second one.
i cannot lI have without counterstrike ..
Time proven classic that will always be most fun us born in 80 last century !!!
.361
Tactical and Strategic game and a lot of team work  Nice game...... I Love to play CS 1.6 every time I open steam. n1 D
still want to play 24*7 ..
classy!
Still ages well in many ways. In addition, its probably the only GoldSrc game that still has players on it, and for good reason. CSs game mechanics are tried and true, and they still hold up despite two sequels and almost two decades. While CS GO is my personal favorite, CS 1.6 is still damn fun, and gI haven that its an older game, you can play it on literally anything nowadays. Theres a singleplayer mode with bots, perfect for newbies or lone wolves, but make sure youve practiced before hopping online, or youll get destroyed. tldr you cannot go wrong with this game.
The classic. Nothing compares!
Ah, the one and only CS 1.6.....so many memories here. This game was my childhood. Big YES.
Classic and never goes old
A game of skill. Master this game and youll be able to dominate in any other FPS games.
The game that started it all well, almost... simply a classic
I shot youre head with awp, why u no die?!
Well, this is the one that basically started it all... An entertaining game that despite being old, its gold!  Cheap and a whole lot of fun.
Cool old Game!
The best oldschool tactic Shooter P
the community is harsh. I suck at this game. supplies running low hope crumbling
Get the complete pack when its on sale and you can play some fun maps with your friends !
The best game on Steam store 3
Grew up with CS. Highly recommended as a parental figure replacement.
This game as its released a long time ago, but it still carries the compitI have sense, unlike the new versions of counter strike source and Go, playing this game is fun and i think it would remain as a favourite game as much as i play anymore games.
Just awsome !
revolutionized first person shooters
cs 1.6, gameplay is good, good fps shooter game, enjoy it. BUY IT
Old.
I cannot believe this game is not FreeToPlay yet. I mean, its been like, what? 15 years? And people can simply just download the nonsteam version. Should really be FreeToPlay to encourage nonsteamers to play it on Steam.
Simple mechanics, fun community, old but gold!
Back in high school I used to lI have and die by this game  then got a girlfriend and my gaming time diminished to an almost nonexistent level for a couple of years and I just fell away from CS. Still, it was great fun. Ran a clan, competed in OGL team matches, etc. Great game especially if you get a group of friends together to run with.
Old is Gold D 
Ilove this game
Best online shooter of last years, old but damn good
Counter Strike rocks! its the only game I can hop on and jump right into action in 5 minutes.
a very good game 
awsome game 
Its a classic, some may not like it but definitely its a mustplay for everyone. Its just a regular multiplayeronly FPS, so its rating highly depends on people you play with. BTW, thanks to this game you have Steam. Well, maybe not, but... Ahh, nevermind.
a noshitfuckt old shooter that is actually fun to play. Get it.
It doesnt need to be recommended.
Still addictI have to play and very fun! With lots of servers to still play in.
This is the best game ever!!
this game is old
The most competitive have game ever.
Cool game ]
I like this game.
Well known fps shooter game Counterstrike will change your life! Dont be lazy to pay 9‚Ç¨ for such good game. I recommend you to try this game! Seeya ingame 
Very Good game the Best!
Nothing like the good old days with the Classic of the Classics, Counter Strike has been such a huge game for me, and also for the world as one of the most played multiplayer games on the internet, I remember like if it was yesterday the old days when i was a children playing LAN games on the Computer Class with my classmates, and not forgetting when i learned to play it with the help of my older brother, it is such a nostalgic game and one of the best I¬¥ve owned in my life. Totally recommended to get back to the old days
Good Games!!!!
Original is always the best, none the less.....CZ was alright, but this is where the real fun started. Let the good times roll!
Classic game. Great shooter even today! 7/10
Still the best imo 
1 of the best classic games
still the best counterstrike out there to date.
An amazing old shooter that is really great fun with friends after you get some experience.
Fat Albert seal of approval
Just the best
Simple AdictI have and Elegant !
Since 2002,since it appeard in Romania,its the greatest and the funnest game I have ever played.
The only one game that holding me for more then ten years.
Great game! The BESt cs ever made!
Best Classic Action Shooter Ever Was Created!
Pretty cool game if youre into killing shit and being leet
Very good game, the movement is fantastic is fantastic.
best there is, best there was, best there ever will be
Ë∂ÖÂ•ΩÁé©!!!  Its the best online game I played, it can make joy for you and your friends, also you can play with your friends. When all the players die, you are lonely, you have to fight for another enemies, all the teammate put the hopes on yourself, and you will never forget that feels!
Its CS nough said
No matter what, hands down my favorite PC game. Alltime best shooter, in my opinion, and Im always hoping for the comeback.
Simply the best online FPS video game out there.
very cool game.
Very good game, but that russians people so shitshit S
Still the greatest shooter of all times
Great game, would play again 10/10.
da grafics r bad but dis game is still good
Old but Gold! Simple mechanics, lots of mods, and a great game to blow off some steam.
Its my favorite game and the best game
Ehh, its ok I guess
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You can also play ping only at the beginning of a great
superb Game must try !
This is one my favorite games of all time. Everybody should play this game
Play tomorrow, Play today! @_@
Just 4 statistics ! =D Theres not too much to say, epic game will never die .
A very good and classic game! I think its the most played game since publish...CounterStrike 1.6 is for those players, who love competitiveon! Its not so easy to be the best in this game, so you must spend some time learning techniques, mapcontrolling, weapons and so on...its a very nice game to spend your time on! I recommend it to all of my friends and for anybody else!
good for players looking for a good fps starter
Go 10 years back and this was the first FPS game I came across, and the first game I ever spent tons of hours on. I keep coming back to it even in my adult years. Perfect game for kids. Great at teaching essential values regarding life. Some of the best voiceacting and most memeroable quotes in any form of media. Fire hole is a classic.
Classic CS CounterStrike never gets old, Ka_ maps were the best game type for me, loved round after round dodging blade swings and countering with a sweet headshot, no game mode more tense than Knife Arena, getting stormed at by several opposing team members hungry for frags, using all skill and wit at a 51 ratio and coming out victor.. EPIC!
The team based multiplayer FPS game that started it all, in my opinion. Classic game.
love it. controls are so solid and the maps are good. new one coming out in 2011 i heard.
the beest 3
cs 1.6 is probably the best yet team based fps game, go is a step up from source but its a very debatable topic that it is AS good as 1.6. Definately not better though.
Wait... you dont own this game already!? Whats WRONG WITH YOU!? How have you not owned this since its release!? For shame! You might as well just wait for CounterStrike Global Offensive have to come out, since you waited this long to even get CounterStrike. Im ashamed of you.
Good game!! Very nice!!
HD Graphics, better than Battlefield 5
Steam is what it is today because of this game! 10/10
A very good game!
A game when you can play with you best friends 
Great game! Addicted to it! GI haves you skills!
Counter Strike is a great FPS simply about terrorists doing things like bombing supplies or keeping people hostage while the CounterTerrorist try to defuse the bombs or save the hostages. This game has many great mods and maps that make it fun to come back to. No wonder this game used to be the worlds number 1 online action game. If that isnt enough you get CounterStrike Condition Zero with it. I would gI have this game a 9 out of 10.
a cult classic of culminating counterterror camaraderie
filete la wia !
#
A true classic multiplayer FPS. Difficult for beginners.
This game is legendary HANDS DOWN
the leggend.
Never gets old.. Classic shooter with great gameplay.
One of the best shooters.
CounterStrike 1.6 is much more difficult to get used to over CSS, but it is much more satisfying to succeed in. Recommended!
THI IS THE BEST GAME GUYS OWN !T 
Really good game, Id recommand it.
Great shooting game  still one of my favorit shooting games
Play it every day ! 3.
Yeap. Its the game that covered all my life. I have it when i was 6 and it makes me much more relaxed than everything.
numer 1 game. Simply the best
It has 13 years since it came out and a lot of people still play it. As you can see, gameplay is more important than graphics.
Perhaps one of the best games every created. If there is a balance between simplicity and complexity, it is this game.
Superb Game ...... xD must have it D 
The best shooter. –Ø –æ—Ç–≤–µ—á–∞—é =
Well what to say about this game..legendary.. =
PlayHardGoPro
Worlds number 1 online action game. 
The Most AggressI have, Awesome,Shooter That dated back then when it was made.It Was the best shooter ever since Halo Combat Evolved Came Out. And Its still popular today.So I,personally think you should buy it.Its Only 10.00,And then,if you have kids let them play it when there older,And then let their kids,kids play it,And so on and so on... So Really Buy This Game To Experience What The Gameplay Feels Like.
You get kinda bored after a while..... its interesting until you meet players with cheats and so on..... this game was a good RPS but his time has passed x
Just CS 1.6
Classic game that will never die!
The worlds most playable FPS game...Ruined my life...5 stars D
Remember, when you play CS the Terrorists have already won.
Great game! 5*
Its a Multiplayer Game can be played on LAN or NET IP ADDRESS Its simple and strategy, one of most played games!
This game is amazing if you like any counter strike try this one out the recoil is diffrent but oh well
Video of me   http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqlapBcLAk 
Still the shooter ever.
+nostalgic game +best game modes of multiplayer +best maps +so much fun  recommend for all peoples who like nostalgic video games  9.8/10
The game that started it all, good for slower PCs.
Ahhhh CS 1.6 it is kind of dead now, but I couldnt begin to tell you how much time I ahve spent just playing this game. It is fun and takes actual skill, unlike that easymode CSSource.
This is the best and always willbe the best cs ever i would never stop playing it till i die i love it so much.
Great game? Or Greatest Game?
great way to spend some down time
stay alI have ...
Many hours of fun in this game. In short, money well spent...Time well wasted! D
Boom Headshot! Fun back in the day... I would presonally go with CSS
Its just classic game  I love it 
Amazing game, will never get old. Probably better than both CSS and GO because of the price and theyre all basically the exact same thing.
This is an oldschool game.
Wasted
Great fun! Whats not to love?
This is the reason I made a steamaccount.. a mustown 
Much Goodness. As of sould any Valve game be. Simple easy to pick up and play but very hard to master. This game and its other similar sequel Condition Zero have both many mods ranging from football right down to the godly great Fureion Mod.
  Game is very good  i like this game and go buy it this game and go funny go play
MEXICOS favorite game este juego es realmente muy bueno Really, if you are considering getting this game, get it. Best CS game. 94/100
Spent ages with this game, its physics and all is a gem of computer gaming. With its price, everyone should have it and play it! a lot!.
This is the game that really defined cooperatI have play. A classic that to this day is one of the most played online games ever and should be for many years to come.
This game... It takes ALOT of skills just to be good at it. I mean, I get shit‚ô• at this game, and I AM a seasoned FPS player. I guess 10 years ago I would play this game to death..
I used to love this game. Now I love TF2.
Even though it is old, this game sure lI haves to today, and is still great!
Valve has taken a large selection of the maps from CounterStrike 1.6  Office, Havana, Italy, Aztec, Chateau, Cobble, Piranesi and of course eternal favourites Dust and Dust 2, and recreated them...
A game, every gamer plays and should play.
This game is massI have time killer. It manages to be both simple and addictI have, while having no customization, no unlocks, no achievements, nothing to distract you. This game will have tens of thousands of players from all over the world for all eternity.   Those players are generally silent, but trolling and griefing is not at all unknown. This game is also very well known for cheaters. Several admins have bizarre rules that only make sense to them on their servers, so expect to be banned from a few.   There are a few popular mods for this game, one being the Warcraft mod. You are generally required to read the notes on how to use these mods, but there are plenty of vanilla servers.
One of the most popular online Shooters!! Your Role affects your Team success and Your Team Success affects your Role!!!
In some cases a multiplayer game/component gets just about everything right. This is one of those cases.
Im gonna let you finish but. CS 1.6 is still the #1 PLAYED FPS OF ALL TIME!!
I must have put 200 hours in this game, oh man those were the days. I miss you 1.3, lmao.
It is a peak of FPS Esports
This is no1 FPS game in the world, King of Esport game.
PlAy hArD g0 pr0__ achieve eternal gaminG*
Best multiplayer FPS in the history, and today one of the best PC game. But good days of this game are permanently away. Valve destroying this game every day, but community is stronger, as they think. People played this game years ago and will play further. VIVA CS
Best cs ever ^^
Grenades flies like piece of shit, but game still cool for tactical multiplayer shooter.
In D2 camping in T spawn with awp is so 2005...
One of the best FPS of all time.
This game was saved because of the AMX Mod X scripting, otherwise I believe it would have been dead years ago.
The Best for his time !! 
An abslutly amazeing millitary team based tatical shooter. This is a great game for LAN parties and team vs team games. Also very fun to just play yourself online. 9.3/10
This game got me into FPS games. Nuff said.
Good for netbooks.
shit‚ô•‚ô•s are cool, and so is this game.
In the beginning, there was Counterstrike. Classic tactical teambased shooter.
My first love.   This game made me to the gamer i am today. Everyone will agree that CounterStrike was and still is that awesome uncle of Fps.  9.5/10
best teamplay game
Pretty much set the bar for modern day FPS
the best FPS in the world forever!!!
I spent 10 years playing this game. What more can be said?
The most important FPS in competitive have gaming history. Respect.
nothing can beat Cs
Its a all time classics
Classic game very fun.. everyone should own this game 
A great fps, if you dont own this, buy it.
Recomended!
ITS F***ING CS!!!
Easily the best American Football game I have ever played
bomb has been planted , go go go  Hehe The best counter strike to play with , The newer ones may have new features and better graphics but this the version to start counter strike gaming with , Extremely simple to get used to the mechanics and well balanced .  Go on find a Dust 2 24/7 32 players public server and enjoy the game
Great game. A lot of people still playing, full/modded servers. Its easy to get into, and its cheap
A real classic game. I lost track about how many time I have spent playing CS
i would strike the counter hard if i could return this bad game
you should play this because i made a lot of maps for it. if you would like a copy i will buy it for you.
This game is a legend !
9/10 Great Game, Worth having in your steam account!
This is a classic. Much better since they added Widescreen and HD reslutions.
good game but complicated story
I think i watched a high school friend play this once. Actually, it might have been the unreal tournament version. W/E!
Everyone should have played CounterStrike 1.6.  This game defined online MP shooters, and is still played to this day.
This will be your best friend when your awesome pc/laptop breaks down.
Best fps of all time, was in 1999 and still is in 2011
The original recipe of counter strike. Play it or Die!
Awsome game getting outdated
Best! buy it ^^
Classic, classic, classic. Will this game ever die? 
What can I say, nostalgia and a great childhood. This was one of my first games back on my old steam account when I was around 8. I hardly remember my first experiances but I remember staying up and playing this all night oncefirst all nighter 3. Of course not just because of nostalgia but excelent gameplay, excelent movement, and perfect balance. 10/10 
the shit
Very good game ! Best ! 
The Best !!! 3
The original Cunter Snipe! The only nonsource game actualy played by people!
A friggen classic in shooters, play it and love it
Ok, this is an internet classic its been the butt of many meme jokes, but you just cannot help getting past the fact that it became an internet classic. With Terrorist versus CT matches, weapons that would make your head spin and a variety of game modes and community based maps, CS is just one of those games you cannot pass up.
Awesome Game ever played.... 
Some would say this game started it all
A game that made history! 1.6 4ever!
CounterStrike is one of those games that I can play for only 2 minutes. Seriously, the graphics suck big chicken nuggets. The thumbnail for this game makes it seem like its graphically in tents, but it is not. Id say wait for sale then buy because this game sucks.
The one of my favourite games of all time i played it since 2000 so it was a lot of fun for me to play if u dont have it buy it now!!  Ruined my social life too 11/10
One of the best games ever created !
Good game of all series CS,but have 1 terible bug when you playing on laptop you use 2 videocards and can be bug with craphick 2D ....
It`s a very nice game. Try it !
I LOVE THIS OLDSQL GAME  MY BROTHER PLAYS I MORE THEN MYSELF, BUT IT WOULDNT BE BORING PP
cannot fight it, best game I ever played. No further information needed. 3
I LIKED THE GAME BEST OF BEST IN CS
_cl_autowepswitch 0  hud_fastswitch 1
this game is so.....ESSY!
The Game Of Life 1.6
For like 10 Years the No. 1 EgoShooter in the ESport Scene, Best Mod of HalfLife and sadly scapegoat for many killing frenzy¬¥s. Was one of the most innovatI have Games that time.
Nice Game Y
Old game but still good for weak computers
One of the best game of all time D
best game evaaahh! buut, CSGO can be the same enjoyable and fun! D
Im a player FPS Games i cannot find anouther game fps like counterstrike 1.6 or globale offansI have i think this is my best game i play it in my life i wish can find anouther game bcz the cheaters are stuped when he use that shit Stop using cheat plz and thank you ‚ô•
best old school game
Simply THE BEst D POWAH !!!
Oldschool, nice mechanic, pro game phisics. Forget about nice graphic, drop out cool free to play systems with donations for hats. This game is really for ninja maniacs.
Nearly comes close to Call of Duty, oh wait it doesnt.
Awesome game! Excellent variety of weapons and maps. Great feel. Not like any other FPS i have ever played. 100/10!
This game passed the test of time
The legandary game
Cs is awesome, its a game that only requieres skill and not ranks and that crap.
The classic orginal that started one of the best FPS MP games of all time! This game is still really good, and a classic now, but there are not as many servers as there used to be. It is great to go back and visit though.
There simply is nothing like this game. Whether its the nostalgia from years past, or the fact that i still have fun playing it 14 years after its release, it is one of a kind. They will keep releasing newer versions of the game Condition Zero, Source, Global Offensive have, and not that these are not good games, they just do not do for me what the original has always done. Even coming back to the game after not being able to play for years I still find the fun that i had in the very beginning. If you are into cutting edge high graphics and realism, it probably isnt for you. If you have a taste for the classics, however, then cs 1.6 is for you.
This is a best game ! ever !
The only thing I have spent time on cybercafes playing while others where watching porn.
Best gave what i ever player xx
Its a quite good game. I play from time to time when I have nothing to do. Definetely the best FPS of the whole CS series. RECOMMEND!
Counter Strike is the best FPS Multiplayer ActionShooting game i have played till now...
Oldschool FPS, Beats all the newer CounterStrikes.... 10/10
Gameplay 10/10 LAN Fun 3/3  Good Servers 2/7  CounterStrike, perhaps the most competitive have game of its time, hasnt aged well graphicswise, but the gameplay remains more precise and consistent than most FPS games today. This game is a  great  LAN game for gettogethers, but otherwise you may have come too late on perhaps one of the greatest games of all time. Servers that I have connected to show that I have horrible ping, and the lag assures me of that. I have come across a server or two that I can connect to and enjoy, as well as being vanillaCS, considering all the servers that mainly run modded games which is about 4/5 of the servers. So here are the reasons to buy the original CounterStrike   Pros  Can run on a potato Plays smoothly no matter the settings. However, you can connect to a server somewhere in Latin America or the Middle East, and lag like heck. Great fun to play with friends, as it can get really competitive have, but at the same time your friends may not have this ancient gem, so this is dependent on the situation. Solid gameplay. Nothing else really compares to the precision that went into it over the years. Large map selection, as well as custommaps found all over the internet. Mods, but many are not as good as some of the others. You have to dig through garbage to find the fun ones.   Cons  Very few good servers Hard to convince people that dont already know how great this game is to buy it, considering its more than a decade old. So...many...sound...file...downloads...from...servers... Custom maps are very rarely as balanced as maps packed in with the game.   Verdict  If youve got the money, and are curious as to what this legendary game is like, then it wouldnt be a complete waste, but if you are coming here from the latest CS or CoD or Battlefield, without having played other older FPS games, then you might regret the buy because this is a game that is quite outdated in terms of UI and such, and might not be appealing.  Overall 7/10 now, after more than a decade since release.
out dated i only weedhop in it. turbad game
i have problem with cs 1.6   when i open cs 1.6 show to me black screen  black screen  
horrible gfx
POLECAM CS 1 ANTHOLOGY!
Old but still gold! Amazing how people keep playing this! Still a fun game c Happy to be able to play it again ^^
This game is SUPER
I recommend playing it !
its the best FPS there is, Just a tip if you a kid. If you buy this game, its really hard....
Such 1.6 very wow such high FPS wow smooth
Hellio guys plz help me when i am run Counter Strike it works fine i see ct then the black screen shows up and Half life ahs stopped working / plz help me
Probably the best online FPS out there to date. Still a large playerbase after all these years should make it clear. The best part is probably how even if you have a crappy, very low budget computer you should be able to run this old game without any issues and have a load of fun. If this isnt in your steam library and you enjoy playing online FPS games then gI have this jem a go.
Top Game, its one of those games you must own.
AweSOmE gaME anD no dOUbT wHY iTS woRLdS nO.1 onLiNE mULtipLaYEr gAmE. D
my mouse is stuck while playing counter strike i can use the arrows button only to turn left or right its only with this game , there is no problems with counter strike source or other games .. please help   thanks .
Buy it, but get PODbot
Counter Strike is a classic game. Fun, addictI have, and customizable. Its incredibly easy to mod, texture and map for so you could expect a whole lotta mods.  Pros Great gameplay, bit of a learning curve but itll become second instinct soon enough Servers are still up, even for such an old game it still has a whole crapton of servers.  Modding community is GREAT Cheap, as in really freakin cheap, not indie game cheap, but still very cheap Cons Most people who you will play with have been playing for longer than I have been alI have. Expect to get pwned very very often Netcode is a shit‚ô•, adjusting settings using the console takes a hell of a while People are sometimes way too serious when playing For Graphics junkies Graphics are pretty damn oldlooking what the hell do you expect its GoldSrc  While its not a perfect game it still provided me with tons of fun and I love playing it. Its a bit slower than CSGO and the weapons behave differently.   Conclusion If you want a nice classic shooter thats light on the pocket and the computer then this along with HalfLife should be in your library
This is a good classic
The best FPS created. It is because of this game that the FPS was revolutionized, be it in the competitive have scene and the casual scene. Nothing can compare to the greatness of this game.
best game that i ever played , recommend to all
Nice Gamer
The game is very fun and I recommend it to everyone
aD
CounterStrike can join in with Golden Eye in taking credit for defining the comman FPS game as we know it today. Its servers are still actI have over a decade of entertainment. You customize your gear then choose to either use tactics to disarm the bomb, or you can JUST RUSH IN LIKE AN INSANE PERSON, GRIP THE HOSTAGES BY THE ARM AS YOU SAY FOLLOW ME NOW!!!, and get them to safety. It is pure greatness. And the system requirements are not demanding, so virtualy any computer nowadays can run it.
Good game, no comment  10/10 
Its just CounterStrike, i dont know what to say...
I want to play But i cannot play
wish c.s. 1.6 will be back!!!
Didnt spend much time on this game,at all.
The best FPS game ever,from 1999 to now...
theres kinda 50percent of them players are cheater... but if ya go a great team, friends n stuff, this old game can show you some coolness!
 http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHJ0AiLQqM   http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7eLDF_yDpk 
the one and only
CS 1.6  It will search for you. It will find you. And someone in the game will probably kill you. If you are noob that is.  10/10 Would kill noobs again.
the best games 
CounterStrike is an almost perfectly balanced mix of teamwork and individual skill with enough depth and nuance to inspire countless esports competitiveons.
Old is Gold.
nice game ever
Its a great FPS game
just the best of the all games in the world 
Counter Strike changed the landscape of multiplayer first person shooter. Ruthless gameplay, perfect balance contributed towards the creation of a very competitive have scene. Years later it still stands as one the giants among games. Loved and still played by thousands, it has shaped lI haves and destinies.   
This is a classic game. It still to this day has a huge player base. Yet the ones that still play are true die hard CS fans. Most are very skilled and have been playing the game sense day one. Still one of the best CS I have ever played. Before anyone asks I run this game on windows 8 and it works like a charm. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone looking for a classic FPS experience.
Like a baws !
Best game on world OLD SCHOOL 
Rumored to be a CSGO clone.
One of the best games ever made. Period.
The Original and possibily still the best minus the riot shields. If you love nostalgia as much as I do, and you dont own this game but used to play it at LAN cafes maybe? Get it already!
The nostalgia... This game is classic.
Old school CounterStrike, its just the best.
i could play this game forever! *_* ...and not get bored.

CounterStrie is not just a game, it is a kind of spirt. It taught me never gI have up, and be strong. CS is my best friend. BUT NOT THAT shitING CSGO!
The popularity of this game had suprised me  Yeasterday i were watching a finnish document, which shows a normal life of poor peoples, one episode told about Nenetsi tribes who lI haves in northen Siberia. There were also a episode that showed deleted scenes of this document show. This episode showed that there were a small power generator in one of the nenetsi tents and there were one nenetsi guy who had get shit‚ô•‚ô• laptop from someone. Even this guy played counter strike. and in norther siberia!!!!. if you have a computer whith internet connection you must have cs it is so populargame. and good game also
Too awesome game Still the No1 game in the world!
Best shooter oldschool game. A must have.
Really good game, it brings back the feelings

Nice Game, Most Enjoyed with all friends and Barbique D
better then all the other Counter Strike versions available on Steam. If you want to experience the classic CS, get it!
An old classic. Always enjoyed playing this for no other reason than its fun.
Awesome OLD Schoooool Game  I hop on to this when im sick on CSGO
First FPS game i have ever played since 2003 and still enjoy the game to this day.
This Game is a 2. Best FPS. The 1. is a HalfLife
little problem, there should be 3 options when u click new game, server server settings or server info and game, i have the first server and the second game i cannot add bots and i cannot change the settings, how do i fix this?
Perfect
Very Fun and Simple Killing
it started it all
too much skills n efforts needed to become a pro.
CounterStrike is very nice old school game! Ofcourse graphic side is very old and looks very primitI have, but gameplay is not repeatable. Gamers which once played this game will play it over and over. Phisics in game is developed very nice, all objects can be shooted through. I rate this game 7 of 10. One of the best shooters game ever.
good for wasting time
,,,,
Very good old classic game. This game was my childhood and i growned up with this game. I still play cs and for me it is the most revolutionary game of game history
part of me 3

Legend ..... wait for it ...... dary !
Is very good game
Game is really the best game
AddictI have... Probably the best replay value of any game ever.
Simple? Yes Outdated? Yes Fun? Yes  This is a classic FPS musthave. Although most of my enjoyment in this game comes from the nostalgia of playing this back in the mid to late 2000s, newcomers will also find enjoyment in this triggerhappy gem. This is the original CounterStrike, and it is a 10/10 good time.
A classic pioneer fps game, fun to play
I had an ight time playing this
the best shooter with friends
A Hell Of a Game D Y .. This Game proves that Graphics does not Matter .  10/10
Old school love this game P
This game has eaten half of my life, dont know how to review this.
This Game wat 2 say dis Is d bst game In d world for all the plyrs  from India  it Was a Hit game it will Be and it should nVr end dis Game
VERY NICE GAME ,low graphis
Nice game. but some cheated.
I love this GAme More than my life * 
The game that started it all for me. Simple and to the point is how i would discribe it. Bad guys vs good guys, eliminate the team and take your place in the CS hall of fame. I ended up playing this game for a professional team in the CPL tournaments.
very awsome game
Too much better than CS GO 
its so good game for you
It reminds me on my good old childhood  still love it! 
Good Game But many Cheatrs
Best game of all time ! Had my best years with this game
i will never stop playing this shitshitshit game...i loVe it!!!!!! ^_*

This game is a legend and everyone who has a computer knows it. Hours of playing and still lots of fun... The older it is... the better...
I recommend to other players its very cool.
1,6
I have played this game for years never forget
Best fps game ever played
CounterStrike 1.6 the very first game I played using steam... I used to play it alot... Now there are CounterStrike games with better graffix. But the original is still damn good!
  !!!  
In my opinion CS is the best game ever made! CS 1.3 was my personal favorite update, but 1.6 is and always will be amazing. I still pub a de_dust2 server daily.
hardest game ever appeared
Old, but good!
well.. its a okay game,
awesome game i love it 3
WonerFul and interresting game
I always find myself coming back to play this game. A true classic
if you never played counter strike before  get ready to be scrubed on       you nub
The legacy speaks for itself. One of the greatest modfuckgames ever.
Like Half Life 1, Counterstrike is an undeniable classic.
If youve never played the original Counter Strike you might as well gI have it a go. Originally a mod for HalfLife, Counter Strike quickly became an extremely popular fps game.
Even though i was VAC Banned seriously dont remember hacking or anything.  This game is still better that CS GO and CSS in my opinion. I dont know how to explain it, i honestly think its just nostalgia. But i dont think i will ever hate this game...  As the other games. Counter Strike has ALOT of gamemodes Zombie , Deathrun , Hide n Seek , etc.  I would suggest you buy this game if you like CS GO or CSS
COUNTER TERRORISTS WIN
most addictI have game ever made!
Fifty years later people will remember this game. It is timeless, just as super smash bros. melee is, dota1/2, and starcraft, etc.   At the competitive have level no other game tops this as a team based esports fps. So many mechanics to learn, bhopping, ladders, russian walks, spamming crouch to short hop, grenades are 1 pixel width, floaty nade physics, flashes, smokes, all these raise the skill ceiling. Too much to say for what I have experienced, try it yourself, and goodluck finding the niche gametype you prefer.
Its wasting to much of your free time.
Worlds greatest first person shooter game!
In my opinion this is the forefather of all fps games, its been the most succesful and popular fps game of alltime.  I remember when CounterStrike was just a mod, but later it was made into a standalone game.  This game is not about the graphics, its about the gameplay, the unique feeling you get while playing it.  Its nothing like a Call of Duty game or even Battlefield, this game has something in it I just cannot describe.  I would gI have this game 5 of 5 stars.
Classic game I still like it. It should be cheaper.
like my source review, this is one of the most highly played FPS for a reason. the game that changed it all. if you dont have it, you do not know shooters.
play on
Classic game. 8/10
its funny games   now this game is not serious games like in 2006 since now CSGO more better than other CS  but, this game is have one special for me
This was my childhood in a nutshell
Happy 15th birthday CS!
very nice and good game
You can COUNT on that STRIKE! *Badum Tch*
The Best and the Legend among MP games  3
yo this game rox 
From a multiplayer and competitive have point of view, its the best or second best game to Q2 in existence Graphics are somewhat dated
Tons of hours of tons of fun. I reccomend this to anyone
Classic of classics.
A brilliant game.
CLASSIC AND A MUST HAVE GAME!!! I highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys killing games! It a rather simple game with simple onjectI haves either to deactivate the bomb, kill the other players, or rescue hostages. In my opinion its worth every dollar! D
top y
This game is epic!
I played a lot of games.I tried games with advanced mechanics,fancy graphics.I tried mods and all guides.Still,I never catch the feeling I get with Counter Strike.It is plain and fair.I love the purity of it.Its also absolutely fair.No skillpoints,no classes,no glamouronly gloss.It is the ultimate first person shooter.Simply the best ever.
This not Game This is My Life 
Good old clasic game!!!! 
I have started the game with the version 1.5
THE BEST GAME EVER.CS 1.6 3
My first love  3
Best cs ever.
Play to Mutilate..
Come play then rage quit because of mexicans and hackers  
Just love it 
shitshit
Very best game DDDDD
addictI have!!!
one of the first pc shooters I have every played and died constantly
This is an interesting game. It is incredibly difficult to rate it either yes or no. There are far too many points to consider. CounterStrike was released nearly fourteen years ago, yet it is still difficult to find an open server. It is incredibly fun and can make you laugh or tear your hair out. This game can be excellent for fans of strategy games and shooters, but its very rare to be able to enjoy it fully. Unless you play on competitive have servers, most everyone goes rogue and does not work as a team. There are frequent cheaters using programs to increase movement speed, look through walls, or assist in aiming. If you look through the community page, many of the posts are pictures of cats or pornography. When joining a new game, you always feel paranoid about what the server is downloading. The community can be very scary you must play on servers you trust with people you respect. If you can do this, you will have a blast. CounterStrike is still played by a huge number of people you can find great servers with great communities in nearly every language imaginable. Theres a wide variety of weapons to choose from, and it is simple to get in on the action. There are no paytowin or customization features‚Äîonly action. CounterStrike can be a fantastic game if you know how to use it properly.  Things to note  There are no bots in CS. However, the CounterStrike Condition Zero package probably the best way to purchase the game includes Condition Zero, which has support for bots and can be played without an Internet connection.  This is not 1.6 to my knowledge there are no shields and a few things are different the difference is negligible. However, CounterStrike Condition Zero still has these features.  This is considered a mod for HalfLife. However, it can be downloaded independently. Note that CounterStrike will be saved inside the HalfLife folder on your computer.
still one of my favourtie games of all time ... D
Best of the best first person shooters
Old legendary game D
Bralgh
love this game  
Where it all started
I spent countless of hours on this game back in my youth. I had a late start and started 1.5 but I remember trying to play competitive havely by requesting scrimmages with clans in my PUG. My fuck got completed handed to me but it was fun times. Staying up late and playin awp_map.  I really hope that CSGO is part of the steam sale this year. I missed the chances to pick it up in the past but I hope I can pick it up this time.
One of the all time greatest FPS ever made.
not as good as Offensive have but is classics. no hat T_T
not enough bats
its shiting good game for old school players!
I like this game.It is very good game.
Great game to spind late nights with. The time just flies into space and you wake up in another time the future. excelent game then and certainly is now.
Still better then Call Of Duty Ghosts
This is the game that ruined my childhood ! I literally was playing it all day long  previously was playing on non steam It was one of the best games back then, but now CSGO has taken its lead, so i recommend you buying Global Offensive have.
...forever in our heart.
The greatest game ever invented.
This is a classic, would recommend. Its okay 10/10
Always a classic.
Hands down the most addictI have teamplay based game out there.

I recommend this game if you play with your friends or at least on Only steam servers.
Best of old school!
The great classic. This is my favorite FPS of all time next to Team Fortress.
Its counterstrike. Nuff said.
One of the BEST FPS Multiplayer of all TIME!!!
The game that started it all...I love it better than global should be more popular... Dont want this game to die...
Very good game, i think more people should be playing it

This is a very fun online shooter! No matter how much time passes, its always fun to hop on and spend a few hours playing.
Really nice game!
Best game of all time...
Youll never accomplish anything if you dont believe that you can do it.
I grow up on CS 1.6, but now it is unplayable. a lot of garbage on servers a lot of music and useless things. low download speed, and everybody hack everywhere. Please make something with this game, just need some patch, for disable downloadable contetn, and useless things...
classic counterstrike you havent experienced any cs until you have played this
CEL MAI TARE JOC!!!
The best game shooting online in the world 
This is game was good ten years ago...and still is

Old,but awesome game.I play HNS.Hide n Seek.I recommend it you can try to buy it.
This is still the ultimate FPS in terms of skill and balance. I have yet to find another game that has come close to the level of skill required to become a professional.
this game is awsome !
Its the best game Ever
I have been playing this game since I was very young. Now, Im still playing it. I still remember the times when I was playing with my friends on our own server such great days back then. 11/10 without any doubt.

Counter Strike is one of the best first person shooter in the whole world, its so funny to play hns and other gamemodes! Yes i recommend this awesome game! 10/10 little cats!

Great game ,nothing can be changed !
i wont get off from this game..... EVER!!
where it all started, best tactical pc fps.
This game is just 11/10
Best game of all the time.Classic
The original CounterStrike was one of the most played games of my life. I have spent countless hours playing this game from 1999 to the release of CounterStrike Condition Zero. I can remember so many things about this game like the old PunkBuster antihacking program, the transfer from a standalone game to being forced to use Steam to play my Valve titles, the countless hackers using OGC and the amazing community created maps. There are more maps, weapon skins and character skins released for this game than probably any other game ever made. This is truly a classic and will be one of my favorites forever. Long LI have CounterStrike 1.6!
Recommend!
I bought the whole CS 1 anthology.Great timeterrible decision.  Lets get to the pointWhen you start,you..well get blasted in the face.Honsetly when i started on the scoreboard it was 115 so yeah. Glock,usp,deagle,mp5,famas,galil,cv47,m4 and Awp that is going to kill ye most of the time. Have fun buying and playing 
The Greastest game ever made in history.
shit!
Its Amazing!
Better then CS GO
What to say...? BUT THE GREATES GAME EVER!
i love thes game
classic.. but guys go play csgo D
Recomand D
Good game. Figure out the camera for me. Looking around doesnt work. 
This game truly has changed and as much as i wish i still enjoyed it, all the changes have turned me away. I will always recommend this game but for myself, i will stick with GO.
This game will always be my favorite counterstrike and its a game from my younger years that I enjoyed. Not alot of people play it anymore but its still good. Id just get a bunch of friends to buy it and have a 5v5 lan. c 3 3
Still one of the best!!!
This game is a legend. Such a game will not be ever. It will never die, will lI have on forever! 
Best in the Counter Strike series, have been playing this mostly since 2004. Sadly, there are only fewer players and servers now...
Skeet shooting at its finest
This game is horrible why arent the graphics good like Call of Duty Ghosts that game has very gud graphics wow Valve more like Bad oh snap
Very old game, but is still one of the best fps games ever. This is accepted as the best Counter Strike ever and I can agree. The mechanics feel great and the weapons are all very fun to use. rating 10/10  Chris
Its a very cool game. Not old, just a good Classic!
Best Game I eveR playeD..
Go go go , play the game.
cs is gud
Fond memories, but get CSGO nowadays.
Even if this game was released in 1999, its still one of the worlds most played games! I really recommand this game, to any person who like shooter games! 
So shiting sick!
Well, the graphics hurt the eyes, but the gameplay is still pretty decent.
One of a kind.
Game that ll never RIP
The best fps of all time !
best game online..play it
Great FPS game.Yes, it has not the best graphics, but if you want to have a nice aim, nice game collection and etc. you should buy this game.  It doesnt have any achievements, but i gurantee that you will have fun there!
for some reason running Counter Strike Source and exiting makes the computer think its playing CS but other than that good game although I probably only played for 533 seconds rather than 533 hours
since 2k8, lovely game.
One of the most revolutionary FPS Online games ever. Its an superb FPS Team Tactical shooter game that has few different game modes with lots of great maps! Highly recommend it to others out there that is looking for great competI have challenging online gaming.
Counterstrike 1.6...recommendation...  ...  Since 1999  Theres no need for it   asH  10 / 10 Punkte
IMMA BE L33T WHERE ARE THE PU$$Y AT?!?
This game is still popular ! I recommend it to everyone!
Probably the greatest team FPS that there ever was, Was way ahead of its time in all departments. Still to this day has full servers full of dedicated players 247. To think that it was originally just a half life mod shows that you dont need to spend a fortune to make a great game
best online action GAME!! 
its a good game all should play it 
A really nice game D
Bets In the world!
Just 1 Word  AWESOME ! 
I love this game. I think its way better than the others CSS or GO.
The game that started the Counter Strike franchise and probably one of the best. Counter Strike didnt have the graphics but it had the gameplay we all know to love in a CS game.
Very Very amazing game it wasent voted for most popular online shooter for no reason.
wish u comeback!!! =/
hi &gt&gt where the d3d mode???   i dont have it ?? only open gl and sofrware???

Classic, I met my bestfriends here 
Much fun, surf, HNS, deathmatch, zombies, causal mode, Clan matches and so on! Good game! 
Heyyo, The FPS multiplayer game that amazed billions of players around the world... and its easy to see why. Just play it and see how intense some of the fights can be. Still has a very strong player base even though its a very old game.
Beast.
!!!!
OldSchool ! ! ! Yeah
Legendary game .. will never ever see death
plz delete my cfg of CS16 in cloud cannot do nothing  black screen
This game is legendary!!! Any online fps fan should play it.
Good game, very fun.  3
this is game is awesome and a classic
Great game, lots of hours of fun!
Old school game !
better than cod
top player  top gamers  old
The best multiplayer game
If u want to learn to play this game all over again after one week break.  Go ahead
The best online first person shooter ever made.  EDIT Its sad when a game released in 1999 is better than a game that came out in 2012.
I played it for a while, died a lot and didnt kill anyone, but I had a damn good time doing it.
Love this cs,I Remeber for ever
Basically the best competitive have FPS of all time  If you dont already have 10,000 hours invested then its probably not worth playing
GREAT shit GABEN! I r8 8/8 m8 its rly gr8
such a nice game D
Dis is great nad there is still player online! and if you can play CSGO! its great!
Its as outdated as the Nintendo Entertainment System but it will always have a special place in my spleen.
screen problems.. it is sucking up.. cannot put back the screen in original way after it gotten wider.. no opption at all.
The king of all FPS games.
Best game of all times.  Hope it will have Match making system like CSGO with a bit better graphics.
Very good thx
I really need help. Why do i have 4 fps?  Windows 8.1
one of my most favorite games of all time.
This game is a genuine classic. Grew up with it. Got over 600 hours on it. Loved almost every moment of it except when I got killed by aimbot and wallers but oterwise a great buy. It has its perks and like a trillion mods of which Id say 25percent are running at any gI haven time from servers worldwide. Definitely recommend it to players who like oldschool games.
Classic! nuff said!
I guess its okay, I havent played it all that much tho
This is my favourite game and also from my point of view the moust interesting shooter game ever made. Is best to play it with friends or with other people to test your skills.
Classic, I like it just as much as CSGO and the community is great. No competitive have option for normal players, but still fun when playing with friends.
it¬¥s a good game for haters
its really nice game i know its old but its really still batter than call of duty
Truely The EVERGREEN game of all FPS games. Worth playing over and over again.
this game is so old that every fps player owns it xD  
We wont forget..
old school game ....it was a pleasure to play it thanks valve
Goes for like a $, Just buy it.
Best game ever, all the mods make the game worth buying and playing even in 2015!
The world will NEVER forget this game! I am really proud of it!
Cool game ^^
Toy for da black guys.
I know what youre thinking. Did he fire all 7 shots or only 6? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I have kinda lost track myself. But being this a .50 Desert Eagle, the most powerful handgun in the game, and it is a oneshot kill with a headshot, youve got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do you, punk?
Great and awesome game 
This is by far one of the most fun online shooters ever. If not the best ever made, And in my opinion the game that pretty much started the genre. I have been playing the game off and on since its release and still to this day it never gets old. The game runs really good on modern pcs and its really a game that when your doing good you really feel a sense of accomplishment. Plenty of fun maps to play on, plenty of servers to play on, plenty of customization options. This is one game that you can really taylor to suit your style. Plenty of user created skins for your weapons that can really make this game look amazing. And I still prefer counter strike over counter strike source. I dont know, call it nostalgia or whatever but there really is something about just good ol counter strike 1.6 that is just simply magical. It truley is a classic in every sense of the word. And STILL is just as enjoyable if not more enjoyable then any online shooter on the market today. So glad I got to grow up with this game. I would definitley recommend it to any fan of competitive have online first person shooters. Come Join the fun.
Very good game! I like it! Lets play. 
where it all started for counter strike
Great.Nice Game But server has bug still
This Is One Of The Best FPS Game`s I Have Ever Played.

Simply legend
Would be still fun if it werent for hackers. fun servers are goone
old school game still has the fast paced
Simply just one of the best Tactical fps games out there. Any one that want to buy it buy it. Well its old but its better then new games in 2015. Skill based playing and over all fun game to play i would say 7/10
Taught me the Spanish Language Would gladly chingate! Translate shit Off! Again! 10/10 for this classic
^ ^
That game will never die. You might think its old and unpopular but then youre wrong. Try this out if youre not do that before.
Best multi play fps ever. ever... dont buy if you have kids or a wife/gf or a job or a life.
very very nice game v
I love this game. There are so many options for servers. You can play the normal CS or you can play on a modded server. can was so much time in this game 3 3 3 3 3
Its old but very good game!

The King 3
You see an enemy... pew...pew...pew...pew... you die with a headshoot... D
One of the best FPS games of all time. 10/10
I played this game for a few years and it made me puke constantly and have bloody diarrhea every day. 10/10 A++++++ would play again
the old school CS!!! It is good to entertain yourself if you are searching for great classics
Cs its one of the best games ever , simply! 10/10
The game of the games
i did a mlg 420 noscop and 2 qiukscops and my gf br0k3 up wif me cux of this gam3 10/10 wont reccomend
CounterStrike being the first PC game that I ever played, And probably the most played game in my country. I can really suggest it, So yeah, Buy this game. It may be old but its excellent. P
I dont know. There isnt much to say here. One of the biggest FPS games out there right now. Still popular and you can still find CW + PUGs in IRC for 1.6. Definitely a welcome alternatI have between CSGO games.
I love this shiting game!
nice and good game !
ALL TIME BEST FPS SHOOTER !!! TILL NOW ^_^
Fun old shooter
Still an epic
Is ok, But Source &amp GO are way better obv 3

Played it?
BES GAYM EVAR mlgquickscopsmokeweederryday420doritosmountaindew2014m8
cs1.6 4ever
This game has no skins it only 100/10 would bang 
Best shooter ever! Better than CoD! Cuz you dont need perks or upgrades or killstreaks! JUST YOUR SKILLZ!
I don‚Äôt believe there is any gamer out there who doesn‚Äôt know CounterStrike. It took CS a long way of over 10 years to reach the point where it is right now. And certainly CS 1.6 played the leading part in this adventure. This game is the closest to be the father of all FPS games. It is not as old as Wolfenstein and does not have beastly graphics like Battlefield but CS 1.6 did not need those aspects to have a special place amongst all games. This is more than a game, this is the timeline where moments of joy, rage, cries and laughs of all players are stored.
One of the best FPS games I have ever played, and still am playing it!
God, I am bad at Counter Strike...  But still this game is one of the most played games ever, and for a reason. It is simple and just works.  The graphics are no longer anywhere near modern graphics, but that doesnt matter.  
10/10 even though I dont have it /
The original Will never get old  One of the best fps
Still the 5th best games evar and still better than Call Of Doody!
Very good game and the community is huge and is very actI have for a game so old yet so fun.
miss old times at HNS on cs 1.6
learning more spanish everyday 10/10 si si
Best Cure For Impotence
OK !~
I shoot the guns.
its still very good game to play, even with 512mb to 16gb ram 
cannot go wrong with this classic.
Very Good Game 
Well I can Remember standing in line for this game on day 1. it was on a cd and this is well before steam was invented.  you had to install the retail patches yourself back then it was a pain. thank goodness they brought out steam hey. anyway this was my first online game I ever played and I have not stopped since. I still play counter strike to this day 15 years later but im on csgo nowadays. this game lost me my girlfriend so thanks valve haha   overall amazing game 10/10
Nice game !!!!
My very first game on Steam, great game however I do not recommend it anymore as most servers has viruses which redirects you to a russian server and NOBODY WANTS THAT!! &gt  But its a great game and will always be one. ‚ô•
The BEST FPS Game to get addicted with 3
Best game of its time, and recent times.
Nice Voice of Fire in the hole Simulator
Best game of 90z,
got this game free in a gI haveaway.  Hours of fun ahead! 
Miss the old days
im a counter strike fanatic and always will be, this i think is the best in the series it is what created and started the demolition modes in most fps games and fps multiplayer games, there is even a freakin nexon korean mmofps of this i play that alot, this game and game series rules if you do not own it what is wrong with you ?! its part of PC FPS history!!!
Where it all began!
fire in the hole fire in the hole fire in the hole  
FIrst game in inventory!
Its counter strike ffs 
It was fun. I like this. 
The best FPS game there existed on earthrealm!!
I remember playing this game a LOT 10+ yrs ago and it is still being played today, not as much as the current CS GO and not as much as back then, but it has stood the test of time none the less.
this is the best FPS first person shooter around, it might be an old one but still has extreme amount of players and servers online, it is this most real life shooter i have evry played and i recommend it for any FPS or first person shooters out there. HAPPY GAMING EVERYONE
the best!!
My childhoods game .
4 years .. one game _
nice game relatI have good graphics
Forever Popular ^^
Boom Headshot, the best game ever
Waste of Time
This game is very fun! its just G[old]
Very fun. but make sure you got opengl or youre out of luck!
March, 1998... Two iconic games released.. FOR SOME REASON THIS ONE IS STILL FUN... O.O
actually this was a good game back in 2011 i played this a lot and i love this
BEST GAME EVER MADE !
Convince yourself how much fun youre having through all of the frustration.  Be thankful that there are way better hitboxes here than in CS GO, and less latency issues.  Join a random server thats modded to play...football?!...and play for 2 hours doing nothing but chasing and pouncing other players because you have no idea how to play the mod.   Classic CS.
The Start Of it All...
pretty awesome 
Better graphics than Witcher 3
No words to review to years i play this game tells everything about it. If wasnt worth it, for sure i wouldnt have played it for so long.
My childhood is here  ALL of it 3
Still the best counter strike game !
Classic game I still enjoy It
BOOM HEADSHOT!
Counter Strike one of the best series of games.This is the best part of the series.This isnt the game which has high graphics or is realistic but to be honest it is very addicting.  No negatI have reviews about the game...Just amazing.  Recommended.
One word for CS Its Awsome
i think this game is one of the best games what ever coded in the written history
Old school lovely game
its awesome game
This game is very old,but it is still one of the most enjoyable and played games.I read in a comment that,for gamers,the graphics arent important,but the gameplay is.When we talk about CounterStrike 1.6,it is very true.
The best Counter Strike Version ever created!
Simply, the best game ever.
Polecam fr2ps.
  I have played this game for about 4 years now and it never gets old, its the greatest online multiplayer ever in my opinion. This game is absolutely addicting and more original than anything I have ever played. Hell even the user created game modes and maps are great. The maps cs_assault and de_dust 1 and 2 are classics. Every video game developer should look to CounterStrike as an example when making a multiplayer. The game has so much variety, it can be ridiculously difficult it just depends on who youre playing with..
Oldschool is still cool 3
Its an incredible game, best first person shooter game ever. You have all the action you need everywhere, and you can have fun playing it with your friends. Try it!
If you think that de_dust2 is boring you can play its lego version on pokemon diablo2 warcraft mod bunnyhopping shooting green beams and lightning bolts at zombie chickens. Easy modding.
Best game ever made 4 sure addicted
15 shiting years son.
Best Game for all Time!!!
this is the best PC game that was ever made.
I love this game!!! Buy it!
good ol classic 1.6 fun 
Best game of the first decade of the 21st century, and, along with its sequal, global Offensive have, best team based tactical shooter there is. 10/10.
one of the most amazing action games of this generation... we hope that the game is played even by the next generation D
very strong game D 4ever cs 1.6 !!!!!!!!!!!!
I liked this game once. It looks like minecraft o.o
CS deep on our hearts since 1999! ‚ô• Is not outdated at all, is the same exgirlfriend that wants to suck the life out of your being.  I also recommend CS GO over Source  http//store.steampowered.com/app/730/  Spread the love! 
Simply the best first person shooter of all time.
Hands down best FPS game ever. #nesc #1447 #ureshii
Were it all started, Great game no more no less nuff said
what else i can say .............. its the best fps game i ever play specially with friends and groups it have the connection type with players
You proboly have not heard about counter strike, its far from main stream.
Really? Do I really need to comment this?
Once upon a time...
Still the best CS ever made!
this game is awsome luv it luv it luv it
the only game I play lol
‚ô•‚ô•
Who likes getting rekt at video games?  This is the game for you D
Obvious clone of CSGO
Want to enjoy a FPS but dont want to spend 14.99 on CSGO or Call of Duty? This is a great game for the price, Pretty much the same as CSGO but not as good graphics. Lots of people still play this so it is still fun. 10/10
One cannot call themselves a true CounterStrike fan without playing this at least once.  10/10 I recommend it to anyone who loves the later CounterStrike games.
Its good.
Hi, I do not know why I recently went on CS 1.6 and gave me VAC banned from secure server when I connected to a server, what happened?
Legend game&gtlove this
Awesome Game I Ever Played! 3 CounterStrike Is life * !
Never before has a multiplayer game blended all the elements of true competitiveon and sweatsoakedshirt anxiety as well a CounterStrike CS. You probably already know CS as one of the most popular modifications for HalfLife. Its been available for download for over a year, at least in beta form. But unless youve got a super fast Internet connection at your house, you may not have played it yet as the nearly 100 megabyte download may be daunting for those of you not fortunate enough to have a highspeed connection. Thankfully CS has turned into a fullblown retail game and, while the two versions of CS are identical, it certainly worth shelling out $30 for this stellar title...plus you get a few more multiplayer goodies in the retail package to boot.   Let me start off by saying that the CounterStrike pack is a standalone product. You dont need the original HalfLife to play this game. In the retail package you get a full version of CS as well as Team Fortress Classic, Opposing Force multiplayer, and the Wanted, Redemption and Firearms mods. The entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is CounterStrike.   There is a singleplayer component to CS and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. You basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counterterrorists. As a terrorist, youre goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. As a counterterrorist, its your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the illfated hostages. Taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory.   CS is an action lovers dream, with games lasting only four or fI have minutes if that in some cases because, unlike HalfLife, one shot to the head can mean instant death. CS is the perfect mix between fastaction and realistic damage. You cannot just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. Working as a team is a must and, while youre in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast.   Its the teambased tactics that make CS so fun. I cannot stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. If your team is on the defensI have side youll all benefit by creating a cohesI have strategy. If you team is on the Offensive have side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. Im sure youve seen movies or television show demonstrating this Conga Line style of infiltration. Well, thats exactly how your team will have to act. This creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. Itll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the IGN offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with CS.   Visually the game will not disappoint. While the HalfLife engine isnt the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. The environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. As in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you cannot tell who it is then you probably wont be able to hit him with your gun. Now, if youve purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counterterrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar.   As good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. But over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. One feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. This takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your hearts content. Usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. But a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, youre off in no time. The other feature that took some getting used to was the wait and watch feature after you get killed. Once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again  you dont just spawn again and start shooting. This actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alI have and completing your objectI have. But like I mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldnt have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again.   Not surprisingly, the user interface is very HalfLifeesque. Gamers who have played HalfLife or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. Even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. The only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the Update on the server page. Firsttime users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of CS. Not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. But the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate.  Just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negatI have comments about is the sound. Sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was gI haven to the rest of the sound in the game. Some levels have lighting and thunder. When the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. We were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. In most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. The sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. As it stands now, its hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone.  So how long does the magic last? Well weve been playing this game for over a year now and we still cannot get enough of it. Are we tired of it? Hell no! Were still surprised by how fun this game is. This game actually made some of us squeal like little schoolgirls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. On the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. I guess well just have to get them next time!   In a nutshell, if youre looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. CS is fast paced, intense, and satisfyingthis game will not disappoint. This is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of CS is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. If you like to play shooters online, get this pack!
Great game, this is an all time classic for pc gaming, the skill you need in this game is what what makes it great and unique...... but the community these days is not very supportI have of new players, they downright hate them, oh and get ready for constant and annoying crashes.
Great game I have spent way much hours than these 2k on my acc. It brings your memories back!
Best cs so far !
Oldschool is always the best!
it doesnt need mouse if you have laptop touchpad
A great game. I recommend!
I am a CSGO player, but i really enjoyed trying out the roots of the CS franchise!  Many actI have servers and players  And potentialy loads of fun!  Enjoy!
it may be old but it still has great gameplay 
The classic 1.6, love it
The World Best Game Ever Played CounterStrike
Install CS 1.6 now Go back to the glory days when the game wasnt a trading and gambling arena with a shooting mingame attached!
started with cs 1.6 would never forget my good old times
Its better than global Offensive have...thats for sure
Classic 
Legendary game !!!!!!!
The good old classic. CounterStrike 1.6. It is perhaps one of the most important FPS game in history when it comes to competitive have FPS. Using the same recipe today in the newest installment of the CounterStrike series.
The first game that got me into steam in the first place. It is still a good quality game. The classic urban terrorism simulator.
So cool game, Love it
I recomemend CounterStrike 1.6 and my servers if you are from sweden you can get admin from 10 kr  20 kr.
Awesome game! Enjoy Playing!
I was born with this game ! y
HUGE is the difference between this and GO. Hitbox is better than csgo altought still bad, admins can ban/kick hackers, raging russian level is lower.
I recommend this game if u want to know and prove the experience as CounterTerrorist in real situations. With this game, u can improve ur aim for future playable glames D
Played Csgo for 800 hours, decided to play cs 1.6 and gets wallbanged almost every round. Decided to quit cause of hackers. Watches youtube and sees that mostly every map is wallbangable and deletes the game. 11/10 would Wallbanged again.
Fire in the hole simulator 2000

The classic counterstrike 1.6! GI haves alot of memories, not mutch for an awesome game like in the old days! D
One of the first few games that had introduced me to PC gaming and love for firstperson shooters. This game is timeless.
From this a lot started, all counterstrike games P
Old the best game ever

Nice game ]
Best game. Period.
My fav and best game till now D 3
Awesome, best 1st person shooter game ever.. This game proves gfx doesnt matter gameplay does p
This game ruined my life 3
the grandfather, the grandaddy, the big cheese of FPS games, this game in particular paved the way for modern FPS games.  this game created some of the most innovatI have players in FPS games of all time, some of the most fun custom maps ever made by man, the most popular maps made by NIPPER, there was nothing like driving jeeps off a death defying jump over a chasm only to crash and do flips while somone is playing music over the microphone with HLSS.  this was the game of generations, of peoples childhoods, millions of hours spent end on end.  buy this game, play it online, play it at lan parties as much as you can, while you can, its heyday has long passed, and everyone misses it, but there will always be someone wanting to, or actually playing the game.  just make sure you play NIPPERs maps as well.
in my opinion, this is quite simply the best multiplayer fps shooter of alltime
Procrastination Simulator 2014.
If youre on Steam and you havent played, or own this game, just kill yourself.
Best game ever..... so many fun times, great fps, worth way more than it costs! its just great!
Counter strike one of the best multiplayer first person shooters out there even though it came out 14 years ago it still has outstanding graphics a good level design and alright player models  i would recomend this game to anyone with a spirit to play oldschool shooters

This Is the best game in teh world. BUY IT NOW
The best FPS I have ever played. From the original beta versions in 1999 up untill version 1.6 I all love. Some more than others but the basic gameplay is just awesome.  It is highly addictI have and frustration levels can rise to highest possible but the fun of teaming up and achieving the kills / goals is just a rush  Okay, the graphics are not the greatest anymore, but the fact that after all these years I still pick up the game and play it says enough for me.   http//www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FiGwvCZ1X0&ampfeature=related   Check it out! P
Old school game was playing this game when i was a child 
the best fps game ever...everything about this game is awesome. real addictI have.....love this one
CounterStrike is one of the most nostalgiac experiences I have had. With that being said I enjoyed the steam version for my 24 hours playing it. However there is a great bit of lag on most servers in this game although I shouldnt have any. Putting that aside however CounterStrike is still one of the most revolutionary games for its time. The multiplayer may be dying down and I have yet to convert to go which I dont know if I will. If you got this with Half Life you remember getting this with it. This is still the same fun game from that period that has come to be a cult classic. It plays very well and is fun to play with friends. Although I may find Team Fortress 2 more enjoyable from my short time playing that game, I shall still enjoy CounterStrike for what it was.
CounterStrike 1.6 is game best for action.
I just 3 this game !
I want that badge
Best for the Best!!
I can have 14 years old, 30 years old, have even 90 years old, and it wont get bored play Counter  Strike, the best part, that every PC can run CS, and it is pretty good, even with the time that got created, i love CS, you basiclly, can play everything, CTF, Normal, Warzone, etc.  I highly recommend to buy Counter Strike.
Do you ever feel that nostalgic feeling when you played the game and you remembered how it felt the first time you played it?
1.6 4 life.
iTS rEallY a fAntastic gAmE to PLay
Best game ever, the graphics may not be the best, BUT WHO CARES, I still love it as hell!
thumbs up !!
Best FPS game of all the time,the one that started it all aswell with the competitive have scene.
I have been playing this game since 45 years now... not bored even now... the mods present in the game . the different models that can be downloaded.. its competitive haveness... make it a game worth buying eve now after this many years of its release... WARNING.. dont buy thios game u wont see sunlight again.. p 
Fun and stuff
i cannot play because this shit The game waas actI haved with a product code that is vailid only in a specifig geographic region. since you are not currently in that region, counter strike is not avaible to play     pls help meeee i already was disable beta updates but nothing 
The one and only. Back when games had simple mechanics and very little nonsense. Remember when a bullet would go where you actually fired it? Remember when recoil patterns were easy to understand? Remember when it was possible to take a game seriously and become ridiculously good at it?  The CounterStrike franchise is very much like Super Smash Bros  they had Brawl, we had CSSource and CSGO. Lets hope VALVe decides to play a proper homage to this game in the future much like Nintendo did with the New Smash Bros.
It is one of the best FPS game available online. Even today its craze has not ended. From a NaVi player i heard that steam version provides very low lag due to which i purchased the game and for sure i was 100percent satisfied. You would not believe my ping dropped to 19~21 from 200~1500.
Is a good game....I love him !
great game 100/10
what can u say it is osm 3
The strippeddown FPS that delI havers raw competitiveon and insane replayability.  My childhood wouldnt be the same without this game. Too bad im old now. I should have kept up.
Even though it came out over 10 years ago it is still a great game to play and the servers are filled with lots of players and the community lI haves on. I would recomend this game to anyone.
What a GAME!!
Classic 1.6, the true Counter Strike.
Its a to class game.
Classic cs nothing like it. a must have for gaming collectors
Really reccomended game!
BEST steam game, EVER!
1 of the bestest game to be played !
Still the most epic game ever created. Yes CSGO is great, and is a definite CS revI haver, BUT, 1.6 will forever be the game that ruined our lI haves!  Commited thousands of hours to 1.6, 1.5 and all previous iterations. Started way way back when it was still a mod for HL1. Growing up and watching the game grow and turn into what it has become has been a truly great experience.  This game is still alI have, and you can still have hundreds of hours of fun on it, so gI have it a go 
this is 50x better than csgo lolz
Its aight, not the best tbh.
Always ready to play some old CS 1.6! P
AWP simulator 1999.  10/10 would AWP again
Better than csgo, 10/10 would buy again
Funnest game ever, still has competitive PUG servers. Lots of fun. =
tis is real classic
i love this game this game is awesome!
Nice game !!!!!!!!!!
CounterStrike set the foundation for online competitive have teamplay FPS. And its still a viable game over 10 years later.
One of the best CounterStrike games in my opinion. Dying out, but still worth playing.
Where it all began.
remembers me good times 
more then 5 years play this game
This game is 10/10
Still the GOAT!

This game are best VERY BESTs !!!! 2001. Oh yeah, 1992 1.5 3  Like GAME 3 !!!
Even after 14 years this game is still going strong and is full of hackers I rate 8/8
This game is byfar one of the best fps game I have ever played! I remember when I used to play this on the original xbox and had so much fun playing it. I was really sad when my controller broke and I couldnt play it anymore but soon after that I got the xbox 360 and started to play COD and GTA. Then, I started playing on PC and all I played was Minecraft until I downloaded steam and I found Counter Strike. I had no idea it would come with CSCZ so I decided to play it and it was more fun than CS. I enjoy to play this game and Im sure that I will continue to love this game!
It was fun for the little that I played it, is this game actI have anymore?
Boom Headshot 5
Play the original that started it all. complete with no skin no crates no keys and a whole lot of nostalgia!
Best shooting game ever made. Period
Still nice after all these years. Just need to get all those annoying cheating kids off your back
I grew up playing this game and Im still playing it. This game will never die.   Things i like about this game.
nice, whateva!
ah, the beauty of old gaming remains. this game is more than just alI have and kicking, even though its old by now. its a nice game which focus more on skill and reflexes than cute graphics and advanced functions. if you like fastpaced shooter youll probably like this one too.  theres lots of mods, addons and maps out there... since this is an older game which allow people to create their own through 3rdparty software. in my opinion, that alone make this game awesome.
classic game that will not die
Classic game. Its great. What more can I say? 9/10. Everyone should own this.
the good old days
This is Realy Amazing CS
Old times   Best game ‚ô•
I will miss...
This game is absolutely amazing!  Even though the graphics are not one of the best but still the game gained popularity. If you will know how to play counterstrike it will be easy for you to play other games. And there is no game like Counterstrike  in my opinion that will gI have you pleasure when you are doing 5 kills and all are headshots And Im 100 percent sure that this game is a LEGEND!!!

Piece of Art
This is the game that got me into CS and furthered my career in this game lovd it from the start and enjoying every minute of it! If your on CSS come and join me on the Australian DTK  Dying To Kill Servers, i am an admin on De_dust 2 deathmatch! looking forward to kicking some fuck with you! mwhahah
cuz its cool 
Best of classic!
Dont have words for that game.. best childhood memories there 
Old game, but its class
This Game is old, but Gold. A great example of FPS game. Really it is. Especially When you bring your Friends into this Game. *Recommended*
Well... isnt it a classic? CS should not require a review. You should get it, whether its 1.6, CSS or CSGO.
Awsome game!
Good enough for FUN. BEsides that try Global Offensive have.
In my opinion, should be like ¬£2.99 not ¬£6.99, and there is no achievments
Still one of the better FPSgames!
Though the tournaments may be over for this game, its still crazy fun to play... its really hard to explain it but youll know that this here is own of the greatests FPS games of all time. 
Play to Counter Strike 5x5
maybe the graphics are not the best, BUT this is a great game!  
[_]
No I dont recommend this game, I just bored when I wrote this recommandation.
Get a gun and do headshots. Sounds easy dosint it?
The game is great, if you can find a server that isnt Dust_2 where everyone rushes long A.
When I was 17 years old, I escaped 34 days from school to play this with my friends and I didnt pass in school that year .  Now its 11 years later and I still consider that year the best in my life .  11/10 would escape from school again .    
Even if this game is old, its pretty amazing and fun. Some mods kinda suck, but classic remains the best.
Yes I very recomand this game !!!!!!
Still a good game.
a legendary game
shits mad whack awesome
Classic. Nuff said.
People only still play this because they have bad computers are just jealous and claim 1.6 is better than source. But on the topic, this game is what started it all. If it was never created, there wouldnt be CounterStrikeSource.
Best classic shooter to date.
This is the best game of all the CS games. The only downside is that it is an outdated game, and its not really worth getting into it now. If youre barely getting into CounterStrike, then just go for Global Offensive have, its the better choice for the new players.
Addticted and best fast game i ever played 
Old school game. This game change the wolrd.
Old Game But Still The Best and Favourite fps Shooting Games to All The Gamers 
Greatest Game Created
its like sex for the first time
A classic multiplayer FPS with many different servers for gamemodes, such as Casual hostage and defuse, Deathmatch, and more. The community still lI haves after 10 years because it is such a great game.
Counter Strike is an first person shooter that was released in the late 90s.  Whats it about?  Well Counter strike is an online first person shooter where you either play as an terrorist or an counter terrorist.  The terrorists objectI have is to transport a bomb to a bombsite located on each map marked as A or B. Whilst the counter terrorists main objectI have is to stop the terrorist force from planting the bomb.  Theres also a gamemode where the terrorists will have hostages and the counter terrorists objectI have is to rescue the hostages before the time runs out.  Game ends when the counter terrorists has saved all hostages or the terrorists has whiped all counter terrorists.   Is it worth buying?  Since this is an really old game and the graphics are really outdated compared to the games we have today i would still say this game is worth buying.  The game is over 15 years old but still has a alot of actI have players and playing with friends make it even better.  Counter Strike also has alot of maps, mods and other stuff that makes the game better in any way.  Graphics. 7/10 Sound. 8/10 Gameplay. 10/10  This review is based on my own opinion and noone elses!
shit‚ô• POLECAM BARDZO WAM TO. SUPER SIE SZCZYLO W TE TERORYSTY.
Very cool game, me liked 
I just bought a Macbook Air and for some reason when u get into a game the mouse goes funky on me and wont let me move around properly. its not the mouse either because it works fine until Im in a game and it does the same thing with the touch pad on my mac... any suggestions?
game of all time.Old woman cs 1.6
really nice and smooth game
Counterstrike is like a fine wine. It gets better with age. That is to say, the more time goes on, the higher quality players remain, resulting in a great game today.
No work, No food.

BestGameInHisotry #FPS
gg...but i cannot play paintballl because of some errors 
Lets face it, this was better than CZ.
This game is P E R F E C T
This game is just as good as it was 10 years ago. Its the Tetris of FPS. You will still find tons of people to play with half of them annoying kids, just like 10 years ago and find yourself neglecting your modern games...
‚òÖCS 1.6 ‚òÖ
The best one !
A old but gold game  From 1.6 it was the beggining,dont forget , a LEGEND game , and I still enjoy this when I play
Pro    very fun and competitive have game   works well on every platform linux included  Cons   None  Now buy it !!!
simply i kike this game too much !  i m not a good gamer but soon i would be a good gamer of cs 1.6 
how could one not like this
Best online shooter in the world of all times
A very nice game! I play this game every day!!
yep its the original countre strike, be a terrorist or a counter terrorist and shoot points to score, beautiful smooth gameplay, much better than that crappy source engine updates, come up with a good spraypaint logo to reach the bonnus round, i like the surf levels as well, valve when will you finally listen to the community and make surfing an actual game mode? it is a very respectful game for its age and i gI have it a good score in the end.
Cool. But Wanna see source in this pack 3 PLease
one of my all time favorite games... this is a classic. i will never forget the fast paced action this game encompasses due to my youth. i played countless hours of this and loved every second of it.
Nice   and i have a cfg no alias just perfect   
CounterStrike is everything forever = Play with your friends,win,and have fun!
B17B4367...,.,.,.,...., 4 Terrorists / 3 CounterTerrorists

No words can describe this amazing game.....
An awesome game takes me back to the good old days !!
A classic dorm room shooter, it may have been topped by games with better graphics and options, but the core CounterStrike formula is still unmatched for a pick up and play simplicity.
My FAV game *

counterstrike is one of the best first person shooter games that came out and is still going strong after all these years
shiting high game
Thats the best gamer ever and over 10 years the 1!
I have played it off and on for the past 8 years of my life. It is a true classic game. And it is still alI have!! The multiplayer community is alI have and thriving! You wont have to deal with annoying Russians depending on if you actually pick a Russian server... or 8 year old FPS kids. Pick this game up if you love classic, FPS action with an amazing community.

This Is Very Good Game.
1.6 shit 
The most amazing game i have ever played in my life. WORTH PLAYING!
blah blah good game blah, this isnt where i parked my car?
This is the best game I have seen 
one of a kind
This game is da shiznic! epic graphic and awesome gameplay,
This game may seem stupid to some people, becasue of the graphis. This game is exactly like CSGO and the only difference is the graphics. Otherwise, everything is the same thing excluding camos.
Play it,because it ain anything better!
Well, this game is kinda old school, but still gold, like this, im playing it like from 2009, but im still likeing it.
twas teh game
This game doesnt need a review.
THE game.
Good and fun game!
still the best fps there¬¥s ever been
Only game to play, end of story.
One of the first FPS games I played and still do for fun. I have allot of memories with the game, made allot of friends and lost allot of friends. But in the end it was all worth it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Not very many players online, but still a fun game. I play this when I get bored of CSGO.  My only gripe is that somehow malicious servers can override your controls. For example, a server overwrote my keybind configuation so that every time I pressed w, it would connect to their server.
deathmach
Nice game, mann awesome game mode 
When I was a kid I grew up as a console player playing ps2 and xbox, never having the chance to play the original Counter Strike. A few months ago I bought CSGO and I now have well over 200 hours. I decided to buy the original so I could see what it was like before csgo, although I could hardly find a server and I have hardly played it I really enjoy it.
the orignial that started it all nuff said
Pretty Nice Game ^^
Very old fps shooter still at the top charts! SmaLler file that steam
Great game, but doesnt let me open it 90percent of the time
Back in past D
The good one, without screaming scrubs like in CSGO
This game is immortal! She will never forget.
This game is AMAZZIINGG D
Now i can spray in a lower res
???
Buy It.
A really good competitive have fps, CSGO is more recent so it has a bigger playerbase if you are looking for the game everyone plays.  PSBeware of the russians PPSCyk4 shit‚ô•
+++++++++
This game is very addictI have and fun if you are looking for a realy good old game this one is for you
The reason why counterstrike got that big in my eyes.  1.6 still have a space in my heart.   10/10!
I recommend this old but still one of the best FPS Shooter ever made... CounterStrike 1.6 is still played by Professional Teams like SK Gaming, Fnatic, Lunatic Hai, mTw, NaVi and more... If you like Fun &amp Action, CounterStrike is the right game for you...
After all this time? Always..
So many good memories with this game. A LAN party classic. Im old... get off my lawn
*kggghh* Fire in the hole!! *kggghh*
its a great game but flaws pros graphics,gameplay,guns,servers,people still play conslag,most servers are in other countries i lI have in the us, but if you are a fan of fps go back to the classics 8/10 
used to be great but waaaaayyyy too many cheaters now...............unfortunately
COOL GAME AND NICE GRAPICS 
Classic FPS that started steam.
CS 1.6. n0thing but headshots.
This goes without saying, if you care about anything in the past two decades PC gaming related, youre going to play CS.
Rate  10/10 Actually i am a lover of CS. I mean ALL cs editions.
Its a classic. 
This is a classic game and has been great for years!
Aaah, keep spending so much money on this game hahaha, love it though
Its a pretty good game.
Clasic. Have been playing since i was 8 years old and will continue.
This game is a wonderful coop and multiplayer game  Yhe best game that was played of most players in 2000  2007
Counter Strike is undoubtable one of the greatest first person shooters of all time. while good servers may be harder to find nowadays, it still remains great.
You shoot people and they shoot back
I still pop in to play every now and then and I feel like a young kid again.
simply the best ever
One of my all time favourite games! You never get bored playing this. You may not find its graphics to be very cool as per todays standard but, old is gold!
Very good game, lots of fun! 9/10
Nice and n1
Only one word..INSANE!
The Game Number One on Line!!! excelent game despite having many years continue being  the best game of accion and estrategy.
For those new players that bought this game with a bundle of CSGO. All I have to say that this game was a mod of the original Valve IP Half life. So everything from that game was brought over. Just play this game with a grain of salt if you are used to actually good hit detection and decent graphics
