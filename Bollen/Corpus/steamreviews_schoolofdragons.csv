"25204,School of Dragons,2016.0,""This is a good game because if you like the HTTYD movies and tv shows and all that stuff, then you should play it, like the new update for RTTE season 3, it has new dragons and places, even old places!!!!!!!! ITS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"",1"
"25205,School of Dragons,2018.0,""Its a good game. Fun child-safe game that all ages can enjoy. But really if you want to look nice i.e have good dragons, cool home stuff you could either wait like 3 years of savings or just pay. Still a really good 3D kids game like Club Penguin."",1"
"25206,School of Dragons,2018.0,""The game can be improved in beautiful graphics. There is a lot of support for the Turks who play the game, but there is no support for the Turkish language if you add it would be easier for us to understand tasks, although we will enjoy more!"",1"
25207,School of Dragons,2015.0,i think this is the best game everpros: -i jumped of a cliff and lived-i can finally fly on my dragon!-i named my viking EMOSEEMOE!-friendly community-everything is censored in chat!-did i mention that you cant die!!!-its on ios!-everything is good about this game!!-its free!!!!!-its educational!-the only quests are fetch quests!-addicting mini games!!!!!-it ruined my life!-and many more!cons-the only bad thing about this game is i cant rate it higher then 10!i personally give this game a 2 for 2perfect!!!!!it deserves every 10 out there and it is a match for modern MMOs today!school of dragons is the best game i have ever played.....      #SoDlife4ever!,1
"25208,School of Dragons,2017.0,""School of Dragons is a good game but the bad side of everything is that everything is so expensive for example the dragon eggs they cost about 300 diamonds or more for the cool dragons.While the normal dragons that everyone has like the Deadly Nadder,Monsterous Nightmare and the Gronicle are in money (not real money game money).You also have to get membership for better things like toothless/alpha toothless.But above all i recommend this game :)"",1"
"25209,School of Dragons,2017.0,""I really love this game. I've been playing it since 2014, on many accounts. With some improvements in graphics, pshyics,and other stuff, it would be the best game ever!Btw i have one dragon that i can't hatch, because i don't have space in it. If you can tell me how to get gems, i would be happy! :)"",1"
"25210,School of Dragons,2015.0,""School Of Dragons is possibly one of the worst MMORPG's to date, remove this garbage off of Steam.It's all """"Pay for this"""" and """"Pay for that"""" and the graphics make me want to shove spoons down my eye sockets."",0"
25211,School of Dragons,2016.0,Honestly the only reason i recommend this game is becaus it is fun... sort ofI enjoy this game but it could be a whole lot better.Pros:Lots of friendly playersLots of questsLots of dragonsCons: Horrible graphics (i know its a kids game but its pretty bad)LaggyCrashes ,1

"25213,School of Dragons,2018.0,""This is my favourite game to play. I have been playing it a couple of years now, off steam on PC and on my ipad. Its very addictive. However you do need to spend money to unlock a lot of the game."",1"
25214,School of Dragons,2015.0,This game is amazing i love the How To Trian Your Dragon movies and shows and this is just the kinda game is was looking for even though i wish they had put more quest to get dragon eggs in the game i still love it and enjoy flying and playing games with my friends on our very own dragons.,1

"25217,School of Dragons,2016.0,""Utter crap. Recycled nonsense. Controls are awful, characters are unoriginal, no plot and my kids feel that their intellect and skill are insulted by the consideration that this is a kid's game. The music sucks too.  Graphics are crap, character creation offers no decent options, but hey, you can pick just about any colour in the spectrum...but...in the case of selecting a dragon, you may choose a colour, but it'll look nothing like the preview.  Early access or not, it's not even worth wasting the bandwidth or hard drive space. Early Access only works if there's a decent groundwork to build off of.  The only thing that would save this game would be a complete rewrite and recode and retexture.0/10"",0"
25218,School of Dragons,2015.0,This game is so good. It had so much cuztomization when making a character.Making my Characters name was super easy as you could definitly use numbers and symbols and spaces. My character is completely unique. It definitely did not take 23 minutes to start the game. The controls are also very smooth. The graphics are unreal. I felt like i actually met Hiccup.10/10. You have not lived until you bought this game.,1
"25219,School of Dragons,2015.0,""The game's concept is amazing for kids and adults who are fans of the HTTYD movies. However, strip that fact away and you're left with a game that is buggy beyond enjoyability and is very limited in the free to play model. Multiple quests are bugged and unable to be completed, the game crashes to the desktop, features are bugged and force you to reload the game to be able to resume play.  My daughter enjoys flying on her dragon, but outside of that I am extremely disappointed."",0"
"25220,School of Dragons,2014.0,""After checking the dreadful reviews I couldnt keep my masochistic self away from it, and jumped into this journey that was meant to enlighten my thoughts of the saga, and i gotta say I got stuck on account registration,where i tried to figure out my age, 2 was fair enough. Then in an attempt to ride Toothless, my character appeared on its back on an empty sky while phasing through him, dropping onto a seemingly endless void, reaching water, and starting to swim at the speed of a submarine with the periscope on the surface.You aint understanding nothing unless youre a kid or high as hell on dragon nip, would play again 11/10."",1"
"25221,School of Dragons,2017.0,""its a mobile game mmo, its alright IF you like mobile games, but i cant stand the big buttons and all the members only rubbish. if you wanna plat single player that is an option. it will run on your machine. dont have graphics options which is awful. i dont recomend because its not a mobile mmo, neither is it a  pc game. although its one of the better f2p(p2p) mobile games."",0"
"25222,School of Dragons,2016.0,""This game doesn't work well. I tried to run it on the client version of the game and on the Steam version of the game, I cannot zoom out at all. Whenever I try to zoom out, it just keeps zooming in automatically. The animations are choppy, I couldn't see some NPCs, the loading times are like 1-2 minutes each and all that while I have a gaming PC.I got disconnected from the server 4 times while installing the game and I had to restart my game twice in order to get into the game.Don't really understand what's wrong with this game, but whatever.Not only that, but you have to pay with premium currency to delete your character... There's microtransactions + membershipÂ options in the game. I would just avoid it."",0"

25227,School of Dragons,2018.0,This game is the cancer of cancer of games problem 1:worst grafics ever 2:you get bored very easily 3:free to play and its pay to have fun 4:if anyone like this game just kys 5:only KIDS play this game go play arma 3 or csgo just anything but this...

25229,School of Dragons,2017.0,This game barely runs for mac. I have had to shut down and open again 5-1o to just get it to download the play button. It's so stupid! Why get a game that claims to work for mac if it doesnt!,0
25230,School of Dragons,2016.0,its a good game but for kids who play it i dont see them staying due to the heavy pay to win feeling in order to get a better dragon then the starting ones without paying to be a vip you could do this right ifyou made it so titan class was a vip thing but made titan just faster not like oh you need to buy this to be cool but if that ever happend with alot of things made cheaper without the pay to win maybe even make it so you have to buy the game for like 2 or 5 bucks you would have alot more players then again world of warcraft if doing this and well it still alive right,1
"25231,School of Dragons,2017.0,""The best game in existence! most exhilirating gameplay you will ever experience, real life pales in comparison to this game. The singleplayer offline campaign has the best story ever. The graphics are amazing, way aheadof its time. And i love how you can eventually unlock time travel and this opens up whole new possibilities forsolving puzzles. And the weapon customisation is so in depth that youcan even decide what band of screw is used and what metal is used for production.And the moment when you get to ride an alpha is amazing.

"25233,School of Dragons,2015.0,""I don't understand the people who are putting negative reviews on things they haven't even played for a few hours. This game is amazing. Some people think it is bad because it is supposed to be """"free"""" but you have to pay. What they don't understand is an amazing game like this isn't going to be FREE. No good game is ever going to be FREE in the world unless you are a hacker of some sort and don't respect the effort put into games. This game is nice, it has a lot to do. I am a big fan of the movies and games. I really enjoy this game, I haven't played it as much as I used to though."",1"
"25234,School of Dragons,2016.0,""School of Dragons is free to play browser game based on the movie.  It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok, maybe edutainment also.  Cons: Very loongg loading screens,  Keyboard controls are fixed in place, and can be Pay to Win.  Might work better using website. Try it if you like the movies and you have children.

"25235,School of Dragons,2014.0,""""""School of Dragons"""" is such a cute game. While there is a bit of negative pointers in my opinion, I do recommend this to those who do not mind  simple gaming. Withing the two hours I been playing """"School of Dragons"""", I realize it's nothing to be overjoyed about however it is a game to waste some time at if your day consists of nothing other than staring at a clock. Graphics: I have seen better graphics in a lot of games, but these are not bad. However, depending on how smooth your computer runs things"
"25236,School of Dragons,2015.0,""probably one of the better games,if you like suffering from the never ending loading screens, you may want to scoop your eyes out with the bones of your dead dragon that you killed due to the fact of not being able to stand the sight of it. so all in all this game should atleast cost a solid 10 dollars.Get it free while you can folks."",1"
"25237,School of Dragons,2014.0,""Despite the reviews by most people, I spent a good 3 hours on the game and hit level 10. Them gameplay is pretty straight forward. Controls extremely simple. If you wan't a complexed game this isn't for you. Its not a bad game whatsoever. Being able to pick your own dragon and bond with it. A ton of mini games. Don't let the comments drag you away from this if you are a big HTTYD fan. Give it a try! I'll be on it a lot more after my experience."",1"
25238,School of Dragons,2015.0,This is best game 2015 I don't know why these people hate on it. they are just jealous they are not rich like me and have all the op dragons.

"25239,School of Dragons,2015.0,""Brilliant game, so good that you can fly a dragon! Only after ourchasing 999 gems which will ONLY cost you about Â£29.99 so not only is it cheap its kid-friendly!Put yourself in this position, your kid wants to play School of Dragons you load it up and let him play it, 10 minutes later it has crashed, oh no! But luckily it's a in game times which was purposely built. The flying is so slow as so kids dont get too hyper. Did I mention the fact that words like die are blocked in the chat? Want a friendly place for your kid!"",1"
"25240,School of Dragons,2015.0,""[Dead Honest Review]So I think I've enough time in this game to thoroughly review this game. Let me start off with the ProsPros-------+Amazing graphics (MUCH better than the Witcher 3, just in case you need a comparison)+Story rich!+The quests are VERY well done, and are NEVER the same, not even the side quests!+Voice acting is amazing, literally THE best +Character design is spot-on+Massive open world game, FILLED with amazing quests, characters and other players!+Dragons!+Amazing character creation!Now on to the cons...Cons--------The graphics are sort of demanding, I can sometimes run it at like 30 fpsThis is seriously the best game I've ever played, seriously blowing games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt completely out of the playing field. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!In all seriousness, why is this on steam, isn't this a freaking mobile phone game or something? "",0"
"25241,School of Dragons,2016.0,""This critically acclaimed game is the sequel to the New York best seller """"Minecraft"""" this game has RPG elements that are reminiscent to games like RuneScape, Club Penguin, And Shower With Your Dad Simulator: Do You Still Shower With You Dad, It's graphics are hitting to an older generation with some graphical nods to Pong and Call Of Duty: Ghosts, This game is easy to get into with a great tutorial, and fun and accepting community you'll be sure to make new steam friends fast, and the developers are constantly helping with bug fixes and great new DLC, there are 4 dragons to choose from, each with their own unique play style.1. The BruiserDon't let this dragon's appearance fool you, this dragon loves a greatâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥and will easily become your best friend, he can take approximately 3 hits before fainting, it's damage is high but can only shoot one fire ball every 30 minutes.It's customization consists of new eyes, the colour of it's ear wax, and the shape of it's nostrils.Overall Choose this class if you're into a quick, stealthy class, much like Dr.Egg Man from sonic and Mario in the Olympic games2.The HealerThis Dragon can only move if something needs healing, so prepare to bring your razor, because you'll be needing to cut yourself to lead this dragon, unlike it's name it actually has no healing capabilities, it can breath air and can move at the speed of a young child, He likes long walks on the beach, romantic movies, and dogs.You can buy paint as DLC and colour it's nails, this adds +20 Agility, and +10 Fletching3.The WizardThis Unique Dragon has the ability to bend the space time continuum and change reality as we know it, this power is somewhat under powered, as this would still take 5 hits to kill a simple protector of time, the AOE of this attack is high, but it's damage is slow, only 12,000 HP per hit, this is nothing compared to the Gnome Child's DEF of 154.NothingIf you're going for a bloodborne game-play style, this dragon is for you, it's completely invisible, because nothing's there It has no attack, and no defense, when playing this game mode, be sure not to die, because it's one life and you're dead, the developers even added a special bonus that if you die in the game, you die in real life, it's so realistic that it actually feels if you're getting a knife stuck in you. There's no customization, because there's no dragon.Overall this game appeals to every audience, and it's asking price of nothing is still way too much, it's DLC is worth it though.A Proper 9/10 Could have used more dragon yiffing"",1"
25242,School of Dragons,2017.0,HI GUYS! i give this game a 5 star!its great game just laggy some times and it has so many dragons to choose from! although once you get toothless once your membership runs out i wish you could still ride him. lots of good updates!,1

"25244,School of Dragons,2015.0,""Ugh, I am so not really pleased why you all are commenting and reviewing this if you are totally NOT a young child or a parent that has a child. Apprently you all are teenagers or adults, so why are you even wanting to be perverts and try to be sexual over kids? Whatever you are doing as teenagers or adults in this game, I don't like it. And it doesn't give you the right to review if you AREN'T even a young child or adult that looks for kid games for your child! This is a game where young children play with their favorite dreamworks characters, and will enjoy it. Everything is okay with it when you have a GOOD, WORKING COMPUTER. Both the application and the personal computer version of the game is fine. It's just the older people like teenagers and adults that grown out of kids games like these that are giving this game a FALSE BAD NAME!I recommend this game for young children and for people who just want non violent gaming or have their child learn bad habits from older aged games."",1"

"25251,School of Dragons,2014.0,""Believe it or not, I've actually been enjoying this game.NOW HEAR ME OUT!Maybe it's because I love the HTTYD franchise, maybe it's because I love having my own dragon to raise, maybe it's because puberty treated Hiccup well. However, I found the game to be colourful and frankly a breath of fresh air. The graphics are outdated and similar to PS2 graphics, it's glitchy, and I've lost my dragon several times just walking around. However, this game had many more glitches before I started playing it apparently, considering I was able to input my appropriate age and I only crashed once. What we must keep in mind is this game just came out yesterday. Understandably, who would want to put a glitchy, unfinished product on the market? *cough* Ubisoft *cough* But that's the beauty of MMO's, although sometimes glitchy at first, they develop and grow over time with the right support. I think this game has a lot of potential and I'm willing to stick around for it. The cutscenes are nothing to ogle at and they play scenes from the movies for some of the quests I've done so far. Call me blinded by nostalgia, but throwing movie scenes into a computer game takes me back to the old Disney PC games. Of course, it shows laziness on development's part by not creating these cutscenes themselves, but I can still appreciate putting scenes in from the movie. tl"

"25257,School of Dragons,2014.0,""To be honest, I am quite surprise that How to train your Dragon is recieving so much love! Dreamworks is releasing a new TV Series, plus later movies. I am a Jumpstart Veteran. I have been with Jumpstart Games since Adventure Land was released, and I have to say the virtual worlds are getting better. Would love to see more updates on their other virtual worlds like EatMyDust and SuperSecret.Sadly, I must warn you. The game does has it's bugs, gliches, and downsets. For example, in Fireball Frenzy, your dragon's body is covering some of the bottom targets. There has been known to be hackers for the game, which does make it unfair, and can be annoying when you see a 20 foot-tall Whispering Death. Also, if you are planning on getting the """"Age-Up"""" option for your dragon, it won't level your dragon up"
"25258,School of Dragons,2014.0,""I highly recommend this game for any fan of the HTTYD franchise. While the graphics look like a PS2 game, it's fun, with plenty of customizations for you or your dragon. Most of the complaints are the age, that you can only go from 1 to 5. NOT TRUE. You can scroll down, and pick your age right there. If you're mouse doesn't scroll, on the right there's a scroller that you can use.

I used to play it all the time but since I've redownloaded (On steam, used to play on iOS) the quest arrow won't work and the new quests seem a bit incomplete and don't really work properly, nor are they that fun. The flying is also kinda glitchy and there are quite a few glitches. Controls are also sloppy and the graphics are baaaaad. If you want the full experience you also need to pay for a subscription so it's kind of pay to win however I just invited a ton of """"friends"""" using yopmails back a few years ago. Not sure if you can do that now... very time consuming though.I'm recommending this game to play as I spent hundreds of hours on this back when I was younger and I don't really have the heart to critisise it. I used to love it and I'm sure it's still incredibly fun for a younger audience. Kinda like star stable I suppose. It's actually less pay to win than that.

"25265,School of Dragons,2016.0,""395249 brain cells died playing this game. I hate it.Here's why:Saturday, April 2th 2016I was looking for some Steam games, and i found this. I loved How to Train your Dragon 1 and 2, and even the Netflix mini-series. I thought it would be a decent game, after seeing the good reviews, (I only see the bad reviews after getting the game, for some reason) and, after all, its only $0.00 (+ over $100.00 in in-game content).The first thing you notice when you turn on the game is that you made some pretty bad life choices. The second thing you notice is that you are already praying for God to have mercy on your soul. The third thing you is  When you get to play the game, you need to make an account, or you get named """"VIKING18346718"""" so i made an account, and i chose the name """"Pingas"""". And it said it had symbols. Really? Ok. I can live with that. Named my character """"ButterGamer"""" in homenage for PBG. The game wouldn't let me name it that way cuz' it had the word """"Butt"""" in it.Finnaly got to the game aaaaaand... wasted 1 minute and 5.12 seconds waiting for the game to load. Aaaaaaaaand... Wasted another minute cuz the game was downloading stuff. Aaaaaaaand FINALY got to play the game. What i saw was atrocious. The quality of the graphics were terrible. I mean... this game was made in 2014 and even still, it looks like the graphics were made by an 11 year old learning how to make a game, or this game was made with the same program the GameCube games were made.The genious that made this game decided not to give any collision detection to some of the NPC characters (and sometimes, you fall under the floor).After that, i justâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥off and uninstalled it.

"25275,School of Dragons,2015.0,""School of Dragons, at first, seemed like a promising game. And being a fan of  MMORPG games and the how to train your dragon franchise made this particular game stand out to me personally. However, it could be so much better. On a whole it is NOT a BAD GAME. It really needs a good few changes.Once a character is created, it cant be deleated without having a certain amount of gems. And gems, from what i can see, cost ACTUAL money. This also goes back to the character creation. Its lazy, sloppily put together and it lacks the actual CREATE YOUR OWN CHARACTER element. Your character is either Hiccup or Astrid, with different sleeves, shoes, and hair. The loading times are decent, but theres too many loading screens. You can pass into one area after seing a loading screen, then within seconds be taken to another. almost everything costs gems, meaning if you want more of a personalised character, you need to feed the developers money. Dragons cost money, as do masks, shoes, food. All the basic things require money. Fair enough, the developers need money so they can continue to keep up the servers, update the game (this game needs some serious updates honestly) but that doesnt mean they should make EVERYTHING cost actual money.Character animations could be a little bit better, as could the dragons. Their flying animations are decent, but on the ground it gets a little hectic. Their flying speeds could be faster, or slower depending on the type of dragon. i.e having a night fury faster than a gronckle.""""MMORPG based on DreamWorks Animationâ€™s How to Train Your Dragon franchise. Players raise and train their own dragon, interact with characters from the HTTYD franchise, join clans and embark upon journeys and quests alongside their Viking pals in-game."""" is a promising description, and these things are done within the game. Just not well. updates are needed, patches too. But on a whole this is not the worst game ive played. And with a few changes, it could easily become much better. Im torn between recommending it and not. I recommend it if you are not a big a fan of the franchise than most, as you could possibly be disappointed if you have your heart set on an """"epic httyd experience"""""",1"
"25276,School of Dragons,2016.0,""School of Dragons resembles something of KingsIsle Entertainment's creations"
"25277,School of Dragons,2014.0,""I gave it an honest try, but at the moment it is not mature enough. And with 'mature', I don't mean 'for adults', though that is also the case, in my opinion. Where to start... This 'free to play' constantly notifies you of buyable stuff and uprades. I suspect that you will miss out if you never buy anything in the game, so the 'free to play' is a con.What annoys me too, is that the 'open world' is not that open. When walking outside, I expect to be actually able to walk from A to B, and not having to load new parts of the outside all the time.The first time I played, the game crashed on me.The second time I played, I wasn't able to find a menu with a 'Quit' option, so I finally Alt+F4'd my way out.It's kinda fun to walk around in the world you know from the movies and series, but that's about it. The graphics aren't all that good. The controls are far from intuitive (I play a couple of other open world games with different controls to move around, none of them as bad as this, and it's nothing to do with 'getting used to).The reason I finally gave up, was the profanity filter in the chat. It filters out 'un' (and words starting with it, like unrealistic, uninstall, et cetera), 'mark', 'slap' (I said 'slap on the wrist'), and the single use of '?'. It made me look like a badmouth, while the only thing I actually said that got filtered out, that was the closest to a profanity, was 'dognibbit'. I'm going to install the game, because there are better games to fill my precious time with."",0"
"25278,School of Dragons,2015.0,""I think the game is great, but it's a little annoying that you have to be a member to enjoy the game. If you're not a member, your play options is limited.

"25280,School of Dragons,2017.0,""I can't say I recommend this which honestly makes me feel down as I quite enjoyed the series, movies and original books however the massive amount of lag renders this game unplayable and I'm not over exagurating about that, I literally could not even register because it was lagging so badly it took 5 minutes for my mouse to move to the register button.This game must be horribly optimized or have some kind of basic issue like that because I'm capable of running games like Subnautica with little to no issue and I can't even get into this game.Also from my perspective on the menu I saw advertisements for at least eight different pay to get packs and whilst that normal for an mmo this one is targetted toward children 5 and under which makes the whole thing rather... sketchy in my book. Not to mention the obvious fact that it's not free to play if everywhere you look the game is asking for you to pay to get this, that or the other. "",0"
"25281,School of Dragons,2015.0,""Quickly decided to uninstall again.The user interface is very different, couldn't find the quit button, and Escape opens the options screen, where it's not even possible to customize the controls.Seems it's more for children anyway."",0"

"25283,School of Dragons,2018.0,""Overall a pretty polished game. The backgrounds are detailed enough to look nice without giving off massive lag, the character animations look natural, and most of the dragons look great. Like all """"free to play"""" games, there are many parts of the game that are blocked off until you purchase them. Unlike many other games of its kind, you can get access to most of the content without paying a dime. There are many loading screens, but you're gonna come across those with any unity game or even 3d game for that matter. Again, for a free game, you get a lot more than you paid for."",1"
"25284,School of Dragons,2015.0,""Let's start with the fact, that...well...having a dragon doesn't really """"opne the doors"""" if you know what I mean. You might be able to fly, but what's the point if there aren't a lot of things to do with your dragon, that have a meaning/impact or are fun?The second thing is that there are a lot of paywalls. The chances are, that you won't really hold to the game for a long time, as most of the content (new or old) will need the use of your wallet.Another thing is the fact, that there aren't really a lot of interesting quests that give you some sense of accomplishment, or are fun. It feels like if you're doing all of this just to waste your time. (Which might not be bad if you want a time-waster. As far as I know there are such players)And let's not even talk about the bugs.To put it simply: It's a buggy mess with not a lot of reasons to play it, and on top of that is also made to be milked as well."",0"

To sum it up, it takes AGES! Like others have said, I would LOVE this game to be a one time purchase and get all the benifits that members currently have. Yes, I know it would be unfair to the ones that have membership, but to be honest, they would have SO many more people buying the game/playing it.

The first is that at times the controls can be frustratingly cumbersome, especially during flight. Sometimes it takes a while to register a turn or boost, but maybe this is just due to timing.The second is that you're bombarded with advertisements for membership, additional perks and boosts, which I'm really not interested in and probably do little to actually enhance the game itself.

I really loved the unmarked buttons with no tutorial to explain what they did, the oversensitive chat filter to stop kids saying nasty words like 'hiiiiii' or 'axaxaxaxa'. The bad face and model design really throws back to the old days of gaming, providing children an insight into how old games used to look. To enhance the image, resolution settings are nonexistent and windowed mode fills the entire screen. Controls are unchangeable (at least, I haven't found a way to change them yet) and my favorite feature is constant disconnects with game-breaking bugs like missions reverting to previous ones, for example after completing the 'Hatch an Egg' mission I was forced to complete is again, which was impossible as I had already hatched an egg and was unable to hatch another.TL"

Once the game was downloaded, it took over half an hour just to gain access, and then another half hour after logging in for the game to actually start. Once in the game, it was fairly straight forward for an MMO. To gain access to the extras, you need to subscribe and it constantly reminds you of this, but you're guided through the games and quests, which are fairly simple. For my kids, the wait times are insanely frustrating. Not too many kids are going to wait around for half an hour or more to play a game before finding something else to do.

Although running out of food or money is the only thing that truly ever scares me when playing this game. If you love being able to fly, fish, even farm and especially just want to bond emotionally with your very own dragon then there is probably nothing wrong with me recomending this game. It makes me happy to go online just to see Pepper Ghost and do whatever strange new task I have to complete next. The tasks may not be exicting and the price for farming and other things might not seem great but oer time with patience and the simple enjoyment you can have from being in this game may be enough to make it a game you would feel happy to be in too.

Once you get a few dragons, you can then send them on stable quests to earn more gems. The Expansion packs are good and the new titan dragons are a great idea.

"25350,School of Dragons,2015.0,""After playing this game for 7 hours, I feel I'm ready to give this a real review. I want to love it, so, so much, but I just can't. There are so many problems with this game that it makes it unbearable. If they were fixed it would at least make a fan of the HTTYD series such as myself at least deal with the minor issues, but sadly, it's not like that. I'm going to list some problems as I think of them so please bear with me: Â· No Volume bar, it's only on or off.Â· Even when both sound options are off some sounds still play, ex. leveling up, your dragon's breathing, etc.Â· Random crashes, a lot.Â· Quest arrow will just not work sometimes.Â· When doing collection quests the NPCs sometimes won't give you the items needed, making you have to re-log.Â· Some quests you finish, just to find the same quest available again making the whole quest progression system very confusing.Â· Friend list is broken, like, really broken.Â· It costs gems (real world currency) to delete a character, wtf.Â· I had to delete my old character because the quest he was on updated making the NPC I had to talk to not appear thus making the quest progress impossible.Â· Quests are really boring, to be honest. There's no variety.Â· Membership gives you some unfair benefits such as 20% discount on ALL items in the store, access to some special fishing thing in your farm, gold bonuses.Â· Anything good in the store costs gems such as the compost, improved fishing rods, good saddles, and lots of other items that are basically needed to get ahead in the game.Â· Membership costs aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ton for what you get, $10 a month, Jesus.Â· When you go to the credits section of the game you can jump off the cliff and forever fall through the world. This really surprised me and you would think that they would have fixed it by now. It's not.So now some good aspects of the game:Â· Fishing is kinda funÂ· Toothless is in the game AKA the best dragon everÂ· The UDT system is kinda neat but affected heavily by hackersThat's about it.Now, if you still want to go ahead and give the game a shot, go ahead. I hope you have a lot of fun. For the others still looking for a good kids game, I heavily recommend Wizard101 or Pirate101. Thos games are without a doubt the best kid friendly game I have ever played. In the end, I feel this game is incomplete and not worthy of your money, or your time. It's something that you would casually play just to have a little fun and not take it seriously or play it hours on end every day. I really hope the developers solve some of these bugs and create a better game, but it's been out for 2 years, I don't see them redeeming themselves anytime soon."",0"
"25351,School of Dragons,2014.0,""this games sucks, the internet connection for this game is worse. so definitely this game sucks then some times the game crashes. so dont play this game otherwise you will regret it. i hope they will fix this because it is a very good game so pls fix that."",0"
"25352,School of Dragons,2014.0,""Its was nice at the first 15 minutes when I was creating the character (viking), but then I realised there's no way to change the resolution. And the game is half pay to play, to create more characters you need to pay and several stuff during the game too."",0"
"25353,School of Dragons,2014.0,""Okay, so I've gotten up to level 7 and this game just has a few problems.1: Definitely freemium. The microtransactions are everywhere and pushed all the time. You can buy a subscription, but that doesn't make the microtransactions go away, it just gives you a bonus pack of stuff and a certain amount of microtransaction currency each month. 90% of the content is locked behind real-money purchasing. 2: Broken in several places, one being a floating fish, which rotated merrily and once I saw it, I could no longer play the fishing minigame, which is required to keep your dragon's energy up.  Also, the fireballs in the flight club game (which is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game so far) will refuse to lock onto targets, and you can't fire manually, which makes a fair few of the levels impossible to 100%. 3: Looks terrible. These aren't good graphics for a PC game. They're not even good graphics for an iPad game. 4: Controls are not rebindable. You're stuck clicking go fast and go slow buttons like an idjit. 5: Has you walk everywhere for the first several hours of the game. I don't know how long away I was from being able to fly on my dragon, but that's what was promised me. Of course, I could turn my baby dragon into an adult immediately for 500 gems. Or five dollars. 6: Is a learning game oriented towards children. Spent a half hour teaching me the scientific method as part of a required quest.7: HAS FARMVILLE IN IT. Literally. A farming minigame where you plant and tend crops, harvest and sell those crops, and then buy more seeds to plant crops with. It is implied that this part of the game is heavily important. I didn't stick around to find out.8: If you stand next to a cliff, then rotate rapidly, your dragon will fall off the cliff and be lost to the nether void, only to pop back into existence when you enter a new area. 9: The voice acting doesn't match the text in the boxes. Petty, I know, but super annoying.10: The high scores on everything are hacked. 11: LITERALLY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE GAME EVER.This is the worst MMO I've ever played. Hell, it might be the worst game I've ever played, period. Not that there aren't worse games, there's plenty of worse games, but those were worse because the game developers didn't know what they were doing. This is a game that started off from one of the most beautiful animated movies, with clever characters and a wonderful landscape, and was run through the corporate meat grinder with the smallest amount of effort. Hell, the company that made it is a subsidiary of Blizzard, so they should know how to make an MMO. It's almost like the developers hated this game right from the start. And they nonchalantly took one of my favorite animated IPs and screwed it into the ground with no hope of some soothing ointment for afters. It's worse because it was deliberately ruined.-Deda"",0"

There are multiple bugs throught the game and they arent major except for the part where the mission you're on spontaneously termiantes and you cant move forward. I was really looking forward to playing in the HTTYD universe and I understand that this is targeted at kids but c'mon. This is 2014, this game plays like it just came out for the Nintendo 64. Did you really release a game like this and expect no one to notice. Not to mension, it takes SO LONG for you to actually ride your beloved dragon. I didn't even get to the point where i can actually ride it but I imagine it would be less like the movies and more like Superman 64 for anyone who remembers that game. This should not be considered a complete game, not even Beta for that matter. This is someone wiping thereâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on a keyboard and somehow managing to write code that produces a barely functional program and deciding to publish hisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥wipe.exe to steam. Furthermore, you have to PAY to DELETE a character and there is only one character slot. Honestly, wtf. Speaking of pay, microtranactions.

"25368,School of Dragons,2015.0,""Let's be honest: DON'T PLAY THIS GAME ON STEAM! Play it directly on the website, it's more stable.The ups: the game is very faithful of the movies/series, adding characters like Heather that were in the series (which is quite refreshing), the dragon customization is gold, the characters are well modelised, the mini-games are quite nice and the maps are wonderful!The downs: Some computers may not be able to stand the MMO mode, and I don't know for others but once I had finished the quests, it became boring. And like any game, the amount of things you have to buy in real cash is just irritating. Speaking of which, I find it scandalous the Toothless you get for becoming member CAN'T be customed! Why can't we change him from black to dark blue or dark purple?!Anyway, I recommand it mostly for the fans of the How to train your dragon franchise, because I'm not sure others may find it really interesting."",1"

"25375,School of Dragons,2014.0,""Okay... Unlike most of the people who reviewed this game i actually took the time to play it for awhile. I love the concept of this game having a dragon to train a soul-bond and you can only have 1 but it contradicts itself. It say's you can only have 1 dragon that you will bond with, but if you pay for Gems you can have several dragons. You cannot earn the dragon's that cost gem's unless you A. Buy gems Or B buy a membership. I don't really feel like this game is Pay2Win as much as I feel that it is Pay2HaveFunCosmetics. The flying on the dragon's is actually quite fun i was surprised to be having fun just going through the obstacle course. It's not a very explaining game the tutorial is like yeah do this and they expect you to know how to do everything. At one point in this game i got very frustrated because it glitched and it said to feed my dragon a fish, your thinking ok how hard can this be well, when your dragon is nowhere to be seen i have no idea how to feed him. Your dragon will be a derpmonster and walk off several times. And woulden't you expect to fly your own dragon? No you will be flying a dragon called Nightmare or something. Supposedly you can't fly on your dragon till it's out of baby mode and then it does not explain how to get your dragon out of baby mode. I like this game but at the same time I hate it.

"25393,School of Dragons,2016.0,""I was very thrilled to play this game after watching the films and series, but this game is very disappointing, Most of the new dragons that have been introduced in the series, are only for members only. They say that """"Nothing is for FREE these days""""  Yet when I used to play games nothing was that hard to get, but these days its cash cash cash, Its very disapointing, but let me shed some light on this game before I get to the huge down fall, This game is going to be mostly recommneded to the fans of the 'How to Train Your Dragon' This games style and design looks a lot like the style of the series that is currently on Netflix, The characters of the main cast are in it and help you along the way, You even get to meet their dragons as well.The area of the game changes to the current season which is nice and you can recognize a lot of the areas. You get to raise your dragon from a baby to its adult form, very cute and you get to choose the colours, But you can't fly for a very long time. Reminded me of Istaria The animation mechanics are ok a little buggy but not bad Now here are the Down fallsSometimes when exiting the area, the loading screen will come up, it will nag you to get a membership, it will take a while to get to the next area, once it does, it will appear again before you can move on and do your quests or tasks around the area, Sadly sometimes when you say no to the membership the game will crash.I struggled to get out of this on wide screen, so if any of you have a PC that struggles to run these types of games, please keep it on window just incase it decides to crash on you.After the crash I decided to check the reviews, sadly all the negatives were right you take a few steps and it already crashes on you, exit an area to another it will crash, go fishing, it will lag so much as well as when you chop down trees for wood, it will lag so bad that your game will crash and freeze your pc.Another reason to keep it on window.Unfortunatly I had to get rid of the game due to the graphics and lagging on the game, it crashed 3 times.Loading it back up is more quicker than getting around the areas.Don't play this game if you dont want your pc to suffer from crashes and freezesPlay this game on window just to be safeBut overall I highly recommended you to not play this game, its needs much more work because it still looks like its in testing, it looks very much like the old graphics from a very old console, lets say ps1 sort of style, yes I know that sounds very harsh but its true. It also needs more free stuff than just membership stuff. The lag makes it very frustrating to play because you can hardly go anywhere. I am very disappointed in this game, but if your little ones would like to play it, make sure your pc can run alright on it, and keep it on window just be on the safe side, but don't be surprised if it crashes on window screens as well.

PERIOD.2. Free up the game a little bit, give some freedom to the players of this game.3. Less ads and more of the the lore and freedom (like before).4. Less offers to buy stuff for money.

I haven't got far enough to see if this is actually a feature but, Free (flying) roaming, like... Exploring berk while flying on your dragon.Summary:It's a great game but... Has olmost every aspect of a Pay-to-win game. If your Kid or yourself is stuggling in prek - 4th grade then this is the game for you. BUT A FAIR WARNING!!! If your child or yourself get's too attached to this game (somehow) get ready to lose all your money because, its a game where you will get mad at having a stupid dragon and then spending 56.99 to buy 500 gems to get like 6 virtual dragons that last like 6 months.(not really)But its ok a little less than what i though it was.(a little pathetic overall) which makes it a below average game.Enjoy!"",0"

I would let my younger siblings play it, and I think it's fun for when I want to just sit back and relax, enjoy a little bit of wandering. Plus, I got an awesome two headed dragon!

"25400,School of Dragons,2014.0,""I downloaded this game, not because I'm familiar with How to Train Your Dragon, but because the description reminded me of a game I hadn't played in nearly two decades call Dragonseeds for the Playstation 1. I came into this, not even thinking that it was possible for a game to be released nowadays with graphics that are on par with a SIXTEEN year old game.Not to mention this pay system. Twenty minutes into the game and you'll already have a large flashing button on the UI telling you that you have 10 days to pay for a starter pack, and thats not even the first thing behind gems you come in contact with. When you have to pick an egg for your future dragon, the ones not even two steps away from where you start, are locked for members only.You want a cool dragon? $5 please.You want to skip the tutorial? $5 please.You want to have a second character slot?

"25408,School of Dragons,2014.0,""Really cool game if you liked the Moves/TV Show. It features several species both from the Movies and Show. My only gripes are that several species specific diet and abilities aren't in the game and that you have a Species Specific Quest. Like the Monstrous Nightmare's ability to light itself on fire, the Nadder's spine shot and the Typhoomerang's Eel diet. The Species Specific Quest involves hovering and the only dragon that can hover is a Gronkle so in order to complete that quest you need a Gronkle. This penalizes players who don't pay for gems and didn't choose a Gronkle as their starter dragon. This could upset players that don't have the money to spend on a virtual game but want to complete all current quests. Also you get a free Whispering Death in a later quest so don't spend your money on getting an egg."",1"

I don't think I really played it long enough to find any bugs, but who knows, I might or might not try it out again one day (if they gave us a Night Fury). Edit: Forgot to say, yes, I know all Night Furies but Toothless 'might' be extinct so they left them out because of that reason most likely, still a let down though.Edit 2: Oh yay, an update...nope, not much has changed.

I could just be walking around and I would enjoy it. But that's pretty much all there is to this game. Just walking around, a few fetch quests to do, nothing much. There isn't even a story, just getting a dragon and, perhaps, growing some carrots. The game is full of monotonous, repetitive tasks that would leave most bashing their keyboard to kingdom come out of boredom. So, therefore I deeply suggest you do not download this game.

However, after a few minutes of playing, I quickly realized this game is not intended for young kids - the ones the movies are geared towards. Also, never did find an easy way to exit the game - tried multiple ways. Had to ctrl-alt-delete just to end the game. Extremely amateur game building IMO. Not only would I not recommend, but I would encourage others to stay away from anything those that designed this game have ever or will ever make."",0"

Later I didn't get the treasure. Then my game has to restart because there is some server down. All the time you have to do quests 2 times, because it got bugged and you need to start all over.This sounds terrible, but... I do enjoy training a dragon and having fun with what the next egg might hold. I hope the buggs get fixed. I'm not bothered by the quests and enjoy flying around.

"25431,School of Dragons,2017.0,""Though I think this game is decent, and would recommend this game to younger HTTYD fans, I would not recommend this game to a hardcore gamer, or a teenager-adult. All this actually game actually is another cash grab made by Jumpstart. You have to buy gems, or a 10 dollar membership which is a downside. Another flaw is weither you disagree or not, this is a pay to win game, but that's pretty reasonable. I also have to warn you that when you boot your game up, there's gonna be lots of lag, but once you play it more, the lag dies down."",0"
"25432,School of Dragons,2017.0,""Pros: If you enjoy HTTYD you will love this game, I wish they made games like this for all my fandoms. It takes a long ime to finish all the quests, and when you do there are in game expansion packs that add on even more. They have pretty much every single dragon ever mentioned in the movies/shows.Cons: There are so many glitches. It can get annoying but if you go on their website and look at bug complaints other people have had the same problems and have found ways around it. Overall it is a fun game and it's free so why even hesitate, if you don't like it you can just erase it."",1"

"25435,School of Dragons,2016.0,""This game is quite fun, but there are loading issues, i have had to close the game several times due to this loading issue, the quest missions and character menu lags and breaks sometimes, but despite these glitches and lag issues, i look at what the game offers, it sorta is a cash grab but there are fun thing in this game, Fireball Frenzy is fun, and the dragon races are fun as well, flight club isnt really that hard. Be careful with what you spend your coins on, always have at least 10 bait just in case you run out of fish and coins. The lab is cool as well, you do learn about materials and what combines with what and what happens to certain materials on certain things.

"25437,School of Dragons,2016.0,""ok lets start with the basics. you Can't Configure your controls.you cant change resoloution(mine is 1280x1024) so you cant see the entire screen.you can't configure your graphics settings.you can't use a joystick.lots and lots of loading screens.you must pay an be a member otherwise you cant have many of the things the game is offering,AND NO you can't unlock them by playng.no subtitles.this game sucks, i really tryed to play it.but i can't pass this minus. this is a no go."",0"
"25438,School of Dragons,2016.0,""HTTYD is a really cool setting, which I really love. Then you got a game based on that setting, how can you go wrong? Well...1) The looksGraphics aren't everything, for sure. But this game was released in 2014 and it looks like something made like 10 years ago. Compare this with another MMO, such as Final Fantasy 14. Released 4 years prior to School of Dragons, and boy does it look better.2) LimitationsOf course, this is a free to play game, so it lives of microtransactions and paying memberships (which are optional). To unlock stuff, you need to buy gems which serve as ingame currency. But is it really necessary to actually charge gems if you want to DELETE a character? Oh, and you can only have one character unless you purchase additional slots.3) DragonsIn the beginning, you get to choose which dragon you want. The dragon only follows you around and when it's grown up, you can ride it. I have no idea if that's only for looks, or if the dragons actually have different skillsets. As a non-paying player, you get to choose from four dragons. Four. So I guess the paying member gets a much larger variety, right? I couldn't check, because I didn't have enough gems to delete my character and start a new one, but if I remember correctly, a paying member gets an additional 2 dragons to choose from. And no, the nightshade is not one of them. Why not offer more variety?Also, when choosing your dragon, there are a few options for customization, like colors. They don't seem to work, at least I couldn't change them. Maybe I chose a dragon that cannot be customized or I need to be a paying member to do so.4) The controlsOh boy. So, moving around on the ground is easy enough, if a bit stiff. You can't look around while moving, but at least you can control the character's orientation with the mouse. In flight, that's a different story. You control the flying direction solely with the keyboard. The steering feels very slippery and you constantly have to steer and counter-steer to keep the dragon on track as it keeps turning for a while longer after you released the button.Climb and dive angles are limited, some flight school courses actually required you to do a steeper dive or climb than is actually possible.Seriously, why not allow steering the dragon with the mouse? You could then use WASD for strafing.Also, attacking or using skills in flight is terrible. You actually have to click on the skills to use them. You're in flight, trying to quickly attack something? First you must look and make sure the cursor is placed above the button.5) Loading timesEvery time you change to another area, you get a loading screen. Which is, of course, used as a canvas for advertising. At times, the game made me feel like I was walking through a forest of billboards.6) SettingsThere hardly are any settings to speak of. You can toggle sound and music on and off, but you can't adjust the volume. You can look at the key mapping, but you can't edit it. You can choose to invert the vertical axis in flight, which is a good thing at least, you can toggle wether names are displayed above yourself and other players, and you can toggle solo and MMO mode. That's it.Summary:You can see that I didn't play very long. I probably didn't even get to see the main game. But seriously, what I saw was enough. I can't say it was fun, the game appears half-arsed and unfinished. It looks rushed and like the devs didn't care for it at all. And considering the large amount of stuff I was already expected to pay for before I actually started my first mission... if that's the sign of what's to come, no thanks.Do I actually have anything positive to say? Uh... the dialogs have partial voiceover, which is nice, and some areas are nicely designed, despite the outdated graphics.JumpStart... HTTYD is a great movie which you could have turned into a great game. You choose not to. You choose to make this a half-arsed thing that begs for money at any given opportunity, but it doesn't offer anything I would be willing to pay money for. What a waste..."",0"
"25439,School of Dragons,2016.0,""The game and ideas themselves are fantastic. However, this game is so damn bugged up that I couldn't play it on my smartphone OR my computer!

It being a MMORPG is what the game is ruined by in my opinion. They could have had the main cast as playable characters and have adventures like in the show.It has the music from the series and the character and that are well modelled so they have that but i didnt want to play it for long before it put me off the series."",0"

"25442,School of Dragons,2017.0,""I think I have played this enough here and before this even was on Steam to say that you must pay real money to actually enjoy of the game.

Quests.I will admit tho, you can earn free stuff that costs gems by using Coin Chests, Randomly appearing chests that have a price of: 90 coins - 160 coins. they have a Whopping 2% to give you a dragon egg and a Measly 50% to give you a Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ item to decorate that poor excuse for a Farm Village rip off.Save your time, Save your Memory card space and more importantly..Keep your kids away from your Credit card"",0"

"25446,School of Dragons,2016.0,""School of Dragons is a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game set in the universe of the 2010 critically-acclaimed Dreamworks Animations film, How to Train Your Dragon, and its sequel. Step into the life of a Viking dragon rider and journey beyond the Isle of Berk to the mainland continent and the surrounding islands, home to dozens of exotic dragons. Train your dragon from birth, join clans and unite with your fellow dragon trainers, ride on the backs of these majestic winged beasts, and relive the thrill of How to Train Your Dragon in stunning graphical detail -- free to play!...is what I would say if I was paid to promote this very bad game."",0"

"25448,School of Dragons,2017.0,""this game is awful and I really like it.--> don't spend money on it there's multiple accounts of people getting glitches that involve losing items/gems. <--it's really glitchy, there's almost no actual skill, strategy, or puzzlesolving. almost all the quests are fetch quests with poorly written dialogue and an inconsistent objective arrow, and there's not nearly enough quests to keep interest. The only repeatable quest takes about 10 steps and gives you 5 gold, and once it's completed it will likely restart itself against your will. The main form of earning cash in the game is a time-lapse farming game and once you've gotten a stable farm there's no point to earning gold anywhere else.The only real gold sink is randomly spawning chests that will give you cosmetic items for your farm and, in theory, dragon eggs.The game plays primarily like a walking simulator with a dozen or so islands for you to explore that are completely undecorated and uninteractable beyond Berk.-The Glitches-The glitches are plentiful and fantastic. the game often takes multiple tries to boot at all. walking through walls is easy and common. falling through the floor is common. I've had the fishing minigame refuse to quit so I was trapped fishing eternally. My pigs live underground. They had to recently update it to avoid letting you multiply your gems. 10% of the farm quests have typos that make images not load. Farming pumpkins causes explosions of produce. the best way to get exp in the game is to afk. Dragons are stuck in T-pose half the time they load.-The Censor-Numbers are censored. Words related to Censorship are censored. Words related to being Lost are censored. Cursing will give you an automatic mute. The chatroom has formed their own language to slip past the eyes of the everpresent robot dictators. Everyone is roleplaying Toothless and seasons have to be misspelled to be spoken about."",1"
"25449,School of Dragons,2015.0,""In my opinion it's not the best, I mean the wii version of this game is so much better but it's not the worst either. If you love and adore dragons with all your heart then this is a game for you. I would still recommend this."",1"
"25450,School of Dragons,2015.0,""*sigh* School of Dragons had potential, but failed poorly in execution. The gameplay feels clunky, the quests (which is SUPPOSED to be the main part of any MMORPG) feels empty, unrewarding and mainly consists of fetch-quests. Except from a few minigames, which are rather boring already, there isn't really any content for the game. Unless you are willing to become a member. But even then, you only get new dragons to ride on(which, may sound cool, it's done in a very, very awkward way.) and some new cosmetics. Then nothing else. NOTHING at all. You can finish all the quests in like a week's time(granted, I finished it in like 3 days back when it is still only on their website via Unity Web Player, with all the guide arrows last year, but still they are on by default...) and then you got nothing to do. Riding and raising your own dragons is a cool thing...but they set up payment barriers for F2Ps so that they need to pay in order to get more dragons, which, I'm doubting they would, seeing that they game does not actually have enough content to keep them there.(Or, they could potentially just start a new account to experience it again....I did. And I admit I was dumb.)But by far, the most disappointing thing about this game, is not how the graphic is terrible, comparing to what Unity could actually do(I feel like that the reason for the horrid graphics is to make sure that a lot more pcs can run it and to maintain the same experience for all players across and probably add in that their servers might not be able to handle massive data flow or something like that, I don't know. It's just speculation. As a sidenote though, AT LEAST LET THE PLAYERS CHOOSE THE RESOULTION OF THE GAME THAT THEY WANT TO PLAY ON), it's the aim of the game and demographic players for the game.I'm a fan of the How To Train Your Dragons series for a while now, and what I've seen from the online fandom, is that they are mostly consist of people who are teens and even young adults, instead of what the game is targeting at, which is like for 6-10 year-olds. So there's a lot of quests in the game that attempts to teach the players about real-world science that they are supposed to be learning at school, and the entire game felt like it was too dumbed down to cater for them. First of all, the science quests. They. Ruin. Immersion. NO one wants to learn science in a world where glass is a valuable and people wear horned helmets to protect themselves in the constant battles and dragons are real. In fact, I'm pretty sure that during the Viking age, most of what we learned about since today hasn't even been theorized or ever touched on! I would rather just focus on training dragons and fly with them, thank you very much.I remember like the original aim was to like 'train, raise your own dragon and learn real world science along the way' or something like that, That's just something I can't agree on.And then there's the catering problem. I know, How To Train Your Dragon is supposed to be a children's film, but it feels mature(especially in the sequel, I don't want to spoil it so go find yourself and cry forever. A major character's parent died.), that's probably why it gathered a number of older fans, but even then, the game developers ignored the needs of them and would rather create something to milk money for themselves. Shame on you.If you are a fan of the Dragons franchise, you could go try out the game...on your own behalves. This game is just not worth it. As for anyone else, nope. Don't even get the idea to click that button to install. It's not worth your time."",0"
"25451,School of Dragons,2018.0,""I used to play this game very often and I enjoyed it (mostly because I love the How To Train Your Dragon movie series). However, I decided to install it again after 1-2 years of not playing and I just cannot get past the loading screen. It would say 'connection timed out' and many other messages, sending me back to the login menu.Don't get me wrong, it has always done this, even when I used to play this game all the time, but it has certainly gotten worse as I spend hours and hours trying to get past the loading screen. It just isn't worth the time anymore, unfortunately. If this gets fixed, I would love to play it again. But right now? NOT recommended."",0"

"25453,School of Dragons,2018.0,""-Looks like a PS2 game-Crashes on taming your first dragon sometimes. Crashes when there are too many players firing (Not sure how many is too many yet, this only happened to me once). Haven't encountered many crashes other than those.-Playerbase ranges from ~7-year-old children to +18. Not a good thing since there's a chat box. Heavy chat restrictions, but can be easily bypassed by adding x's or q's, or any other letter you wish in front of each word.-No real gameplay value past minigames, multiplayer races for trophy points, and ship battles for gems/eggs/saddles/etc. after finishing all of the quests.   (ship battles in a nutshell: hover dragon at the respawn area and spam f or fireball at ship for abt 2 mins, then wait 2 hours for the event, repeat)-You can't fight other dragons or trainers. Only in a quest where you fight the Red Death, which happens  once  in your viking's playthrough.-Toothless is the only dragon that's really satisfying to fly. (Members only)-Lots of dragons but not much use for them. Most of them are for show. (Boneknapper for example. Cool dragon, bad stats. Can't race, and there are better dragons for ship battles. The only two uses that a dragon can have, besides for looks. Races and battle events.)-Kind of a dragon collecting game because of the above. I've seen veteran players flex their entire collection of dragons on other players. That's pretty much all you can do with most of them.-Not only are most dragons essentially useless, but they cost gems! Which you're supposed to spend real money on!*I mean, if you like running and flying around interacting with people, this is a good game for that. Oh and quests. They run out after a while though. Can't replay them after that. Then you need to make a new viking.*Yeah, microtransactions suck, but the game doesn't have the best security against people who want to exploit the game. It was especially bad in 2015 or so. Anyone could get infinite gems. 2 years later, there are still exploits that need to be fixed.*Overall a decent game if you like collecting dragons and flying them around, and are willing to deal with getting gems for them. Just don't buy gems though, only try membership if you're thinking about it. I play this game to decompress. It's not that fast paced.*I would not recommend SoD to a friend to play a game. It's more about the social aspects than playing a game. You would likely have more fun interacting with people than racing or doing battle events. However, SoD isn't the only place you can talk to people, so that doesn't make  this particular  game stand out much.*I'd like to see more gameplay added in, like other dueling options than fireball frenzy, or another use for dragons like the boneknapper. He's average with speed and firepower, but he has a lot of armor and spikes. Maybe there can be a new minigame where bulky dragons can destroy things with melee attacks.*They're starting to improve the graphics in some areas, like the Training Grounds and the School, which is nice :) The water at the School is honestly the best looking part of the game.Graphics: 4/10Gameplay: 4/10Fun factor: 4/10Gets boring after a while. I log on every once in a while to fly around, then log off. Flight is one of those mechanics in games that are kind of hard to come by, especially if it's both free flight and it's an integral part of the game. To compare with MMORPGs like Riders of Icarus and World of Warcraft, these two games are just overdone and too detailed. I like School of Dragons because of its simplicity and focus on the dragons. It also isn't an eyesore for me, compared to RoI or WoW. There's just a lack of content in-game.  More things to do than quests, battle events, and races would be a good place to start working.

"25467,School of Dragons,2018.0,""Product received for freeI think we can all agree that School of Dragons is nothing more but a scam of a kids game. And it's all because of gems. Gems everywhere. You need gems to get dragons, you need gems to open rare chests, you need gems to buy more stables, and you need more gems to buy coins if you don't wanna do quests, and on, and on, and ON! This game is demanding for you to spend all of the money that you have in your wallet so that you can enjoy the game. Sure, there are ways you can obtain gems, be it invitations, watching videos, stuff like that, but this is just nuts. That's why we've got hackers all over School of Dragons. because gems are very costly. You want the max load of gems? You gotta pay $100 dollars. You want membership for a whole year? Pay $85 and you'll get your wish! Even PSN isn't this bad, with only $60 for a whole year. Sure it's still expensive, but that's to be expected from Sony, not a company that made those little pc games for little kids. Bugs, glitches, hackers, the works. It's all because JumpStart is nothing but money grabbing monster, robbing both you or your money and of your sanity with all its flaws.. Don't let your kids spend all of your money onto this game, else you're gonna try calling them, and they won't even respond to your call, or just say something completely different, ignoring your problem.. Which, I'm pretty sure they don't. I pray that after the release of How to Train your Dragon 3, can we get a game like this, but less tedious, more visually appealing, more freedom, and most importantly of all, not being a """"Pay to Win"""" game.But knowing how movie based console games usually are, I don't think we can ever get a game like that,Burn in hell, JumpStart."",0"

"25469,School of Dragons,2018.0,""The only fun thing about this game is the flying, the rest is buy to win. Litterally. Quests are fun- at first. After about 20 minuets of a quest, it makes you go somewhere.....where you have to PAY REAL MONEY to get there. You also have to PAY REAL MONEY to delete a character, you have to PAY REAL MONEY to make a new character, you have to PAY REAL MONEY to get another dragon or gear, and the game money is worthless. This game is free because you cannot complete a quest without having to PAY REAL MONEY. =S    Therefore, there is nothing to do in the game but PAYING REAL MONEY.(best is 5 X, lowest score is 1 X) GRAPHICS: X  Hated graphics. It looks nothing like the movie, and certainly doesn't look like any other game Iv'e played. GAMEPLAY: XX  Poor gameplay. Like I said in the first paragraph, the gamplay is just quests you have to pay for. The only thing most people like about the game is you can fly your own dragons.LAG: XXXXX  I have never experienced lag or crashes in this game. It is pretty much the only thing they actually worked hard on.CONTROLS: XXXX Liked controls. Controls for School of Dragons are pretty good, a little to sensitive, but good.MULTIPLAYER: XXX People don't interact with each other much, but if you are in multiplayer, the better chance there is to recive lag.MULTIPLAYER CHAT: XXXX Like I said, people don't interact much in multiplayer, or chat. But, if bad people dicide to come in and say somthing bad in chat, it gives the person 3 chances to stop saying any bad thing he is saying, and if he doesn't stop- he will automaticly get kicked out of the whole game for an hour or so.
