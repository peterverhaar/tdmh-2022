"3649,Ring of Elysium,,""Access ReviewSo far so good with the new season. Minor glitches with the grappling hook vs. trees, but i am sure that will get worked out before too long. overall, still my favorite game to play and stream!"",1"

3651,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewWell at first i thought it was just a PUBG clone but when i played i found out its kind of more fun for me and i have PUBG so :) there are issues like i snipe a guy with a sniper in the head and he survives but hey its a beta so its OK it have a lot of potential and i hope more people will start playing it...already have all of my friends download it so give it a try guys,1
"3652,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewSo originaly i bought my PC to start gaming on PubG, but after playing that game and just not understanding the mechanics of it i gave this one a try. I gotta say for a free to play game, its pretty damn good. I love how the challanges are set up and how its a bit different in the end battle. The game is nice and polishied plays smooth from its lowest settings all the way to its max. deffently recomend this game to any one who wants to jump in the whole battle royal ban wagon. I really hope this game grows becuase i am willing to drop some of my hard earnd $$ into as long as it keeps playing nice and smooth and new content of course."",1"
"3653,Ring of Elysium,,""Access ReviewI rarely write reviews on Steam but this game really deserve a good review.Okay so i'm gonna write my review the way I would love someone to write it :GENERAL FEELING : That's beautiful. My graphic card is middle/low end "
"3654,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game: fun to play in squads, its free, smooth, weapons are custom, avatar is custom, amazing graphics, good performance, little to no cheaters, unique classes: skii, climb/rapple, glide.  LOVE THE HELI AND HOW TO WIN.  way better than fortnut and battle grounds combined - and its free.  100% would recommend"",1"
"3655,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game didn't lag even once while I played it (looking at you PUBG). PREMIUM doesnt give you any advantage, just clothing. Character customization is way better than it actually should be (I mean you can't even see your face anyway, but kudos for the nice touch in there). Different ways to move around the map and make you playstyle more...awesome I guess? You can be death from above with glider(watch the shadows peeps) , extra fast moving from one spot to another with snowboard and climbing pack gives you an edge at the beginning of the match and you can literally be the hospital with two legs (carry tonns of medpacks etc).Now for the dislikes. Can't shoot with smgs from snowboard and while climbing (I heard that they will change that), you can hear the steps of every1 from very far away (annoying, cant sneak around, perhaps they should make another class that is slow, without perks like glider etc but with muffled walking), on medium settings some of the graphics glitch if you look at the trees and stuff (sometimes flashes or textures move around, doesn'd bother much, but still). And last... And least annoying thing, all characters are asian (not that I dislike asians, but why limit it with only this option? You can edit your dude or dudette to look half asian, but thats about it).Can't deside about the """"get to tha choppa"""" escaping. I hate and like it at the same time, people never cooperate, but there is a chance that in the midst of chaos etc you can just slip through the opponents and win the match by smokebombing everything.In all other aspects, nothing surprising, if you don't count that it's FREE and it works more or less without flaws. Be sure to give it a try!"",1"
3656,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewVery good game . I like roe more than pubg because the gliders snowboards and climbing packs .If they will work at the game at graphichs and other things it will be my favorite game .The bad part is that it is not in europe .,1
"3657,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewSo far I'm loving this game. Starting to see more hackers, but overall it's much more polished than PUBG and devs are working hard to improve the game. It's a great game to play with squads as long as everyone has a mic."",1"
"3658,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewimagine pubg. nevermind. dont imagine garbage. Imagine going out with your family on a vacation to a ski resort, but your family are your steam friends and the ski resort is a breathtaking map with endless possibilities."",1"
3659,Ring of Elysium,,Access ReviewImo This game is way better than pubg like with The Graphics and Movement animation. and i also like how you have to get in the heli rather then just killing to win. (also you can use my reffural code:9WZUHH47DLB) Thanks!,1
"3660,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's like a WAAAYY better version of PUBG. It's at least having an easier early access release than PUBG was. And funny thing is, the developers are the devs who also made PUBG Mobile. Even THAT is better than PUBG.RoE pros:No DesyncA new take on Battle Royale3 different kinds of gear you can start with. Also includes starting weapons and medsVehiclesAttachments for weaponsFree DLC released for 1,000,000 usersIt's freeRoE Cons:When you team up for duo or squad (not sure if this is only happening on first-person) but when you die and spectate your team, buildings do not render. And the same goes for enemys you knock out too.Poorly optimized at the moment, but its early access. (Still better than what PUBG was during its early access stage)A very nice game overall. I could see this becoming something big. #PUBGKILLER"",1"
"3661,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis was an awesome game until 11/8 patch turned it into PUBG. Everything that made this a fun game was converted to a money mining scheme like the rest of them. RIP RoE, you'll be sorely missed.-11/17 editHackers paradise -Hacks discovered after 5 minute search on google. https://gfycat.com/disgustingfastantbearSo sad, developers desperately need to address this steam gamers down 60% to a new all time low-12/31 editHoliday event with 7 day login reward system implemented.

"3662,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis Free2Play Battle Royale has won me over. It has snowboarding, hand gliding, mountain climbing and ziplining! You can join a squad of up to 4 players, play duo or solo, pick your spawning point on the grid based map and your package of choice (snowboard/handglider/climber). Your objective is to survive the harsh cold. You will be pushed around the map by a blizzard which will black out certain regions of the map which are randomly chosen so that no match can be predicted beforehand. Eventually, there will be but one small space remaining, and the numbers of players will have dwindled thin to all but the strongest and most evasive survivalists. In these last moments before the blizzard completely engulfs the map, the players have to fight for their seats aboard the escape helicopter. Teams will be at eachother's throats at this point as they all struggle to climb the ladder, praying that they aren't killed before comfortably claiming their seat. One time I had almost claimed my seat and about 1 second before sitting down, I was sniped. It was agonizing, yet the thrill this game delivers me in moments like that are just plain addictive. When you DO finally escape the blizzard, that feeling of accomplishment is definitely there. My fondest moment thus far was when my friend and I had both taken down 2 people each who had us cornered down in a 3 floor building. The entire building was up in smoke, and it was like a Call of Duty Modern Warfare campaign. It was intense, and as soon as I saw the silhouette of a person I unloaded with my Origin 12 shotgun. Their buddy made the mistake of rushing to their aid and I downed him too. We both were the last 2 players standing in the game and we claimed our seats and triumphantly escaped. I've had many more satisfying experiences like this one and I could sit and name more but then this review would be absurdly long, so let me just conclude by saying that the Early Access title Ring of Elysium is a game you will have a blast in, and to me it feels like multiple games in one. If you have friends, play with them, it will only enhance the experience tenfold.I highly recommend Ring of Elysium with a 9/10 and it is one of the few Free2Play games worth playing."",1"

"3669,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewok, so the title doesn't make a lick of sense, not really, and it's basically a carbon copy of PUBG, but it's got snowboarding and nifty graphics that aren't TOO anime-ish. For what should be a generic cashgrab chinese battle royale clone, the weather and mobility twist makes it actually insanely fun. plus, rendering is fantastic - if you're good enough you can snipe someone clear across the map, with the right vantage point. The helicopter thing for four people is pretty pointless, because everyone just camps the helicopter and spams medpacks, so it's still basically last man standing. Other than that, this is a good PUBG knockoff, that i find myself playing more than PUBG itself. Here's to a good game before the inevitable pay to win cash shop that i just FEEL will eventually show up one day."",1"

3674,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewSimilar to PUBG in many ways but it runs better for the most part and your character doesn't feel as heavy. Shooting mechanics and hit detection are great. Escaping by helicopter is a nice twist to the battle royale formula.Free to play but not pay to win. Active developers.,1
3675,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewI see people down voting for some pretty silly stuff. your comp wasnt strong enough to play it and thats the devs fault? you are unhappy with the data collection on a free to play game you didnt pay for? Look i hate battle royale games. imho fortnite sucks and overwatch has people so OP that i fell behind a few months after it started due to my own lack of skill and learning how to combine skills. but 2 types of games i am decent at is fps where shots count and arent randomized like FN and x games. this game perfectly blends both of those. on top of it you launch the game and are dropped into a totally free character customization screen. oh wait i dont have to play 239420395 matches to simply change one little layer of clothing? wow. oh i dont have to pour buckets of cash all over my account to get 1 tiny prop. i can actually bang out enough matches in one night to earn prizes? oh i am not stuck with some generic mongoloid looking cartoon avatar? i can actually reshape the face and body from day 1? Is no one else taking all these customizable aspects into consideration? on top of it its all free! how is anyone angry about all this?if i were to add a few needs for the game i would say text chat would be nice. how else am i suppose to troll someone for getting shot while climbing the ladder to the heli lol?,1
"3676,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewA winter Battle Royale worth tryingBy no means is Ring of Elysium a perfect game, but it is a unique take on the BR genre with the wonderful price of FREE.The BadI'd say the worst part about the game is the sound design. Hardly anything sounds like it's supposed to, or sounds """"cheap"""". But really, mechanically the game is great and the graphics are decent enough.The GoodThe style of the game is excellent. I love the winter ski resort theme and the ability fly, board, or zipline my way around the map. Vehicles and basic loot is plentiful, but the Ymir (storm) is ruthless, and only gives you about a minute before you start losing your toes. Gunplay is solid, and I look forward to what they will add to the game. Overall, a great experience, I highly recommend grabbing a few of your friends and giving it a try."",1"
"3677,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewWay better than Fortnite in every way.Compared to PUBG though? Tough to say. As of writing this, I have only played a few matches, but absolutely loved it so far. Will update later but...It is free. If your pc can run it, just try it out and stop wasting your time reading reviews."",1"
"3678,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewOkay I have been playing this game for a little less than a month and I genuinely enjoyed it. Its mechanics were really nice, animations were smooth and gmaeplay was really fun. I could also play this on my junk computer at good framerates. It was essentially a really well made free-to-play PUBG clone and I loved it. As of late though, not so much. As to what me and a few friends refer to as the """"Fortnite"""" update its not so interesting and just becomes another battle royale game. Previously it was more like PUBG with getting credits for kills and getting boxes for cosmetics. Some friends and I would try to get strategic cosmetics that would help us blend in with the environment and stuff of the sort. With the """"Fortnite"""" update it has introduced 'Seasons' and taken away the customizability. I had a decent looking character and tons of cosmetics, but now they are all gone. They instead added what they did with Fortnite and with the seasons you unlock different looking characters and cosmetics for gameplay and added a paid """"Adventurer's Pass"""" to gain more. I am saddened by this choice from the devs and all the progress I had stripped from me and my friends. This started out as a really nice free to play PUBG clone and is turning into a Fortnite clone."",0"
"3679,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewWorst hacker fest ever, worst than PUBG when it came out.  The amount of aimbots and wall hacks are unreal. Also the DEVs are doing nothing o ban players. They rely on players reporting, but have no real anti-hack system in place. Also the game is buggy as hell. The DEVs working on skins, and a second map. But are doing nothing to fix the bugs. Updates are based around player skins, and stupid stuff like that. But nothing to fix weapons or bugs. Hit a guy 30+ times with a M4, he turns and one shots you with a MP5. Seems like the DEVs never even reseasrched the weapons. The bullet drops are worse than PUBG, and a M4 or AK is just as good as a sniper rifle. Most like it because it allows you to fly off hills or snowboard. But the playablity is crap. Also if you pay for the chick skin/model, you have smaller hit boxes. That is the perk they pushing with pay to win."",0"

"3687,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI've lost all respect now for the publishers, Tencent Games. I regret buying the founder's pack if you're just going to add a season pass and microtransactions. It's a shame too, because I enjoy this game a ton and it has a unique style which add to the fun experience. What was wrong with the crate system before? I loved this game because it wasn't trying to shove payments in your face like other battle royales (Fortnite, PUBG, etc...) but now that's changed. It's become like every other battle royale, a cash cow being milked to death. Although there are no issues I can find with the game, it's a bit frustrating to see the money I put into supporting this game just being used for stupid additions like microtransactions and the scam season passes are. How about a new map? New weapons? But no, there's just more cosmetics. There's no point in a rarity system because everything is given to you if you play the game. I preferred it before when you were awarded credits for doing well in your matches. The ridiculous experience system slows down the rate at which you can unlock new cosmetics, which is very unnappealing to new players, as they can only get 5-6 cosmetics before the season ends. At least you guys made the smart decision to let players keep the cosmetics they already had. It's really saddening to see that this is what I bought the founder's pack for and it's being used to create a system like V-Bucks and COD Points. If you want me to buy your microtransactions, bring back the free case system but allow those who help support the game to get some unique cosmetics. Please, Tencent. I really want to like this game because it had virtue before which was a nice breath of air from all the microtransactions modern games have. Please bring back the old system, but add new packs similar to the founder's pack. I cannot consider buying the battle pass because it's temporary and most of the cosmetics unlockable are recycled from the good ol' days of crates. This update truly scars the good nature that this game once had. The new UI makes things impossible to see in your inventory! Before, I had no issue seeing which gun had which attachment. This is a stupid issue that needs to be resolved, and I've never had this problem with any other game before. That aside, this game is extremely fun to play and very aesthetically pleasing.

"3691,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewIt is a fun game, but I've grown very frustrated waiting for the match making. One night I waited 10 minutes for the match to start, got killed after maybe 5 minutes, then exited and waited for a new match to start. I waited 20 minutes and then got a message that the system timed out. Started waiting again for another match which ended up being an 8 minute wait. So, basically got to play for 5 minutes and waited nearly 40 minutes. They need to change the matchup system. Start matches with less people and less waiting - then it might be fun to play.

The guns sound and feel pretty good although they are way too loud, right now the game can be insanly loud. Need some seperate audio sliders for cars, footsteps, and guns.

"3711,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is literally everything PUBG should have been on launch. This game also has an interesting end-game scenario. Instead of being the last player alive to achieve victory, a Heli flies down and drops a ladder and offers extraction for a total of 4 passengers to escape from the Blizzard. You may think well, that isn't too much fun, players will just camp the ladder up into the heli. That is true, however to keep that playstyle from being abused too much, after a certain amount of time players are revealed on the map forcing a potential extraction or intense  gunfight ( While in PUBG it's whoever can stay prone the longest until you spot a potential kill ). Great idea and for me personally, well executed. It brings some freshness to the genre. Gun play is great too. Also the game is faster than PUBG but it's not over in 10 minutes either it's just the right amount of time. There is so much more but i'll let you all explore this game yourself :) Of Course the game has it's problems too as many do some minor frame drops and lag here and there from what I have experienced but it's not game breaking at all nor a reason not to play it.    *NOTE* I'm comparing this to PUBG because they are so damn similar an many many way's and I feel this game does it all 1,000 times better.

"3714,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI hate to be that guy that compares this to other games, but this game is like Black Ops 4, H1Z1, and PUBG had a child. That child then went to Harvard and got an MBA. Then the child then began to make his way up in the world easily surpasing his predececors and becoming a role model. On the real though, this game is so much more fun than all of the listed games above. I only have 6 hours at the moment but I am quickly racking them up as I was playing this game instead of writing an English 101 essay. Already my favorite game for sure. One thing that could definately change would be some of the physics. It rarely messes you up but sometimes it happens."",1"

This game is fun out of the game not perfect but with a few patches this game will run better then pubg ever dreamed of running,1
"3725,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewWay more polished than pubg, also free. The main thing to know is what differences it has compared to other games in the genre. -You get a starting loadout and there are actual spawn points. You choose your spawn during the the 1 minute setup and you can see where other players are spawning as well. The spawns are well spaced out. This coupled with the starting equipment means that the start of the game is less insane than other BR games. You never feel like you're taken out before you have a chance to play. Even in the inevitable city frenzies, everyone will have a chance to loot a house before it kicks off.-The travesal equipment is the most unique thing about this game. With each loadout you get a gun, a piece of equipment (medkit, extra ammo, ect..), and a mobility item. You have a choice between hang glider, snowboard, and climbing kit. With the hanglider you can leap off of any ledge and not only land safely but get a boost of speed in the direction you were going.  Snowboard allows you to move at vehicle speeds on any downward slope. Finally the climbing gear allows you to climb at special places on the map that other players would have to take the long way around. The climbing gear isn't really as fun, but they counter that by starting you with a shotgun.-Finally you are not fighting till the last man/team standing. You are trying to board a chopper with only 4 seats. However, most of the time it still turns into a last man/team standing game. But the fact that if you can create enough chaos you might be able to climb that ladder without being blasted adds a bit of spice to the end game."",1"
"3726,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewListen up! This game is honestly one of the best 'Battle Royale' games I've ever played!

My only downside to this game is for them just to fix some minor Hit-Regs, and as well as adding a flipping shoulders function.

"3742,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewOkay SO. I have been heavily enjoying this game and I've been doing well if I do say so myself. The game I feel has a lot of potential and I hope that more people do decide to pick up the game and start playing it more than the other standard BR games right now. There are a lot of pros and cons that I can think of for this game but, for the sack of time I am just going to list a few.PROS:1. Class Selection - I think that this is one of my favorite options in the game. Being given the ability to pick between a Paraglider, Mountain Climbing Kit, and a Snowboard along with a free minor weapon setup to start the game up is just wonderful and I think allows everyone to have an equal fighting chance in the beginning of the match.2. Weapon play - Now I won't say that it is as good as PUBG's Weapon Play but, I will say that it is damn good for what it is, and I hope that a lot more people realize this as well. I do think that it needs some adjusting cause I do think that there is some latency between bullets when fighting or just bad hitbox registration because there have been a few not many but, a few times where I have dead centered a sight down on someone not moving and it just miss for no reason at all.3. Lastly, For the Pros Map Size - I feel like this is a very comfortable map size for what has been given to us. Especially with all the class selection options we get that allows us to traverse the map even quicker. CONS:1.  Sound Clarification - I have a really hard time distinguishing where I am being shot from. There were a few instances where I just simple could not figure out where the player was shooting from because I just couldnâ€™t pinpoint the area of which the sound was resonating. There was one major instance where I was being shot from a house a block down but, it sounded like the player was damn near next to me.2. Minor Glitching - I don't know if these are just glitches within the game or just game smoothing issues but, Iâ€™ve had several matches where I died because when I swapped back to a different weapon it showed I was on that weapon selected but, in all reality was a completely different weapon. The last game that I just played I used a Grenade swapped to a shotgun and it showed that my shotgun was selected but, in fact it was still my grenade and I feel like this is something that really needs to be fixed.3. Hitboxes - I feel like the player hitboxes could be worked on just a tiny bit more in my honest opinion, for most I feel like itâ€™s comfortable but, as the game moves forward I would like the hitboxes to become a lot better and the hit registration to become a lot more accurate.That about wraps it up for my review I don't do these very often but, this is a great game and I really believes that it deserves more publicity. I feel like with some content updates and patching that this game could become a gem and become just a popular as Fortnite and PUBG but, thatâ€™s a long stretch and really depends on how hard you all want to work on the game. Overall 7.5/10 "",1"

"3748,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game has so much potential I am looking forward to further development. As the game changes down the road this review will have additions.9/24/2018-Pros-*Free*Longest queue time I have waited is 2 minutes so far*~30 minute rounds (of course this depends on how long you survive) this is helped out by the match limit of 60 players*The different packs to choose from (Glider, Snowboard, ClimbingPick/Rappel)            Glider        ->    you are required to jump from a certain height off the ground, but even with this slight problem in        some situations if you are trying to make a quick getaway you can glide a great distance across the map            Snowboard    -> (aka ski pack[why it's called that we will never know, but maybe they will add the option to use skis        or the snowboard later down the road])            Climbing-pick/Rapel    -> this pack has its situational uses, but when the zone has zipline heaven in it, then you can get around quickly as long as you don't get shot off the line*Most of the vehicles can climb mountain surfaces (as long as you keep control of the vehicle)            -fiat->person-seater, decent speed, slides around a little too much though            -snowmobile        -> double-seater, damn quick, not a great idea to attempt to catch air but can traverse flat /        slightly bumping land quick as can be, the only problem I have seen so far is that at high speeds trying to turn can be a        bit touchy            -Monster truck        -> 4person-seater, a bit on the slow side but can climb hills and mountains well            -Opnbacktruck        -> 4person-seater, decent speed all around            -Cosedbacktruck    -> 4person-seater, decent speed on straightaways            -Doble-Seater 4x4    -> double-seater, damn quick, this speed helps you go across flat points and can catch air            -Bats    -> (haven't used yet, to be reviewed after use) *As a player you can also walk your way up most high rises in the game-Cons-*The way they have region locked EU at launch is disappointing because I am unable to game with some of my m8s*It is EA so of course there are some bugs            - have to run in admin account to be able to start up the game            -after updating NVIDIA driver the game crashes everytime I back out to the main menu from a match*Not being able to free peek like in PUBG is a shame*Vehicles are too bloody loud when riding one its sounds trump most other game sounds unless someone is unloading a        clip into you from 100 meters away or less*Can sprint up normal ladders but cant on the Escape Chopper ladder"",1"
"3749,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewA fun alternative to PUBG/FORTNITE/H1Z1.===[PROS]===- Free- Character Customization (With sliders!)- Decent Graphics / Runs smoothly (Expressly when compared to PUBG)- Decent Gunplay  (Expressly when compared to PUBG)- Better equipment management (The game automatically equips modifications, has easy scope switching, and is relatively quick to gear up, in.)- Travel Perks (Gliding, Skiing & Climbing.)- Nice car physics- Ability to spot/mark ===[CONS]===- Map in Indonesian/Thai version was superior.- Too large of a map means more spread out battles. (Still, faster paced than PUBG.) - A bit awkward (But, not as clunky as PUBG or H1Z1.)- Can't jump when snowboarding - The competitiveness of the game is watered down by the fact a helicopter allows up to 4 players to ''win'', so there is no last man standing showdown.===[7/10]=== (When compared to available Battle Royale games, this one would probably be my top pick until Blackout releases.)"",1"
"3750,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewSolid game, developed very well and has a huge name (Tencent) to back it up. Smoother than Pubg and has features such as challenges both daily and weekly that took pubg years to implement. Looting is quick and I haven't experienced any d-sync. You can pick where you want to land in the map, and even see other player's picks to strategize accordingly. Completely 100% free at the moment, no key required for crates.Interface is somewhat generic but could change in the future.You can snowboard anywhere. You can ride ski lifts across the map and fight in them.Very fun game, a little less hardcore than pubg but in a positive way. Overall it's very enjoyable especially for a free to play early access.Tencent owns 100% of league of legends and 40% of epic games so they hopefully know what they're doing and excited to see how their game turns out."",1"
3751,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewBetter than Expected.1. PUBG is definately better in mechanics2. This game has better FPS and system3. Being free to play and better than H1Z14. Small map = More EncountersButI see it slowly die after PUBG snow map. Nice Game,1
3752,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewOMG This game is lit  this is the god of br games ok h1z1 was good we all now that but i'm so sick of the bloom bs  in you now the game i just love brs and pubg was so bad all and all 10 out of 10 we all need to help keep this game good,1
3753,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis Game is amazing 10/10  Optimization is great! There is sometimes FPS drops but it is a new map compare to the first one so it will need a little more optimization ....I hope they bring back the FIRST MAP!,1
"3754,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFirst off this game is far better than PUBG and FORTNITE. In my personal opinion I find it takes everything wrong that is with PUBG and just fixed it. And I find its better than Fortnite cause honestly Fortnite is just a prime example of a company selling out (Refering to EPIC killing Paragon for Fortnite and then releasing 12mil$ of assets for free on Unreal just to say """"hey we're done with this, we care more about money than our work, so y'all can finish the game) but this review isnt about those two games its about this one. First impressions was superb, I really enjoy the character customization menu and the variety of clothing options you can preview beforehand. Now when I played on the beta, it wasnt a snow map, so this makes me think they will be adding seasonal maps with a variety of packs to go with them. Now the big thing of this game is the pack system which I will give a pro and con of.GliderPros: Best mobility pack ingame in terms of moving speed, you can literally glide across the map, the glock is niceCons: I find you need to start in the mountains for this pack to shine as its limited to where you can use it. Lowest capacity start off (so need to focus on finding a backpack for max carry)SnowboardPros: Can be used almost anywhere uphill and downhill, can cover great downhill distance, medium mobility and medium capacity, can do gnarly jumpsCons: You're limited to certain paths, (it kind of contricts the pro I've mentioned but its a little harder to explain, you would have to see for yourself)Rock Climbing Kit (My personal fav)Pros: Can use ice axes to quickly skim up and down slopes, max starting capacity, the shotgun is decent, zipline is motor driven so can be used up and down, can jump off early at your own risk if you see incoming threats, can cover long distances fastCons: I find the rock climbing itself is very linear and there arent as many rock paths as ziplines, zip posts can be easily camped.Now thats out of the way I want to give more insight on the game, it has hit markers, it has bullet drop, I find the guns are balanced except for the fact that hip firing is so useless I wouldnt recommend it. The way you all spawn in the map is different than the traditional """"bus/plane"""" the map is divided by what i can roughly estimate a 30x30 grid (Its a guestimate I havent actually counted) and players can choose which square they want to go, it lights up to signify its taken, so can choose to fight right off the bat or dont. The loot is not scarce at all, you will always find something somewhere, the 3 guns you can have I find is a little overkill but Im not complaining. All and all for an early access game and for me to pump out this much information in the 3 odd hours I played is just very entertaining. This is my first review of any game. Please feel free to share your thoughts, why you agree or disagree with the points i've made. P.S to the devs: Please look into the idea of making Rock climbing kits a permanent thing, it is so useful and I find it should be essential, but so far love the game, can't wait to see whats in store and potential console port. Cheers!"",1"
3755,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewMy steam controller is not working with this game I have never had this problem... Can anyone assist me dont get me wrong I love my K and M but for certain games I would enjoy the ability to use controller. THANKS IN ADVANCE...,1
"3756,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFeels very Different from other Battle Royale games but i think thats honestly a good thing, i like the differences in this game and the starting packs were a interesting concept.

"3758,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewgood game , a little bugs in cliffs and mountains , ak-47s dissapear on the ground , cant change hair colour and no EU server , it has much to improve and very similar to pubg mobile."",1"
3759,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewBefore starting this review lets keep in mind it is Early Access and label some of the bugs I have encountered.Bug 1: While going down certain slopes at high speeds while on the snowboard you can freeze and start lagging in place.Bug 2: While trying to perform a weapon swap and then immediately doing another action your weapon won't actually switch.Bug 3: Vehicles moving at high speeds will glitch and teleport on your side of view compared to the smooth movement of the player actually driving.Now onto the good side of the game1. The game is fairly simple to grasp and understand2. The game itself offers a casual and competitive hairstyle to approach3. You are able to physically choose your spawn location than wasting about two minutes sky diving and praying you pick up a weapon firstAnd now the bad side1. Since the circle gives your a freeze effect on your screen and tints the ring a blue hue it can be fairly difficult to cope with players camping the outside of the storm2. Since bullet drop doesn't seem to exist (just from what I've seen it might be a slight bullet drop) trying to avoid gunfire while in the open really doesn't work at all3. Directional sounds in the game are alright for now but don't expect a refined and top of the line sound functionAll in all if you want a fun and casual battle royal that isn't Super competitive (Pubg) or inconsistent Rng based (Fortnite) this game is definitely a good choice.,1
3760,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewPretty good game. Same concept as Pubg and Fortnite. It's very high quality game with good mechanics and controls. And it's free. Hopefully the developers behind this game will keep on updating it and not make it a pay to win game. Very solid game.,1
"3761,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewHighest quality Early Release BR Style game I've played to date.Pros:-Attachments Auto Attach-Weapons Auto Reload and Start on Auto-Two Scopes/Sights per Weapon-3 Primary Weapon slots-Can Ping on map to show teammates where to shot/go-Has vaulting day 1-Very solid gunplay-Excellent Hit Registration-Pick your starting kit (snowboard, Rock Climbing kit, or Hanglider)-Pick your starting area (about 100 grid squares are shown, ddand you can see where other people are spawning)-Beautiful map/graphics-Instead of last player alive, it's a race to """"extract"""" via a helicopter-Insane character customization (needs more hair options)Cons:-Poor sound optimization-Guns don't sound great-60 player lobbies-Only one map (they had a different map during Beta, that in my opinion was better)Final Conclusion:The game feels really solid, as well as, the network infrastructure. The vehicles need some work, as the handling doesn't quite seem realistic. The game is very similar to your typical BR, but with a lot of quality of life enhancements. Once they bring back to original Beta map I'll be a little more excited.I have about 400+ hours on PUBG and quit playing it months ago. Absolutely loved the game, just got bored of it. Played some Fortnite, but hated the building. I'll be playing this one for a good bit, it feels like an optimized version of PUBG, but more """"arcadey."""""",1"
"3762,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewLove that this is back earlier than I thought it would be.  I loved it before when it was on Garena.  The updates and new maps are great.  Am really liking the new features, the starter packs and choosing your start point.  Glad to see you can actually use a ladder now.  Totally recommend this to anyone that likesd a shooter game.  Best od all, it's free.  Buy the DLC if you like it and support the developers."",1"
3763,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewLove this game.Love the snowboard and the hang glider which make it much more thrill to move around.Enjoy the scenery of this snow mountain. Plz do more optimization on fullscreen. Sometimes get below 60 fps when moving.,1

"3765,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFor a free early access  game, it's good. It looks and feels a bit like a mobile version since the graphics aren't super polished and the frames are lower than most other BR's. That being said, there's plenty to do and the map itself is unique and fun to play. Give it a try if you're tired of the other games out"",1"
"3766,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI am just loving it. First of all Kudos to Tencent Games to make a true competitior of PUBG. Some places it is really better than PUBG. Take the SKI for instance. It gives you nice mobility in the time of Ymir. The weapon recoils are quite managable. It has beautiful terrain.  AND I MUST TALK ABOUT THE PLAYER ROTATION WHILE PRONE. IT IS SO REALISTIC. No other third person game has such rotation. I will not complain about Spawn. Everything has a unique flavor. PUBG has given air-drop that doesn't mean it has to follow that too. I love the realistic zone-shortening by the freezing effect. It is quite belivable. I have already recommended this game for DUO and SQUAD for some of my friends, and I also like to do some more marketting about this game. And I am also willing to help developers with some suggestion if they are open to take that."",1"
"3767,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewVery fun game, the framerate and ease of life is missing from this but whats there is worth playing. The way you move around the enviroment makes the game very enjoyable compared to other battleroyale games."",1"
"3768,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFor a F2P Battle Royale, this has a surprising amount of polish and is surprisingly fun.Before getting into the game itself, you have an indepth character customization system that allows you to very slightly change the way your character looks. Unfortunately, you can't make your character look not asian which is a bit disappointing. You also have cosmetics which you can unlock using crates that you can purchase PUBG style without the need for keys. These crates can be purchased with the credits you earn by playing the game.Let me say that this is one of the more fun oriented Battle Royale games. Aside from your standard Battle Royale fare, you can also do any of the following"
"3769,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewWith 2k+ Hours on the Launcher before steam release.THINGS THAT NEED A CHANGE > Ymir zone timer too long. 5min per zone is crazy. 60 player lobbies shouldnt take 40min to play a full game. Maximize players to 80. Add old map to the rotation. New snow map sucks.Pros: Feels great, Smooth, Guns are well balanced, Vehicles are less clunky now. Visuals are clean. (Not a fan of snow due to bright white). Cons: Matches take too long. 40+min of camping till last 5min zone push. Snipers are too strong still. And of course the occasional foreigner in NA servers who screams in another language.Launcher pre steam release rating: 8/10Steam Release rating: 6.5/10 (Due to match times and max players)These are my opinions but they are facts and you know it.

"3773,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewRing of Elysium is everything PUBG wishes it could be. From the moment it entered Beta on Garena it was more polished than PUBG was 6 months into early access and quickly surpassed PUBG in its current state. Extremely smooth gameplay and quality of life features such as allowing 2 scopes on each gun, attachments auto equip to your weapon, simplified leaning system, and mobility kits (glider/snowboard/ice ax) make this game a blast to play. I played through all the Beta access periods and Tencent has shown great dedication to making a quality product. I just hope they make the old map available at some point. This one is ok but the old one was really good."",1"
"3774,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI know many people have wrote that this game has bitcoin mining stuff in it or stuff like maleware but don't believe that. As for the premissions you can literally disable all the access RoE tries to get by going to the launcher -> right click -> properities -> security -> edit premissions and deny everything. Been playing this game long enough to tell that it's clean and I checked it with antivirus scan and it's clean. I beleive that most of these negative reviews are made by rival battle royale games. I wouldn't be surprised if pubg players did that just so that it affects the game.Also, as of now, there are no EU servers so when you download the game it will ask you if you're from EU and a bunch of other countries, say """"No"""" and you will get access to the game. If you say Yes you will have to close the game and reopen it and the same question will popup. say no to that.As for the actual game play, It's not bad at all, fun but there are few things that they need to work on (which they are) and I believe in the matter of few months this game will be better than pubg. Would be sick if they could optimize this game better because the Fps drops in the Ice map are insane sometimes."",1"

I know most FPS players and general gamers are getting sick of BR after BR being announced and coming out, but this game is not better than any other its in a league of its own. I have played more than 70 hours of ROE and I have never had more fun with my friends than in this game. Thank you Tencent Games for ROE and for bringing it to us so we can enjoy it too."",1"

"3779,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAppeal to the developers.What happened to optimizing the game? On my PC (GTX 1050ti, i5-3330 3.2 GHz, 8Gb RAM) the game goes on low settings 40-50 fps and periodically freezes. Before the release on Steam everything was great on high settings 60-100 fps. And so the game is very good. P.S. Pardon my bad English."",1"
"3780,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI could play this game for hours just snowboarding down mountains. Throw in the fact that it feels less sluggish, better optimized and faster paced than PUBG...well, i'm sold. My only major gripe is that at longer ranges (in which a sniper should still be effective) you will see players stutter along their path rather than a smooth running motion. This makes longer range battles a headache (when this occurs). If they can polish this up I will be 100% satisfied with this game. The hours of fun its brought me so far has reignited my love for this genre and opened my eyes to the mediocrity we've settled with for far too long. RIP PUBG."",1"
"3781,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewLet me start with what i like, i LOVE the concept for using the tools like the climbing pick, glider and snowboard, its super fun to walk around the map loot things and just look, its a super pretty game, now heres the kicker, the gun play is TERRIBLE, ive played 2 matches one solo and one squad and both games ended with me or my squad about 10 or 15 feet away from enemies and just kinda spraying around like crazy until someone dies. So sadly, i dont see any competitive nature in the future of this game, this is something i would honestly play with some buddys to just mess around inEDIT: After playing a bit more with friends, its for sure something that is different, and takes some time to get used to, the aim may seem a bit off at first, once you really customize it, it will feel better.

By that I mean it's a big map with a lot of mounatains and open space-Seems to be an FPS cap, around 60-70 frames, hope that's removed soonOverall:-I'm a big fan of pubg and this game is like an easier, more optimized, slightly faster paced, potentially more fun, version of it. From choosing a loadout and your spawn point in the beggining to the oh-so-sweet chopper evac at the end, it's a fun and interesting ride.

"3800,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewMostly a well made game. Played almost 13 hours at the time of this review however please note this game has only had 2 updates so far. One of the first things I really liked about this game was the variety of weapons as well as the accesories you can find stranded across the map. If I can, I always opt for an SMG (Either MP5 or Vector) as well as an Assault Rifle and a Sniper. The reason I opt for an SMG over a Shotgun is I often find a Shotgun can take too many shots to kill when compared to an SMG. So in my opinion the shotgun needs some buffs to make it a viable choice. The smg also has a vast range of accesories which is something I wish the shotguns had. Like any normal player I also go for an Assault rifle for distanced situations and a sniper is also handy as well. One thing which always annoyed me was I often ran out of carry weight for my inventory and I had to drop items. I am not saying this is a bad thing, it is good for a game to implement a limited inventory however there is no way that I know of to split ammo supplies. This means you have to drop the entirety of the ammo and is something I wish differed. Other than that, the weapons are well thought out and the inventory system works (minus a few hiccups). The classes on offer are versatile, you can sacrfice mobility for carry weight or vice versa if you wish. However I don't see any other reason to go with another class other than the snowboard. It is much more mobile than the others and in my opinion a heck of a load more entertaining. You can also customise your character (I have been quite lucky with my crates) but I think limited time clothing with difficult ways of achieving would give the game more playability. Also 20 credits to change your face is an acceptable amount (maybe too cheap?) as you can easily earn it in one game. In terms of the game experience I have found it is relatively bug free. Currently I am playing on a 2400g so not the highest end system but it is still playable. My friend and I have enjoyed the experience however he ran into a bug where he spawned on the map before the game started and the game was noticeably laggy afterwards (fixed with a restart). Another note is when hopping into the modified volkswagon there is a major drop in frames likely from all the snow it tears up. So it forces me to avoid that vehicle. All the other vehicles work well which is a good sign. Lastly just as I spawn in I see the insides of my character's head (eyes, mouth, ears) for a split second and I am still recovering from the PTSD that has caused me. Other than those minor bugs the game is relatively well constructed.Ring of Elysium is a fun game overall, you die from other players quite fast so you always want the upper hand. This is a good thing too"
3801,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis is one of the best free to play games I have ever played. I have been playing this game non stop when i have the chance 2. highly rate this game and it was well worth $3 to back these devs they are doing a grate job!!!,1
"3802,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game honestly addresses some of my biggest problems with the battle royale genre. The spawn system instead of parachuting is great. Nothing I hated more than losing early in PUBG because someone can parachute slightly better than me, and is better at RNG than me and finds a gun while I don't. Not to mention, spawning with a gun in the game is awesome. It doesn't give you an amazing chance, but you have some chance with it...plus the loot is pretty great in this game, so I can focus more on traveling and action that looting house after house after house after house hoping I finally get a gun that doesn't suck.I hope this game sticks around for a while to come. It's what I was hoping Call of Duty was going to be."",1"
"3803,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game has its own vibe. Not just a copy of pubg, fornite, etc. The addition to snowboarding, ziplining, gliding, etc adds its very own polish to things. Gun fights keep you on your toes. You dont just drop in 1 shot, the fights feel much more entertaining. The graphics are really easy on the eyes and seem very smooth. Overall this is the best early access game ive ever played. On top of it.. its free?! Win, win. Give it a try, you will love it."",1"
"3804,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewSo far, this game is very promising. Very unique.

"3808,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewfunny to think that a free to play can be so much more responsive, pretty (graphically speaking), and better developed all around than a game like pubg (which might not be saying much considering pubg is a piece of garbage).

XD and they actually have a working vaulting system before full release! in my honest opinion this is the best free to play battle royale out there you could want. its PUBG but better the devs just have a lot of work to do to make this game truly remarkable. gun play is on point and they have a decent selection of weaponry the only downside to this game so far is i think that the loot system needs to be toned down i mean i can walk in one house and come out fully looted so it need to be turned down in my honest opinion other than that its great just need polishing"",1"
"3813,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThe only other BR I have enjoyed besides Realm Royale before the developer team absolutely butchered it.It feels like a more polished and functional PUBG, but I will refrain from calling it a PUBG killer.Outside of the quirky but enjoyable movement system with snowboards and hang gliders (no one uses the rock climb ability), it is essentially what Bluehole pictures PUBG could be once it is truly finished. Everything just works, there is no clunkiness or choppyness - vaulting over obstacles won't leave you jumping flat against a wall for 3 hops before a vault triggers. Gun play is night and day difference compared to PUBG, where sometimes you feel like your bullets disappear in the air. It just plays and FEELS like a great shooter, which is something that has been lacking in the BR genre. This will definitely remain my main game until CoD Blackout releases, and then it will be my alterate BR experience. Hopefully more and more people will give the game a chance despite the publisher, I was hesitant to, but every single quirk and original feature this game has grows on you quickly and you come to enjoy the game for what it is and not what it may become, unlike every other BR in existence."",1"

"3819,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewPretty good game so far, I love that you get to spawn immediatly where you want. I love the 3 classes that you can use in a variety of ways to out play other players. So far the only down fall is just the norm for an early access game, car wheels are transparent until you get up close. The driving, however, is awkward and seems slow to react. Those are the only issues I have run across, so far. I really like how fast you get into games, and how well the loot is spread out. Can't wait to see how this turns out."",1"
"3820,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI've only played a couple of battle royales, but this one feels much better by far.It's not goofy or cartoony. The environment is great, and the weather changes really add a challenging dynamic that changes strategy and difficulty of each match.There's some minor clipping and display issues: I saw someone sneak up on me because of a graphics glitch, and I fatally fell down a gradual slope that should have been easily walkable.The developers seem to really be invovlved and address issues raised, and I'm glad they're taking this seriously and not treating it as P2W or a whacky-cosmetic-cashgrab."",1"
"3821,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFor starters, let me point out this is a FREE game and you know honestly it doesn't feel like it not in the sense that its pay to win but for the fact that I myself would've paid money for the game (hense why I bought the founder upgrade to support these devs!) Players have to escape an astonishing disaster in Ring of Elysium, a battle royale shooter developed by Tencent Games that adds on to what Playerunkowns and other battle royale games but with a twist of winter! There is three classes to chose from which change gameplay(Snowboard, Glider or Ice Picks/Rappel). They say early access is going for 3-6 months but we'll see about that. Im a new fan of these devs so Im not 100% sure what to expect, I can just hope. There is cons like the sound at certain times can be extremely annoying, driving collisions seem to be a little too flaily and no impact, and there is some desync on players. But I mean, for a FREE game that got released yesterday in early access, I'd say this is polished enough to stay alive further upon developement.So far, enjoying this game and recommend it, not like your wasting your money here!

"3826,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access Review My First """"TryHard"""" Review  Because This Game Deserves It! Firstly, I'm a hardcore game hopper, because I find flaws fast that drive me away from the game. A lot of games to date push out a title that is there just to make quick money and lacks creativity, replayability, and polished gameplay mechanics. There are also those games that go so hard into realism that it makes a """"game"""" overwhelming and tedious. Luckily for those interested in a new Battle Royal, this is not the case! Off the start, I was AMAZED by the character customization. It is so innovated and gorgeous, followed by the music tracks in the background, are outstanding. It actually pumps you up! Lets get down to the brass tax.PROSGraphicsCreativityMusicCustomizationSmooth GameplayShooting down someone that is trying to escape, when there are plenty of seats on the chopper to evacuate the remaining players!!!The evacuation mechanic itself is really an awesome ending to the match, not just """"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."""" Its called trying NUBG..It is not overly complex, and the attachments auto-install is super nice and smoothWhen prone, (and this is a goodin') your character actually swivels his/her body, in order to do a 360 and turns on their @$$ in order to face 180. Tired of getting that ankle caught on a twig in NUBG?

(Great job Devs!)A true FREE TO PLAYCONSThere are graphical detials that still need to be polished, such as the structures, I.E. doors.Lack of graphical customization in settings (will hinder amount of players able to play the game with potatoe PCs)Still being developed, so bugs are eventually going to work themselves to the surface (Bound to happen)People are still playing Fartnite and NUBG, and not this yetLookout BR genre, we have found an instant crowd favorite!

"3834,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewPersonally, I don't believe that there is any malware in the game, but I don't know too much about the issue so we'll set that aside. Ring of Elysium is definitely worth trying out if you're a fan of battle royales or if you're looking for a PUBG alternative. The game itself is similar to PUBG (considering that Tencent, the company that makes this game, also makes PUBG mobile, this is no surprise). There is a certain lack of polish in the game (gunplay can use some work [imo assault rifles could use a little tweaking], endgame needs reworking, bullets don't penetrate certain objects that they should), but considering that the game is in early access, this is to be expected. However, considering how well the developers are communicating with the community (several of them are active on the official subreddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/RingofElysium_tencent/], and seem receptive to feedback), I have no doubt that the various aformentioned issues will be fixed sooner or later.

"3835,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAlready put 13 hours into this game and I say for sure that I enjoy this a lot more than PUBG.

"3839,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is one of the best games I've played on steam. I love the specialties with the different classes and how diverse each match is. You never know what to expect. I've played a few matches, I won once and it is very satasfying. Totally recommend."",1"
"3840,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is, as a lot of people put it, PUBG but better in literally every way.  This review will mostly compare it to PUBG, sol people who already play it and other games like Fortnite/H1Z1 can know exactly how this is better and what's different/new to expect that you won't find in other battle royales. Note that I've only got a few hours of game time but I've got dozens more on the beta summer map. Pros:- It's free, you have literally zero excuse not to at least try it- Weapons are better, attachments go onto your guns automatically and should you change weapons, the old attachments will automatically transfer to the new ones. More balance, no more instakill shotgunning people across the map.- Only one map so far but it'll soon beat PUBG in this as well with 2 other maps planned, one most likely being the """"old"""" beta map. Everyone complaining about the new map should understand that the old one will come back when it's ready.- New """"Classes"""" for the winter map: Snowboarder can travel quickly downhill, glider can travel far distances quickly, and rock climber can climb mountains and travel around rather easily through predetermined ziplines that go both uphill and downhill. I imagine summer map and map 3 will have their own classes as well.- Spawn points. Rather than jumping out of a plane, you pick exactly which point on the map you wish to spawn at and are teleported there instantly at the start of the match. This also offers you an opportunity to know where everyone else spawns, and how worried to be about player activity in your spawn area. You can spawn away from everyone else for worry-free farming, or drop straight into a hot zone and rush the best loot.- Rather than a """"Barrier"""" of some sort that closes in slowly in pretty much every other BR, this time (At least on winter map) the permafrost replaces a barrier, and it shows up instantly when the timer goes to 0. The frost will progressively hurt more as the temperatures drop.- The winning condition. Once the frost has almost envelopped the entire map, a rescue helicopter swoops in to rescue up to 4 individual survivors, or an entire 4 man squad. Anyone who makes it to the chopper to get those four seats wins, and by this point there's usually 8-10 people left so it's quite a battle to climb on without someone shooting you. This does, however, allow for more than one winner in almost every case. Some people will like this mechanic, some will not, but it's original and a good concept.- All the big cities have """"lore"""" in almost every second house in the form of newspapers and journals, giving you a little insight into the map itself when you've got some free explore time. Cons: What are those? Besides some bug fixing, this game has none. Graphics are nice, music is nice, gameplay is nice, it's all around a solid game that teabags every other BR on the market. The only real con is that every other BR game is going to have to adopt a f2p model or go extinct thanks to this jewel appearing at the small price of 0$ for everyone.Other thoughts: The ice pick class is just straight up OP, you have absolutely no reason to pick the other two classes when this class exists. Not only do you have increased carry capacity, but your mobility is insane. You also don't need to be at the top of a hill to use this class, as ziplines go both ways and are all over the place. My suggestion to the devs would be to either make ziplines usable by all classes, or make ice picks given to everyone with the other two as extra choices. Alternatively, for balance you can add more ski-lifts and only allow snowboarder class to use them. I can't think of a way to balance glider, as it's only really good for making one trip down a mountain to escape the frost and then it's useless for the rest of the game. Jumping off a 5 story building will get you 50 feet, you absolutely have to be at the top of a mountain to get any use out of it which also limits your potential strategic spawn locations. "",1"

3845,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis latest update is the worst patch I've ever seen for this game. This pass idea is horrid. Just create a shop + curreny like League of legends. No need to remove normal crates with basic items and tiny chances at higher rarity items. In the shop you can put all items + some shop only ones that are more special or something.I will not put any more money into this game in this state and will more than likely play something else going forward.,0
"3846,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewBetter than PUBG, for sure. Much better game engine, more smooth, prettier. Combat feels good. Fresh, shiny, new. And free.

Haven't encounterd any cheaters yet but only time will tell. Also yes, there are bugs, yes there are glitches, but it early access so there are bound to be broken things that will hopefully get fixed. Nothing to outrageous to complain about so far."",1"

"3849,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewRight i want to put this out there as im not the biggest fan of BR games and i seen this an thought oh god sake not another one!That said, I would happly pay for this game!  it feels like an AAA game and feels like a full release already!The graphics are really nice,  The gameplay is great,  The guns  / hit boxes work!   Havnt really come accross any bugs / flaws other than the odd graphical glitch. There is also challenges to do whilst in match, so it does feel like your just there to kill players etc.There is a nice feature where instead of been the last one alive to win, You and upto 3 others (4) have to evac on a heli.You can also choose between a snowboard / climbing axe , zip wire / glider.

This game will succeed with or without your bad reviews."",1"
3854,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewJust played my first game. Already very cool and nostalgic gameplay from old COD games. This game already has content that took rival Royale games a year at least to implement. I hope to see good updates and a good player base for this game. Would highly recommend.,1
"3855,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI much prefer this game to PUBG. I think PUBG has a bit of an identity issue and wants to be everything. This game balances it out quite nice and the 3 different forms of movement really add to the overall pacing of the game. My only issue with this game is the combat, the refresh rate, and the grappling movement option. Combat seems a bit stiff and favors camping. I know camping is inevitable, but maybe add a gas/molotov grenade to flush people out or something. Leaning should always be a key bind action if implemented. Refresh/tick rate of the game seems a bit off. On my screen I shot dead on, but died to a head shot a second later. It's always going to be an issue with battle royale games sure, but it's still a legitimate claim if they want to be competitive or have a public k/d win/loss statisitics. The Grappling movement option is severely limited to the predetermined routes on the map and the rock climbing is next to useless and extremely slow. A glider player could just get ahead of the grappling player and wait for them to show up to the next point and shoot them or the grappler could risk taking a fall and dying or attempt to go back up the rappeling line, which is extremely slow to turn around. They should greatly reduce fall damage for grapplers or add a parachute or increase the speed of the grappling movement and landing. Aslo, something can be said about the game ending heli, but I don't have a solution for that yet. Overall 7/10"",1"
3856,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewJust put away everything you think you know about battle royale games or yourself even. Just play it and give it a shot without comparing it to any other game and you might have a better experience than others.,1
"3857,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewdifferent twist to a b.r. besides fortnite or pubgeezy. 3 equipment sets, glider, snowboard and climbing gear. all snow based and no jumping from a plane, kinda cool you can move your spawn before the start. it shows everyones spawn radius before start also. and free to play. the evacuation is cool. 4 seats waiting."",1"

"3859,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewBest Battle Royale game I've played so far - Finally a fresh take on the gamemode i like very much. Brings me sooooo much fun and its very well optimized. No major bugs, no annoying mechanics - just simple and fun game. And its free!"",1"
"3860,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access Review1. Much better to have algrothm for auto equip the pick up weapon parts.2. Compare to circle, the pologon is harder to determine if player is in the safe zone or not.3. Very interesting reflection algrothme concept for water, metal and floor."",1"
"3861,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewDon't let the opening video mislead you- this game is not PUBG with a bunch of gimmicks. If anything, it is what PUBG was meant to be from the beginning. I was originally skeptical of the different loadouts (snowboard, climber, and hang glider) but they add a new level of gameplay that I very much enjoy.Graphics are pretty good, although options are somewhat limited. The game is new, so I imagine this will change, and the optimization will hopefully improve, but the combat and movement generally feels smooth and fair. The plot still makes no sense, but the game is fun, with extra mechanics at the end (the helicopter), and a buddy or two will always help. The only issues I have with the game are the doors, vehicles, and sound. Doors tend to have trippy visual effects in which I myself holding 8 blurry guns if I look closely. Vehicles almost look like they tear a little bit, something with the materials or reflection or something. The last issue I mentioned was the audio. Depth is hard to perceive, and I can generally hear things from further away than should be normal, causing me to think someone 50 yards away is around a corner sometimes.Overall, great game that will sadly be overshadowed by blackout."",1"

"3871,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewIt is a fairly good battle royale game. it runs well and there are only a few bugs in this beta. I don't feel as if there is a lag playing the game like I do in pubg. I would love to see more and get more maps! I would like to offer Tenecent some suggestions that I hope they implement. The auto lean is a pain. I would rather control leaning around corners or leaning any time. There isn't any sway in ADS. The scopes do not feel like they are zooming in much. There is barely a difference between a 2X and a 4X scope. Please allow us to switch shoulders when aming in third person. More destructable environments if possible. Tires on cars, gates etc.  The sound is lackluster so improving the sounds of doors, footsepts and some gunfire would be awesome!"",1"
"3872,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewOverall I would recommend this game. I am a girl who does not game often but when I do I like to play games that have some sort of strategy, ability to alter your apperance and a time limit. I get bored doing quests and builiding up levels for what? who knows? This game however has a few fun aspects  (1) there is a time limit, you are dropped in remote locations to gather weapons and loot while Ymir a blue cold frost spreads, if you get caught in the cold it harms your health, this is a quick achievalbe goal that tests your skill when you get """"caught up"""", such as in a vehicle ambused in town by an opposing team,50 players in the game, in teams of 1,2 and 4(2) there are 3 ways to quickly transport in game, ziplines, hand gliders and snowboards, giving each game it's own unique round a different strategic approach(3) your apperance is somewhat customizable with various outfits and makeup to choose from, i admit i change my outfit before every game(4) you can carry multiple weapons, from snipers, to shotgons, AR's and SMG's with mutliple scope attahments(5) the loading time isn't that long, i've waited mabye 3 minutes tops, just enough time to go get a snack or run to the bathroom(6) the end goal is to board a helicopter before the whole places freezes and its fun at the end, i end up screaming in entertainment even if i don't win(7) it IS winnableThings i would change:(1) ability to shoot when downed waiting to be revived(2)sensitivity on scopes and camera in general, i took mine down to 15-20 and prefer it over the preset 50(3) the snow seen makes its really easy to spot people, but there are just enough rocks, trees and hiding spots to get to the end of game(4) upgraded vests and helmets, sometimes they protect me sometimes i am like """"i shot this guy in the head 3 times and he kills me with one shot from a pistol"""" aww hellll nahhhh. OVERAL, RECOMMEND!!! YES"",1"
"3873,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI will start by saying I have played this game before it was out on steam. I've enjoyed this game as well as PUBG.I am a big fan of both. They both have their differences but I like the end play of this one better. It is a huge thrill having to climb up the ladder and hope you strategize correctly to not get shot to board safely. The storm is also a different twist making it more random then a circle within a circle. You have to play different to stay infront of the storm but also how you move within the map. Instead of a parachuting from plane to pick your location you pick before the game starts. You also no longer look for backpacks but choose your mobility perk at the start when choosing your location which decides how much you can carry. a Glider can carry the least but move the fastest in the map. Hiking/Rappelling which moves slow through the map but can carry the most. Sense the map is all snow the last mobility perk is a snowboard.  Your carry limit is in between the other two.. There is also ski lifts  through out the map.The new update improved weapons, movement and all around smoothness of the game. I believe the biggest loss with the new update is the way you upgrade or customize your characters/equipment. It's not as easy as using experience from your games played. Free game for me so I am not worried about that just the action with friends and the game playOver all the the game is awesome. Action packed, Best played with mic, friends and scopes.Add me Ramitinashol"",1"
"3874,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAlmost 10hrs in, and it feels so damn good. Pros:- Fast response time with key inputs.- Smooth shooting mechanics.- Clean Map design.- Great Weapon design. It's easy to see the differences between the weaponry.- Cool looking vehicles.- Balanced class system. No real advantage in choosing a class over another, just a different moving ability with different inventory space.- End-Game really engaging and different from other BRs.Cons:- Optimization could be better. On a 1080 and i7 6700 the game struggles to keep 60FPS.- Pickaxe class could use a little boost in speed when climbing a rock wall. Climbing makes you slow and vulnerable.- 3D sound design could be improved. Sometimes it's hard to tell where you're getting shot from.8/10 so far. Cons are not big enough to penalize the game. Ring of Elysium is fully enjoyable, fun and can be also competitive. I recommend it, and the price tag of ZERO MONEY makes it easy to be accessed by everybody!"",1"

"3876,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI've been playing this game for months (via garena) and it just keeps getting better and better. Obviously there will be a lot of comparisions to PUBG, but I personally feel like there's more focus on fun gameplay rather than pure shooting mechanics.  Hopefully tencent will introduce another map with the same fun gameplay elements soon.It's also worth noting that they continue to refine gameplay here in Early Access as well as on the original client, so I'm optimistic this game will continue to improve.  With that said, it's defintely worth a try."",1"
"3877,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI have only played a few hours of this game so far.From what i can tell the game needs a little work with rendering of people in cars and snowboards when moving! the fps is ok but i would expect to get better fps with Gforce titan cards.Whats great.The gameplay seems on par with pubg/h1z1 if they had a roudy child!Looting and auto attach of items picked up makes it smoother in the first few mins to better enguage other players faster.shooting and hit registering are dead on, no desynce that i can see yet.the med system in this game is great! no boosts or special meds to get back up to full hpThe Strategy map instead of a lobby is awesome, its by far the worse part of other games in my opinion but some may like it.Spawning in at the selected point is awesome as well, no glitching and taking fall damage, no making sure to hit 234kph to hit the ground faster than the guy next to you just for you to hit the invisible skybox and get turned in mid air!all in all this game needs some work, but right off the bat if the company can keep up with the demands of its player base and smooth some things out, it has great potential for the first day of EA."",1"
"3878,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewWhile this game is """"just another BR"""" I find that its oretty addictive. The different classes are way different than any other BR. The Map is very large and is 100% traversable (albiet not within a single game), and teh graphivs are amazing for something thats free to play. The gameplay its a bit laggy (something thats pretty easy to fic relatibely speaking) and the looting system is very noob friendly. It's a very great game, that I can only see getting better as it recieves more updates.In all, as it stands now, 8.75/10 would recommend."",1"

THINK about the decisions you make ROE, make a community forum or something to help push decisions. You're sitting on a gold mine but choose not to strike gold. Why are the graphics the same no matter what if your run max and low. make a potato graphic for people who cant even shoot the gun. Last update was not great for this game."",0"
"3880,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAlright so this game started off as kinda like a PUBG ripoff but with its own unique twist and not just some blatant copy. As time grew on it started to establish itself as a new and different battle royale but yet retaining the core fundemental gameplay as all the others. It forced you to be tactical and a quick mover without getting caught up in looting while also looting enough so you good stand a chance in a firefight. I love this game for its unique twist on the battle royale genre where most games are almost exact copies of each other. I've never really been one to have a preference over Fortnite or PUBG. I enjoyed both and played them quite a bit (at least 40 hours for each). I didn't neccesarily like how noticeable it was that this game beneath all its beauty was just another PUBG copy. It wasn't enough to make me leave just enough to make me a little irritated but you could the same to any battle royale game that out after PUBG or Fortnite or even H1Z1. But it was the point when the """"BATTLE PASS"""" oh sorry I meant the """"ADVENTURE'S PASS"""". Again its kinda bound to happen to any battle royale game but I dont like how it borrows stuff from games and sorta turns it into its own, the graphics reminded me of Pubg but seriously the new player skins and the Pass just kinda seem like a total ripoff of fortnite. Now it wont stop me from playing it and I hope it wont stop you from playing either but its just something to be aware of. Its a good game and otherwise a great Battle Royale Game"",1"
"3881,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFirst review, hope it help's someone, First and foremost gotta start with, GOD DAMN, for a free BR, GOD DAMN! this game is good. Pros: the map's size in relation to characters is almost just 2 perfect that allows for encounters after looting a city quite fast, especially if you have a vehicle. The guns don't bloom...that's a really good pro BTW quite consistent looting quite original way of landing mechanic graphics are quite good, not 2 much not 2 little, the IP is really consistent through out the game. The ending is quite original and brings about interesting gameplay the whole loadout management is also good I personally didn't encounter any bug or lagg and many more prosCons: Vehicles turn out in fire 2 fast for the shots that they take, they should have a pin point where shooting will cause the vehicle to explode or go out in fire. Shotguns are not viable at all. Glider loadout is kinda 2 strong sniping people swimming doesn't do dmg...I think corner peaking could use some changes.Overall a REALLY good BR personally I have literally been enjoying alot, Alot of potential here.

"3884,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewBest free to play battle royale on steam without a doubt! Here I'll list some great features about the game that make it so good. Without listing the obvious ofcourse.- Not a walking simulator (the game offers other machenics to cross the map that other battle royales don't offer).- Different twist on the start and ending of the game that make this game play different, but very familair.- Currently the game has a snow map which is atleast uncommon for battle royales.- Active devs! (sometimes multiple updates per week)- Has a grid system for the storm like Radicle Heights (R.I.P.) had.- Guns will show snow and your vision will receive a frozen affect when you are in the storm- Multiple teams/players can win a matchNow some things I dislike about the game.- The game has an auto-lean system. Either make it an option to manually lean corners or get rid of it.- Suppressors aren't that """"suppressive"""". You can still hear the gun shots from a couple 100m away.- Still a lot of Helicopter camping, which they reduced by the """"adrenaline"""" feature. - The game could use a ton more of optimalization, but it is playable.- Helicopter view when you have climbled the ladder is pretty OP. Although it might be realistic it is pretty OP in duos and squads.All and all this game is a lot of fun and has the most potential of all early access games without a doubt, due to the fact it is of Tencent.

"3889,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewRing of Elysium is a good game of the Battle Royale genre.It is of a similar nature to PUBG, with various differences:* In ROE players pick a spot on the map to start from, rather than dropping from a plane (as with PUBG).* Players start the game with a basic weapon.* It seems to be a lot easier to find weapons in ROE than in PUBG.* ROE is played in a snowy land.Like PUBG, you can play solo, duo, or in a squad.You can choose to equip yourself with a Gliding Pack, a Skiing Pack, or a Climbing Pack, each of which offers different abilities:* Gliding Packs give players the ability to use a hang-glider. Just jump off from a high point and hit F - ignore the temptation to use your forward key to move forward, as that will glide you to the ground"
"3890,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAwesome, way better than pubg. Less Lag and you actually have a chance of winning in this game.The concept is awesome, a group of people are stranded at a ski resort and must kill each other to increases the chance of survival while also escaping a snow/ice storm(zone). When the zone reahces its limit a rescue helicoptor lands and 4 people are able to board. You must board to win the match. I highly recomend this game."",1"

"3893,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewWhat can I say about ROE? Well first off, it's an amazing tactical battle royale. While it may be somewhat childish in the sense of the characters, it offers a somewhat realistic gameplay. The guns act like how guns should act, with pistols doing one shots to the head and any ARs doing the exact same. The movement mechanics are amazing, the gliding aspect makes the manuverability across the map easier and is just awesome. However, the privacy policy and connection of data is a joke. But what can we do right? The company is based off in China afterall."",1"

"3896,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFINNALY A GOOD BATTLE ROYALE GAME!!!! (sorry for caps)After Fortshit and PUBuG we finally got a good BR game which keeps realism, fun and seriousness in balance.It has the basic BR game elements but also unique systems such as """"choose-where-to-spawn"""", helicopter win, non-circular zone restriction and fast travel by telecabin.This game was made by the same company that owns PUBG (mobile) so you will see similarities (guns, sounds and the winner winner chicken dinner)It has the Adventure Pass which is something similar to the battle """"psst"""" in fortn... nevermindIt is not pay2win but you can buy the adventure pass and get some cool clothesSo much better than those two games mentioned above. Go play it now, it's free."",1"
"3897,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI love this game, everything about it is awesome. It has everything a battle royale needs with something extra that most battle royales don't. It's got gliders, snowboards, and climbing pickaxes! I enjoy every moment of the game. Negative thing I have to say is that I struggle with ping because of the servers. Just hope they get EU servers or better yet ZA servers, so that we South Africans can enjoy low ping like the rest of the world."",1"
"3898,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewDecent game, Cars handle way better than pubg, looting is faster paced and the gameplay doesn't feel like chore.I'd give it a metacritic rating of 80 so far. Just needs little fixes. Doesn't feel all that polished but thus far i look forward to future development.Pros: Quick looting and attachment upgradesGreat car handlingInteresting end game dynamicFast pacedCons: No reason not to choose a shotgun to startNot available in the UK for some reason (and probably other regions)Drastic differences between player skill (common for a F2P game)Overview (TLDR): Its fun and free, as long as you're not in one of the regions its not available its worth playing at least for a few hours. Try playing with friends as this will greatly increase the experience."",1"
"3899,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI can't believe its free. The ending is definitely unique to BR genre - 0 to 4 teams can win, as long as one member survives to reach the chopper. Attachments auto equip which is nice for inventory management."",1"
"3900,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is awesome. Controls take a little to get used to but all the mechanics work so well! It's a blast driving, the gunplay is great, snowboarding is a blast, and I haven't even found a way to buy stuff. You get 100% of the experience for 100% free. It's character customization is really cool and you use an in game currency to progress to buy costmetics and they don't even ask you to pay. I've played 3.4 hours and don't even know what you'd buy or how you'd buy it. Easily on of the best battle royale games out there. Very fun with a team and solo.cons: frame rate dips even on lowering qualityYou must restart the game if you want to change graphic options.But yeah, amazing for a 100% free game."",1"
3901,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewFirst good battle royale game since pubg.100% in my top 3 games and i usually play car games or ark.Would recommend this game for a lot of fun and a great open world experience.,1
"3902,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewGame still has work that needs to be done. leaning from behind buildings using E and Q, a little faster movement would be nice. It has potential and i think its already better than buggy pubg. the idea of the storm and helicopter is good too. just need more servers!"",1"
"3903,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is the best Battle Royale game out there.  (notice the period).If you are going to buy this game I suggest you read my warning at the bottom of this reviewDisclaimer: I only play FPPProblems other BRs have*: Too many people dropping tilted/milli/hottest spot on the map, Spawning with nothing and getting killed solely because the other guy found a gun first, Nowhere to hide, Getting caught in the zone.How RoE fixes those problems*: You choose your spawn up to a full minute before the match starts but you (and your buddy(s)) take up that spawn location (only a limited amount of ppl can start on a town), you ALWAYS start with a weapon (either a usp/glock or the double barrel SG depending on class), there is plenty of cover on 3/4 of the map and the ridges in the plentiful mountains are great for this, Cars/trucks are very common and if you pay attention you'll know when to start sprinting because the starting zone is very generous in its time.Pros: It's free (for now)The guns feel great and well ballanced.  9/10.The different classes are really cool.I'll start with the hanglider"
"3904,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI hardly ever write reviews but I feel this game really deserves it so here goes.I have over 800+ hours in pubg, well a few of my friends kept badgering me to play RoE and since it was free I caved in eventually and decided to give it a shot. I was incredibly surprised at the experience I have ended up with. I pretty much completely stopped playing pubg. The quality of life changes such as auto-equipping attachments onto weapons and when you swap a weapon the attachments go with it is huge. Also, being able to choose one of 3 'loadouts' to sort of cater your movement around the map as well as carrying capacity is a pretty sweet edition.But overall my favorite part is the end game. A chopper flies in once the map constricts down to a very small block due to an encroaching storm. On this chopper there are 4 seats left, meaning there can be multiple 'winners'. Some will rush the chopper and hope to not get shot down while climbing the ladder while overs will have saved up a lot of meds and wait til the storm rolls in and fight out the last survivors so they are the only ones left. Overall this makes every match feel pretty unique due to the low visibility at the end at the helicopter aspect.Overall I highly recommend this game, especially since it is free. I cannot wait to see what is in store next for this game."",1"
"3905,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewthis game is basically Tencent (makers of PUBG) response to fortnite, its a mesh between the 2 (minus the BS building mechanic) and its actually decent, its the right mix of casual gameplay from fortnite with stuff like zipwires, snowboards and gliders and alot of the things that made pubg good like weapon customisation. It has a real clwan system where when you pick up an new gun, you dont need to take all the attachments off your old one, they all just transfer over and the ones that dont fit go in your backpack.All in all a great expirience and i would love to see this get big"",1"
3906,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis is a great game and needs some improvements in the loot distribution sector but overall the concept is different and fresh. No doubt this game cannot compete with the big titles but good for free as they say.,1
"3907,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewHonestly, this game is, yes, another battle Royale. But don't let that dissuade you from trying it. From the start, the game makes itself stand out from other battle royales.You get to choose load out kits, for starters. Each has their own unique weapon and mobility piece. Wanna snowboard down mountain slopes? Go for it! Wanna hangglide off them instead? It's got you covered. Feel like braving the face of a mountain with just your feet and ice picks? Go on then, get! Dont forget! You can rappel with this kit too! It's quite speedy   Each load out comes with it's own weapon, some ammo, and a few healing bits and bobs. The loadouts make each game feel unique.Then there's the spawn system. No more jumping out of planes. Instead, it's pick a grid. And no two people can spawn directly on top of each other. That right there is a welcome reprieve. You can see where others choose to spawn, and adjust accordingly.Now, on to the real fun. The """"meat and potatoes"""" of these types of games. The loot.So far, in the 10-15 games I've played (not much, I know) I've yet to come across the problem I seem to run into in every other battle Royale. I find guns and ammo EVERYWHERE. Sure, some are crummy shotguns (note, shotguns are actually amazing, I just personally don't like them.) or another pistol, but all in all, almost every house or cabin or barn I've been in had at least one weapon, if not two. Attachments are a dime a a dozen, but the other neat thing is the ability to swap sights at the press of a button. Yes, you heard right. One key swaps two different sights out. Need long range? Put that 8x on. Need close quarters? Go ahead and make sure your red dot or Holo is on backup.Armor has been simplified compared to most games of this type, with their only being two kinds currently. Basic, and superior. Vehicles are also present in the world, and can soak quite a bit of gunfire, which is a downside to them, but hey, do you want to be caught out in the storm?Speaking of the storm, yimir is actually quite a cool concept (ha, cold jokes.) that doesn't shrink in a circle like most royales. It segments and really can screw you up. Also, as the storm closes in, your character begins to freeze. Meaning slower movement, reduced accuracy, and overall health drop beyond a certain point, if you're caught out in the danger zones. It's actually a lovely mechanic, and I've enjoyed it.The shooting in the game feels fairly well thought out, and actually does fairly decent in intense firefights. I've enjoyed the shootouts I've had so far, even when you can retreat and heal back to full if you time it right. There's also a cover system in place for doors or windows and openings. It seems to still be in the works though, as it doesn't always engage when you feel it should. Oh, and it works on trees too!Honestly, my favorite part of this game is how you win.Last Man standing? Not if you're smart and fast. A helicopter shows up when the last area is being closed in on, and it has 4 seats. That's right. 4 people on a solo match can win WITHOUT killing a soul.Is this likely to happen? Not so much, since no one trusts anyone, but hey, I've done it once or twice.Ah, something I forgot to mention. The graphics. The graphics in this game are actually very pretty. Now sure, I'm not able to run them at Max, cause I've got an older Asus ROG laptop that's getting onto it's last legs, but honestly, it runs better than another super popular battle Royale that likes it's unknown name.The sound in this game is actually also of a great quality. Sure, ambient sound needs little tweaking so far, but it's not game breaking.Overall, this game is definitely on the """"try it"""" list. If you like battle royales, by all means, come on. It's great fun.Discover the beautiful landscapes and the riviting joy of being one with the snow."",1"
"3908,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewOne of the best Battle Royale games out there, here is how I will put it, this game starts as a free early access BR, and beats PUBG 10x from all aspects, such as: -1- Better weapons and better aiming/recoil system2- Better map and zone system (instead of the mainstream boring circle system)3- Perfect Features: Sliding, Mountain Climbing, Gliding and I am hoping for more as the game grows bigger.4- Excellent Auto-Attach feature, even when you are replacing weapons, saves a lot of time and does not allow for nonsense skill base.5- The graphics are WAAAAY BETTER THAN PUBG's 6- The pinging system is GENIUS, where you can ping enemies and show a calculation of the distance as well.7- The kockdown/revival features are way better optimised than PUBG8- You can actually heal while moving slowly unlike the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ system in PUBG9- The bullet drop mechanics are SANE unlike PUBG's own book of physics that no other game in the world agrees with.10- The hit markers are very helpful instead of waiting to see a small drop of blood like PUBG's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ system.11- The loot allocation/availability is way more even and fairer than PUBG's stupid random logic.12- The user interface is 10 times better than PUBG's including the in-game HUD.13- The game is not just about """"kill kill kill"""" it also has a small objective-like escape plan at the end where only 4 players can make it to the chopper, which makes it way more fun than just a camping game of """"wait for the blue zone"""".14- This game also promotes for a great teamwork factor that is totally missing in PUBG.15- You can easily kill an enemy and die in the same time if you both happened to shoot each other simultaneously unlike PUBG's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bug of """"bullet not registering"""".16- This game is way less laggier than â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ PUBG's stupid servers.To summarise it all, this game is not perfect yet, but it offers the users an actual worthy alternative to the money grubbing greedy and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ company of PUBG using the exact same mechanics and base logic. This game really deserves support and honestly, I honestly think that this game should take PUBG's lead as the no.1 BR FPS/TPS game.Please download it, play it, support it, and let us all stand behind it until it takes its rightful place in the market.Thank you!"",1"
"3909,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFor Free to Play  PUBG spawn....it currently showing the most potential.  If your tired of what's already been around since last fall,  give RoE a try...you won't regret and will find yourself getting hooked on it."",1"
"3910,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewDecent BR, better than PUBG in my opinion, needs some changes, #1 being YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT WHILE VAULTING OVER SOMETHING NOT JUST BE A BULLET SPONGE. This is only getting a thumbs up because you can snowboard and do flips."",1"

"3913,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat Battle Royale game - very good sound, decent gun variety, pretty good movement. The """"pack"""" feature is my favorite in any battle royale game so far, especially because I myself am a big fan of snowboarding- though it would be cool if you could choose whether you wanted to snowboard OR ski in the skiing pack. The health system is my favorite out of all the battle royale games I've played, and thank tencent for hitmarkers. I like the variety of vehicles in the game and the fact that you don't have to rest the fate of the game on whether you find a vehicle or not- especially if you're the farthest from the safe zone you can possibly be. Like I mentioned earlier, I like being able to heal up to full health with bandages, especially if you take accidental fall damage and don't want to waste a first-aid kit.If I had to point out anything to be worked on in the game, I'd start with switching weapons. I can't tell you how many times I've died because someone saw me and I tried to scroll to my gun or switch a different weapon mid-gunfight without any cover. Sometimes the weapon won't switch or you'll accidentally goto one you don't want. As a side-note- It would be cool to see the climbing pack become more viable to use in game other than just running up really tall things and ziplining. Maybe make more things climbable? or give them spiked boots to be able to run faster over the snow? It would make sense to me."",1"
"3914,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you want a free Pubg style game and are not a fan of fortnite, this game could be for you. Though it just entered public early access, It is really refined, though some bugs need to be worked out. Its very unique in that your starting gear is chosen by you as well as your exact drop off point. What you choose will reflect how you are going to play.

"3916,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewRing of Elysium is not a bad BR game, but it's still beta-ish and needs some work. No true fullscreen (borderless windowed only), devs are working on more compatiblility with streaming / recording software also. The game is optimized fairly well now (I played it back in March and April), it runs on directx9 so older hardware is supported there. Vibrant setting for graphics is a big plus for me, and runs well and looks great on my ultrawide 21:9 monitor. Devs seem to know what they're doing with FPP so far (added recently). A few bugs here and there but nothing crazy. RoE is a free game, so the playerbase should last for a while. Some countries are not able to download or play as of release on Steam, probably some legal red tape there. They can still use Garena launcher to get into the game.I'd say it's worth a download and quick play if you like BR games like PUBG. It's easy to pick up and play with friends casually or hardcore on FPP servers. Solo is okay play, and it's just straight up enjoyable to try out the glider, snowboard, and snowmobile for some funsies!"",1"

"3918,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAfter playing PUBG for a year, I can definitely recommend this game.Very smooth BR game that has so far the best graphics. However, it does not compromise performance for the graphics, which is obviously a win-win.You can choose either TPP or FPP, like in PUBG, but it feels like TPP is a smoother experience. You also have a choice of three different kits (Glider, Snowboard or Climber), that make the gameplay a tad more funnier as you do not rely on vehicles on to travel.This game is like a breeze of fresh air, no pun intended.9/10"",1"

"3926,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewReally good game. Unlike 90% of battle royal games, it actually brings something original and new to the table.

The only issues I really have are the hitboxes (not gonna lie, they're kinda bad), and PLEASE make it to where when you just can't go into places you can't fit when you're prone instead of it having you stand up. I've been killed several times because of this."",1"
"3927,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI was very skeptical about this game when my friends were trying to convince me to play as I am not a fan of battle royale style games normally. I was quick to change my mind when I actually got into it with a group of friends and we were running a 4 man fireteam. The map is large, but there are many ways to traverse it, assuming you take the time to plan to make the most of your forms of transportation. Gunplay is intense as the game accounts for velocity and bullet drop, with SMGs and Shotguns feeling lethal in close combat, while the dedicated sniper rifles(if you can find a scope for them...) actually give you the ability to get kilometer+ standoff distances assuming visibility is good. The Assault rifles cover the middle ground, with some tending more to feeling like SMGs(like the Groza and M4), while others tend to be better at longer ranges(like the LVOA and AKM). The vehicle physics are absolutely legendary, you can drive trucks up 80% slopes at 60kph, and given the ridiculous terrain features this is a huge plus and leads to some hilarious moments as well. The graphics are good, nothing exceptional, but when you reach a mountain peak or are riding in the ski lifts scattered around the map you are blown away by the fantastically designed landscape. The game is surprisingly optimized as well, I'm playing on a laptop with a GTX1060M and a 4th Gen i7, and I'm usually around 120 fps on the High settings even in intense firefights or the snowstorms that occur. As a battle royale I give this game a 9/10. It's a simple game, you grab guns, you get attachments, you follow the zone, you kill the enemy teams. It doesn't do anything groundbreaking while at the same time having enough small changes to the formula to make it stand out and actually be worth playing with your buddies. As a whole game experience, 7/10. They supposedly have a PvE mode coming sometime next year as well, and the PvP has given me enough of a reason to stick around to see where this goes."",1"

"3930,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThere was HUGE potential! and I mean EUGE! But failed to be the game it felt it needed to be. Fortnite and PUBG are great games on their own, but Ring of Elysium feels as if you mushed the two together and added snowboards. The primary issues are bugs bug BUGS! I love me a good pasta, but DAG-NABBIT! IF there's bugs riddling my Fettuccini, I'm going to get my knickers in a bunch! Combat is a joke, Mobility is a joke, and quite frankly if you wanted to play a better Battle Royale game for free, you could just play Fortnite. OR you could play PUBG for a cost. but either way, prevent the stomach and heart ache later and just avoid this game. The beginning screen felt oddly familiar, and I mean REALLY familiar. Theres this in game currency you can use to buy things in the store... that doesn't exist yet, and as you level up by playing the game, you unlock skins, emotes, colorful items, and bragging rites. but if you wish to pay for the V.I.P version, you can get more rewards, more skins, and that means more fun! right? Skins=Wins so therefore you get the skins... except theres only 3 base skins in the game. And there are about three color options for each of them.

"3933,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is an early access game that in my opinion is in a very good state, here are some bugs but that's understandable.Notice that this is not a traditional Battle Royal game: there are up to 4 winners in this game. Also it happens in a snowy environment and has three player classes which makes a nice combination of features in the game. Recently the developers added a season pass ($10) which, as usual in this kind of games, provides cosmetic changes.There's FortNite (which is more comics like), there Player Unknown battleGrounds (which is more realistic, plus was the pioneer), there was Islands of Nyne (which died because of being a complex game plus competition against the 80 tons FortNite mamooth), and there's Ring of Elysyum which .... in my opinion is a very nice game, well built.Also, developers are really paying attention to their officel reddit forums. That doesn't means they do everything people ask just that they pay attention to players."",1"
3934,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewSo much fun I don't know where to say.   After I said that the fact it's free I'm not sure why your not playing it?  Spyware people say? you must google some sick $hi7 if your concerned about that.  It's not BTW just saying.,1
"3935,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAfter numerous hours of screaming at PUBG and browsing battle royal games I feel like my prayers are finally answered. Not only is this game better then PUBG its free. No BS bullet physics, no chinese hackers, no glitching. There were some brief movement issues in the first 5 seconds of some of the games that quickly subsided. This game â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ all over PUBG. To the developers, thank you. Dont touch it!!. Add some guns , polish it, just dont make it more like PUBG.  I would reccomend playing this game if you want to see what pubg should have been like."",1"

"3937,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat Game. In Fact the best BR i have played. I love how it breaks the BR norms (jumping out of a plane, starting with out a gun, and the classes). The game is simple compared to pubg, which just has to many items in it now, and the hit reg is much better. The fact that there are no map pistol spaws is wonderful, other than the degal. The fact that to loot boxes can not be sold is another good thing. NO real world profit less hackers."",1"
"3938,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewAn absolute gem! It's free and it plays very nicely! Having logged countless hours on PUBG this is a welcome distraction. I'm not so keen on not jumping from an aircraft and selecting my LZ on descent but it's not a biggy as the game does allow you a better look at the positioning of enemy players and allows you some level of situational awareness from the word gon through the use of a spawn map which highlights which slots other players have selected along with your own spawn. It has good graphics, weapon play is very nice to use and easy to get used to, the ability to choose between a handglider, snowboard and climbing kit is a definite positive twist and the ability to pull out my handglider to make a quick transition is always handy when speed is key.The inventory system is a definite upgrade! Weapon attachments automatically occupy vacant slots on your weapons and you can easily transition between optics by clicking V so you can go from Long to Short range combat without having to risk using that pesky inventory menu to get your RDS equipped.If you've not tried this i'd definately give it a go."",1"

"3948,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game have a potential to be one of the best battle royal games. Right now in early access feels a little clumsy but that's all fixable. If you are in battle royal games then you should give it a try.What can you lose, it's free to play."",1"
"3949,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewLong story short: I recommend it.Short story long:Before anybody manages to call me out (not that anybody will even read this) on only having spent ~30 hours on the game, implying I have no experience: I have won 3 out of the 4 solo games ive played, having quit out mid-game on the 4th one because of IRL reasons, which means my K/D ratio would be at 24 if I had died once. My aim isnt good, but the game rewards good playstyles and mindgames.As somebody with experience in both PUBG and Elysium, this wins by a very large margin. What seperates these games you might ask? Fun. Thats it. This game has a lot less content, some weird issues like tabbing out may crash the game during loading screens and that textures (very rarely) dont load in etc but... Its so much better than PUBG nonetheless. Bullets actually hit the target you're aiming at, the gunplay is fun and not gimmicky, everything is fast paced where most games take less than 20 minutes meaning you get high amounts of loot in a short period of time. It even has a pretty amazing character creation part which is honestly its own game.You get clothing items by completing challanges or you can buy a cheap as all hell pass that only gives you cosmetic items in exchange for completing challanges, which are more fun than tedious. It also isnt graphics heavy yet looks more than decent, compared to PUBG its actually optimized well enough to not load in later than everybody else if you have a toaster for a PC. If this game had the same budget as Bluehole i'd be a happy man, but it doesnt, so people complain - It's free to play people, calm your asses. I really do not understand negative reviews complaining about losing, they all blame the loss on something odd but the entire review reeks of """"I just dont have enough experience!"""" This is not the place to whine about how bad you are. The most negative thing I could think of is the end, it is heavily influenced by RNG if you first look at it, but once you starting fiddling with tactics and aquire the right mindset you can win them quite easily, this is coming from someone who usually goes from 5 kills to double that in the end zone (in duos).TL"
"3950,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewBetter than PUBG.  Better optimized, runs without crashing, no network lag etc.  Smooth game play mechanics.  It's my favorite battle royale.  Not really into the latest update so much other than some of the improved graphics.  I hope Tencent reads through the reviews and learns what the community likes/dislikes about the game and makes changes accordingly."",1"
"3951,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI would only play this game if I was held at gunpoint, holding myself at gunpoint to play this game with my buddies is cancer. I'd have more fun eating rasins out of an old mans swampâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ The meding is broken, and the kills dont come easy, it's a game for tryhard rasin eaters."",1"
"3952,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewBetter version of PUBG, and also """"free"""". There are obviously microtransactions, some of which are a little intrusive. For example, there are weekly challenges that give you an EXP bonus if you complete 4 out of 7. The catch is that only 3 of them are available unless you buy the Adventurer Pass (about $13CAD)That aside, the traversal is pretty cool, being able to choose from a glider, snowboard and a climbing pack (which is terribly slow for climbing, but is the only loadout that allows you to use the ziplines). Everyone starts with a gun, a pistol for glider and snowboard, and a double-barrel shotgun for the climber. The games are usually only around 60 players at the start, and combine that with the abundance of loot, the game moves a lot faster than other BR's.If you even slightly enjoy Battle Royale games, I would strongly suggest this one. I personally like it more than any other I've played."",1"
"3953,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewOut of the many battle royale games I've played over the past year, this game has by far been the best. Despite my small amount of hours, this game has actually felt like no other. With the obvious elements from fortnite and the obvious elements from PUBG this game is the perfect mix with some cool additions of it's own creation.The Snowboarding, Gliding and Climbing is cool asâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Although the mechanics are a bit janky and there are elements throughout the game that show through it's early access. This game is still better than PUBG and Fortnite.The shooting is satisfying and not overcomplicated, the inventory system works and isn't overcomplicated, the map is actually interesting and I actually want to explore it. The areas are impressive I.E The Mine.It's simple, it works and is actually a lot of fun to play. I'd sooner spend 26 quid on cosmetics on this game that 26 quid on PUBG.I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game.EDIT: I've read a lot about the terms of service in this game and here is what I have to say.All Ring of Elysiums terms of service say is that they have an intrusive anti-cheat, it's needed cause in china cheating is actually illegal and you can get jailtime for it. That's why the game has HWID bans too. You get the same kind of Anti-Cheat when you play ESEA or Faceit or any game with battleye or infact most anti-cheats nowadays. Cheats are so hard to detect so the Anti-Cheats have to be so much more intrusive, it's a small price to pay for a decent game experience.We've all experienced our fair share of sketchy deaths but it terms of blatent cheating I haven't seen any as of yet. As for the sketchy deaths if you look back it was probably just someone got lucky etc because I really haven't died to a lot of BS.As for the company selling your data, there is no genuine hard proof of that. All just speculation."",1"
"3954,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewWould 100% recommend this game... I haven't been able to find any 'faults' with it so far and I've played for a pretty good amount of time. Compared to PUBG, Fornite and other BR games, it definitely feels nicer to play as in it feels consistent and controls, movement and overall game functionality is just nice to use. I don't think I can fault the game as of yet, nor do I think I'll be able too at this rate. For an early access it's honestly one of the best games I've ever played, I'd even tgo to the length of saying it's the best I've played this year. Good job."",1"

3958,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access Review[Pretty Solid] If you're looking for a very fun and semi casual game with some competitive aspects this game is your daddy. It will lead you on a very well developed (and free) journey! [8/10],1
"3959,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewRing of Elysium.It is worth a buy? Yes. It is free to play at the time of review.Score: 8.5/10 (Current score in Early Access.)Score: 9/10 (Expected score when fully released.)Ring of Elysium, a Battle Royale, that has innovated and improved on this style of game successfully.The loot table is way better. Guns and ammo are easier to come by. Less circle luck. Air drops roll away. It has first person and third person. In third person you can press control and h to get first person view. = is autorun.You can't peak manually left and right around corners at moment, hopefully they add this ability soon. There is only an auto peak. Vehicle handling is excellent, cars have no fuel and you cant shoot out the tyres. You can split stacks of items in your inventory.Gun handling is excellent. More attachments can be kept on guns, can have three primary weapons. Attachments auto equip. Healing is less complicated and you can make more use of bandages to get back up to 100% health. Weather, lighting, graphics are awesome. Most building have realistic interiors rather than being empty. You can see your footsteps in the snow.Map, level design is excellent. The three abilities, snowboard, glide and climb add some strategy and make each round a new experience. Sound design is sublime, absolutely excellent. I was able to tell the direction of shots.Lots of potential when they add the new maps. Excellent launch, servers worked, games loaded quickly. you no longer have to jump out of plane, you can select a location on the map. Gets you into the interesting part much quicker. From some locations you can glide almost the entire map.There can be multiple winner from different teams. The helicopter end game allows a lot more freedom of movement. The helicopter end game works well, but they could easily implement a more traditional ending. The fact there is no circle makes the games harder to predict.You can't look around while running in fpp locked mode. Alt will not look around.If we have cosmetic items for sale I would rather be able to just buy what we want, than have random chance / luck loot boxes for sale that we pay for and still can't get what we want. I had high hopes for this game and it has exceeded them! Lots of potential, but in its current state it is much better than many finished games and this is only early access. They had to have the movement, the gunplay and release with a decent map for this early access and they have done that already and much more. This game is extremely fun.Why did the game not get 9.5/10. The following five features were missing at time of review in early access for me to give it 9.5/10. To developers, please add peaking manually / q and e buttons, shooting out tyres on vehicles, oceanic / australia, sydney dedicated servers, more maps to play on, ability to adjust voices, mute individuals, adjust car volume, gun reload sounds separately!Tested on a 1080Ti. 2080Ti had not released at time of review.A landmark game release.

I also love how they have a blizzard/storm instead of a zone closing in for no reason like PUBG or a few clouds that for some reason kill you like Fortnite.

Movement balances being realistic and responsive unlike pubg, Netcode isn't complete trash, I live in NZ and playing on both the roe Asia and NA servers is far smoother and more playable than playing on pubg's OC servers.The game manages to look nice without have the performance of a potato battery. Consistent 60+fps, no frame drops or lag spikes.The ability to select the general area where you spawn and see where others are spawning is nice and cuts all the boring parachuting crap (you can spawn on top of teammates but not enemies). There are several gondola lifts around the map aswell as interconnecting ziplines, (sadly) no friendly fire.Its a f2p game and has no pay to win mechanics and none of abortnites horrendous fashion. Infact right now the only way that you can actually spend money is on the founders pack which is like 2.50 USD.Vehicles are very forgiving, in that it is extremely difficult to tip a vehicle unless you are a class A retard or you are deliberately trying.There are 3 packs (classes) which you can choose when you load into a match:Gliding - Hang glider - Start with a glock (9mm) - High mobility - Low capacitySkiing - Snowboard - Start with a usp45 (.45 acp) - Medium mobility - Medium capacityClimbing - Pickaxe & ability to use ziplines - Start with a double barrel shotgun - Low mobility - High capacityStarting weapons don't make much of a difference as it is extremely easy to find guns, you will very rarely have to use a starting weapon, unless you are deliberately trying to get kills in the first 30 seconds."",1"

"3976,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is a straight forward non-gimmicky(no building as in Fortnite, no forging equipment as Realm Royale) battle royale. It has some fresh ideas like all the players spawning at the same time on the map, not flying in at trying to land before the others. You have a pistol/shotgun from the start so you are not completely on the mercy of the RNG weapon spawns. Good guns are relatively easy to find. The decreasing of the playing area is done by cutting off sectors from the map and not with the usual shrinking circle. At the end it only matters if you are in the helicopter which leaves the very slight possibility that you might win without killing anyone. The system requirements are very reasonable and the game runs OK most of the time. The whole thing seems to be very well thought out by the developers.What I do not like is the controls. They feel kind of wooden. The shooting also feels off which is my biggest complaint. That being said it is free to play and I haven't noticed any pay to win mechanics so it gets my approval as a whole."",1"

I'm pretty impressed about how this game actually performed.You start off with a view of a map. You pick where you spawn, and you can see where others spawn. You have 3 classes, glider (you can jump and glide from high places) Snow Boarder (You can snow board fast down hills) and Climber (You can climb mountains and use the various zip lines placed throughout the map.There are an...okay variety of guns. It's not a lot, but it's pretty decent. I've encountered like 8 different guns. The loot spawns in predictable places, I think they're set to spawn there every time. Details The graphics are okay. I mean, there are particles of snow that pop up when you drive/run, and you can leave footsteps in a certain density of snow. Different textures have different sounds, and I'm shocked as of how realistic they sound.The gunfire has realistic recoil, and the guns are pretty detailed.The textures have 3 settings, low, medium, and standard. None of these really make a difference, however. Optimization Sadlly, this game is poorly optimized. The game stutters a lot and I encounter frame drops and rubber banding, even with an i7 and 1060ti and set to lowest settings. The game's """"minimum requirements"""" are just basically what you must have to get to the main menu. Overall Well, the review can be summarized short and simple. The game is free, however it really exceeded my expectations for a free game. I can't really complain about the little things, the only real problem I have with this free game is it's poor optimization.Is it worth your time to download and play? I mean...yea. It's pretty fun, and it  pretty much is the free, better PUBG.  "",1"

The other guy drives off in a car and I cut through the snow on a snowboard. The other guy gets out of the car and crawls towards the helicopter's ladder using the car as cover. I manage to get a shot off on him with my sniper. rather than fighting back the other guy makes a dash for it and climbs up the ladder.

"3997,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI'm going to say that this is by far my favourite battle royale and 100% deserves a try, it is fun, fast-paced gameplay and interesting mechanics now here are the pros and cons:Pros:* Fast paced, fun and tactical gameplay.* Unlike other battle royales (which I find get dry after extensive gameplay) this has fast load times and no pre-game lobby BS that feels like a lifetime and a half to get through and then into the game.* It's polished really well considering how new it is. (definitely better than PUBG was.)* New mechanics that freshen up the genre something that really hasn't been done in a while.* A great time whether you are playing with or without friends. (I personally prefer to play with friends.)* The servers are amazing and I haven't encountered any problems with them so far.* Free to playCons:* The game is a little glitchy at times which can get frustrating but keep in mind it is in early access and all of this is subject to change and it's likely will because this game gets updated quite frequently with frequent patches to most of the bugs discovered by the community."",1"
"3998,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewIts a verry nice game. It makes a lot of fun alone or with some Friends. I find the game makeÂ´s its better as some games who costs like Pubge, Call of Duty Blackops or Fortight. The game has also a Battle-Pass like Fortnight. And the grafiks are beautiful and the surroundings are fantastic. I find that the developers should get a praise for what they do. Its a verry nice/funny game. "",1"
"3999,Ring of Elysium,,""Access Review    Ring of Elysium is a game that offers a mediocre expierence. There is far to many errors to look over in this game. This game is a good idea as it takes the fun of snow and uses it to enhance the expierece of a battle royale. So I will lay out the pros/cons so here we go.                 PROS:-Good intergration of snowboards, climbing and glider-Interesting map-Shows density of players on map-no battlebus, plane, ETC.-Good car mechanics-Fun            CONS:-Impossible to aim-Climbing and glider are never used in combat-Falling is odd-Movement is stiff-Render distance is a bit off-One instance of bad texture pop inMediocre game, but great potential.

"4002,Ring of Elysium,,""Access ReviewA smaller-than-average group of 60 players (either alone, in pairs, or in groups of up to four) battle it out to escape a deadly blizzard that ravages remote mountain towns. But unlike the usual trudging around on foot or the occasional vehicle, RoE mixes up the way you get from point A to point B with a map that features not only ski lifts, but also gives you access to snowboards, hang gliders, and mountain-climbing gear. That change injects exciting creativity into the genre without going into off-the-wall fantasy. "",1"
"4003,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewFun game, very addicting, but it crashes WAY too often.

"4008,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewMy favourite BR to date. I have never enjoyed a BR until now. The zone, the movement, all reimagined.

It saddens me that every other person I meet compares the game to PUBG, as I would find that quite insulting as a developer. The devs are the best I've seen and I respect them immensely.

"4010,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access Reviewthis is a good game. However, there are a few problems that happen with squads or duos. Forexample, they need to add a feature so that you can drop half or part of a stack of ammo or meds for sharing with a teamate. There is also a glitch where your teamate is driving a car. It will show the wheels spinning then have them move really fast for a couple of seconds. While this is USUALLY not a problem, I have died once because of this. It would also be better if the time to kill was a little shorter, and the recoil feels a bit unatural. All in all though, I would reccomend getting this game especially if you have friends that play it."",1"
"4011,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewRefunded Call Of Duty Blackops 4.  I uninstalled this because I was so excited to finally play blackout.. that after playing blackout I realized I just missed almost 99% of everything about RoE.  If RoE would deal with some server update issues, and hacking this would be the #1 game on the planet."",1"
"4012,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI honestly never type reviews or some sorts. but i had too tbh.When i first started playing this game i was just thinking its just a pubg look alike BR.And yes, there is alot of game mechanics which makes this game look like pubg. but we cant forget there is alot of stuff you can do that pubg dosent even have.You can litterly snowboard to go fast thru a field, down a mountain which you need to evacuate from asap. or glide yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥off to safety, or rush people with those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. you can even climb mountains, you can you a grappler to get from mountains and towns.You have varierty of wepeons which you gonna realize you like more the more you play. you play with wepeons that suits  your playstyle. Ive only played this game for 40 hours now and i have to tell that its really amazed me, i wasnt expecting to keep playing and just quit after a few games. but i have to say its really enjoyable. ive played pubg, but it kinda sucks you only can only drive 3 different cars, and run for the most of the time. on RoE we have 5+ different vehicles. we can transport easy without a car. its alot more fast paced. and its awesome to shoot people that are gliding in the air or snowboarding away for example.Watching people take the elevator thingys and shoot the whole thing down. Amazing experience. this game is fun to play alone, but 1000% more enjoyable to play with friends...ofc this games feels cluncky here and there. but its alpha after all.Game has big potential. worth a try.If you wanna look at my first video/montage ive made this game, it would be very helpful to drop a like and maybe a sub for  future videos :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCFGL2QA9W8 "",1"

"4014,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI've seen quite a lot of reports about this game destroying your Windows install, or being a Trojan...I mean, I know it logs a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on of data, like all Tencent games anyway... But Tencent games themselves aren't the only ones that do this.Let's talk about all the other games running EasyAntiCheat and BattlEye, which both CONSTANTLY SCAN your system to check if there are cheats running in the background, or if there are bad libraries dropped inside the game's folder using a fake name (e.g. d3d9.dll)... Or even VAC itself from Valve, which scans all the incoming and outgoing Internet traffic!Going back to the Trojan thing, I've tried running this on both my fast desktop and my old laptop, and they both still work fine, nothing broke or something like that... So I really don't know what's happening to you guys.So here's my verdict:If you don't like handing your data to Xi Jinping, then DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME I guess.If you don't give a damn, and you already know that this game is doing the same exact thing as other games, and most companies such as Facebook and Google, then go ahead and play it, it's pretty fun.P.S.

"4016,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is a review for the last 7 months as a whole coming from 700 hours+ on G-Arena and 60 on Steam. In this review I'll focus on 3rd Person, because that's the way it was originally intended and as such that's what I stick to. This game firstly is built on a great engine,  with solid shooting mechanics, no dsync nightmare, very generious loot tables and just an all around a polished and stable game. In the new Pioneer Servers, you have a choice between 3 different loadout that are unique and change the way you can approach certain engagements. The Hang-glider with limited backpack space but great to get across swaths of land and get on enemy rooftops. Oh yeah, and you can shoot an smg while gliding! Very Hand-yThe snowboard, with medium backpack space, great for speeding away to zones or down mountains. Also, you can pull sweet tricks off by holding jump key before a ramp life formation in the world. The third pack is a climbing kit, which you can use to scale mountains and also include a zip line motor attachment. You will find zip lines scattered across the map to traverse. It also has the largest backpack space avaliable. *hint, you can hold about 75 more wieght by equipping a bulletproof vest. *Each pack includes a weapon to give you a fighting chance if you spawn next to an enemy.

"4017,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI'm not gonna write out a fancy review for this game or anything because at the end of the day it should be YOU the reader to decide if you wanna take my review to heart or not.. The game is in early access... expect bugs and other minor glitches etc... With any game especially 1st person shooters expect hackers and wallhacks/ESP but honestly I rarely expereince this or see it unless you're diegosaurs or other big named streamer constantly getting streamed sniped by cheaters which 90% of the time get banned anyways... All theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥you read about this game collecting data or spying on you and being malware is a false positive... If you want a REAL company to worry about go YouTube/Google EA Games and look at how Origin is technically considered a whitelisted botnet... (whitelisted being it's not detected by anti viruses)People used Process Monitor to scan Origins behaviour and posted pictures of the program accessing files of their tax management program and their cell phone manager.obviously its scanning directories, but to look for games when the only """"games"""" available on origin are from EA I find it hard to believe it would need to do such a deep recursive scan, but regardless I find it quite amusing that this program can pretty much hook into everything - read config files and who knows what else, it'sâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥like this on why I don't buy many games and the primary reason I refuse to install origin."",1"

"4023,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is fun and i'm having more of a fun time playing than PubG for sure. Something that gets on my nerves thoug (and it's pubG as well) is people that just get a gun and sit in a random corner of a house so they make no noise. They will literally sit there for 15 minutes if needs be and you die so fast that if you don't peek at the right corner 9/10 times you're just dead. No way of knowing if they are there and slowing the game down 200% because now I have to try and check ever single corner of every single room I enter so it takes 2 minutes to clear a house.I think a workaround in this game would be nice such as, because it's cold weather, if you sit still for too long your character gets progressivly colder and under a certain degrees makes heavy breathing sounds than can be heard at least just from the next room along. It would help identify if someone is just sitting in a corner waiting for you so you at least hasve a chance to defend yourself."",1"

But keep in mind, this can make the game for some people less exited!There are so many battle royale games out there which are based on randomness, it's good to have this one out there.I dare you to give it a try "
"4040,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI' ve thought a lot about this game. And now I want to say about it. FIrst: the game is better than pubg. Second: it looks not so monotonous or common. Third: there are 3 classes which aren't different, but they are very interesting. And finaly the game is free. SO! This game is good. Not the best, but good. If you want to play battleroyal, you have to try this. 7 snowstorms out of 10."",1"
"4041,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewRoe thought of everything that PUBg didn't or did it first, even before it was in the snow before it was on steam, it has always been a positive experience for me and I'm sure it will continue to be. ÄŸÅ¸â„¢â€š"",1"
"4042,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is really great, i love the atmosphere and mood the game sets with its menu screen, and finally a small indie studio is showing those big developers how to successfully pull off a battle royale game. No tricks, gimmicks, scams, or Over powered equipment for sale. I only have about 3 hours on it (At the time of this review, but surely many more hours to come.) but from those three hours of non stop play, i never got into any bugs or glitches, a few lag spikes here and there but honestly i think its just my wifi setup and not the games servers. this game is a great free indie game with a pretty large backing behind it, and i see this title going very far unlike most of the other BR indie titles that have surfaced to the steam market, paid or not.TL:DR This game is very solid and stable, no long waiting to get in lobbies, and no paid op content. also great graphics for a free title. 9/10"",1"
"4043,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is awesome. Both i terms of gameplay and design, However the EU servers are very unstable.

"4046,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI usually hate BR games, PUBG left a really bad taste in my mouth after beta so i sold my beta outfit for 2k and never loaded it again. I was hesitent to try ROE but i'm so glad i did. The game does so many things better than PUBG and it runs soo much better for me. This also being free is awesome, for a free EA BR game this is unbeatable."",1"
"4047,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewHad a lot of fun playing before the most recent updates. The playing style suddenly feels really uncomfortable and I've lost the incentive to continue without crates and having my stats wiped.Would be cool if they'd revert back to what it was before this update. Even if the season pass stays in, I'd just like the play style to go back to what it was."",0"
"4048,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's like free PUBG with snowboarding, and they don't randomly permaban your account. The gameplay is a clunky, but I think it is functional in delivering a battle royale experience."",1"
"4049,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewNever really been a huge fan of the battle royale genre. BUT...This game has been intense, fun, addictive, and it's hard to believe it's free.Gonna throw some money at the developers like I'm at the strippers!Well done, keep up the good work!"",1"
"4050,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewSteep, Pubg, and Black Ops 4 had a Battle Royale Baby and Its Funded By Tencent Games.....Free and Fun. Research Tencent Games because they own like 40% of Epic Games, 11% of Bluehole, and 5% of ubisoft."",1"
"4051,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is really fun, I have been playing PUBG but this just brings a wole new world and concept into the game. I am hopeing that this game slowly becomes bigger and more well known since its sooo fun. Just hope the sweaty players stay out of here and keep to PUB and fortnite.There is a problem with Gforce Now where tha game automatticaly looses connection after about 5-10 min of gametime and quits the game. It would be really nice if this problem was fixed quickly."",1"
4052,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is good but for some reason their security system found records of cheating on this system even though i've never cheated in me fooking life so this game's anti-cheat system is garbage,0

"",1"
"4056,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewOk, so, data collection aside, the game is pretty good. If something good is free then YOU are the product.Mobility is nice and diverse (glider, snowboard and climbing pack).Biggest problem (in my opinion) are the bots. The game auto-fills a server with bots. I would say there are around 15-20 players/game out of 50.That being said, it's probably going to get better as the player base increase, but I would rather wait 2-3 mins for a game queue rather than play with bots (most queues are around 15secs). AI is dumb as all hell and on top of that sometimes it glitches and they just stand there for target practice.It's obvious it is not finished and they still need to add a lot of stuff. There is only 1 map and pistols are, for the most part, useless. There are no upgrades for them. Shotguns are also kind of useless as most engagements happen over long distances.If you're scared about the game sniffing around your PC you can try to sandbox it, I guess, or in a virtual machine. I play it on an HD7700 as an emergency since my regular card blew out a few weeks ago and I get decent fps for such a large map.I've been playing it with some buddies and we had quite a bit of fun with some intense moments.Customization is pretty low at the moment with few clothing items available and NO snow camouflage or white items whatsoever, mostly dark color apparel making you stick out like a sore thumb on that white background.

"4057,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewBest battle royal out there! Iv played PUBG, Fortnite and son. I was even playing ROE when it was only avalible in thailand. The map is amazing and the variety of transport is great (car, snowbord, glider, gondaler and skimobile). the wepons are great and has an awesome variety. the game machanics work great and are super smooth, you don not need to buy the game pass to win but its there id you want it! this is a true free game with some micro transactions but you dont need to buy them to win. I'm addicted to this game and so are my friends its great fun playing solo or as a squad."",1"
"4058,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewI hate BR games, but this one is the first I really liked. Loot is evenly spreadSweet mechanic with gliders and snowboardsSatisfying hitregLooks greatYou can swap between 2 scopes on the same weapon just by pressing V. Attachments auto equips when lootedLooting is fast"",1"
4059,Ring of Elysium,,Access ReviewThis game is like if Fortnite and Ghost Recon had a four-way with Final Fantasy and SSX. The gunplay is ridicuously solid for a free game and the spawn system and 3 equipment loadouts are a fun twist on an overbranded genre. Abso-freaking-lutely recommend this game.,1
"4060,Ring of Elysium,,""Access ReviewI am really surprised about this. The idea of Paragliding/Snowboarding/Climbing fits really well into the game. Movement and weapon mechanics feel good (not as arcade as CoD but still no Arma realism), a bit faster game play than PUBGLong term motivation might lack a bit but I hope the will come up with new maps.Speaking about maps. The current map is done pretty well. Far more details than PUBG and therefore a more interesting environment."",1"
"4061,Ring of Elysium,,""Access ReviewThis game is great to play with friends but at times I find myself playing alone....and still love the game. The only Problem is that there are no AU sever, But me and my mate have over came this by palying on close by severs. Would recommend it to anyone who like's a good battle royale game"",1"
"4062,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewLet's do it really short......because I don't wanna put too much time into reviewing a """"game"""" that is pretty much still in developement and has not too many complex features.1. Is this game an innovative Battle Royal?Well, I'd say it's a very fresh new touch to the variety of BR games that were released over the last 2 years or so.It has some nice new mechanics (Start-Kits) and brings a very interesting zone mechanism with a unique end-game.2. Is this a good game?Ignoring the facts I've listed above, this game honestly needs some decent polishing before I would even bother commenting on the quality of the game in general. There are some main issues (desync, fps, some graphical glitches) that will probably be worked on very soon. It's pretty much as good/bad in terms of stability as PUBG (and I obviously have to make this comparison) with fewer FPS but less desync and drops and the handling feels a bit smoother overall. Graphics are pretty neat, same bad textures for some objects and terrains as in PUBG. RoE also has some really good QoL features that certainly makes it a bit more casual than PUBG but also more enjoyable from my pov (e.g. Scope Swaping, Auto-Attach etc.).3. Is this a fun gamel?Yes! Snowboarding, climbing, ziplines, paragliding, it's a lot of fun in terms of dynamic gameplay and movement over the map. The gunplay is decent, guns feel solid but recoil is pretty much absent. You also got hitmarkers.4. Would I recommend this game?Yes! It's free and it's more casual and more entertaining than PUBG imho.So go ahead, download it and give it a try. You'll not regret it. It's especially enjoyable with friends, gliding in a 4-man squad or showing off your best SSX snowboard moves while getting to the next zone.Closing wordsWith some time and good decision making by Tencent Games this will soon be a gem and probably overtake PUBGs daily player count on Steam. It's like a mix of a casual PUBG and a more mature Fortnite without forts and with a lot of snow.Thanks for reading and have a lot of fun with RoE!"",1"
4063,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,Early Access ReviewThis game does have good aspects in terms of weapon pickink up and supportive equipments yet the anti-cheat engine is useless. Skilled players got banned by some silly overwatches even if  they did not cheat. Accounts got recovered and development team does apologise for this BUT THIS IS ANNOYING. Overall neutral.,1
"4064,Ring of Elysium,2018.0,""Early Access ReviewVery promising (casual) battle royale! Looks and plays like a cross between H1Z1 and PUBG, but the hit registration is much better. As Tencent is the publisher (and developer) we have a sort of guarantee of future development, but even as an early access title this is very polished and great fun. The first person models can feel a bit rigid, but the shooting is solid and netcode is excellent. There can be a little stuttering with vehicles, but besides that i haven't experienced a shred of lag or any bugs. Movement is very tight and responsive.There's little else to say at the moment. It's an excellent battle royale game - it also allows up to four players to win in the form of escaping the map with a helicopter, but unfortunately many players will not allow you to get out without a fight - even when there's only four of you left. And the fear of getting shot while approaching the ladder doesn't allow you to let them approach you while making a run for it yourself. But hey, that's Free for all for you.Hackers naturally do exist and especially now that the game has gone f2p. From my experience they are much more prevalent in the squads gamemode than in solo."",1"
