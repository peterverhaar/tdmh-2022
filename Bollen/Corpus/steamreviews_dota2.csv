"2068,Dota 2,2014.0,""Dota.... Dota has its times where you play with your friends with a max team of 5... However things happe. When alone you are swarmed with Asians, Mexicans, Russians , and maybe even aliens who would know. Also Aliens will watch and learn about the people in this world by peoples name calling and yelling. You will be screamed at by other languages and dont know what is going on. Then you will be in games with blamers that blame everything on you. Filled with racism and Yelling 10/10"",1"
"2069,Dota 2,2014.0,""I used to play this game with kind of delight. But it was a long time ago when everything started. You know- you came from school to play some good games, start picking and ... OH MY GOOOD! There are no supports and whole your team is speaking some kind of magic language, that you can heard only in fairytales. Yea I am talking about azbuka. And you know, doesen't matter if you checked before finding the game that you wanna play with english speaking people, oh no! It really doesen't matter if you checked EU or NA region, or no... They are everywhere you watch, even in your bed. There is aboslutelly no hope to get anything normall from them. You can just enjoy their mighty &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥quot"
"2070,Dota 2,2016.0,""I am Jose, i used to be believe that i was a casual player, til my mind changed entirely. i started to play DOTA1 when i was 9 years old, i started DOTA2 3 years ago.Getting out of a gaming addiction can be really hard. Its very underrated, people think it's just a video game, its nothing. But an addiction is an addiction, From personal experience I can tell you that cutting down your time playing DOES NOT WORK. At least it didn't for me. It's much easier to stop completely. I cant stop and im not planning on doing it. However, You need to make up your mind and JUST PUT AN END TO IT. Unless you plan on being a professional gamer. and I am kinda working on it. This is a great game, you can have a lot of fun, you need skills. a lot of practice. and PATIENCE. Players of all kinds in this game, from the most toxic, to the most charismatic, I like to believe i am part of the cool ones, even tho the number of reports i get everyday is hella big Lol.  I am into Dota 2 for about 3.5 years. It initially started as a casual pastime and later turned into a full blown addiction. Even in college. And it got to a point that I was bunking classes almost everyday to sit in my room and play DOTA for 9-10 hours straight. I was on numerous Dota forums, all I thought about was how I could get better at Dota. My life was Dota. One of the main reasons behind the addictiveness of Dota 2 is that you are able to escape your real life problems and unlike your real life, you are in full control of your character in Dota 2 which makes it even more enticing, along with other things which I am sure you already know. Why is my nickname """"Addicted"""" ?- Its actually funny cause it was my high school principal who told me to call me like that.         Its a pretty good game, but BE AWAREPeruvians and russians are coming for you..Addicted ^^"",1"
"2071,Dota 2,2012.0,""It's a purgatory simulator based on the existential novel No Exit, in which you are trapped in a game with 9 other people who hate you. You spend your time killing the same enemies, who spawn every 30 seconds for all eternity, until you have amassed an arbitrary amount of gold/items with which you kill the other team. The worst 2 players in the game are blamed for every mistake made and ridiculed without mercy, while the player with the highest kill/death ratio (often times not the best player) calls you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for the 60 minute duration. It's a nice game and I highly recommend it."",1"
"2072,Dota 2,2014.0,""Don't bother spending hundreds on other language learning programs, or ones that claim to be the best, like Rosetta Stone. DotA 2 has the market cornered and you would have to be a fool to pay anything for these """"superior"""" pieces of software when DotA 2 is completely free of charge! When you want to learn a new language, simply queue for your region, and select the language that you already know. Valve's patented system will immediately match you with other language speakers who will get you on the fast track to success! You will love your learning experience. I can guarantee that you will not grow to hate other cultures due to a language barrier, because soon you will be able to speak Portugeuse, Spanish, Russian, and Chinese!"",1"
2073,Dota 2,2016.0,Dota 2 is a very addictive game but since 7.00 the new update released the game in my opinion has dropped alot the game is basically broken with alot of stupid builds with the new skill tree making some heros way to broken and some just stupidly bad they are not even worth playing anymore and the HUD has ruined the game for me i can play 2 games and then feel sick because of the HUD making it very hard for me to play the changes to the shop has made it harder to buy items and i just personally hate the way the they never considered the HUD Effects that alot of players have spent money on to get and now with the new update the HUD Effects are basically worthless and hardly change anything the new hero monkey kind is cool and all but with all the other changes like the broken skill tree with some heros and the HUD changes i find this game extreamly less enjoyable,0

"2075,Dota 2,2016.0,""Haven't enjoyed 7.00 at all.Playing a support feels terrible now with the changes to visibility and the maze of trees/stairs everywhere, trying to ward is just a nightmare.It feels like as soon as one team starts getting ahead it just snowballs with the new talent system.Before 7.00 Dota was the only game I played but can't see myself continuing, it's basically a completely different game."",0"

"2083,Dota 2,2014.0,""Dota 2 is a fps developed by bungie in 1998 for the nintendo 64. Its a game that presents itself as a point and click adventure, similarly to the """"best game of the year 10/10 - New york times"""" Gone home, you play a young lesbian trying to find love, however the game presents multiple obstacles to keep you from achieveing your goal. The obstacles are mostly stuns and supressions that every playable champ in the game has access to, accept for surpressor who has access to a global ult that puts all his opponents into low prio but thats another story. The game also has access to cool cosmetic items that give players direct access to their facebook allowing everyone to see how vibrant and colorful their language is when losing an mmorpg. Dota 2 is also an amazing language software, on pare with Rosetta stone that allows players to learn multiple languages, including but not limited too, Russian, Mexican, Spanish, Burrito Burrito Taco, ecceterra. I would highly suggest this game to you and your friends, despite it being so over priced at 89.99 msrb, it is worth every penny. Dota 2 is also the only good video game to come out in the last 28 years and will stay that way for years to come, and thats how i spent my summer vacation - ferris bueller"",1"
"2084,Dota 2,2016.0,""Bad game overall. Unbalanced heroes, unfixed bugs, bad servers. If you want to stay sane, don't play this game. Matchmaking doesn't work. Valve only cares about money. The best game in moba genre has turned into the worst during the last 3 years. This game doesn't offer any fun anymore. Only suffering."",0"
2085,Dota 2,2016.0,The games ruined.  The community is only toxic now.  I thought I could come back to play a few casual games but nope.  The community got worse over time.  People just call eachother horrible names and its sad.  This game is done.  Next 5 years its gunna be a meme,0
"2086,Dota 2,2017.0,""Only skill is needed unlike the rest of the F2P MOBA games you can find on the net. Can't really go wrong with that. Other games force you to pay for heroes even. The community is total cancer though, but one could say the same for EVERY other online game in existence.Just... watch your wallet... the shinies in this will eat through it faster than a hungry hamster in a pile of sunflower seeds."",1"
2087,Dota 2,2016.0,Dota 2 is probably the best MOBA game I've ever played. I had more fun in Dota 2 than I ever did with LOL but don't have as many personal friends who play it like I do with LOL.I enjoy the customization and the free items with the added ability to trade items easily and even sell them which is really nice and some of the many things that made the game nicer than LOL which is a great MOBA but just not as good.,1

"2090,Dota 2,2017.0,""I started playing this in 2007 and I managed to finally quit it in 2015. Dota was my life and I have never played any other moba game. There were days where I wake up, play dota, fall asleep and repeat.

"2092,Dota 2,2014.0,""This game is total garbage, with the worst community I've ever seen in any multiplayer game. The game will lower your IQ if you indulge in it over extended periods of time and will also ruin your mental state. Caution, it causes depression and explicit anger.MMR is broken, and every server you play on is Russian. The only good thing is that you'll acquire some knowledge about the Russian language aswell as some of their mental capabilities (if they even exist)."",0"

"2095,Dota 2,2014.0,""Defense of the Ancients 2 or DotA 2 for short, is like being addicted to an extremely harmful substance. No matter how many times you queue for Europe West and get Russians.

"2096,Dota 2,2016.0,""What is DOTA? It's very advanced and limitless game where no one learns all heroes to play at pro level. DOTA is for players who wants compatition, party games, play with friends, learn how to rage, be good at solo, play tournaments, league games, learn new languages and son on. Side effects may include...Blurred vision, memory loss, extreme paranoia, time displacement and rage."",1"
"2097,Dota 2,2014.0,""I can't really write a good review for the ever-changing landscape that is Dota2. But I will say the following generic things:Dota2 is not a simple team game. There are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online. You come into Dota to have fun with """"tools"""", every character is a different tool. They move different, they turn different, they attack differently. If you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little, small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange, then this is for you. If you come from any fighting game for example, you can get into this. Like really into this.What makes Dota2 different from other MOBAs? Depth. Dota offers much more variety, much more freedom to experiment. Other MOBAs shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools. You have items that give you more movement options, that take away movement options from the opponent, even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically. In other games you will find these """"options"""" baked into a character, they try to guide you into learning how a character """"should"""" be played. Dota2 gives you the sandbox to experiment, As a reminder, it's never anyone's fault when you fail to build your tool properly. This is a game. Have fun.Most people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle, and Valve facilitates this. But you don't have to. Everything depends in Dota2. Should you try Dota2? Yes. But remember to have fun. You will be playing a game that can last 1 hour per match. Enjoy. Smile. A lot of people forget this. If you're not enjoying Dota2. Uninstall."",1"
"2098,Dota 2,2014.0,""This is a MOBA game, what else could I say about it?I'm pretty sure you've read a bunch of reviews upon dota before coming to this review. Getting straight to the point that this game is probably worth playing if you're interested in facing individuals across the internet, with the probability of being skilled in tactics and strategy. These strategies and tactics are accomplished via the vast cast of characters within dota, each with their own set of abilities, roles (most characters are not confined to their specificed roles), and given a wide variety of items that can produce a devastating or riduculous combination that will cripple the enemy team.If you're up to play this game, let it be discerned that how you interact with your teammates is vital in your aim to win the match against the opposing team. An example of what I mean would be communication: within this game, you will not always be paired with individuals that you will be on equal footing with, however you and the other persons that comprise your team will have to compromise to make of what you can to achieve the same goal: TO WIN. In addition, aside how you communicate with another, you could gain ideas of how to play a certain character, plot ingenius tactics, and enjoy the sensation of teamwork resulting from communication.Leaving off on one final note: Remember that every loss within dota, show be a gain via reflection. See what has been done wrong or hasn't been done at all with your comrades, and together offer strategies and suggestions for future matches. Do not let the loss of a match get to your head"

GG EZ. - The skills in the skill tree are terrible, let's give heroes free lifesteal, triple silence, triple sniper shot...Cool...but not what those heroes are to me.- Level 25 CM? With blink, drums, hex, and aghs 40 min game? NO PROBLEM- And since all heroes changes etc. are based around the above♥♥♥♥♥♥skill tree, that just means EVERYTHING is terrible.- Please rename game either STORM : Heroes of the League of Dota from Newerth.... OR Level 25 Rush Simulator.- The Arcade style VS thing....is just....nasty.- HEAPS more clowns than usual, Congrats your patch cleaned the bottom of the barrel- The Stats tab being gone and not being levelable is terrible.- Wanna know how much int your OD has vs enemy to calculate damage? Goodluck if you don't know the game and heroes inside out,,,,but we making it noob friendly don't worry.- The damage, MS and armour tab is just♥♥♥♥♥♥ - Let's add a backpack to make it less confusing, its worse than ever....I'd rather have it drop on the ground thanks.- The Pre Planning is nifty, but should be kept for captain's mode, i want to have fun, and not reason with 4 random idiots why not having a courier is a bad idea before the game even starts- This game no longer feels like dota....having played HON, HOTS and League, it feels like none of them, but like a bastard child spawned of 4 way incest. THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN- The performance issues are terrible- The servers are somehow worse than ever- I feel let down having downloaded 6.6GB of this♥♥♥♥♥♥br>I have a old image on external which i will never update to keep the memory of the game you guys ruined. If your intent is to force people to play this mess, with no regards for year long fans, give us a mod so we can search for games of a version of our choosing. OR SOMEONE MAKE A MOD PLEASE.While i have friends that have found this to be great, some have complained that the above appears to be more noticeable when playing solo. Maybe with 4 Friends this can still be great given the right circumstance.I accept many will disagree with all of this, but reviews are what our perceptions are on said things, and this is just mine.

"2109,Dota 2,2014.0,""Being an old League of Legends player I really needed some time off LoL since I knew every champion, every item and every possible outcome for hero duels, I came to Dota 2. If you are just like me then I would strongly suggest taking a look at dota 2. It is much more realistic and I can guarantee it once you get to know a little bit the mechanics of the game and if you play it with a friend or two then you will have so much fun. No bugs whatsoever, very fluid game and most of all very diverse range of heroes. The only bad thing there might be (from what I have seen) is that there is quite a big number of trolls in the game."",1"
"2110,Dota 2,2016.0,""Dear developers,I really loved playing DOTA2 until you guys ruined it with the new update. I've invested money to make my heroes look nice but now, I cant enjoy that because of the new patch, Would it be possible to revert back to the old patch but still have the new hero? I know Monkey King came from HoN because I've played him before there. Also, as for the shop items, it would be nice to revert back to the old one too. The old patch is a representation of DOTA2's uniqueness. The new design in my opinion, is trying to emulate LoL or HoN. Please bring back DOTA2's uniqueness. "",0"

"2114,Dota 2,2013.0,""I played this game because friends asked me to. With 20 hours under my belt, I can safely say I still have absolutely no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ I'm doing.This game is NOT beginner-friendly. If this is your first MOBA, you need to start with something lighter, because DOTA 2 will completely overwhelm you. There's very little balance, players will treat you like trash (because most of the community is built of DOTA 1 players who already know the ins-and-outs) and you will struggle to find the right guides that will show you what you're doing wrong.If you're playing with friends who are much better than you, you'll only be holding them back. If you're playing with friends who are much worse than you, you'll grow tired of playing with them. DOTA 2 is like a fine wine -- a lot of fun for somebody experienced. Tastes like pee for a newbie."",0"
"2115,Dota 2,2016.0,""This is a game with potential, genuinely good qualities, but it has severe issues.DOTA 2 requires teamwork to win, but it is filled with incompetent & abusive players. To make matters worse, matchmaking results are not balanced. One team often has better players than the other right from the start.Neither of these issues would be severe, if not for a punishment system which forces you to remain in 60-90 minute matches that are unbalanced & abusive. Despite the game having two modes, ranked & unranked, and the latter being described as casual, both are virtually the same.I have advocated that if unranked is indeed meant to be the """"casual"""" mode of DOTA 2, then the punishment system for inactivity & abandoning, should not apply here.After remaining in a miserable 60-90 minute match to avoid an abandon & subsequent low priority, you may still get reported by abusive players. In DOTA 2 it isn't uncommon for a player to blame you for their own mistakes & then report you. Example, seen people solo tower diving or jungling alone in the enemies territory & as soon as they die they blame everyone else. The time when you're most likely to receive a fraduluent report is when your team has a party of 3 or 4 people, and you're the outsider"

"2117,Dota 2,2016.0,""New Edit at 30.12.2017After changes during 7.00-> onward the game did come out of the issues previously stated. However, theres still some major issues that has and never will apparently be addressed properly:1. Alt / Smurf / Troll / etc. accounts. Even after the """"add your phone"""" system, there has been no change in the amount of clear alt and troll accounts. On the contrary: after Turbo mode was introduced it seems the old ranked mode is even more filled with people who should just be permanently banned.2. Scripters: Issue that is not widely screamed about, but is there. On this issue I have no idea how well Valve is hunting them down and how common it really is. What I do know, is that you sometimes stumble on players abusing scripts and the only way to really know is to watch and analyze the replay.3. Overall toxic behavior that will never disappear as long as alt accounts are possible. There are just so many players that aren't just abusive in chat. They intentionally destroy games for the entire team. Didn't get mid? well, i'll just sit in base and get 100 xp every 5 mins from jungle and then sit in base watching youtube again. Or I'll just buy all wards and place them in our fountain because of reason x.4. After the talent introduction I feel the game has gone in a downward spiral in terms of balance. There has never been so clear meta than after 7.00. Every patch there are heroes with insane winrates on all mmr ranges.-------------------------------I have to say that I'v always thought Dota as the best MOBA out there in terms of gameplay and the insanely high skill cap. A much of that remains now that 7.00 came out, but in the mean while the GUI is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to the point that the game doesn't feel right anymore.However, the issue isnt only the GUI. A major issue is the new map imo. Suddenly the map became a super open world that doesn't have the same boundries it used to have. Theres just way too many ways to invade opposing side of the map making the world feel like its an open arena instead of radiant and dire side.I have to say that my first impressions on the new patch is leaving me with the feeling that I don't wanna play dota2 anymore at all.Edit: 7th of Feb 2017After some UI fixes the game has started to look like Dota again. However, during these new updates things have gone in other ways a lot worse.After some changes to the match making system and report system, there has been a significant raise in unjustified low priority games. You can get low priority for anything now. Example: Muted after 3 games of summary showing 0-3. Didn't say a word during those games, won 1, lost 2. After which a 4 game winstreak (still muted) and receive 3 games in low priority.Problem is that opponents are able to report you. If you play certain heroes you will farm reports like theres no tomorrow. I kinda have to say, Im starting to feel im finally done with this game for good and won't put any more money into it."",0"
"2118,Dota 2,2015.0,""Learning Dota 2 is like learning the entire history of the world, every civilization, every war, every political situation, every nit-picky historical detail. Except valve keeps changing the history every patch.It took me 1000 hours to actually say """"Huh, I think I now completely understand how to play the game properly"""". And even that was achieved by being a dota nerd, watching guides, theorycrafting 24/7 while eating or sitting on the toilet or traveling or trying to sleep. It becomes an obsession, a challenge to learn the entire game. Only to unlearn and relearn everything again every major patch. It's more mind straining than getting an academic education or even trying to get a PHD. I never thought of the game as worth the effort and time investment.So why keep playing if one thinks it just isn't worth the time investment? At first it was the damn human curiosity, experimenting every detail and enjoying the results. But after that phase 2 main reasons remained: too much free time and not having another game to play. Mainly it was the latter reason. Me and my friends would find some games, play them until we were bored, find singleplayer games, finish them, aand then there was nothing to do. So no other game? Back to dota. I hated this vicious circle. I tried to quit atleast 15 times, deleted the game several times while I had a really poor download speed, tried quitting by removing my monitor from the house, changed the pw of my only account in windows to something really long and gave it away to somebody so I couldn't open the computer, deleted steam entirely several times and tried much, much more things to quit. I couldn't. Stuck in the loop, I kept trying to improve my gameplay by watching high level players play and explain the game. Until one day...I came across ChiLongQua's youtube channel...The first video I saw, he was non-stop feeding the enemy team, while complaining about the issues in the game such as:-im 5k yet i always get matched with 4k ♥♥♥♥♥tains that don't know how to play the game, you have to forcefully tell them on mic what to do-last game my teammate gave up and fed for a puny argument and if my game gets ruined, im gonna ruin someone elses gameMy first thought was: """"Huh, an annoying tryhard rager kid that flames everyone on voice chat just because he lost some games"""". But the more I watched, the more I understood his psychology and his reasoning behind his actions. It is a long story but in the end I eventually decided to feed like him just to understand his mentality even more. And boy, was that a turning point. I analyzed everyones reactions as i went down mid and gave my life as a gift to the enemy team. First, I realized how♥♥♥♥♥♥ and inefficient the enemy team was at killing me. I ran around under their tower and they still struggled to kill me. This alone made me realize the enemy team is way worse than I am at the game. My teammates reacted to the situation like expected. But in the sentences they produced I was able to understand they are simply stupid. The results were amazing. I was enlightened.After this feeding session, I played my next game normally(while still thinking in my mind that I am the best player in the game) and I stomped that game. I stomped the next game after that. This was weird. Because I had been stuck at that my mmr for years. But the change of my mindset gained me 600 mmr in less than 10 days. Realizing that I will almost always have to carry my team if I want to win, I will always have inferior players to me in my team and the enemy team, I was able to slowly stop playing dota. I realized the game as a whole was a pile of mess, that cant be fixed, if you dont fix the players. So my hatred for dota grew day by day, and one day I deleted the game for the last time. It has been over 2 years since I last played dota. The hatred kindling, kindled by CLQ grew so big that I was able to finally quit. CLQ had saved me.Later I played dota again with my friends once several months when new big patches came. But I wasnt getting addicted anymore. I was able to enjoy the game with my friends again.This game is a vacuum that will suck your life and soul in. There is no ending to this game. Valve will keep trying to manipulate players to come back to the game by updating, even if the game is balanced. They will ruin the balance to keep the game interesting and fresh. Because its business. More players playing = More skins sold, more crates opened. Even the ♥♥♥♥♥iest jobs of today does at least pays you back, so you can buy food and some other things you like, keep your life going. But dota doesn't. Don't live dota. Most of the players aren't even playing dota to have fun anymore. They play it to shout and get shouted at, after a day of stressful work. Dota 2 is a psychiatric hospital that doesn't fix people, it only makes them worse.I certainly don't regret any of my playtime I have on this game. But I am glad I dont have any more hours than what I had currently spent on it. If it wasn't for CLQ and the enlightenment he provided me, I would have sunk about 5k hours into this game by now. (Sadly, he is still playing dota forcing himself to be positive and not rage. He defies his own past, defies his own opinions. Just because youtube is an income for him. His position is just sad.)With that many hours, you can master any craft, study anything to become one of the best at the subject. But if you sink 5k hours into dota, you will still be an above average player. If you don't go pro, you get nothing in return. Stop lying to yourself. You aren't having fun playing this game. It became a stressful work a long time ago. Think about it.If you don't agree with anything I said, just go ruin a game, purposefully feed and analyze the other players reactions. One game won't hurt. Then think about all of the above, again.If you are already a high skilled but non pro player with your teenage years buried into this game, think about other games you couldve spent a fraction of time on and became one of the top players, earning all that e-sports money you can't get playing dota 2. Since you never actually played any other game while not thinking about dota in the back of your head, you are unable to comprehend that there are other fun games out there, that don't require wasting 10 years of your 70 year life to learn.03.05.2017Ahmet Faruk Albayrak"",0"

Through the recent gameplay patches of 6.87 and 6.88, there have been many new changes that focuses more on the strategic aspects of the game, namely Scans and cheaper more defensive items.New items such as Echo Sabre and Hurricane Pike also serve to make competitive games more exciting as teams that have fallen behind in the early game now have a chance to comeback with the cheaper mid-tier but very cost-efficient items giving them an opportunity to fight back.""""Everything can work""""As a whole, Dota 2 has become a game very much focused on positioning and the right draft composition of heroes for the game match at hand. No particular strategy has dominated the tournament scene this year, be it push, defensive splitpush, or teamfight, and it is this remarkable balance that allows many teams with varied style tendencies to showcase their way of playing without feeling disadvantaged. Be it EG's methodical lane dominance and calm style, MVP Phoenix's all-in teamfight style, EHOME's strategic drafting style, or TI6 Winners - Wings' anything goes style.Valve has also shown interest in further expanding the game through its released custom games feature for Dota 2 and Virtual Reality support for spectating. Overall, its been a good year for Dota 2, the game is more fun than ever with any strategy being workable, all heroes being viable in competitive tournaments and more expanded options for spectating, viewing games and analysing replays and statistics that aficionados would love.2015:Over the course of a year, Dota 2 has slowly introduced its Source 2 game client, which allows for easier integration of custom games similar to the original system of Warcraft 3's Battle.net. The International 2015 tournament is also a huge success and has a record $18.4 million, of which $16.8 million were contributed by community spending. Valve has also revealed its future plans for the game in the form of quarterly Majors tournaments that is meant to further develop its competitive scene and community interest.It is also clear that Dota 2 will be taking a seasonal games events approach towards stimulating community support, with obvious targets being December Holidays, Chinese New Year and Halloween. With regards to porting over Dota 1's legacy, there are only 2 heroes left: Arc Warden and Pitlord"

"2137,Dota 2,2014.0,""So here we are...I have started playing Dota 2 in 2014 and from that time, i have to say, it has drastically changed.We could have seen many updates and map changes going through the history, but by time the community got worse, with each update that has came, since people started playing just the overpowered heroes to complete their quests for compendiums and other♥♥♥♥♥♥BUT. Dota 2 is an AMAZING game with a lot of possibilites. You and other 4 heroes are defending your towers against other 5 enemy heroes and you try to destroy their towers, leading to destroying the Ancient, after that, you win and you can go play another match again. If you have friends, that don't mind to spend few cold nights with ya playing Dota 2, just grab them and start having fun. There are over 100 heroes in the game, so it will take you a lot of time to master all of them (after my 3k hours, i am far from mastering one of them, heh). Then there are frequent updates that keep the game fresh, LOADS of mods (official ones or community ones).Game is maintained and is definetly one of the best games for free you can find around.I have found that the game is quite distracting or way too complex at the beginning for new players. The tutorial just isn't enough to get you going, so if you have a friend with some hours already played, ask him for a help, because trust me, you will need it. Matchmaking still needs some work since it is unbalanced sometimes aswell as some heroes.This game is about keeping going. If you give up, you have no place in this game. If your nerves are strong enough and you can cooperate with your team (i know it isn't always possible, since the teammates suck often), you will have much better experience than people that keep raging.

"2142,Dota 2,2014.0,""A maelstrom of anger, fear, disillusionment and sheer ecstasy - Dota 2 is all these things and more. You’ll learn to hate your friends and love random strangers during the forty five minutes of an average match. In that short span of time, grudges will be born, heroes will rise and poor plays will be vilified like a G R R Martin epic. And yet for all its emotional drama, both highs and lows, you’ll still yearn for more. Just learning to play is an adventure into masochism. Everyone begins as a dreaded n00b, unable to contribute anything but gold and XP to the opposing team. A few weeks later and they’ll have learned a few tricks: where to place wards, how to turn off auto attack in the options and, crucially, the ability to take abuse on the chin without rage quitting. Give it a few months and they’ll be rolling with the regulars. Double stacking, recrowing and GGWP will become part of their vernacular. Immunity to the insults will be delivered upon their chins which have since grown thick with stubble and caloused skin. They'll have succesfully joined an inclusive club whose members include the heroes of the world's burgeoning e-sports scene. Consider the football metaphor, pub matches are like a kick about down the local park using the same boots, strips and footballs Rooney, Messi and Neymar use in packed stadiums full of shouting people.      If all of the above sounds a bit much then ask yourself: What’s the point of playing if you don’t feel something in the end?  Dota 2 delivers passion and fury in spades, and like all great games its hidden depths forever tease like sirens upon the rocks, always ready to punish an overblown sense of ego. Just don’t look at the item store"

The objective is simple enough, destroy the opponent's Ancient which lies deep within their territory. Graphically speaking, the game is best in all the games out there for sure, very nice animations, looks of the heroes can be improved though, to me they look more like cartoons and I would like a realistic approach for them. Voice acting is nice as well, soundtrack can be improved. The best part of this game is that its not pay to win, all the items that you can get only alters your look in some way and not your performance in the game so no matter what weapon you are using. Be it vanilla or $10 weapon for a hero, it will do same damage to the opponent in all cases. I for one don't care much about Hero looks so its a big plus for me.All in all a very good and polished game. It also updates very frequently which is good and bad depending on your bandwidth.

"2150,Dota 2,2014.0,""Итак Dota 2 - игра для тех кто умеет размышлять и кто не является """"тормозом"""".Давайте же рассмотрим плюсы и минусы этой игры.Начнем с минусов, хоть и каждый, имеющий  желание отнести эту игру к самому отрицательному, из всего с чем он сталкивался когда либо, способен найти для себя очень много минусов dota 2, но а я рассмотрю самые банальные.1. В процессе игры человек познает всю силу и мощь русского языка, а точнее ненормативной лексики, которая встречается довольно часто в ходе игры.2. Из-за сильных переживаний, как за своего героя так и за качество игрового процессе у союзников, повышается вероятность психологического расстройства, а все потому что в игре встречаюся, так называемые """"Раки"""" (чаще на миду).-""""Рак""""(днище, нуб, ракал, лол и т.д.)- зто один (несколько) игроков в вашей команде, которые просто шокируют своим профессиОНАЛизмом игры в dota 2. Многие из таких игРАКов даже утверждают о том, что имели возможность""""наказывать"""" ваших близких и родственников, с помощью полового вмешательства.3. Матч длится, в среднем 30-40 минут, и таких матчей может быть больше 15 за день, все потраченное время на игры можно было провести с пользой для себя или же для близких вам людей. Как можно назвать, то время которое вы потратили, за сутки, играя в dota 2? Пожалуй я назову это время - """"пустотой"""".Минусы, в любой ситуации, найти намного проще, чем плюсы, но все же я попытаюсь это сделать.1. Многие считают, что ничего положительного нет в игре, но а как же мышление, память, помощь союзнику по команде, даже немного математики присутствует, и это все положительные стороны игры.2. Dota 2 помогает научится расчитывать своего героя приимущества и приимущества противника, а также недостатки как свои так и его, бывают ситуации когда это все нужно расчитать за пару секунд. Для всего этого необходимо знание героев, предметов, ну и конечно немного интуиции.3. Я всегда задавался вопросом, как это однообразие карты, героев и цели игры, не надоедает игроку? На самом деле каждая игра это """"маленькая жизнь"""", которую проживаешь всегда на одной и той же карте, но всегда с новыми людьми, сколько людей, столько и вариантов развития игрового процесса. Поэтому никакого постояного, раздражающего, однообразия - нет и быть не может. А вывод из всего этого, что каждый сам для себя решает, положительное воздействие или отрицательное дает ему эта игра.p.s. Не игра меняет человека в плохую или же хорошую сторону, а человек должен сам себя настраивать, только вот """"ЗА"""" или """"ПРОТИВ"""" игры, решить должен сам за себя а не игра за тебя или же мнение окружающих. Ты - сам себе хозяин и в силах настроить себя куда угодно!!! "",1"

After politely asking foreigners to speak english while on US West servers, they respond with reports, death threats and various other verbal abuses. This game has also taught me many skills in terms of raging.

The game's brilliant matchmaking will take 8 minutes to help you get paired up with players clearly above your league, just for the sake of getting youâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in every possible area (many you never even knew existed). Additionally, the 8 minute matchmaking system will also pair you with downies, russians, autists and Josh Elliot, who will all most likely blame their 20 minute loss on you.

Of course, there is a way to skip this, and that is by abandoning. After abandoning a match, you will play in a low priority pool for X amount of games. The low priority pool is where you will finally get a chance to play with fellow American players who speak your language as they are too, people just like you who rage quit a match after hearing """"Chinga tu madre"""" dozens of times thanks to the addition of high quality voice chat.

"2167,Dota 2,2017.0,""I've played Dota a lot. Like, A LOT. I've come to the conclusion that yes, the gameplay is fun, it can be fun with friends, and it is rewarding sometimes, I highly do not recommend it to new people. The community is 16 shades of toxic, the report system is, the best I can describe it, extremely useless, as well, it just shows a total lack of effort from Valve, and their lack of effort to improve the community. One person on your team feeding and raging? Oh well, unless people from another game report him, he's probably not getting low priority. If you play more than one match of Dota a day, you'll probably run out of the allotted weekly reports (3) rather quickly, and the only way to get more within the week is if they act upon the person you report. I've had multiple games with people feeding, spam pinging, or being toxic as hell in general. Whole team reports them, nothing happens. The report was wasted and it feels like a suggestion box connected directly to a trash can. The low priority system just needs to be completely redone. The whole thing is ineffectual, and usually ends up being one maybe two people in the game who got low priority because of Internet problems (I've suffered from quite a few of these and thus my knowledge of the hell that is low priority), while the rest are ragers, spam pingers, and feeders. Yes Dota has very intellegent gameplay, and tons of depth and can be hours and hours of replayable fun, however, with the community how it is, the terrible punishment/report system, and valve's total lack in interest to fix any problems that aren't related to making money, I have to recommend you not download Dota 2"",0"

"2169,Dota 2,2015.0,""""""sooka ♥♥♥♥♥ noob report"""" - your average friendly Russians""""Well played!""""  - chat bind used in a mocking way""""DROP YOUR STICK""""- EternaLEnVy leading his team in a professional wayDota 2 is the leading game of the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genre developed by Valve Software, released in 2011. In Dota 2, players in teams of five control various heroes and abilities in a bid to utterly crush the enemy in a pointless waste of 30-60 minutes.* GameplayDota 2 largely follows the experience of the original Dota All Stars mod: you pick a hero of your choice and get assigned to the Radiant or Dire (formerly known as Sentinel and Scourge) faction with the objective of destroying the enemy's Ancient. Protecting the Ancients is maintained by towers and barracks which ensure lane equilibrium and creep strength. Heroes are initially very weak and must rely on creeps (faceless grunts) to obtain starting gold from which options to start pushing begin, as well as experience which enables leveling up abilities. Abilities range from:   Deal damage (and maybe a status effect)  Inflict a positive or negative buff  Area of effect damage/positive or negative buff  Utilities  Global effects While laning is the main way to gain gold and experience, alternate choices are fighting neutral creeps in the jungle (usually done by very specific heroes) or challenging the mighty Roshan, who drops the fabled Aegis of the Immortal (resurrect on death). In order to maintain the advantage, certain nuances of the game must be learned:  Last hitting/denying (ensuring/denying gold and experience)  Camp stacking (having a single jungle camp hold more creeps than intended)  Creep pull (having allied and neutral creeps fight each other to shift lane equilibrium)  Map vision (prevents ambushes)Of course, having a good Dota 2 experience is defined by your teammates, who may be either incompetent or singlehandedly taking on the entire enemy team and winning. Communication and teamwork are vital, thus it is recommended to play with friends, although it doesn't ensure victory.* Hero roles and balanceEach hero has a set of 4 abilities that have synergy with each other or other heroes' abilities, but more importantly, each has a specific role:  Carry/hard carry - heroes that need a lot of gold and levels to get the ball rolling  Support/hard support - heroes that excel at supporting carries in early stage, and usually   buy support items and stack camps   Jungler - heroes that spend early game in jungle, then ambushing lanes at level 6A hero is not forced to follow a role, although using highly unorthodox tactics will most likely earn you the scorn of your team, possibly giving you a trip to the low priority queue, filled with Russians and similar  friendly  people. Dota 2 often changes with large updates that give heroes buffs or nerfs, change certain mechanics or simply iron out bugs and glitches. The most popular heroes tend to be the ones that have an easy way of dominating games, making you have a hard time if they aren't on your team, although learning to counter them is a great learning experience.* Other interests in Dota 2If you get bored (and you will) of right clicking at the time, the game offers the option of following various e-sport leagues, the biggest being the yearly International hosted by Valve, and famous players (such as Dendi, EternaLEnVy and so on) which set many gameplay trends and strategies. There is also the large economy which is mostly based on altering the looks of heroes and the game, but with no pay-to-win options, except maybe gaudy gold cosmetics. Finally, every Chinese New Year/Halloween/Christmas a slightly different game mode is introduced, thus making the game slightly less stale.* Closing commentsDota 2 is a fairly well made game which offers many hours of play, although the relatively unchanging experience and hostile people may spoil your enjoyment. Personally, I wouldn't suggest getting too involved as you will become highly misanthropic, although I wouldn't say it is a bad game."",0"

The Meta will change, and maybe you'll pick that hero more and more in the future. But now, whenever you replay him, people will see that lowly rank forever after the subscription expires. You'll get flamed, shamed and pressured into renewing a subscription just so you can validate yourself as a dota player.Valve understands its toxic community, I have no doubt they're trying to leverage the harassment that will surely ensue in pubs whether you don't have a pass or didn't renew it.

"2175,Dota 2,2015.0,""Such a FANTASTIC MOBA. You will love every minute of the complex, well made mechanics that you can tell took people a long time to create and put love into. Definatly not pay to win. The reason why I said you SHOULDNT play this game is because of the Community. Everyone is a jerk. Lower ranking games consist of horrible people who have no idea what they are doing, so they blame everyone els on the team. THIS IS ALMOST EVERY GAME. These people make it INCREDIBLY hard to move up or learn from your mistakes because the one guy who has a lot of kills but doesnt help the team in any way is yelling at you. Its just amazing how horrible people are at this game, but are quick to judge. My suggestion is to SKIP this game  because what ever time, place or day you decide to get on to play this BEAUTIFUL game there will be someone who will put you in a bad mood. The only valid way to play this game is to have a group of friends to play with you. If you are missing even one person you will get someone who doesnt want to help you or the team. Again a FANTASTIC MOBA, it is just littered with its community."",0"
"2176,Dota 2,2018.0,""Here is my problem with the recent addition of DotA Plus: Valve openly condemned the use of similar programs in the past, programs like DOTABUFF Plus and a similar program on OverWolf, and I believe they have threatened to or have given temporary bans for people caught using such programs (don't quote me on that last line, only heard rumors about the bans). This was a few months ago, they vocalized this in one of their newsletters. And now, all of a sudden, they want to ride the hype train by offering a paid version of what players can already get for free (with the addition of accesories to try and justify the price). There is nothing intrinsically wrong with DotA Plus in such a way that it offers an unfair advantage - it doesn't increase your damage or anything, it just gives (rarely) useful insight into hero drafting, and that's it. If people feel inclined that they spend money for a computer to tell them how to draft their heroes, jokes on them because again, they are free versions available. In fact, you don't even need a program - what these programs do is basically give you a small, fast windowed version from websitess like DOTABUFF that carry all the statistics such as winrates between heroes and common hero laning. Theoretically you can just alt-tab to the website and type in everything, it's just inconvenient because it takes longer to switch windows and type in a timely manner during the drafting phase. These programs eliminate the inconveniences of alt-tabbing and typing, it automates the search-up of heroes and pops up the results in a wondow. That's it. People have gotten punished for using these draft helpers not long ago (again, only rumored that people got temp-bans) and now Valve decides to turn a blind eye on what they have been doing and make us pay for the same type of program because they added some cosmetics.In other words, Valve banned people who used these free programs because it was 'cheating' (not really), and then come out with the same program but in order to use it, you need to pay by monthly subscription (with hero accessories). Scam if I ever heard one. Not supporting this behavior, too many games get ruined because of actions like this, World of Tanks for one example."",0"

No fake railroad good or bad """"decisions"""" - everything you decide to spend your time on impacts the game either positively or negatively.It's a very complex game and there's a steep learning curve. The game is very teamplay oriented, hence why people get upset if they feel their teammates aren't performing to the best of their ability.Mainly what the game comes down to is who makes the first mistake, and if the other team is able to take advantage of it to create more opportunities and eventually take the enemy's ancient.It's a fun learning experience, as long as one doesn't let the occasional whining or hateful comments get to them."",1"

"2179,Dota 2,2014.0,""When I first started DOTA2 I was a little overwhelmed, as my first ARTS / MOBA game it was pretty complicated. I soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. Before I knew it, I was performing better and better. I stopped making silly mistakes and I got vastly better at not feeding the enemy team. For the most part, everyone I've met was very helpful and nice, there have sometimes the jerk however.

I would say Dota1 was a succes for ICE_FROG , but with dota2 i think he hit the jackpot.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I HAVE YEARS OF DOTA 2after some time. Would like to add the things u might not like about the game, it can be rly fustrating for an old dota player like me as i have decent knowledge about heroes/items/mecanics/tactics.(been playing since dota1 had like no icons for items in shop)  from my understanding the machmaker works like this u win u get ~+25mmr ,for defeat you get -25, well this seems normal but........ some ppl make new accounts to troll or get a better start in mmr...       Sometimes enemy team can have a party , and your team will have none... Some ppl say u actually get worse players in your team if u win too much.... like i used to play with people in party at 3000mmr and i still do. but if u play alone..... well i droped from 3000 to 1500... BECAUSE people don't communicate.. because random ppl will feed either by buying couriers and sending them do die to the enemy, or they don't let u finish your item and kill the courier, or feeding with the hero (sending his hero to the enemy to be killed, enemy gets gold makes more items...you lose)  VALVE will do nothing about feeders, today i see a guy who was obviously muted for doing something bad in the past playing in RANKED LADDER, he started to buy couriers and feed the enemy...also was moving the courier so i won't finish my item. u can report, but they can always play again after few games in low priority... u can block them but the matchmaker could still place them in your team in next game.Valve dosn't care about you.. valve doesn't care.  u can't send replay to anyone.. it's chaos.. my advice don't even bother playing alone."",0"

"2187,Dota 2,2014.0,""One of my favorite games in my library. My play time reflects how much time I have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game. Supports who actually support the team, carries who can carry the team to victory, and players who can execute a base push as timely as the New York Sunway. By the way, I love subway sandwiches. I eat a BLT without the T almost every week. Bacon is the most delicious meat. Lettuce is like the cup to the tea party. You can't have tea without water, and you can't hold water without cups. Unless of course you use your hands. Or your mouth. But lettuce cups are pretty delicious. So imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes. Which while they rhyme with potato, don't taste anything similar. If potatoes tasted like french fries, tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables. Speaking of wet tables, If you put water on tables, it gets wet. Not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated. What is 6X6? Its like 64 or something. Which is like 10 if you add them all together. What does that mean? I am not sure. Math is hard. Unlike DOTA2. Which is a great game. Especially as a carry.Actually I never played carry before. It seems like a pretty easy job though.Just kill things until you win the game. That is a pretty simple job description. Unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle. I mean jungle is a location, how is it a job? It is more like a forest than a jungle. I mean jungles have lions and stuff right? Forests have angry bears. I am not sure where man-birds and horse-men are from though. Horses aren't jungle creatures I think. They sound more like mountain creatures to be honest. I haven't seen a troll before or a gnoll, but I bet they are forest creatures as well too. So jungle should really be called forest.Mid is a pretty self explanatory position. Its the middle of the map lane. Like if you had 3 lanes, he would take the second one. Or she. There are female heroes as well. Are they called heroines? Well I wouldn't want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug. That would be sexist. I mean playing Lina is pretty addicting though. Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire .Its like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx. Thats what lina is. Which reminds me that pokemon recently came out. X and Y are pretty popular with my friends, so I wamt a 3DS. Those things cost money though, but I head I can trade my items for cash. That sounds pretty amazing. Earning money while palying games, its like the American dream for people who don't want actual jobs. Not that I have a job yet. All I do is stay home and read manga. Which is pronounced mane gah, Like mango but with an a. I sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa.So offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane. So the dangerous lane as they would call it. It isn't very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys. Its like chinese vampires and running water. I don't think they can cross running water. Many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing. One flush of the toilet and the go poof. Or do they? I actually know nothing about chinese vampires. I only know vampires from the books my friends lent me. It was the Twilight saga. I really preferred the Jacob to the other guy though. I was pretty upset when Bella made the wrong choice. I mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted. Plus the other guy was like 439434 years old. Yuck!So Support is the last job you can play. Not only do you provide moral support because most teams don't ever have asupport, but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy. Like a slave donkey to carry your items for you. He can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price. Why wouldn't I want another donkey instead of one flying one? I am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one. I mean how would you even catch a flying donkey? It could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful. Like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror. But donkeys are pretty cute. So keep them on the ground. If donkeys were meant to fly, god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic.  So that is Dota. Its a pretty good game. But it has some problems too. After all, even BLT's have T's. Here are the digusting parts of the BLT. Games take a while to finish. So if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me, you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game. A game of Dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours. Like I am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of Dota. I mean look at my avatar. That is my face for like the first 5 minutes of Dota before my legs fall asleep and I start getting cramps. It also has too many different heroes. I think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7. It would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldn't choose any hero. It is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero. You are literally counterpicked because you chose too early. It would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option. Some game modes take forever. Like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans. Sometimes I want to make team electric, but then a ban comes up and I accidentally ban Mr. Thunder or the masked electric emo. Then Team thunder is ruined. I can understand why bans could be good though. Cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy. He uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death. Sometimes he tickles you for extra damage. What is worse is that he eats you, he gets fatter and stronger. The biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action, but not enough story. Its like worse than Dynasty Warriors when it comes to story. I could use a few cutscenes telling me why I am teaming up with a giant spider, a porcupine, a baby rock, and a angel man. At least there was a reason in Dynasty Warriors 7 about why I am fighting Guan Yu with my hated enemies the filthy Wu. Were those filthy Wu actually even men? The way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians. So I think I will give the game a 1/10/14. Its a pretty good game, but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category. I understand that every hero has its own lore, but the bigger connection is quite lost when I team up with my biggest rival against my best friend. A 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game. People play like men instead of filthy Wu women. But Ali, why the 14 and not a 17? Because the game has that huge tomato. And I hate Tomatoes. I love BLT's without the T. BL is the greatest invention of man, till someone introduced the uncessary T. I would have BL everyday if I could afford it, but I have no job and spend all my time reading manga.    "",1"

"2192,Dota 2,2017.0,""I have been playing this game for over a year and I have to say that before I knew about DotA 2, I never would have thought that a game would bring me the greatest pain I've ever felt. Really, everything about this game is toxic and sucks. The community is horrible as ♥♥♥♥ and so is the matchmaking. People picking support heroes actually aren't able to do their job and instead of buying wards and supporting the team, what they are actually meant to do, they go for their ♥♥♥♥ing items first and don't even think about upgrading the courier after minute 3 (yeah, and it's unnecessary to mention that they sometimes don't buy this courier at all). So I am asking myself: Who in the hell♥♥♥♥♥♥into their head for them to do such stupid things? It' all about teamplay in this game and the game can only be won when every player does his job instead of jerking around! And when there are already 4 carries, why the ♥♥♥♥ do you, the last one for picking, go for a carry hero, too? That makes no sense! While playing DotA 2 I discovered that this game brings out a really dark side of me. Normally I'm a calm and relaxed person but DotA 2 forces me to go to the limit and for the first time in my young life I realized that I can be toxic and salty like the rest of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, too when the game doesn't go well because my team mates are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s again. That's why I prefer to play with friends instead of going alone. If it's your lucky day, you will have a nice team which knows how to play and if not, then let me say this: RIP! There is no more to say, really. You will get this cancer gang and the game will be ♥♥♥♥ed up. Furthermore, you will waste more or less 40 minutes of your precious time. But trust me, it will take longer, way longer, trust me. And because you are a masochist like me you won't quit this game, although you often say to yourself that this will be the last game you have ever played before deleting DotA 2. No, instead of quitting the game you will play more and more matches, you will get mad as hell, learn russian (and persian) for free and this will be a vicious circle. You can't get out of it. You are trapped in this game. It's really sad. I've tried so hard but always end up playing when I have some time.So here are my advices:1. Never play alone when you have just started this game and don't have enough experience yet.2. Always have some foods and drinks (preferably alcoholic) next to you, because playing and flaming will burn your energy which you actually need for a win. Or maybe for more flaming.3. Schedule your free time. It's not only 40 minutes you will spend on this game, actually it will be more than this. Sometimes the whole day is ruined by DotA 2. Once you start playing, you can't stop anymore.4.  You have to be thick-skinned or having nerves of steel. There is no other way to endure this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community.You get it? Great! Then I wish you guys lots of joy playing DotA 2! :3"",1"

2196,Dota 2,2014.0,this is an excellnt game if you want a really dynamic playstyle and a unique item shop which offers much variation.

"2198,Dota 2,2014.0,""Dota 2 is a multiplayer game (though you can play against bots). There are two teams of five players - the Radiant, and the Dire. Each player picks from a list of many characters, each with a different set of abilities. The two teams start on opposing sides of the map (there's only one map in the game). Each team has a base area, in which resides an """"Ancient"""". From each base, creeps - these autonomous NPC creatures - spawn periodically in waves, and start a journey toward's the other teams base. Towers are scattered around the map that will automatically fire on any enemy unit.The goal for each team is to destroy the other team's Ancient, while defending their own. Hence: Defense of the Ancients.Sounds simple - but there's a lot more to it than this. Imagine the game starts and both teams just stay in their own base. Creeps from both teams will wander out from one base and head to the other, meeting somewhere in the middle of the map, where they will fight (again, they do this automatically without any player input). The creeps are evenly matched so typically they will both wipe each other out. The next wave of creeps will clean up anything left over - or they'll reach a tower, and get smashed by it - and the cycle will continue.Basically, nothing will happen - the game will not end, because the creeps can't get anywhere. Now imagine just one player from one of the teams goes out with his creeps. He can attack the enemy creeps, and support his own creeps as they make their way across the map, knocking down towers along the way. Eventually, he'll get to the enemy Ancient, and be able to destroy it. But if just one enemy player comes out to meet him, the teams will be more evenly matched - and it comes down to a player versus player (PvP) scenario.The PvP is, of course, the heart of the game. It is of a high level of complexity - the learning curve is quite steep, making it challenging for noobs, which is one of the reasons why the community was famed for being full of what I will euphemistically call """"short tempered people"""". One player who doesn't know what he is doing can easily bring down the whole team.The complexity comes from two main parts - first, the sheer number of selectable characters in the game. At the time of writing, there are 102 characters - with more added periodically as the game is updated. Each character has four different abilities (sometimes more) that are active (requiring the user to press something to make them go) or passive (they just operate automatically). The abilities are character-specific, though there are common elements between them. Some of the abilities require chaining to use them effectively, and each ability is leveled individually as your character earns experience.After you've done the maths and figured out how many different abilities there are between all the characters - and thought about how long it would take to become familiar with even a small handful of them - consider that in addition to that, there are over 120 different items that you can equip your character with. Items can perform new actions or augment your existing ones (again, they are active or passive in nature).Oh yeah - each game takes a long time to finish - around 45 minutes is pretty common. You will never get away with saying """"I'll just have a quick game of Dota"""" to your significant other - at least, not once they've put up with you playing it a few times.So - learning curve. Big one. Time investment (or sink, if you prefer). Big one. Especially when you're trying to play with other people and they're abusing you for not knowing what you're doing. But the real question is - is it worth it?I've clocked up almost 400 games (and there's still some characters I haven't played). I'm not turning pro any time soon, but have a reasonable handle on the fundamentals. My win rate is about 50%, which seems to be fairly normal. Losing is often traumatic, especially after you've lost a couple of long 45-60 minute games in a row, or you're saddled with random teammates in the matchmaking who are abusive idiots (or just bad).But the games that are good - they're really good. With so many combinations and different ways to exploit them, the level of satisfaction when you're playing with friends and manage to co-ordinate a five-person push on a tower, laying down that perfect combo that takes advantage of all your abilities, wiping out the other team.... well, that's what keeps me coming back for more.Not only that, but once you've invested a bunch of time and gotten over some initial learning humps, it's genuinely fun exploring the different characters and item combinations. There are always new builds to try and new items to buy. I've gone through several """"favourite characters"""", depending on which new ones I've played recently and how well they worked out with my natural play style and with my teammates. Even after around 400 hours of gametime, I still have more to explore.I do, however, only really enjoy playing the game with my friends. I've tried a few games """"solo"""", just picking up teammates using the matchmaking service, and I find this massively less fun. It's less engaging because I typically don't like to communicate with randoms via voice, and your chances of picking up toxic players are increased. I've had good games with randoms, but generally don't bother playing unless my mates are online.As with all reviews, this one attempts to help answer the question: """"should I buy this game?"""". Well, good news - Dota 2 is free. It has just come out of a long invite-only beta period, so your actual financial investment in whether or not you should get into the game is zero. But there are two big questions you need to ask yourself:1. Can I justify the amount of time I need to get decent at this game before I start enjoying it?Make no mistake, the learning process for this game is An Ordeal. If you're prepared to spend many hours reading guides and playing with bots until you can beat them on a reasonable difficulty - maybe 10 games? - then that's a good start. If you've got mates that are happy to babysit you then that's good - but note that most of them will not want to do this because it almost certainly means they'll be losing (a lot) while you're still struggling with the basics.The best way to approach it is to read some guides - I recommend Welcome to Dota, You Suck - and play with bots until you can beat them on Hard, reliably, with one character. Then find some friends who are happy to play with you knowing your noob status, and play some games online with them. The more friends the better"

But i have to say just move on and play, ignore these stupid players)-In my perspective, Dota 2 is very well balanced but there are still heroes who are just too strong and broke which can frustrate hard-Language problems(There are like in every game some Russians who think they can freely write russian in the chat although it´s an english server. I think that´s unrespectful towards the people who actually write english although they are also from other countries besides Russia like me)-Pauses(Seriously these unpauses ♥♥♥♥s everyone up and nobody is able to wait for like 3 minutes -.-)My rating for Dota 2 would be 95 out of 100That´s all from me.

They had a solid (and diehard loyal) group of players and 7.00 is like spitting in our mouths and telling us its champagne. I see what they're doing. Valve wants to appeal to a younger generation of players that does not (I repeat) does not want to play Dota 2. That is why they play League of Legends or Heroes of the Storm or Smite. They want a fast paced game that requires little to no knowledge of tactics, strategy or the game's mechanics. I used to say Dota 2 was the chess of MOBAs"

I would recommend for others as this is an incredible MOBA, but may be difficult to learn for the un-educated.I would not recommend for others to procrastinate from school/uni work.

"2212,Dota 2,2013.0,""To fully illustrate what makes DOTA one of the most compelling multiplayer games of all time, it helps to have a bit of background on the game itself.DOTA has its roots as a Warcraft 3 modification. Warcraft 3 introduced a unique mechanic in its campaign and multiplayer modes of """"hero"""" units - units that actually gained experience points, abilities, and items as the game progresses. This really made it feel like you had an investment in these units, and you grew attached to them. To a degree these hero units, effectively commanders of your army of relatively disposable units, became your avatar in-game. It was a brilliant concept, and DOTA took it a step further.DOTA created a multiplayer mode that focused *exclusively* on playing these hero units - it removed the base building and unit management seen in the standard RTS format. It's one of the best examples of """"less is more"""" than I've ever seen, and that description hardly does it justice. Managing your individual hero and your income, position on the map, constant decision making, and being able to size yourself up versus your enemy brings more depth than any other game I've ever played.I've yet to play any other multiplayer game where *every* member of your 5-man team is crucial to your victory. Everyone must do their part, and do it better than the other 5-man team. There are very few cases of where a game can be winnable 4v5, and teamwork becomes a huge factor. In the most intense and close games, the level of immersion really can't be matched. It's hard to think of another game that draws you in more than DOTA, especially when other people are counting on you to do well! It's a hectic, stressful, enormously complex and in-depth experience - not to mention absurdly fun. This is what keeps me coming back, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to really experience what multiplayer gaming can truly offer. If you're new to the game and want some background on specific heroes and strategies, or just want to watch some gameplay, be sure to check out my YouTube channel.

"2213,Dota 2,2014.0,""A great game filled with action and strategy. Takes a very long time to learn, longer to master. After 700 hours I still cant play each hero, and havent mastered quite all of the advanced mechanics. You must play this game for 50-100 hours before you can even think about deciding if its a game for you. It is very competetive, and sensitive people will not enjoy it. You will be insulted, a lot. If you get to a high lvl and have played many matches like me, you wont be paired up with Peruvians or Russian quite as much, but at the beginning there will be someone who doesnt speak English (in a U.S. English server) and they will most likely suck and lose the game for you. There will be heros that will wreck you every game until you (and those idiots you call allies) learn how to play against them. Even after all the hardships, I'm still playing this game.

"2217,Dota 2,2017.0,""Dota 2 Dota 2 is good game. It has a very steep learning curve. However, when you finally learn how the complex mechanics work. It can be quite fun when you pull off great ability combos. I would recommend getting a squad of at least three friends to play, preferrably experienced players who are not quick to get angry. This will make your team more organised and efficient. Communication is really important.Secondly, it will be a safer learning environment for new players. If you ever enter a solo match, changes of getting a toxic team member is fairly high. However, there are also many patient veterans who will give constructive feedback. Pic your teammates wisely if you can.Dota 2 is a well made game and balanced. OP characters always get nerfed eventually except for Phantom Assassin. As said before, it can be very fun when you get really cool people in a match. It can also be frustrating if you get people who do not speak your language or people who just are toxic. If you constantly get the latter, you may want to take a break from the game for a while. Just like many others have said, this game can be really addictive.Grade 8/10"",1"

Loads of heroes to choose from and heaps of items to go along. The training system is a precious help and introduces you to the last hits, denies, shopping for items and combining items, allows you to play with a few noob-friendly (not easy and not weaker than the other ones, mind you, just not that complicated to master in the early stages of the game) heroes to get you to feel the game's pace.From then on, you still have a lot to learn. Everybody can use ALL heroes for free and there's no advantage anyone has over you except their own experience in the game. But there are plenty of heroes to go around and until you've played them all (or played against them) at least once, you'll be feeling like a noob when you face one for the first time.Dota 2 is rather unforgiving when it comes to carries. You die, you lose time, experience and GOLD. And you need GOLD to buy items to allow you to carry. Not that easy for supports either. Most of them do have the uppoer hand on some carries on the early stages of the game, but you need to know them in order to take advantage of that. Also, your abilities' damage doesn't really scale all that well to late game, where the carries start to shine. There are dozens of ward spots, jungling tricks and control points you need to master. Every game's different. Lanes are pretty unpredictable at Dota 2. You can have 2-1-2, but you can have a 1-1-3, a 1-2-2, or, if you have some jungler, you can have 1-1-1-2 os something like that. The game's pretty dynamic. Do check some guides and builds. They can help you in your first contacts with some heroes. But, hey... it's Dota 2. Everything's situational.

2232,Dota 2,2016.0,patch 7.00 in my opinion seemed like a rushed attempt at making dota feel new but  in the process we lost that oldschool  feel dota had and the players that stayed never truly got why anyone would spend thousand of hours in one game and the players who left felt as if the game was heading towards a simplistic casual direction to keep the new players happy  but hey atleast overwatch got a xmas update and lol added a new champ dotas dead to me,0
"2233,Dota 2,2013.0,""With over 110 heroes to choose from, Dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of all the games available on Steam.  Many players find that even after 100+ hours of gameplay, they feel incompetent at the game.  While this is probably Dota 2's greatest downfall, it is also the aspect that makes the game as great as it is.  There is just so much to learn in this game, that it will provide fans with countless hours of playtime.Verdict: Dota 2 is an extremely difficult game, and that is what makes it most rewarding.  Yes, the amount of time it will take a new player to become even an """"average"""" player may take well over 100 hours.  However, if you are can overcome its steep learning curve and are looking for a game long term, DOTA 2 may just be the best game you can currently find - and it is free."",1"
"2234,Dota 2,2016.0,""I have been an avid Dota player since beta.  With over 3000 games played and countless hours invested, I clearly enjoyed the game.  I recently took a break after the International, due to the overhype that happens every year with it.  I saw that 7.0 went live (didn't see that coming) and was excited to patch up and start my addiction all over again. After playing a few nights since 7.0 release, I keep asking myself """"wtf is this?""""  I don't even know where to begin describing the absolute sh*tshow that this game has become.  I find myself confused constantly, and not because of mechanics or UI, or items, or X...but the overall design that is the package of 7.0.  What is the vision?  Who in the Hell is in charge of quality?  What made them decide to make such drastic changes overnight?  Why was there no narrative or rational explained behind this overhaul.  Valve just vomited this poorly designed, extremely buggy, modge podge of randomly designed and bloated features onto live servers.  Lets start with the map changes.  Why?  Why bounty runes?  Why relocaiton of rosh?  Why change core mechanics on a whim?  I tried multiple games to stack jungle camps and was maybe successful 5% of the time, trying at multiple iterations of early to mid 50 seconds.  Rosh is on the other side of the map...right in the middle of the river..o.O?  There are so many terrain changes now that I don't know how to ward properly and at this point in my time spent in the game...I don't want to relearn all of it.The minimap will be your demise.  Don't use it to flee frantically because the scaling is actually larger than the frame window and you will end up running face first into the enemy.  On that note, when trying to launch something across map  (like clockwerk's rocket) the actual trigger point is not in the center of the rectile, but the tip of the hidden mouse, which is the upper left hand of the bounding box.  Nice bug there, that went live???The pregame VS screen is atrocious.  Particles flying at your face to reveal the two battling team compositions...with horrific shadow flickering, polygon tearing, and half of the heroes are so poorly framed that their face isn't even seen!  What in the Hell is that all about?!  Did you have some unpaid intern work on this loading screen?Monkey King needs heavy tuning.  Not even going to get into that f*cking mess of a hero.  Dota 2 has not released a new hero that has never been released in Dota 1...until now...and its not even original or new.  Yea yeah yeah I know he's been in talks for like a decade or something, but he's not new.  He rolled out in League a long time ago and it just makes Valve look unoriginal and cliche.  Oh cool new hero!....its a monkey...how lame.  A monkey with an arcana, give me a f*cking break.Seriously, at some point were there 10 random people in a room throwing darts at a wall to design this patch?  Sadly, in 3 months from now..most of the bugs will still exist, new ones will be present, old features will still not be correctly implemented, and a year from now most of the stuff that was added in this patch will not be maintained properly and the game will be an even bigger mess than it is now.  But who cares right?  As long as people keep buying hats, pouring millions into overhyped tournaments, and fattening Gabe's wallet...why should they care?Pre 7.0 = 8/10Post 7.0 = 4/10Don't waste your time, money, or effort.

Dota 2 is one of those games that takes a lot of time to get even moderately ok at, time that could be spent playing something else more rewarding.

"2244,Dota 2,2014.0,""A combination of great game mechanics and compelling hero backstories make Dota 2 a cut above other Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs) such as League of Legend and Dota 1. Of particular interest to new and old players alike is the hero Mirana and her trademark w-button ability, sacred arrow, which when successfully deployed is often considered one of the most fatal not-ulti moves in the game. When not utilising this 360-damage 5-second stun, players may take solace in Mirana's other special abilities such as leap, a devastatingly evasive jump, starstorm, a powerful aoe magical damage dealer, and her notorious ultimate moonlight shadow which will render all heroes on Mirana's team invisible at the click of a button.

I don't think I've seen more people take a game more seriously and turn on eachother in such a way that is so cringe inducingly sad until your team loses every lane and you're forced to turtle the rest of the game out. I've seen death threats, people insulting eachother's lives and it just makes me wonder why bother? Add onto that the fact that games go from bad to worse when mistakes lead to uphill battles that can't be clawed back from and games in which you will literally be stunned for eight seconds straight and god help you if you fall even a little bit behind then because you will then not want to be in the game.

All this long to find, in a relatively short time, a team more or less sets of people with whom it is possible to cooperate and communicate effectively, since the nature of the deep tactical gameplay makes it almost impossible to be accompanied by casual players and hope to derive mutual benefit and fun, especially in the long term. Now that DOTA 2 is available for all, the challenge of numbers with the main competitor League of Legends can begin.

Like dark seer for example: he is currently useless. when i use wall replica i WANT to use the illustions and thier abillitys. But then u get OP heroes like riki. Invisibillity has got to be the most op of all abillitys /items, but valve give him a tricks of the trade as his ult and then buff it harder with a scepter. There are many more examples but honestly cant be bothered to type. but im sure u can think of a few...Alot of blood sweat and tears went into this game and for what?If i had one wish i would ask valve to bring back the beta club, those days were the best!!This prolly aint helpful to anyone, i just needed to express myself and tell you how let down i feel.would i reccomend this game to anyone in this current state. NO..... spend your'e money a holiday or maybe even hobby u control.prolly so much i have not said but im sure you get my point.RIP dota 2. i will miss you and i will not forget you.all those people that made those GREAT custom game dev's THANK YOU!If u feel same please add a comment on your'e views,PS: Valve go ♥♥♥♥ yourself you money grubbing peices of S***.

"2279,Dota 2,2018.0,""Dota in itself is a great game. I have had many hours of fun playing it. But to be honest this is not a kids game. At least not anymore. It has really become gruff, outspoken, harsh and very very true in filthy language. This is really unfortunate because it was not made for thet and not intended for those who are not universally human enough to realize this is a game not life! Do I recommend this game Yes on yes the game is great. Do i recommend it for young people a definate NO! I myself as many others are finding other games now because we are sick of the filthy language and things said here in this game. I will say this. The Dota people have tried I think in ernest to stop it. Those people laugh at them and just do it anyways. To bad if it ever stopped it would be the best game on the internet! Im  sure Dota would never let me or this be said and pass this in the review."",0"
"2280,Dota 2,2016.0,""I don't know where to start, this is the first time i feel the need to write a review. I spent 30 minutes reading reviews on forums and here in steam (80-90% negative and that comming from players with 2k to 7k hours spent on the game) about the last patch and as someone who has played this game since dota 1 I've seen a lot of changes... some were good and some ofcourse not but you could've get along with them and even start to like them. However this last update 7.00 is not like them... it completely changes everything, to add so much new things in one time it's so unbalanced and with the tree skill every hero is different now the supports are carries and the carries supports it's like i have no knowledge of the game.About the visuals. The new HUD is really small (keep in mind many people play on standart laptops size 15.6"""") and the health bar is hard to watch when it's on the bottom instead on top of the skill bar. It will really be good if after all the changes you get the option to adjust all of those (for example to expand the HUD like the map size).I would like as many others the new update to be a new game like DotA 3 so a lot of people have the option to play the last game patch 6.88 we all like but i know this won't happen unless a lot of people leave the game or professional players don't say something. If the idea of this update was to draw more people to the game keep in mind is it worth it and will they be more than the one leaving it... I personally won't be playing it unless some drastic changes take place which most likely won't happen.... "",0"

"2282,Dota 2,2018.0,""After 7.20, if you don't play the meta characters right now, you won't win.  Team  comps at higher levels look well rounded.  Towards the bottom tiers, they whole team needs to be carries, and only meta-carries. The majority of players are low tier, so this is most of the players' experiece.  The recent buff to certain characters make some supports one-hit killers late game and other broken.  I used to think this game was better than League because the various build paths and play styles, but it seems like you must go a certain path to win games and only that path.  If you want to play various characters that might not be meta and still have a shot at winning, don't play this version of DOTA 2.  Go play league or another moba that is growing.  This game doesn't satisfy like it used to and by the way they've been making changes it doesn't look like it will change in a better direction soon.

"2300,Dota 2,2014.0,""Dota 2 is a 5-v-5 MOBA game. You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available.The object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams’ Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. You’ll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, you’ll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team.Because of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that you’ll be teamed up with won’t always show the same willingness to communicate. If you’re just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique.Something to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if you’re playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldn’t prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, don’t worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game."",1"

What is remarkable is, Dota 2 has reached this level of depth and polish in a remarkably short amount of time.  What started as a relatively rough beta has blossomed into a competitive game that entertains, captivates and truly engrosses people who are into competitive gaming.  Valve has done a bang up job making this game free, and having all of the """"buy"""" stuff totally optional to those who are interested in it.  I think the method of giving people drops that they can decide to equip or unlock via unlocking chests is genius.  I hope they get all of the money."",1"

"2304,Dota 2,2014.0,""Dota2 often claimed to be the hardest MOBA there is and that is because the game is very complex, which is why there is a ~10 hour tutorial trying to breakdown the game mechanics into little pieces and if you want to get faster and easier into it you can't avoid watching videos for more tips'n'tricks, which makes this game very time consuming, not to mention that an average game is between 30 and 50 minutes long.However when you dig yourself through the wall of Dota2 and got to the point, where you start understanding what you are doing wrong. Then the game gets very rewarding and fun. Playing Dota2 is a combination of strategy - which hero to pick, where to lane, what items to buy and satisfying combat, one hero usually has 4 abilities and one of them being there ultimate ability, which is the hero's strongest ability, for newbies, there are a lot of hero's with passives and few abilities.Something, which I don't usually mention in reviews, is the voice acting, this game, although it has 108 different characters, has really good voice acting for every single hero. Although the game is getting to get a bit older now, its graphics are definetly up to date and personally I really like the water, it looks really good.Overall if have a lot of spare time and for a very strategic in-depth game go for it!

"2305,Dota 2,2014.0,""I've played this game since I was in my highschool, Dota 1 days were surely a jumpstart for me. Now I'm a licensed Interior Designer and I still play this game. In-game items make this game a whole lot more interesting than before. But since I'm a new player, it's sad to know that DYNAMIC PRESENTS are now unavailable. Rendering Old Players an edge of having good set of items while New ones can never have while they level up. So this makes leveling up your dota profile a bit of useless to me. Leveling up a profile knowing that there is no use or benefit can be disappointing at some point. And hopefully soon there will be an AUTOBAN for rude players in-game. Some sort of a """"PROFANE"""" word detection thru out any language. There are a lot of rude and tactless players out there that can most of the time disappoint newbies from playing the game.

"2307,Dota 2,2016.0,""Why I am unistalling Dota 2 after patch 7.00:First I have loved Dota and put in a lot of time - 1700hrs.Patch 7.00 add complexity but doesnt address the issues that face the game:Toxic community: Although there are reports and commends there are still rude players who play in almost every game. The reporting system does not seem to deal with this. I suggest a social ranking which is used for public match making as well as mmr. Social ranking could be determined as a function of commends v reports.Supports: I play supports almost exclusively. The reason is that if I dont I cant rely on anyone else to. I spend a lot gold on support items at the expense of developing my hero. It is a grind. Because I regularly play supports my level almost always lags behind others so I will rarely see a lot of the new high level options. The new changes do little to make playing a support more enjoyable. Wards should be free and on a timer.Map change: I hate the new map. Visibility is reduced, wards are less effective, it will become a gankers paradise since you cannot ward as effectively. For a prodominently support player who normally takes the role of hard carry baby sitter that is not a prospect I like.EDIT:Snowballing. Talents will accelerate snowballing. My suspicion is that means that the team that handles the transfer from laning phase to ganking phase most efficiently will have a significant advantage. My prediction is stats will show that the team that is dominate after 15 minutes will win almost all games.I doubt anyone from Valve will read this but there it is.So long and thanks for all the fish."",0"

Thanks valve "
"2311,Dota 2,2016.0,""Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad game. Not by any stretch. It's a candidate for my favourite game of all time, in fact. I have a second account devoted to it, where my playtime is similar, and I haven't gotten anywhere close to 2000+ hours in any other video game.But I can't recommend it to a new player, for a single very significant reason. The community is the single most toxic community I have ever been a part of. It is extremely, extremely rare for a match to be completely free of players abusing you for bad decisions and shouting at you over a microphone in a language you can't even understand. For me, it's become comical, but for a new player, unless they have friends that are willing to teach them the basics and help them learn the mechanics of the game, they are going to struggle. There are tutorials, but these are beyond limited, and with a pool of 113 Heroes each with individual and unique abilities, the learning curve is exceptionally steep. In order to be a ''good'' player, every detail of every single skill and item in the game will need to be learned (that is, its function, cooldown, damage, added effects, gold cost, mana cost, and more.) This takes several hours to achieve. The best way of learning all these intricate details would usually be to just play the game, but the aforementioned toxic community makes this impossible unless you have a number of friends willing to play alongside you while you learn the basics.Now, let's assume you have a group of four friends, or you are lucky enough to be matched with reasonable and understanding players. Let's assume that you've put the time into learning the mechanics of the game. You're going to have a great time. The game is, with a few glaring exceptions,  *cough* Monkey King *cough*  well balanced and fair at all times, putting the outcome of each and every game at least largely down to the player's skill and their ability to communicate with their team. It is completely and utterly free to play, there are no extra heroes or stat bonuses that can be bought, although there are cosmetic item sets and other miscellaneous items such as different soundtracks and HUDs that can be bought with real money, but these are entirely optional. This means that every player has access to the same number of heroes, and on top of that Heroes are not cycled like in other MOBAs- all 113 heroes are available all the time. The sheer amount of playtime that this game offers is mindblowing, especially taking the fact that it is free into consideration. I can't think of any other game, free or otherwise, that could remain so fresh and enjoyable for so long. There are so many different playstyles and so many different incredible hero combinations that can be utilised, the cliché that 'no two games are the same' definitely applies here.On top of all this, it's excellently optimised- most systems will be able to run it at a semi-decent framerate.The terrible community and the natural learning curve that comes with the MOBA genre really are a shame, because this game really is a true achievement of video gaming. Its a 10/10 game without a doubt but it's near impossible to get into, and it is that very factor that means, in the vast majority of cases, this game cannot be recommended."",0"

"2344,Dota 2,2013.0,""Four and a half years ago I wrote a negative review on this game, which can be viewed here.[pastebin.com] Pretty much everything I wrote in the review still applies, and in fact, much of what I said has been vindicated by the course the game has gone in my absence. But I figured that with all the changes dota's gone through, that I should give it a go experience the differences firsthand.As I alluded to in my first review, IceFrog, or whoever really makes the updates for Dota, is pretty much insane, and will change things constantly for seemingly no reason. I was more correct about this than I could have ever imagined, as the game has undergone a massive amount of changes since I left, and I don't think a single one of them, aside from the addition of new heroes, has actually made the game better. If anything, it's probably gotten worse.The short and true of it is this: When I played dota, the thing I most enjoyed was the fact that my every move made a difference towards the outcome of a match, and thinking of the many heroes in non -conventional ways (item builds, lane choices, etc) could result in anything from astonished amazement and victory, to unbelivably swift loss. The idea that my unconventional method of play could mean victory or defeat is what drove me to keep playing, and keep trying new things. That sort of decision making is dota to me. Mask of Madness + Armlet Wisp is a triumph of dota. Fountain hooking is a triumph of dota.The thing I liked least about dota, besides the community, was the distinct lack of clarity towards the apparent importance of any given moment. In any other team game, even if my team gets massively stomped, I can pretty much always say with total certainty why we lost a game. Similarly I can see why we achieved victory if we do win. This is not the case with dota. The bulk of your time in each match flooded with white noise, this constant need to ask """"what the hell just happened?"""" makes losses seem like even more like an incredible waste of your time when they are, in fact, 40+ minutes. When I played this game, I remember having so many days where I   felt that the time I alloted to playing it was a complete waste of time. I could have used that time for literally anything else, and it would have been more productive.What I noticed almost immediately upon booting up dota again was that the thing I liked best about dota  has gotten muddled and infrequent, and the thing I like least about dota has become pretty much perpetual. Recent updates to this game have added terrible gameplay elements like the bounty runes which force players to be in a specific spot at a specific time or they will be at a disadvantage. I hated this even back when it was just bounty runes in the river, now this kind of design is everywhere--tome of knowledge, bounty runes seperated from river runes, shrines.........oh my god, shrines. Unbelievably bad design there--the addition of free mana/health restores on the map makes it so that you pretty much always have to assume that the enemy team has full health and mana, which makes ability use, most of which involves you getting hit by things that don't allow you to play the game, is constant, but actually killing people is harder and doesn't actually mean anything. Why is the laning phase even still a thing if it's impossible to kill people by attrition and everyone can just buy EXP in the shop? I lost faith in this game a long time ago, but holy crap. We're reaching TF2 levels of bad changes and depth decline.You'd think that talents--the ability to choose from two options once every 10 levels or so--would make my little speech about carving your own build even more fun. As any HotS player can tell you this is a lie, a trap--the ability to choose from two different options doesn't allow you to carve a meaningful identity, it's just a singular choice which tends to have a very obtuse and hard to parse impact on the game. This is why I say the white noise problem has gotten worse--cast range and cooldowns, two aspects of dota that you used to never be able to change, are very commonly increased by talents, meaning you no longer have any ability to determine just how long a time period you to exploit an opening after a hero uses their ultimate, or how far away you need to stand to dodge it, etc. Then there's the classic obstructive stats--what does """"+15 Strength"""" do? I know I get health, and maybe damage, but how much? Nevermind movement speed--there's so much free movement now that pretty much everyone is a miniature Bloodseeker, all the time.On the bright side, if you like teamfights, you're in for a pleasant surprise, as the game has pretty much devolved into being nothing but teamfights since laning and farming no longer matter and everyone is constantly at full health and mana with nothing on cooldown. But at some point you're gonna have to ask yourself: if that's what you want, why aren't you just playing Overwatch."",0"
"2345,Dota 2,2018.0,""Great game, a masterpiece. I played it until I became good enough to join a clan but wasn't interested and didn't have the time so I stopped and moved to something else. I recommend this game specially to people that have the possibility of playing with friends. This is a team-based experience, and it's really frustrating to try to play cooperatively with random people, a lot of which are quite toxic. It's very easy to get a trapped in a loop of playing over and over and finding out that you're actually enjoying just a few of multiple matches. That's why I recommend everybody interested to play only with friends if possible. It can easily get very stressful and a time-waster."",1"
"2346,Dota 2,2016.0,""The game in itself is technically remarkable as the mechanics are brilliant and you could have fun with it for a lifetime.The community however is toxic - humankind at its worst.Most matches your teammates will disconnect as soon as the other team gains the lead which is pathetic, this is common practice online but on dota it reaches new highs.When are not busy clicking the disconnect button, these lovely folks (instead of playing the bloody game) spend their time insulting you for whatever reason - it's common taking at female characters which is lovely, sometimes right at the beginning of the match for no apparent reason whatsoever other than probably them being complete dumbasses.It's particularly sad that this happens playing unranked matches, years away from even being able to attempt a competitive match. I can't even begin to imagine the environment when things start getting serious.It was a better experience praticing with bots as machines demonstrated better team spirit and they acted in a much more civilized fashion. If you are into trolling and flaming, insanely competitive playing, or if you are a sociopath, this is the game for you.Otherwise just avoid it like the plague.

I mean, out of 900 hours I can only remember like, 7-8 really funny moments where I actually laughed.Oh, the irony of fate, the very last laugh was in my very last match. I was Earthshaker top dire in lane with Warlock against Death Prophet and Batrider, we got first blood like 10 seconds after the 00:00 mark, I spotted DP warding our jungle, I used fissure to block her escape way and Warlock used Shadow Word. While we were AA her, she started to move left and right like she didn't know what to do, it looked like she was dancing, and it reminded me of that case of mass hysteria happening around the early XVI century in France, where several people started dancing uncontrollably for weeks until they died(yes I know, my interests are ♥♥♥♥ed up), and THAT actually made me laugh, THAT to me was a funny moment, not the quick first blood, not the 2 more kills we did on bat in the next couple of minutes (warlock got all of them btw) but the fact that DP started dancing while we were beating her up. This made me think a little, but only for a couple of seconds, there's a game to win here guys!

The psychological abuse that they encourage players inflict upon each other is unheard of in any other video game i've ever played. The report system is fully automated with no judge or jury and allows gutless trolls and griefers to run amok. They encourage petty 'eye for an eye' behavior instead of good sportsmanship and bully players into staying in a match that has them being battered over and over. They allow griefers to flame the living daylights out of you then when you finally snap and stick up for yourself, those same flamers have you repremanded by said automatic report system and YOU end up being the one who is punished. And what's worse is that those griefers get thanked by Valve for causing harm to other players.But that's not all, people. No the abuse doesn't stop there. For a free to play game, this one will have you spending more money than its worth, dressing up your favorite heroes with expensive hats (some of which can only be won in Valve's treasure chest casino where they encourage children to gamble). Dota has gone from a fun strategy game to a cesspool of greed and mental torture since Valve published its sequel and took over. And now that they're filthy rich they don't even develop their own games anymore. They take the lions share of the profits gained from treasure chests and give the artists who created those skins a mere pittance for their work. If you thought EA was bad, Valve just took the title from them for most soulless games company."",0"

Everything in this game, from the toxic community to the rage I have had to endure for this game was difficult and nearly impossible for me to accomplish but i did. After the 1500 hours, I questioned myself, what did I do this for? The fame and money or the fact that the game is so addicting that I chose to play 10 hours of DOTA 2 before my exam. (The result was an E grade which is not bad...Is it??). Could it be that I watched TI6 and TI7 and was inspired to make my mark on the aegis of champions. Whatever the reason, my family despised me for what i had become. In short: DOTA 2 is a game which is not free to play.

Just when u think you've figured out the meta, a new patch arrives and with it comes new sections to explore,learn and adapt to the changes. This changing metagame not only manages to keep the casual gamers entertained but also tends to reset the Professional Scene. A champion team who dominated the most of the tournaments on the previous patch may be quickly replaced by another team who adapted to the new changes of the recently released patch way faster as compared to the rest of the teams.

"2381,Dota 2,2016.0,""Before the 7.0 update i would have recommended this game gladly, but the latest update just broke the game, I would say.It actually just got more like League of Legends, but in a way in which i would be more likely to play League of Legends than Dota 2.

"2385,Dota 2,2016.0,""For all the pro and cons of dota, I would recommend it... before the 7.00 update took a massive♥♥♥♥♥♥on the game. Quick Summary - The 7.00 update turns dota into the bastard child of Heroes of the Storm and Dota 6.89, in otherwords it you're still forced to sit through 35+ minute onsided games but now on a far worse map then before. Granted, its not all bad... I'd say the talent tree addition is a good move forward however it certianly could use some more work. Also the backpack addition is decent, it removes some of the higher skill play when it comes to destroying items... but it's not a terrible addition.But that's about it for the """"pros"""".  The new map is a joke, a complete farse. 2 minute respawn times for camps removes the ability to make effective stacks and the fountian in the jungle removes all challenge to jungling - unless the enemy team is dedicated to harassing you, and even then you'll still have an almost full healing every 5 minutes. The ui changes are nothing more than a straight downgrade from before, guides suffer particularly. Instead of having a dedicated tab it now is thrown into the shop tab, which for some reason, valve decide to make harder to navigate. All in all, Dota 7.00 has an identity problem, it doesn't know if it wants to be Dota 6.89, League, or Heroes of the Storm. At this point I'd say League is better if you're looking for a hardcore experience, Heroes of the Storm if you're not. Dota right now is painfully mediocre."",0"

"2392,Dota 2,2014.0,""Ok so its dota 2, The larges and most popular game on steam at the time of writing, If you dont have this game and you are an avid gamer. You will most likely pick up this game at some point, due to the fact that it is free, and well why not? From a Graphics point of view at maxed out on a GTX 660 easily it looks fantastic and that isnt even the best graphics card so the requirements arnt huge but much lower than that on budget PC with the worst graphics card ever and you might get a few people compaining about your *Wooden PC* increasing the time to load up into the game, and if worst comes to worse you can turn it to complete minium and I bet you that even if you laptop has one of the worst GPU's on the market you can eventually get it to run at a playable pace.From a gameplay point of view, as you can see I have spent well over 500 hours on this game so it must be pretty good and some other reviewers have spent from 1000 hours and above, the reason?Well there is 1 map that has a few variables that can change the game such as the runes, weather you get a good creep from the jungle to control and take on your enemies with. So 1 map you think hummm that must be pretty limited, well yes i would kind of agree with you but the fact is that becuase of the 100+ heros and many hero combinations and counters no game is the same with each game changing the way you play slightly depending the character you play, how you play it and who you are against and how they play it so the game does take a while to get old and even then having the same map means that you can really know it, like REALLY know it. How to do specific techneques and pulling creeps, where the enemy heros can see you and how to position yourself. So in that term the gameplay remains fun and interesting while still for players like me challenging.The Community: This is the one issue you get with this game some people are not very forgiving for your mistakes and there is a lot of anti-russian stuff, mainly because when you go to play on an English or US server and you get strange man shouting at you and your team in a strange language that no one on your team but him can understand, people get a little (to say the least) annoyed. Althrough the higher your battle rank and mmr (I will talk about that later) means that eventually you will get players who actually make an effort to co-ordinate with you.The Ranking system and how valve makes its money: So the game is free and so how does valve make its money? Well first let me explain the ranking system: Basicaly after each game you will recieve an ammount of battle points for you to increase your battle point level, each level you will recieve an item (I think) and acasionally you will be able to open a present to get free items, these items can also be dropped through luck randomaly to people at the end of the game. Valve also sells hero costumes in the dota store/in game shop these items will only change the look of your character and will not actualy affect the gameplay which I find very unique and means that there arnt huge pay to wins in the game which annoys me hugely when people make a good game and then make it pay to win. These costume items are very effective with the steam market allowing players to sell their items cheaply to other players but valve still profits of that by taking a transaction fee. Also due to the popular steam workshop players can submit their item designs to be avaliable in game and they will also get a cut of the money made which is a nice thing for new artists to make some money while having something to potentially put on a CV.Also when you reach a battle point rank of 13 you will unlock ranked matchmaking which will allow you to play games with other people of that level 13 and higher to increase your MMR with the top MMR being 7500 and bottom 0 (You really have to be bad to get 0) with 5000+ mmr being very high. MMR is for more serious players that want to really test their skills with others of that level, but on a down side note, 2000-2700 mmr is very hard to get past as there are people from all different abilities so that can be a little dificult to get past. but eventually with experience and a little luck you will get past and eventually be on the climb you your ability level.This concludes my review for dota with a few 10/10 statisticsAlso please consider taking a look at my youtube channel where there is some dota content and some help videos for new players: https://www.youtube.com/user/MerlinICVideosGraphics: 8.5/10Gameplay: 9/10Community: 6/10 As it gets better later onRanking/Progression System: 9/10"",1"

2401,Dota 2,2017.0,There used to be a game called DOTA 2. Then a new patch (7.00) came out and turned it into a copy of League of Legends. That patch changed almost every aspect of the game. I liked it the way it was. ,0

"2403,Dota 2,2014.0,""When I started playing Dota 2 I absolutely hated it. I refused to play it. No one could convince me to go through the pain and suffering of repeatedly dying, being outplayed by everyone and the abuse that came with those performances. During The International 3, I decided to make an effort to watch the tournament and it completely blew me away. Orange tearing through the Losers Bracket, taking out DK and pushing towards the finals. The commentators were going wild, I had absolutely no idea what was actually going on but I knew it was epic. This brought me back to the game. We're now in the middle of The International 4 a n entire year later, I now have over 700 hours played and almost 450 games listed on my Dotabuff.Dota 2 is like an abusive relationship. It's a genuinely great game, competitive gaming at its near finest. When you do well you feel fantastic, you've earned it - you outplayed and outsmarted the opponents. You'll have games you won't forget about with big performances and dramatic team fights. But there are games that will haunt you due to ferocious emotional abuse from team mates. These games don't end quickly, you can be harassed for half an hour during a slow and painful loss. The community isn't as bad as other MOBAs, but it's very easy to blame other people. If you win, people will sing your praises through the game. If you lose, and if you're a support like myself - prepare yourself.  I've played a fair amount of MOBAs, from League of Legends and HoN to the more abstract Awesomenauts and Smashmuck Champions. Dota 2 has to be rated as the best. It's tactically sound, it's gorgeous to look at, the 100+ heroes are all interesting and challenging and the team synergy is there to be picked up on. You can win games by choosing a more aggressive or pushing lineup. Go for team fight heroes and combine to wipe out the opponents or make space for certain heroes to keep the game going for as long as possible and win late into the game. Games can range from 10 minute stomps to 75+ epics. The game mechanics are for your team to gain gold and experience from killing creeps and opponents, but also to deny gold and experience by denying creeps and team mates - killing them so they can't get the kill. Everything is tactical, where you go in the map, at which times, controlling vision, acquiring runes or when to defend and when to push for towers or ancients. This is again, why the entry point into the game is so difficult. There is a very steep learning curve. You also have a shop menu to work out which items you should buy to help your heroes in different ways. You will learn this with experience. I have put this much time, effort and stupidity into this game and I still don't know a lot of things about the game. I still don't fully understand what heroes counter which, and I don't have full understanding of some abilities or item builds. It takes time and patience. Dota 2. It's a game I grew to really appreciate, but still a game that can ruin your day in one disastrous game. The competitive scene is great and fully supported by the game developers, it's constantly updated with community created cosmetics, mini events or new heroes. And the only time that in-game purchases are required is for specialist things like team pennants, tournament passes or cosmetics for your courier or hero unlike that of other MOBAs that require you to earn or purchase heroes to have the chance to broaden your playing experience. Easily recommended, but just be wary and try to keep your team mates relaxed and mediate them during those bad losses. You can't win every game. "",1"

"2406,Dota 2,2014.0,""Dota 2 is a first person MMO RPG survival horror game developed by EA and EA only where you have to fight to survive in the drunken robot zombie apocalypse with nothing but your bare feet, as your hands are too pre-occupied taking off your panties in excitement for this sick filth.The main protagonist is you, Jakob. You are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy. Jakob's model really matches his personality. A hipster, emo, gothic sex-driven male paired with the voice acting of Morgan Freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable.The storyline is great. I love how the developers have a completely separate """"prologue"""" chapter for the story, explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell (that's not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minutes of the game). You start out in the middle of Россия... er, Russia, spending time with your beloved family, and find out you are really, REALLY attracted to your cousin. You take her out to """"show her the world"""" when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you. Your cousin falls into the crevice. You are devastated. You try to rush home, but then all of a sudden, you hear a big шлеп... er, plop. You look behind you, and there are robot zombies, all drinking vodka. You then turn all around and find yourself surrounded. And I'll stop there, otherwise I may end up spoiling the prologue!The PvP in this game is SPOT ON. It's like the developers KNOW that you're the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the get-go! It's brilliant, need I say more? Fine, I shall! Just like the amazingness that was Dungeon Keeper Mobile, you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slamming your wallet into EA's pockets! It's fantastic!The best part too? It's бесплатно--free. Если вы грязная американская свинья, кто не любит водку, то вы позор. Um, what I meant to say was """"It doesn't even cost a dime!""""Overall I would say this game is a 10/10, a must-have game. EA has really shown how to create such a game. I'm just waiting on the DLC to come out later since, surprisingly, there was no day-one DLC."",1"

"2423,Dota 2,2016.0,""I've been a Moba fan for quite some time now, i played dota since it still was a minor game mod for warcraft 3, also known as ''Dota Allstars'', and i still kept playing it, then dota 2 came out and i was excited, i wasted atleast 3 years on dota 2 and i've enjoyed it all the time-... untill the patch 7.00 struck, Valve changed nearly everything of Dota. It didn't feel unique more, it seemed more like a bloody ripoff from Heroes of the storm (i love that game, no offense).

"2426,Dota 2,2015.0,""I dont usually write reviews but this is a game that I played really much because I enjoy the genre and tried many games in it to compare DotA 2 with. Basically in terms of speed DotA 2, along with Strife (which is basically DotA 2 in graphics style of LoL with a pet+item system which you can level up by playing) is average, so if you think a MOBA should be slower you should try League of Legends and if you think it should be faster you should try Heroes of Newerth. If you are looking for an alternative that is less knowledge based you should probably try Heroes of the Storm, since you dont have to learn as many item effects.DotA 2 in a """"nutshell"""" after ~2400h of playtime:-New players (if interested in cosmetic items) will have to visit the shop now because game drops have become so incredibly rare that it has become hilarious.-IF you buy item chests in the shop and dont get the set you bought it for, you can't sell the items since volvo put a trade+market cooldown (2 months I think) on every new item that gets released (yay!) so if you dont want to spend money until you have each possible drop from that single chest (RNG is strong in this one) you're better off waiting until the desired item is marketable and then buy it off the market.-Volvo greed simulator: The old loot system, in which you could acutally gain items after a game ,for DotA 2 profile levels, and a leveling chest you had in your inventory (which could be opened every few profile levels and contained a new chest to open later) was successfully reworked into greed-mode. The chances to get ANY items after a game are as low as getting a legendary (or higher) before. Sure they drop ENTIRE sets now, but most of them are common to rare, which overall is still less rewards than before if you add up singe items and put them up against the set drop chance now in both, item quantity AND value. Maybe you should try some """"never change a running system"""" in this particular function.-Mostly developer/support abandoned game. the new content this game releases is mostly made by the community since the hero sets are workshop based and hero releases/patches are just really really rare. Special events are mostly the same every year and the report system is most likely 100% count-based/not reviewed by support employées (for example if you express your annoyance towards...lets say russians...for not being able to communicate in english on EU servers, you will most likely end up muted because out of the 10 players in a EU game 3 (probably more) are most likely russian and will report you for speaking english)-These days russian-infested to the max...8/10 games you play will result in eyecancer due to russian chatspam, even though they have their own servers(!) because its way cooler to go to international servers and spam your native language, thanks volvo for letting that happen! maybe one day the EU servers will be renamed into russia 2 and russia 3 and the actual EU will have to play on american servers after all :D*EDIT*-In addition to the listed issues, the game servers are now absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1/4-1/5 of the games crash and are not counted due to connection issues with the servers, great job of making it even worse when ppl thought that wasn't possible...Conclusion: If you want to play a game in which you get rewarded for playing (in terms of cosmetic effects and/or profile progression) this probably is not the right choice anymore, because as stated you don't get level rewards or similar stuff anymore, just REALLY rare item drops (probably in the 0,2% range). If you want to blow off some steam with trolling other players, spamming your native language while being sure nobody will be able to understand you this might probably be YOUR gamechoice #1. The community these days is mostly toxic and troll based so this is NOT your game for some serious gametime (at least not in solo matchmaking).I didnt check the other games these days but the community in HoN was much more friendly and less russian.In my personal opinion DotA 2 isn't playable solo anymore because there is too few games where you can actually play properly, without being annoyed by trolls or russians...Gameplay/Balance: 9/10Community: 2,5/10Rewards System: 1/10"",0"

All heros have a multitude of voice lines, and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax. Like real-time chess, everyone is a queen. Some queens shoot lasers, some summon huge Golems and some sing so hard your eardrums burst. Definitely one of the best games of this generation, and I'm certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come.From perfectly co-ordinating a fountain hook, to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as Storm Spirit, no other genre rivals, outstanding strategic gameplay and near-vertical learning curve.

Though not as newbie friendly as the rest of the MOBA games out there, this game has always been the epicenter of the MOBA genre.The community is the little downside here. I guess the competitiveness leaves room for sympathy for those new to the game. Even the slightest bit of mistake can put off any player on your team.

"2445,Dota 2,2017.0,""From many hours of experience, i can safely say that this is an amazing and addicting game for people who like to challenge themselves while playing with other people. DOTA 2 can indeed be hard for beginners, but once you get used to the game you'll be enjoying yourself more as long as you arent one of those people who rage quickly and end up abandoning. Things can be improved to make this game more enjoyable, such as the toxcitiy of players which drags MANY players away from this game. But nonetheless in my opinion this game is a great game.[Second Edit: Dota 2 2018 Review] (Lots of reading ahead)It's been a year since the Dueling fates update, and 2 years since the 7.00 update. From what i have personally experienced in this year of Dota, i can now say that the game is changing a lot. Many changes and introductions have occured in 2018, from the ranked medals to the 7.20 update.Starting from the medals, which where the first introduction in 2018. I have personally always liked the medals idea, and dont really seem to have problems with them being added to the game, I personally find that they are suiting, since many other games have medals for ranking, why shouldn't Dota? The next perhaps big thing which was announced in mid February of 2018, was what was known as the """"bi-weekly"""" patches/updates. In a nutshell, icefrog had finally spoken and looked down upon us peasents and finally said """"we will be releasing updates every two weeks which will release features slowly, instead of all in one go on a single patch"""". Yes people, the frog has spoken! All this was due to the community complaining about valve not caring so much about updates and giving way too few. Hah, the irony is that, when the bi-weekly patches came, people eventually hated more on valve for the amount of space they are taking up on their hard drives. So eventually after the international 2018 championships had come to an end, the bi-weekly patches just dissapeared.The next huge addition to the game was dotaplus, which is supposed to apparently be an evolution of the seasonal battlepasses. Whats my opinion on this? Well lets put it this way about dotaplus, what a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. People literally only buy it for the hero leveling, so they can have a little badge which shows their progression on heroes they play, for the battlecups because AT LEAST dota plus owners get free battlecup tournament access, and also for the ranked roles, a new thing that replaced the double down mmr in ranked matchmaking. Which btw took a que time as long as 40 mins to an entire hour even. Not saying it still doesnt, infact it's worse from what i've heard. In a nutshell, pay 3.50 a month so you can have the ability to choose which role you want to search for in ranked matchmaking. For some WEIRD reason, ranked roles is not the normal way of matchmaking, and all those who dont have dotaplus or dont really feel like waiting 40 mins to find a game (around 80% of players)  will just be stuck with """"ME MID OR FEED OR♥♥♥♥♥♥YOUR MAMMA ♥♥♥♥♥"""" pretty much what you see in the EU servers nowadays, yea pretty disturbing. But that just about sums dotaplus in a nutshell.Next up was spring cleaning. This update was simply amazing and i do hope we get one again for 2019. My favourite bit of this update was the new look of in-game player profiles, must commend valve for this one, great work!After that came the long awaited pudge arcana, pretty amazing overall, especially with a hero like pudge, who didnt really seem extensive for an arcana, i mean IT IS pudge we're talking about. But they did it, and it's pretty decent. What could've made the arcana SOO much better, is a new hook animation, not just using the right hand hook, but also the back chain hooks. Then again, this is my opinion.Jumping ahead, we saw a lovely summer season, kicking off summer 2018 with the international 2018 championship's battlepass, which brought about the """"lakad matatag"""" meme, and it was just beutiful. The tournament was great, a massive applause to OG once again, very well deserved. Towards the end of the tournament days, 2 new heroes by the names """"mars"""" and """"grimstroke"""" were announced, and on that day, people freaked out, especially when grimstroke was literally released right after the trailer revealed him.Autumn came, and naturally, people were expecting a traditional """"post-TI"""" patch. To be fully specific, the 7.20 patch. When 7.20 debutted back on the 19th of November, it brought about A LOT of changes. People were wondering how to even play the game anymore. I mean bounty hunter now steals gold from enemies when he hits them?? Denies give gold?? Slark gains permanent agility if he or an ally who is next to him gets a kill?? The update in my personal opinion needed DESPERATE balancing. This of course naturally happened, and literally 4 sub-patches were released in a month. But eventually I personally adapted, and some of my friends who are at the ancient level have either quit playing the game, or taken a massive break with questionable return.Tomorrow (the start of 2019) the ranked season 3 is expected to debut, along a possible update to ranked matchmaking, which we hope will be effective, or at least a lot more effective than previous updates to ranked matchmaking. Mars is nowwhere to be seen yet, but valve said winter, so as far as we're concerned it could be on the 20th of March. Althought if you want to see him early, buy a mega telescope and find where mars is in the night sky (hah good luck with that, but seriously don't buy a mega telescope, use it to buy dotaplus instead LOL)The last but not least thing that happened and is soon going to end, is the frosthaven event, along with the long anticipated Rubick arcana release. Frosthaven is DECENT, but in my opinion frostivus of 2017 was much better. As for the Rubick arcana, it's pretty nice, and i'd rate it just as much as the Pudge arcana.To conclude the review of Dota 2 in 2018, this year had changes, loads of changes, i will say it was a decent year for Dota 2, it wasnt amazing, but there was great stuff released aswell to cover up for that.So one last thing before we conclude 2018. Do I still recommend Dota 2 as a game? The answer is yes, it's still amazing, and i hope it will become even greater in 2019, because for some reason, i sense 2019 will be the best year for Dota 2 ever. We'll see in a years time, if i was right and wrong i guess!I hope you all have a happy new year!- Dark=======================================================================If you wish to find my 2017 review of Dota 2, please click the link below.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yXurlIUKwTAphGZDZZhf-86PF9zSEHFev5JlBCrnsZc/edit?usp=sharing======================================================================="",1"

"2447,Dota 2,2016.0,"" This review may cover both DOTA games, DOTA 1 and DOTA 2.  DOTA 2, in my perspective, is just a rework of its original game, DOTA 1. I have played DOTA 1 for more than 2 years before transferring to DOTA 2. However, I only played this game because I thought it was far better than the previous game.It is, but it's partly not. -Gameplay-The gameplay is just like any most other MOBA games out there that involves communication, skill, and the ability to play the game itself. Personally, I have been a fan of MOBA games back then because MOBA games are quite easy to learn, and its fun.Before moving to DOTA 2, the gameplay on DOTA 1 is easy to understand, because graphics back then were as simple and easy to understand, and I got into it pretty fast. DOTA 2 on the other hand, has better graphics, and the game was far more easier than before. In DOTA 2, the gameplay is shorter, because of how fast-paced the game is, compared to DOTA 1 which requires right timing to actually execute a good play. But they are still the same game that lets you farm creeps, level up your hero, kill the enemy team, and win.Not to mention, DOTA 1 needed a third-party software to play online (at least in other countries) while in DOTA 2, its just download, install, and play.-Controls-DOTA 2 basically has the same controls as DOTA 1, but it has the option to let you customize to your preference. You can now assign different hotkeys for every button that you can use for your hero and the menu. Back in DOTA 1, all hotkeys were quite fixed until you use another third-party software to modify them. -Community-Well, its like in any other MOBA games out there, it's either the community is good, or bad. But honestly, what really makes the DOTA 2 fall currently is the rise of toxicity among players. Since the game is free, more and more players are creating more accounts that lets them play whenever they want if one of their account is banned.-Other Things-Since DOTA 2 is a Valve software, you can actually make money by playing the game. The game has an inventory system that lets you store a certain hero's piece of equipment, or tools that lets you customize those equipment, and even tickets that enables you to watch a certain tournament in DOTA 2 itself. (I still watch on Twitch though.) With these items that you can receive through game drops, you can actually sell it in the community market for Steam Wallet. You can also make more of the items you get by trading with other players.Also, DOTA 2 has its own workshop, which you can visit to check out other gamemodes/maps made by other players in the DOTA 2 community.(Back in DOTA 1, you can only download the maps made by others.) Certain players in the community also create/design new items which can be implemented into the game if the proposed item was approved by players and the developers.-Final notes-Although DOTA 2 is a great game, it has it drawbacks specifically the community, which makes DOTA 2 itself. I mean, how do you play this game without players, right? Even so, its generally fun, especially with your friends. DOTA 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward to those who commit.I recommend this game to people who like multiplayer/MOBA games. I guarantee you, its worth it despite the troubles it might bring."",1"

"2457,Dota 2,2014.0,""A true masterpiece and a milestone in gaming, this sequel to a genre-definer that is now just bursting in a global scale is a great point of reference to anyone attempting to make a game of this genre.

But it's major strong point is the depth in its mechanics.While Dota 2's gameplay might seem daunting at first, it's one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game, and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting. Other games such as League of Legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula, but Dota 2 kept it intact, and makes sure you learn something new everyday.Not only the core game is strong, but also the eSport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing, with several tournaments going on, including Valve's own The International.

"2465,Dota 2,2017.0,""TLDR version: !!Do not even consider installing this game!! Toxic pile of dung. (edit2: Just had an indept discussion with one of the homophobic sweethearts that play the game.. read the comments to see what to expect in-game tenfold..)If you want some details:I played enough hours to be able to tell you that this game has the most TOXIC community I have ever encountered in any game. I love(d) dota, been playing it since dota1 as a customgame in WC3, was very happy dota2 came into excistence. But lately the toxicity has reached levels of never before.As of now I am selling all my items, never intending to play this game ever again. The game has been taken over by russians and turks (monolingual people make teamplay nearly impossible), two of the most rude and unsocial people on earth. The reporting system only works against you because the monolingual narrow minded turds will stick up for eachother. So if you play support and the enemy dewards, its your fault and thus you get reported. Or if enemy team has Nightstalker and they can't see then it's your fault as well that wards dont work. Either way you're ♥♥♥♥ed if you play support - it's always your fault. So ♥♥♥♥ing toxic this game. I am so done with this game. Spent hundreds of euros on it, but they (developers) rather make it appealing to people who don't know how to be social or teamplay. So here it is, my final review, I am selling all my stuff, the last few euro's you'll make of me. The game itself is beautiful, but it's really not worth it if you have to put up with this toxic community that they wish to keep intact with this failing report system. Reports mean evertything, commends mean nothing. I get commended 40 times, doesnt mean♥♥♥♥♥♥against the 7 times I get reported. Then I get low Priority. I fail to see the logic in that. I am done with this game. (numbers may be exagerated but you get my point.)And yes, there is an option to mute people that don't speak English or that are rude - thing is that won't stop them from trying to get everyone to report you just because you didn't heal them in time that one time, or that your shallow grave spell isn't a mapwide castable. And power is in repetition, these toxic kids will be very persuasive and promise commends in return for reports. (people who agree to that are probably even worse than the toxic kid that promises it.)Bloody shame though, been playing Dota since the very beginning when it was just a custom game on WC3, too bad seeing it go to♥♥♥♥♥♥because of a worthless reportsystem that seeminlgy only makes the game even more toxic instead of making it a better place."",0"

"2468,Dota 2,2014.0,""Causes mood swings, eating disorders, triggered sociopathy and a chronic breakdown of human decency. Also fufills the second language requirement for numerous eastern european universities. 420/10 would play again."",1"
"2469,Dota 2,2014.0,""Nice game, I think this game better than LOL, it has more details at operation, interesting tools, weather is sprightly, and all hero is free!!! Undoubtedly, DOTA2 is a diversified game, you won't guess what happen in next time! And DOTA2 makes player needs some individual skills, so we can free choice of heroes, not boring EU tactic. In the end, if you are loving DOTA(or MOBA) game, don't missed DOTA2!!! "",1"
"2470,Dota 2,2014.0,""If you enjoy dedicating your life to this game while at the same time ignoring your family, friends, and any sort of social interaction, then you will certainly enjoy fighting with your teammates over who will support or who will buy courier. By playing this glorious game you will also learn how to speak several languages as for some reason Russians and Peruvians like to join the US East and West servers when they have servers in their own country. Im sure you are already sold by this point, but just to add on one more thing about this game is that you will also learn how seriously people take this game and realize truly how terrible you are at this game because you have less than 3,000 hours played."",1"
