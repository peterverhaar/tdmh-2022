"885,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's a good game. But the levels are achieved so slow. Spent 3 hours, gained 1 ship... didin't even upgrade it. But don't get me wrong it's is fun to play, but it gets repetative and on some servers if you die you have to wait for some time to respown. But give it a try if you in to space, battle ship fighting etc."",1"
886,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game has exceeded my expectation for an early access game. The graphics looks great and the gameplay is very decent.  The only annoying part of the game for me was being made to complete a 15minutes tutorial even though the UI is quite self explanatory. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.,1
"887,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewALPHA REVIEW:First off, if you're thinking of getting this game, please understand that it is, at its core, a MOBA. (Think LoL in space.) It is however, a very unique MOBA"
"888,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewBig ships in space? Who wouldn't want to dance the slow and deadly dance of cap.ship slugging it out at each other. FS looks good and I didn't run into any bugs first time running it. Lacking any kind of tutorial the learning curve can be a bit harsh, but once you realize how things works it's a big fun. Team work a must in this one. Grab a copy and jump in, just remember that big ships are slow "
"889,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is a MOBA game with big spaceships and even bigger potential.Whether the developers will achieve that potential is another matter, but they're definitely on the right track. If the premise sounds appealing to you, you will enjoy the game and it is worth the price of admission. It's very well done.However, it is early access, and as such, there are a lot of missing functions, some balance issues, bugs, and a lack of content which appears to be in the process of being addressed. My biggest concern at the moment, in terms of """"I want to have fun right now,"""" is the lack of tooltip details.Let me explain. You get choices on which weapons/abilities to load your ship with. However, there is absolutely zero description of what any of the weapons do aside from the name. So you kind of have to try them all and figure out how they're supposed to work.  Yes, this will obviously be addressed, but in the game's current state, there's sort of an unnecessarily high learning curve.Still, once I figured things out, I started having a ton of fun, and I'm glad I paid the $10. I'm having fun finding new ways to sneak up on enemies and blow them to pieces."",1"
"890,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewVery good game, i lloved SWTORS new space combat system but i was found it stupid just fot that subscribe every mounth, i was looking for a game to replace and finally i found it, the game is new and in early acces, and for this the game is IMBA, but its need worked on it i hope it will not stay like this. Ps: my english sucks i now."",1"
"891,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space is exaclty what it says in its description. You are in charge of a large spaceship where you have to decide where to postition yourself and when you fire to get the most out of your weapons/abilities. Inevitably this is going to be compared to star trek, battlestar galactica, dreadnought, star conflict but i believe that this game can take elements from these games/shows to make a unique game with a solid free to play system.Still in early access so keep in mind some things may change.Their are a total of 12 ships which have varying unique properties. Graphics, effects and models are fantastic with improvements to quality and performance every major update. Having more local servers would be nice (to reduce ping) but its quite easy to find a game. With each update the game gets better and better.Overall a great game, essentialy a moba in space with large spaceships with flashy battles. Love to see how this develops. The price for the forerunner and harbinger are woth playing the game but keep in mind that this is going to be free to play in the future.EDIT: updated with more current info"",1"
"892,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewVery enjoyable game if you enjoy team based objective games. Ships are all fairly interesting and each has it's own unique feel. So far, things seem fairly balanced, every ship has some type of counter ship, and each ship fills a particular role in combat. I would definitely recomend picking it up and giving it a try. Takes a few games to really figure things out, but once you do, it is enjoyable."",1"
"893,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe Takeaway: Fractured Space has qutie a  lot of good potential. The graphics are great thanks to the UT4 engine. The gameplay is something fairly new and fresh despite being based on existing MOBA archetypes.  I felt that there's enough promise to put my $15 USD on the table after playing just a few matches. It's like Homeworld, World of Tanks, and LoL/DOTA/HoTS had a giant party and everyone got together at the end of the night and this sexy minx is the result.The Good:  Amazing graphics for a MOBA title Fresh gameplay for the genre Intuitive, easy to master controls Unique ship designs that feel plausible as real starships (some folks don't care, but for me that's a HUGE thing) The Bad:  HORRIBLE lag issues. (I'm used to SOME lag, but I've had a few matches where I would jump large distances from where I was or where I intended to be without using any speed enhancing abilites. No tutorial, and for a game as complex as this one can be, at times. There needs to be a bit more information about exactly how matches are supposed to work included as perhaps non-intrusive in-game tutorial messages (Move next to the point to capture and so on. Something simple that you can breifly read on screen before it gently fades out). I've managed to work out so far you shoot other ships and capture points on the map, but exactly how to do so in order to achieve victory isn't readily apparent even after reading the in-game """"How to Play"""" primer which barely had enough explanation to fit on an MTG card. There's nothing the actually explains how ship or tech tree progression works either and if you didn't know you could upgrate your ship's systems you'll be less effective as you grind up to the next tier of ship. HOWEVER THERE IS ONE BIG CAVEAT I'LL GIVE TO MY LITTLE BIT OF WHINING ABOVE. I DIDN'T BOTHER TO READ ANY OF THE """"HOW TO PLAY"""" STUFF OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL SCHEME FOR MY FIRST 3 MATCHES.  "",1"
894,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewEarly Access Review:it's a 5 vs 5 battle game with huge starships:Pros:- good graphics- good gameplay- many ships with different playstyleCons:-not very much to do in the game-bad collision against objects-pay to have credit to spend in the gameI recommend this game to peaple who likes space locations.,1
"895,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I have only 10 hours on the game, i have rather enjoyed the game play a lot and ill most likely keep playing but for someone who lives in Australia i search for Aus servers only but still get out in a game with over 200 ping which makes some skill ships hard to hit enemies idk if its a delf proglem but i tried on a frineds internet and computer and had the same problem so Australian servers would be rather nice other then that the game is really enjoyable, also i have never seen the rewardsscreen because it always breaks and never shows me"",1"
896,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewBy far one of the most entertaining Capital ship combat games ive ever played... the diffrent ships that are avalable right now are very fun to fly and can pack a serious punch!!!! each ship suits a specific role.. and if your good enough.. they can suit any role! this game is a good game to play with friends and work together with your fleet and capture the enemys base!!! 10/10 will Stealth again,1
"897,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Created 09.25.16Fractured Space is a game about driving your gigantic Spaceship into epic 5v5 team Battles on vast maps, with Sectors of up to 100 Kilometers Length. There are currently 33 Ships available to play. Where they are split into 3 Manufacturers, wich each boast their own distinctive Artstyle and unique Systems.Games can be played in the two currently available Gamemodes """"Conquest"""" and """"Frontline"""", where the first feels somewhat like a good old MOBA and the latter like a fast King of the Hill match with base-Capture elements.Ships can manouver almost completely free, though you are unable to roll and only limited tilting is possible. Though this goes to ensure that certain ships can function the way they were designed and combat gets more challenging. More on that later.Movement between sectors is achieved via a """"Phase-Relocation"""", also called Jump, wich keeps both your orientation and momentum.Fractured Space features a very high depth of mechanics, wich might not jump your thought immediatly and will require some getting used to. Such as the concept of Armor and breaking Armor causing you to take increased Damage from enemy fire.Fractured Space, due to its high depth, delivers lots of potential for very tactical play and thus has huge potential to become an E-Sport in the future.Here are my, personal, Scores for the Game:Graphics: 9/10  The Unreal Engine delivers again! And so do the Art-Devs from Edgecase games! Beatifull looks!Sound: Solid 8/10 Despite the usual """"No Sound in Space"""" thing, Fractured Space features a really immersive Soundscape!Depth: 9/10 In terms of Depth, Fractured Space beats most MMOSA's ive yet seen. May be a bit to much for the casual Player.Character Design: 9/10 The Ships you play feel very very Unique, and become so even more with Loadouts and Crew.Gameplay: 7/10 Gameplay is a bit unintuitive at times, but a well done Tutorial helps with the tremedous depth of the Game.Now, do I recommend Fractured Space?HELL YEAH!Its one of the most revolutionary Space-Shooters ive ever seen and the Unreal Engine makes it just SO nice to play and look good. The Game is fair and balanced. No cheaters to bee seen since the game started. There is payed content to the game, but this completely restricts itself to Skins, giving you the cool looks but nothing else. While you can also buy """"Credit Boosters"""" to simply get your next ship faster.That being said, a more expensive ship doesnt mean you will have an easier time. Having a newer, more expensive ship gives you absolutely no advantages over other people.Now there are some players i defenitly don't recomment to touch Fractured Space, because the game takes quite some effort to be successful in. So just quickly Jumping in for the pure Ownage will likely not work out."",1"
"898,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is beautiful for a free to play game. It's currently in alpha and is extremely well polished, they have a big update coming out in July which will make the tech tree a whole lot nicer.The game is a 5v5 space moba, it's a nice kind of medium paced style and you can just enjoy it.There are 2 lanes, each with a set of capture points and every 6 mins the mid opens up for a buff fight.10/10 everyone should try."",1"
899,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is pretty cool.. But..(-)1) Game needs to get Party System in game2)Need Eu Servers3)I dont like server list system..

Main menu is really freezing but in game its ok.(+)1)Pretty cool graphics and gameplay2)Good price for that game3)Good effects and visuals4)Soft game play its not hard5)Skill based MOBA ,1
"900,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is really good for those space junkies that want a free TVP match up or PVP matchup, preciceley a capture the flag kind of game, have not played much of it but can get a little dull after a while of playing unless your strictly that kind of game seeker. Me I prefer different aspects to video gaming but this is still a fun game to get into if your all about capturing bases."",1"
"901,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewInb4 the negative """"p2w"""" """"unbalanced"""" """"no refund"""" are from 0.1-2hrs in peeps:^)Great game, bad impression.All ships are balanced even the highest unlock requirements one can still be D E S T R O Y E D by starters(I really hope they remove the ship tech tree someday tho, i wanna play more ships without grinding to unlock them)+nice skinz, 9/11 swag"",1"
"902,Fractured Space,2016.0,""This game is absolutely awesome.Easy to learn though, there are much to learn and you can find yourself with very unpredictable games. I've seen horrible matches turn on the last 1 minute of the game and my team winning victory out of the jaws of defeat.It is still early days, it would be wonderful when this game gets to E-Sport level."",1"
"903,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Last played it during the Beta, now full of 12 year old kids flaming each other, waiting for hours just to find a single match.Game has changed alot since then, most are for the worse"",0"
"904,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Superb spacecraft design - these are the most solid, realistic, detailed capital ships I've seen in any game so far and better than most AAA movies and TV shows. I'll say it again - the ships are original, believeable and simply gorgeous.Gameplay is fairly basic, and any time you're not in combat, you will be made acutely aware that you're playing a freemium game"
"905,Fractured Space,2016.0,""There's not a lot of Space games on the market that many can get behind. Somewhere down the line, devs effectively equated space with complexity, so for years we were driven away with spreadsheets, graphs, and pure busywork. However the genre continues to be an itch I can rarely scratch with the rare exception (Rebel Galaxy being one).This is another. As the synopsis demonstrates, this is a creep-less MOBA. It has much of the staples. Zone control for resources, except those 'resources' mostly translate to 'team experience'. You zone back to a base in order to 'level up', comparable to how you buy items in DoTa or LoL. After that, it's just a 5v5 beat'em up with a fair bit of strategy and adjustment. Like many space games, you have to think on the fly and move your ship behind the dozens of asteroids that litter the zones in order to mitigate the damage you'd otherwise receive. Like with many team-based games, it's more fun when you play with friends. When pugging, I lost against AI because everyone pulled a Lone Wolf mentality that just does not work here. A lesser ship cannot take a greater one without sniper support. A tank ship cannot 1v2 unless he has a support ship on his back. One match had two snipers in it which meant they remained in the back (As they should) but it meant that we had a fraction of people that could not capture bases with us. The list goes on.There is also no pay to win here. At best, with real money you could buy crew members outright which give you an extra 10% utility here, some 4% damage there, and only serves for diehard minmaxers but the basic set of crew is all one really needs. The real game here is to pick a few of your favorite ships, adapt to their styles, and just win with superior skill, and it won't matter if an enemy does an extra 6% damage or not.Everything else is mostly cosmetic, with the obvious credit boosters and whatnot like every other F2P.One of the things I want to touch upon that has nothing to due with the game's playability or mechanics - But the ship designs are some of the best I've seen in a long time. Just opening the game's tutorial giving the overview of the Pioneer gave me some epic feelings. And then just looking at ships from the Hangar menu, you can tell a lot of love went into their designs. Every inch is covered. You can see storage bays, lights under metal panels, antennae. Kudos to the designers.I've met many like me, needing a space game without it feeling like a second job. This one fits the bill. Space MOBA. That's what it is."",1"
906,Fractured Space,2014.0,Early Access ReviewFor one thing its good need's bug fixing bit more optimzations and the disconnecting part get's a bit annoying. Umm is just MP only are there is a single player also going to be included just to try out the ships.,1
"907,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewDo you like space flight simulators?Do you like MOBA's?Do you like playing support?Do you like playing tank?Do you like playing ADC/Bruiser?Well fractured space has it all!Seriously though, if you like MOBA's but want to change the game style a bit, YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS! I mean, me myself I stopped playing for a while. Yesterday I launched it by mistake, played 1 game, another, and another, and another, and another, and another, and it was 1 AM. This game will make me have to put an auto shutdown on my computer again."",1"
"908,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Download it, you're missing out!This game has brought me countless hours of fun and I have met many people through the game that I have become long term friends with. This is a game that is well optimized and the developers work very hard on.Although, the game lacks a few points , such as new game modes and a propper match making system that puts me with minimaly skilled people, this game has its troubles, but it has alot more positives. I can definitly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys the space or moba genre.Please, if anything, this game is the game that you should be playing!"",1"
"909,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewStill very early Alpha so the game is a bit rudimentary and buggy still.BUT the concept is really entertaining. Its very fun to play! Thinking about later stages of development I must say this is a game with a lot of potential. If you love space battles and intense fighting give it a try. Its worth it.Only a few basic ship types available at the moment. But all have very differeent roles and give you very different possibilities to play against the enemy ships. You have cloaked Assassins, Disruptor ships that can heal your allies and disable the weapons of enemys. There are Sniper Ships, Huge Flagships etc.Highy recommended and fun game."",1"
"910,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space has a great deal of depth and tactical complexity. A new player can pick up the basic mouse-and-keyboard commands after a few matches and yet a 100+ hour veteran can still find new tricks and tactics.The recent change for ship acquisition makes the grind for new ships very manageable.  New players can quickly pick up a decent cross section of ships, while leaving a few more expenive (and newer) ships as goals to pursue.  The only purchaseable elements are purely cosmetic or means to bypass some of the unlock grind.  Despite some reviews here this game is absolutely NOT pay-to-win.The design team is very active in releasing new updates to the game.  While some bugs and significant ship balance issues remain, as is typical for an alpha-stage game, the updates have largely been incrementally improving the game for the past year-and-a-half.Key Features:-Deep tactially spaceship combat-Beautiful visuals (esp. for an alpha)-Manageable unlock rate-No PTW elements-Active development teamWeaknesses:-Some server lag and stability issues-Growing, but currently limited, player base-Ship balance still a work-in-progressVerdict: Try it today!  Fractured Space boasts massive spaceships, looks great, and it's FREE!  There's nothing to lose and the game continues to grow, improve and evolve with every update."",1"
911,Fractured Space,2014.0,Early Access ReviewOverall a very good game. Very pretty. There is still some frame rate issues when there is a lot going on in one area. Never the less it has good potential and i hope to see this game goes far in the future. :D,1
"912,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewAwesome game. There are a few Bugs and it requires optimization, but it's definetly worth the money. Even more if you ever played the X series and loved the big ships."",1"
"913,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewI really enjoy what I've been able to play so far. When I first activated """"fighter swarm"""" for instance, I was expecting a measley few fighters. What I got instead were squadrons on squadrons pouring out of my every orifice, BSG style. Similar to missiles, I expected a few limp dicked streaks... pleasantly surprised to find dual broadsides of tubes on tubes on tubes pumping away at the enemy. (This review has too many sexual innuendos. I apologize.)"",1"
914,Fractured Space,2017.0,You know that im having a hard time to find a match? is it people are playing this game or nah?i left this game 2 months ago and when i come back....cant find a match..........u might wanna widen ur search to more countries,0
"915,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I get why Free to Play games have purchases to make the grind easier, and some custom skins and what not.But this isn't a grind when you cannot gain EXP from Solo PvE at all, and if you go PvP, you will get slaughtered. Grind should always start gradual, not a steep curve right from the first 15 minutes."",0"
"916,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Download the game and bought some ships and packs. I really REALLY enjoyed it. Spent aome additional money on it as well sadly...

917,Fractured Space,2018.0,Super fun game it's a lot like league of legends. The graphics are pretty intense so you should have a good card to run this without lag. The servers are amazing and this is probably my favorite free game on steam. :D,1
"918,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I fly in a humongous capital ship, well over a kilometre long. This mobile fortress of mass destruction can become an impenetrable wall, single-handedly defending a jump point. Or an unstoppable force, relentlessly pushing through the enemy lines. Its crew numbers in thousands, and the entirety of the ship is managed by a seasoned veteran Captain Jonesy. Who is also a cat. What's not to like?"",1"

"921,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Zum Release gibt es auch ein aktuelles Review.Fractured Space ist keine 0815-Kost. Der Anfang wirkt chaotisch und unfair. Das liegt mehr oder minder daran, dass die meisten Schiffe spezielle Rollen erfÃ¼llen. Fast noch spezieller als in jedem anderen MOBA. Beginnt man mit dem Spiel, denkt man anfangs von seiner BrÃ¼cke aus, spÃ¤ter fÃ¤ngt man (wenn man die anderen Schiffe kennenlernt) an im Teamrahmen zu denken. Dann wird es richtig interessant, aber streckenweise auch etwas frustrierend (wenn das eigene Teamplay nicht so wirklich funktionieren will). FÃ¼r Solospieler und lonely wolves ist das Spiel nicht geeignet. FÃ¼r Casualplayer die ihr eigenes KillbedÃ¼rfnis auch mal hinter Teaminteressen zurÃ¼ckstellen kÃ¶nnen schon eher.Spielst du mit Freunden? Umso besser! Da es noch keine Ingamevoice-MÃ¶glichkeit gibt, bleibt nur der 90iger-Jahre Chat. Das ist definitv nicht zeitgemÃ¤ÃŸ, aber sofern ich die Devs richtig einschÃ¤tze - und ich habe das Spiel schon eine ganze Ecke - wird das auch noch kommen. Dann eben Curse, oder TS oder wie sie nicht alle heiÃŸen :)Fractured Space hat eine steile Lernkurve, sofern man denn will. Auch ist es eines von wenigen Spielen heutzutage, bei dem es Sinn macht Guides und Tipps von erfahrenen Spielern zu lesen. Es ist ein kleines Microuniversum. Genauso wie Schach. Nur eben bunter und bombastischer.Grafik wird durch die aktuelle Unreal Engine auf die Monitore gezaubert. Auch wenn ich kein Fan der UE4 mit ihrem fÃ¼rchterlichen AntiAliasing bin, so knallt und explodiert es Ã¼berall ziemlich farbenfroh. Da gibt es kaum etwas zu beanstanden.Der Sound ist ein eigenes Kaliber. Jede Waffe, jede FÃ¤higkeit, jede TÃ¤tigkeit hat ihren eigenen einzigartigen Sound und erhÃ¶ht deutlich die AthmospÃ¤hre. Es besteht fÃ¼r mich kein Zweifel, dass (wenn die Spieler so wollen) FS ein ordentliches Zeichen im E-Sport setzen kann.Thema Pay2Win:Sofern man EchtgeldkÃ¤ufe fÃ¼r Schiffe (die nicht besser oder schlechter sind als die Starterships), die man problemlos (4-6 Spiele fÃ¼r die ersten) auch fÃ¼r IngamewÃ¤hrung kaufen kann als p2w bezeichnen mÃ¶chte, dann ist es das. Einen Vorteil erhÃ¤lt man dadurch nicht. Fractured Space lebt vor allem von der richtigen EinschÃ¤tzung der Situation. Wer meint ein teures Schiff kaufen zu kÃ¶nnen und damit newbs wegzubocken, findet sich schneller auf dem Respawnscreen wieder als einem lieb sein mag.ES GIBT KEIN P2W in Fractured Space.TL:DRDownloaden und ein paar Tage spielen. Nicht von der steilen Lernkurve abschrecken lassen. Es lohnt sich! So etwas gibt es nÃ¤mlich nicht noch einmal."",1"
"922,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Only had this game for two days, but really enjoying it.  The tutorial does a very good job of leading you through the controls and how to play the game, and the 3 'starter' ships you begin with are no less capable than any of the other ships, they just have roles which make them easier to play (detection capable scout used in tutorial, a fast attack ship, and a support ship with healing AoE pulse and ability to break enemy armour).  All the ships in game are able to be obtained without spending real money, and the rate at which you can earn them seems pretty quick - there are multiple ships at relatively low cost, across a range of roles including a very tanky battleship, a medic ship with healing beams, a cloaky ambusher, etc.  The ships for the more complex roles will take a bit of time to work towards, but thats probably a good thing as it means by the time you can buy one, you've probably worked out how it could be used."",1"
"923,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is beautiful. Such an awesome concept. I was sceptical at first, but this is one of the most enjoyable games in my library right now. As of writing this it is also free to download. DO NOT MISS THIS OPPERTUNITY!"",1"

"926,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewA New Face for Early Access?When most people hear """"Early Access"""" in a game's description, what do they think? """"Shoddy, unfinished, unpolished, cash-grab.""""Fractured Space is an Early Access game, and without a doubt it blows those stereotypes out of the water (or would that be asteroid belt?)As an Early Access game, FS stands out with its beautifully polished content, but suffers from a lack thereof. What's in the game (as of the time of writing) is phenomenal, but one can't help shake the feeling that it's an empty frame - beautifully crafted - waiting for something to fill the void.However, do not take this as a negative. The relatively small amount of content that exists in the game is still enough to keep a player occupied! Upgrade costs are balanced in such a way that players can look forward to tweaking their loadout with a new gimmick after every match, or hold out for a few more and get an entirely new ship.With a pace that shifts from relaxed to blistering at a moment's notice, the game itself is stunning, breathtaking, and incredibly fun to play. There's something magical about drifting in calm silence to let your ship repair one moment, then warping in to a hurricane of shrapnel and broadside fire the next. Fractured Space truly captures the mix of nerve-wracking tactics and frenetic action that real space combat would be - and wraps it up in an intuitive, easy-to-learn package.The assets are absolutely gorgeous and the atmosphere is incredibly well thought-out. Ship design seems to take cues from modern popular Sci-Fi as well as the classic Hard Science Fiction of the 20th century. The first time I clapped eyes on the game's """"Flagship"""" heavy cruiser, I felt the spirit of Robert A. Heinlein become one with my own and we both giggled uncontrollably for several minutes from sheer glee.Fans of War Thunder and other tactical vehicle-based team warfare games would be well-advised to pick this gem up ASAP.

"927,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewDo you like MOBA gameplay such as  DOTA 2, LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, HON and other similar games?But you also like BIGâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING SPACESHIPS WITH BIGâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥GUNS SHOOTING FIERY BALLS OF DOOM AND LASORS AT OTHER SPACESHIP?THAN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU, WAIT NO LONGER AND INSTALL NOW!!Basicly you're going 5 vs 5 with a spaceship of your choice, capturing points  and eventually trying to capture the enemy base. The more points you capture the more resources you gain per second, and resources mean upgrades to your ships health and damage, giving you advantage over  the enemy ships. Currently you can choose between 15 or something ships (but this is still alpha, more ships to come for sure), you got  tanky ships, high damage ships, long range ships, close range attack ships, assasin ship (like you go in stealth mode, pop up next to enemy ship, do a lot of damage and then get the hell out of there), support ships (repair yourself and allies, or increase damage done on enemy ships for you and your allies.) and some mixed ships that have a little of everything.I can only say that i've liked this game so far, there are some downsides like laggy servers ( like 1 in 5 games for me are laggy, and 1 in 15 or so is like almost unplayable due to lagg), but that is what you get when you play alpha release. other downside is that currently it is impossible to change the controls for the game (unless you alter some files) which is really anoying if you are one of the few people (belgium,france, ...) that use AZERTY keyboards, because the controls are for QWERTY which means you control the ships movement with ZQSD instead of WSAD. You can fix this by pressing alt+Lshift to switch your keyboard to qwerty mode, but than you will not be able to type properly.  All in all, great game, I am sure they will fix these problems in the near future, and when the game goes full release there will most likely be more ships and maps  and modes to play.I rate it  7.5/10"",1"

"929,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI bought this when it was only a couple weeks old on steam. It was choppy and unoptimised, to the point where I was getting 0 FPS in combat situations. After a couple of months of neglect I came back to find the game patched several times fixing the issues I was having. Great cap ship combat for those looking for a game!"",1"
"930,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is absolutely awesome. It allows you to play in those space battle with huge ship that I always fantasized about. This is an early access that needs some polishing here and there, but it is mostly there."",1"
"931,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewA tactical space MOBA of sorts, with a real depth and potential for even more greatness. Plus the devs are really open and communicative, which makes it easy to see this game is going to be fantastic."",1"
"932,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewVery fresh approach to MOBA genre with popular cosmetic micro transactions system (absolutely no pay 2 win). Easy to get into, but hard to master. Also very competitive and visually stunning. Worth trying out. Big thumbs up!"",1"
"933,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access Reviewlove the but the weekend deal is overloading their servers.  I will assume that will be fixed in time.  The way they use xp as a currancy prevents """"Pay to Win"""".  Look forward to more in the future."",1"
"934,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI picked up Fractured Space during the free weekend last week, and these are my thoughts after 3-4 days of playing it.Fractured Space is a very interesting and promising space combat game that combines A MOBA and World of Warships with a space age aesthetic. This game is relatively easy to get into, even for someone who generally dislikes MOBA's, such as I. The objective of each game is to capture the enemy base while vying for control of two lanes and a middle sector. You capture up to three mining stations to gain resources for your team. Resources are used to upgrade your ships, and the upgrade level of your fleet makes a huge difference in combating other players and capturing the enemy base. There is also the middle area, called the Gamma Sector. This is a large station that when captured by a team, gives the whole team a big damage buff, making pushes much easier to accomplish. Teamwork is a major part of this game, and this is made more obvious when you look at the variety of ships available. It almost reminds me of a class based shooter, like Team Fortress 2. You have your basic front line attack ships, the super massive defensive ships, and the support and healer ships. Any player can find a role and a ship that fits their play style the most. No ship is outright better then the other, which is a huge sigh of relief in a word of pay-2-win F2P games. Graphics are quite impressive in this game, though there are some minor rough spots here and there. The skyboxes are beautiful, distant planets look amazing, and the ships themselves are loaded with detail. The ships are the highlight of the audio-visual experience for me, looking like something a real company would make. They also sound great, weapons sound punchy and dangerous, and the warp drive really does sound how you'd imagine massive hyperspace engines would sound like. Though graphics can be a bit uneven in places, especially on asteroids. But as you're usually just flying by them, it won't bother you that much. There is also occasionally texture pop-in when warping into different lanes. But overall, graphics are sound are great.Gaining new ships and weapon in Fractured Space is a process of gaining experience in one of the three ship manufacturers in the game by using their ships, and making credits, which you gain after each round. It took me only a couple matches to unlock the first ship after the starter ship, and one more day to unlock the one after that. You can speed up the process by purchasing a microtransaction only currency and buying the ship with that, but you still need to unlock the ship with actual play time. And as no ship is a direct upgrade over the other, I find this very fair.Speaking of microtransactions, they are done very well in Fractured Space. The only exclusive things you can buy are ship skins and credit and XP boosters to use after the match, along with being able to purchase weapons and crew members (five stat boosters you can buy to improve your ship even more) faster. You can still buy these with credits, although it will take you longer. I think this system is totally fair and encourages people to invest in the game if they like it.My only real gripes with the game come from its Alpha, Early Access status. Matchmaking can sometimes not work, lag can playing borderline impossible, warping sometimes doesn't work, and general wonkiness and UI weirdness crops up. But all these things are being worked on by the devs, and the game isn't even in Beta yet. This game has a ton of potential, and I really hope that this game garners a large following in the very near future. Until then, I'll see you in the Gamma Sector while getting shot down by a Brawler.  "",1"
"935,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWhile matchmaking is still being worked on, I can honestly say that the connection quality has shown some improvements, and I'm hopeful for the future. While it lacks the intense customization of games like DotA and LoL, it's current game format heavily resembles the balancing act that is involved with those games. Controlling stations gains you resources which level your team up, the more stations you control on the map, the faster you level, which in turn strengthens your teams ships. However, killing isn't the goal in this game, rather the capture of enemy forward bases to open the way for your team to capture their home base. Capturing stations will net you more resources, but also will signal to the enemy which sectors you're advancing on and where they should divert more ships to counter. There's a small series of tutorial missions that will enable you to get a sense of the basic mechanics of the game and how to move about, but it's up to you to get an idea of the tactics and strategy. There's currently three factions of ships, each with their own unique classes and abilities, so there's plenty of variety in the different ship classes, and there is also the chance to further tweak your ships through the uses of different crews and weapons. The game is slated to become Free-to-Play when it exits Early Access (may even be free now, not 100% sure) but, assuming there aren't any significant tweaks to the EXP and Credit rewards, the spectre of 'grind' doesn't seem to loom heavily as I've managed, as a rookie, to get around 1k of experience each game, making new ships availible every dozen games or so depending on my performance. Money will help unlock things faster, but the only things money can exclusively buy amount mostly to new skins for ships. It also helps that it scratches that capital ship itch. You know the one, the desire to maneuver a massive ship to bring an earth-shattering arsenal to bear on the enemy..."",1"
"936,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAbsolutely Great game with good graphics and fun combat... only downside (and what killed it for me) is that matchmaking is horrible, as I found myself grouped with teammates who didn't know what they should be doing, and enemy teams with 2000+ more matchmaking points than the team I was on, even being in a lobby with a friend (who is about the same level as me) did nothing to help.I'd love to see these things fixed, but untill they are, I sadly cant give this game more than a 6/10"",1"
"937,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWell everything already good about the game from landscape till the bases and the ships need to be more upgraded or should be more ship for every faction. The detail is so amazing but,should add more damage condition like engine problem or weapon jammed and that kind of poblem is needed on this kind of gameBut i still recomomend this game that love space adventure"",1"
"938,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured space has been a fun game, If you want a storyline Go to another game, This is a very good Strategy game and has had me playing for hours, The only thing that i would change is add a lore. Idk what we are fighting over! it might just be who stole whos oreos. 10/10 potatos would recommend"",1"
"939,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI will keep this sweet and short,  its a solid space moba light. with friends, its alot of fun, solo it can get frustrating at times but is still playable. the comunity is one of the least toxic and most helpful out their. and even if your playing at the highest level, there is alot of fun to be had.the only problem I have with this game is that they call it a alpha, in many ways its more pollished then any proper alpha I have ever seen,  being what it is however, its pretty good, but I want the devs to take even more pride in the work they did.the game is a bit fps intensive if you dont have good gpu (unreal engine) but is still playable for most ships.  there are a few which I do not recomend for beginner like the raven, raider, and ranger. but most of the other ships are playable if they have enough skill.lastly, devs are nice and funny."",1"
"940,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewSo far my favorite game. Graphics are beautiful, controls are easy to use and unlike some people think it's not pay to win. Even buying the most expensive ship doesn't mean you have a ship that better then someone using a starter ship. That's one thing I love about this game."",1"
"941,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is only in Alpha stages and I t hink it's beautiful :). Yes I only played for a few minutes but it was enough time for me to have a look at the graphics and play around with the ship, I thought the controls were nice and e asy to use, effects are cool :)I would recommend giving this game a go :)"",1"
"942,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Im blown away by this game, the details of every ship is not something to be taken for granted, i usually have this sort of personal hate towards MOBA games because they usually turn out salty af, this game is not the case and i actually enjoy myself, its slow paced in a way but hey, those are huge ships.recommend it to anyone with a tactical view of playing games:)"",1"
"943,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI was going to breakdown everything in the game but wont bother and will keep it simple (although still longer than i expected):My opinion: Solid gameplay with no game breaking issues that ive come across yet. Only had some weird issues with the matchmaking but its not frequent enough to be too bad.  If played with an organized group, this game could excel even more, but still fun playing solo and most people do at this point. If you can get it free (weekend special as of posting) or on sale, and your remotely interested in this game, get it. The devs have shown they can develop it into a decent game.  The negatives are in the fact this game is still being developed, and needs some more variety in gameplay/maps. But really my negatives are limited to that and I do believe the devs have shown interest in properly developing this game and adding more additions.  I suppose a second lesser negative is directed towards Sci-fi junkies, if you observe the ships at face value they seem fine. But when you read the details they add things like the # of crew, which is cool, but its done very arbituarily. A lot of the ships looks like they are made of sheets of metal housing some bare bones weapon infrastructure inside. If anything they appear to be remotely controlled behemoths (and most actually appearing to be thinly defended by said sheets of metal), so I find it difficult to make out where exactly the crew on these ships live/move around/operate. Additionally, the physics of ship movement dont add up with what is graphically displayed. If i use thrusters to go upwards, and then stop using them, which passively levels my ship, what I see is the nose of the ship going up (with thrusters below the nose clearly pushing it, and the main thrusters at the back of the ship giving forward momentum), but then upon stopping my movement and evening back down there are no thrusters above the ship trying to even my ship out. This isnt correct as there is no gravity, and if my ship evens out thrusters at the top should be visibily attempting to level out my ship. Of course we can try and derail this critique by my use of leveling out, and upwards, and the fact its in space, but you know what i mean that has nothing to do with the graphics being incorrect.  Since scifi junkies are likely to be the ones most immersed in this kind of game, its important to have those aspects correct.Microtransactions: Limited to skins essentially, you CAN'T simply buy a ship to unlock and use it. There is a little more detail to provide in this regard but i wont bother, just know that microtransactions are heavily limited and you wont see people with more money winning. Every ship has its pros and cons too, so even if they could, not like that means they'd be the best."",1"
"944,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is a great game, one of the bests I've ever played. It gathers the best of the MOBA universe (the importance of positioning, map awareness, knowing how to push and where jumping across sectors) and the intensity of games as World of Tanks or World of Warships. The ships are really well designed and the variety of playstyles feels very nice. I totally recommend this game."",1"
"945,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewNever played a space game quite like it, original concept MOBA/Space shooter. good graphics, runs well and has some variety and customisation. I'll be playing this one again for sure."",1"
"946,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI played this game quite a while back for a bit, believed it to be decent, but lacking. I have to say the game has come quite some ways, but it is still in need of more quality of life improvements.The good:*Good preformance running 3770K and 980.*Not grindy no stepping up of this ship is better they are simply different.*Gameplay flow is good, slow enough to be tactical and fast enough to be fun.*Ships truly are different and forfil different roles within the game and just just this is a healbot ship and this one does damage. They all have their prefered way of playing so once you are in you will find the ships that suit your playstyle. The bad:*Pricing feels high on the micro transaction they are boarderline macro in my opinion and this is not a problem unique to this game. *Lacks a quick communicate option like a command tree where you can with 2-3 button presses ask for support, order an attack etc etc etc. Such a system would be helpful in public matches and specially give new players and idea of what to do. *Bit more feedback on what just nuked you would be nice, sometimes you can really go from being just fine to death in seconds a bit of a what happened would be ideaal to help you learn, again quality of life. The ugly: *Match making is unsure of itself it feels, 1 match is very quick and the next one just will not show up. This makes it quite annoying to play because there is also no indication of why things take longer. So if there are very few players communicate this, that way it is still bad, but not frustrating.Overal I would recommend this game to those who like big space ships and moba style games as that is what it is a moba with capital space ships."",1"
"947,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI don't understand why not many people play this game. It's a very strong game that has already enough content to hold on it's 10E pricetag, physics are really great, the engine choice is great, graphics are great, it runs smooth and it has bling-bling effects, and after all it's a medium scale space battle game, who doesn't love space battles?EDIT: I forgot to the add the fact that for some reason this game has like ~140 players online usually (which as I said is odd :( ) around all the time but the devs still develop it at a good rate."",1"

"954,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game really is fun. Sure it is ruff around the edges but what EARLY ACCESS game isnt? They defintely need to add some more maps to pick from and of course more ships and gear is always awesome. Very simple you pick a ship get locked in with a team and fight to capture each others bases. Alot funner then you might think, so ya I recommend this game as it has HUGE growth potential. 2v2 player maps 3v3 player maps, different space areneas to fight in, weapons upgrades and whats with that first video? I would love to be able to go in my cockpit. The growth is there so keep it up guys. Also read alot of reviews about it not connecting to people? When I play I usually see 1k-2k playing and it links up most often in under 2min.

"955,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewRelatively quick matchmaking, surprisingly intuitive gameplay, high skill ceiling, great aesthetics.

956,Fractured Space,2016.0,This game is a whole lot of fun. It's like World of Tanks meets a MOBA except space ships... CAPITAL space ships. There are many ship types and each is interesting and fun in its own way. Each match runs about 30 mins with a competant team. Game play heavily favors teamwork. I see myself spending a whole lot of time in this game.My only criticism: the ships handle like submarines.SUBS IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE!,1
"957,Fractured Space,2016.0,""The game is not deep enough to endure the grindy progression to new ships, crew and equipment. Also the matches feel way to random with not knowing what the other team pick until your locked in your choice. The ships look good but the maps are quite bland and repetitive. The game works as som casual fun but I have a hard time seeing myself deeply invested in it.However it is free so by all means test it out."",1"

"960,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Okay this is an edit to the original my opinion hasn't changed i still like the game. The Dev seems to be making improvements to the game things can go quickly or you have this nice drawn out space battle and just blow each other up which is what i like. Graphics are nice. I love the detail of the ships mostly it seems like they took there time in that aspect. Overall still and 8 out of 10. I hope to see more people join up for the battles.Ok, first I would like to say I have no idea how I got this game. It just was in my library decided to install and go from there. There is no tutorial but after a few matches you don't need one everything is kind of easy to learn. I honestly believe this game would be even more awesome if there was no pay wall. You can however earn things but simply playing the game it may take you longer but guess what if you got money get what you want. Overall I give the game an 8 out of 10 its fun, fast paced, sort of, and its in space."",1"
"961,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI had this on my wishlist for a while and was afraid to pull the trigger because I kept reading that term MOBA.  I enjoy some MOBA type games like Awesomenauts.  I used to play LoL until it wasn't fun anymore because the community became toxic and it was hard to find games where people just played it to have fun.  Every match became way too intense with all the meta rules and immature people.  And I'm really happy to say that so far 'Fractured Space' has NOT been like that at all.  It's been a really enjoyable experience so far.  Game runs awesome, with zero problems on my rig.  (Intel i5 4670, 780 GTX SC, 8GB Ram).  The longest I've waited to get into a game is about 5 minutes.  People are either quiet or helpful, I'm sure they're â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s out there but I haven't run into them yet.  Games are strategic but very hectic and loose (your mom's hectic and loose) at the same time.The tutorials are short and not annoyingly overcomplex.  It's not pay2win, everything is earnable, save for a couple ships you can buy, but everything is balanced so no one ship is OP over another.I was worried I'd regret this purchase, that I'd go into games and think """"oh here we go again, some game junkie yelling at people for not following his grand plan and some meta"""" because some of us don't have 100 hours / week to study every minute detail of a game.  Instead I've actually had fun playing this and when I'm not playing I'm actually anxious to play it again."",1"

"966,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFirst impression: awesome!Way to many asteroids that distract from combat. I prefer a few but dangerous asteroids instead (if impacted).Obviously this is alpha but we need more weapons and more counter measures. It would be wise to offer this for free as this is the win-win formula. Don't make it pay-to-win but instead offer all the ships freely but players can pay a few dollars for skins and other skins. You'll be CS:GO but in space.Also a little more fastpace (or offer faster and maneuvrable ships at the cost of fire power).Well done, keep at it, you are onto something here"",1"
"967,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewPretty unique / solid game mechanics.  I agree with other reviewer's comment on this, its like a spaceship MOBA.  I particuarly enjoyed the art direction on the ships as well as the lumbering manueverability during gameplay.  It really gives you a sense of the massiveness of the boats.  Lastly, I hope they keep skins as the only thing that costs money to avoid PTW.  Also particularly interesting is how the """"classes"""" are essentially divided based on ship size, manueverability, and specific CDs.  What sets this apart is the 3-dimensional aspect of each engagement.Given that its still in Alpha, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on the following.1) Optimization2) Lag spikes in game3) Connectivity issue into matches4) No complete texture on most stationary objects.What I'd like to see more of, personally, are as follows:1) Larger teams, 5v5 seems too small... 10v10 sounds awesome, with bigger maps.2) A slighter further zoom on the ship3) Better effects on CQC type weapons4) More game modes5) More non-interactive background battles in some of these maps for immersion.6) More customization on loadout (Think MechWarrior Online)7) A grander conflict to engage community to work towards something other than just a grind.8) It be awesome if EVE was like this =)Will buy again for sure.

"969,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThe first thing that struck me about this game is that it's beautiful: detailed capital ships glint from the light of alien suns, back lit from the blue glow of an earth like planet or the red fire of a lava world with undulating rolls of magma oozing below: it's stunning.   The game itself feels like naval capital ship brawling from the age of sail, only in three dimensions and with rail-guns, guided missiles and the cold vacuum of space instead of the sea with fishes in it.   Rather than the more abstract controls of most RTS games, this game puts you directly in control of a capital ship using WASD (plus extra keys for vertical) and the mouse for aiming. The ships feel suitably massive and take time to turn. This adds a tactical element, using asteroids for cover as you try to blind-side the enemy. I really like the three dimensional aspect of this: feels like I'm battling Khan, hiding in the nebula.  The ships feel imposing and as their arsenal rains down fiery death from all angles, it gives a satisfying feeling of might.  There's an extensive range of ships to choose from, each with their own playstyle. They all capture the feeling of being in charge of a large capital ship, rather than a zippy fighter. There is, however, some variation in speed and agility: you can expect larger ships to be slower but heavier armored and more nimble craft to be weaker. There are no fighter craft to control"

Graphics are Awesome.The Ui is a bit like my room. Alot of things all over the place I hope the do something about it. otherthan that this game is great F2P!!!,1
"976,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewGood Lord this game kinda came out of no where and is rocking it with me. This game is one of those few games where a single player can't tank everything in each match """"Team Cooperation is Key"""" I'be been in team where everyone scattered and did everything on there own we lost in under 3 minutes on the other hand I played with a well oiled team and we won in under 3 minutes, and if both teams know what to do then I guess you're gonna be in a 1 hour and 20 minute match GL."",1"
977,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewIts a cool and good looking game with a good concept! I can see how some people will and do like it. But in my case its lacking action. Still its a good game and i recomend it or at least give it a try!,1
"978,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFun game, lots of spaceships, from what I can tell the premium ships they offer are not overpowered in any way over their existing free to unlock versions and all you get is a money + XP boost from owning it and using it in a game. The rest of the ships seem diverse and the game has a captain you get for your ship that is a talking cat named Jonesy which is a Alien movie reference in case anyone missed that. That being said, the game is still alpha, but is coming along and is playable. At the time of this review, the crew part of the menu is kinda â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed for me and my FPS takes a nose dive for no clear reason when I view the crew members in that menu and the only thing I can think of is because it is an alpha and they have not sorted out the bugs on it and probably not good optimization there yet.""""We are vunerable from down below, and that is never a good thing to say!"""" -Elax Zenchas"",1"
"979,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is pretty great.  The gameplay is exciting, the graphics are impressive, and it is better with every patch/update.  The best way to give it a chance is to put at least a few hours into it.  I know that sounds outrageous, but seriously, play a handful of games using different ships.  Fractured Space is a really well put together game and the Devs are easily accesible.      The game has done nothing but increase in quality and a large player pool would be amazing."",1"
980,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewFirst of all Holy crap the graphics are amazing. Secondly  the gameplay is easy to get into. Lastly it is an overal great game.I HIGHLY recommend this game if you love AWSOME games. One thing that is a problem is you need a decent graphics card towards the GTX 900s.,1

"982,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured space is a good idea but i do have some critisizms for the game1. when you leave the battle without ther game ending, there should be some reward not 0 Credis and 0 Ship Research points2. There should be a way to have a matchmaker create games based on your ship and not you choosing what game to joinPlease note that i did get the game while it was during the Free weekend where if you downloaded it then you got to keep that copyI persionally am neutral about this game (meaning i dont hate and i dont love the game)This is my review of Fractured Space-Nuclear Poptart"",1"
"983,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is great but I'd like to tell you my opinion then give you a overall summary:- some of the ships look like they are covered in foil and are all glittery which is kinda wierd- not much in the way of upgrades and it's impossible to customize the ships in any way.- the crew members sound..... wierd.- I thought I would be able to actually command a fleet of ships like at least 20 at the same time in a game but I can only use 1 and dont get me wrong, it's fun but it's just knda... underwhelmingOverall, I would give this game  a 6 out of 10 mainly because customization and upgrading aren't great at the moment and would like to see ALOT more variety. And if they could add some more ships that would be even better."",1"
"984,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewGood solid game at it's core, the Devs just need to fix the problems that have persisted for some time, such as ship tooltips not displaying correct information and the glaring issues with Crew creation (i.e. explain what the hell Crew skills do).  Not Pay2Win (yet) and it would be even better if they could get the ship mechanics right.  Matchmaking needs abit of work, half the time you'll find yourself as a novice playing with/against the top players on the leaderboards.  But the core gameplay is decent and enjoyable.  If you enjoy bashing your head on your keyboard after a match, or if you ever wanted to play World of Tanks but in LoL, this is the game for you.My one main issue: The Devs want $30 worth of Platinum to buy one Premium Ship that is exactly the same as the original ship, just reskinned with a pitiful (10%) exp/credit booster.  That's three times what the game cost at release. god damn ridiculous.  For $30 I expect a hell of a lot more than a new skin and dinky exp/cred boost.Spoiler! You WILL bash your head on your keyboard after a match on occasion  "",1"
985,Fractured Space,2016.0,Ever since I downloaded the game I've been hooked. I started playing when the game went Free to Play. This is the space game that I have been waiting for. Commanding a ship against others is just so exciting and I can not get enough. This is indeed a new twist to the MOBA style of games. All killer no filler.I love this game so much that I'm about to buy some DLCs to help support the game,1

"987,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Hello friends! This game is one of my favorites. I've invested a ton of time into it and still play pretty much every night. Its a swirling melee of a game with plenty of depth to the combat with plenty of strategy and tactics to play with. So if you read no farther then know my opinion is: yes get it and start playing. This game is also 100% free to play! With absolutely no pay to win involved. Crew and ships as well as alternative load outs can all be purchased with in game earned credits (earned just by playing, which is why you are here right?) You can use money to speed things along, but mostly money gets you cosmetics. Some of which are really cool and lovingly made. And no ship is truely 'better' than all the others. The models and graphics in this game are georgous. It plays smoothly and is well optimized. It is still technically under development and so a lot of things have changed since i got here. But honestly it is amazingly polished. And at the time I am writing this things are in a great place. The balance is solid, with a few ships over preforming and a few under preforming. The thing that really sells this game for me isn't the team play (though I love that) or exciting combat but the unique way good piloting can turn a ship from average to unstoppable and how great tactics and strategy can make or break a team. I hope you pick this title up and love it the way I do. See you out there."",1"
"988,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's the epic ship to ship battles of the sci-fi genre you want with the customization options you didn't know you wanted.UPDATE:Games has drastically improved as developers add more and more things. Game now has dedicated tutorial and start-up guide for new players, so you don't feel like you're going in blind, gameplay has been smoothed out, and the game as a whole is generally more fun to play. It fulfills the dreams of large capital ship combat, and then some."",1"
"989,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewPlayed this game for a couple of hours after getting it for free this weekend and overall I am saying it is a very good game, had 3 games in all upto now and not had a single problem in any of them. Very quick to get a game and once you know the controlles and warning sounds its a very fun game. "",1"
"990,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI haven't been as activie since the last free weekend, but wow. Fractured space has come a long way. I'm impressed by the art improvements and new ship along with the way combat flows. Deveplment seems to progress at a steady speed with focus on gameplay vaule and new ship (class) types."",1"
"991,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI like this game, it's very complex and requires a lot of strategic thinking and teamworking, the only thing i find to be a minus is that i cant play it at more than 20 fps in the lowest settings, that might be my computer but if you have a system that can handle it I really recomend this game"",1"
"992,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIs it fun? Yes.Is it worth money? Depends.The game is an early access version of what will eventually be a free to play game, with a tech tree similar to the likes of War Thunder or World of Tanks. However, it throws away the tiers, and instead balances all ships together into one matchmaking block, similar to Mechwarrior Online. It's enjoyable for a while, but the grind begins to get excessive. The good news is that you're not going to need to worry about repairs or ammo costs, which eliminates a point of stress in the grinding. The graphics are also absolutely beautiful. Unreal Engine 4 is put to the max, and boy does it look good. The ships also are interestingly designed.The game has two modes - a TDM style mode, and a capture the base mode. Both are enjoyable, but something like this could really use some more modes to keep its longevity. And now, onto the negatives. These modes won't keep your attention forever, and you'll quickly want more. The various classes of ships give a huge variety of playstyles, but again - you will be grinding a while to get a ship you may or may not like. UNLESS, of course, you decide to throw money at premium currency, in which case you can push to that ship faster, and this is a bit of a problem... unless you've snagged the game on a free-forever weekend, you've already tossed money at the game, and now they are asking for more money via microtransactions. This however, is only a temporary problem, since the game needn't be bought once it gets released.There also are major server issues, despite there only being a peak of about 1000 players online IN THE WORLD. Half the matches I'm in, I'll get severe lag stutters that are serverside, not on my end.Final thoughts - I'd suggest you DEFINITELY get the game on one if its free-forever weekends. It'll definitely net you enough enjoyment to be worth the download. If you want to get the game with money, I'd also say it's probably worth it, especially with the steam refunds should you not like it. Will it be worth the microtransactions? You decide."",1"

A great team-based strategy game that allows the use of plenty of different tactics, whether you wanna soak up damage or sneak behind enemy lines and decimate the opposition, I'd recommend buying it."",1"
"997,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is honestly a one to get. Since it's in the Alpha stage of development, there are some bug and optimization issues that need to be fixed.

There's advantages that working as a team can accomplish, like ambushing the enemy, distractions, etc. This game is very promising for the future, and I strongly recommend that people get the game."",1"
"998,Fractured Space,2018.0,""It was such a fun game early on. I had an issue when I paid for an alpha game and then it went F2P.  Didnt play for quite a while.

Its free, so go ahead and try it.  Maybe certain days have more players.  It really was fun...  I had way more than 9.8 hours, that must be after launch."",1"

It need quite a bit of optimization especially when it comes to sound but it is still playable and extreamly fun. Doesn't look like unlocks have been implimented yet but they are clearly planned.

1004,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewFirst impression review:Just started. Kinda like a moba version of World of Warships...in space! Should be called Lobby Simulator 2016! Takes forever to find a game. Still trying to figure out how to not die in the first 10 seconds of an engagement. Died a lot! Fun game though if you can find a team that's not playing it like a standard multiplayer fps where everyone just lone-wolfs it.,1

1006,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis game has a ton of potential. Will eventually be a better game worth a lot more. The only downside is that it plays like a video game with an obvious lack of realism in the physics dept. I hope that gets better but I dunno about the constraints of the software. Game play is the priority over realism with graphics consumption. Both would be nice. I love the concept of this game. It could be really great. I'd like to see...every ship have at least 2 regular attack abilities (guns & torpedos etc.)slick looking shields until they fail spectacularlycontrollable fighter squadronsmovable & destroyable asteroids & platformsdifferent trim levels for each ship with different abilitiessingle player with bots & story mode with cinematics will put this in the $59.99 ballparkI have more but they're most likely in the works already so I'll reserve until laterty,1
1007,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThe game is fun it plays very much like world of tanks only much more balanced where world of tanks has tiers of tanks starting very small and getting to very large almost unstopable behemiths this game just seems to have each ship having a different style of play some are snipers some are short range fighters some are stealth others are heavy tanks and there are even a few healers but all seem to be in the same ballpark of deadlynessdo keep in mind this not NOT a fighter vs fighter game at all this game is cap ship vs capship blasting each other some of the fights i have had so far have lasted as much as 1 min of nothing but blasting each other so its not 1 shot 1 kill at all Now all of that was good so the one VERY large - of this game the game launcher. when you start the game you can set here for anywhere from 10sec to 5 min before anything at all happens and then it will try to match 10 people up but a lot of the time people drop out or dc so you end up with unbalanced games which is NOT fun so far i have only won 1 game that was not balanced or in my favor that one game we had WAY better poeple skill wise and working as a team,1
"1008,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIt reminds me of dota and lol just without the creeps. People need to hold and push down (space)lanes acordingly, capture resource points to then acuire upgrades for their ships. Once your teams ships are strong enough to take on the enemies final base a window must be seized, perhaps when some enemies are respawning.It's a great game requiring tactics, teamwork, patience and planning. Shame the only people I come across seem to be incapable of understanding this. Bunch up and rush down one lane seems to be the only play most seem to know. If both blobs pick oposite lanes, whoever reaches the end base first wins only after doing this twice. If both blobs meet they fight, the blobs will then reform and repeat. The most excruciating part though, is waiting for a game.I recomend this though, in the hopes that one day enough tacticly minded people will play this beautiful game and I'll start having some really good edge of the command seat capital battles."",1"
"1009,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIt is:MultiplayerOnlineBattleArena I will take it it is a MOBA but doesn't have typical 3 lanes nor creeps. This is a battle of large capital ships. Even though ships are sluggish at the begining, games are not so slow and usually last 25 minuts. Game is built around team in mind in every aspect. To level up, whole team must take mining stations so entire team gets new level (ship upgrades). It is not possible to level up by killing ship but team with more ships get advantage - one player more means more firepower, more means to capture mines or infiltrate enemy base. Technically, feeding is not granting enemy any direct advantage.Ships do feel big and behave big. There are no plans to put in small combat ships - it is not the point of this game. Every ship feels different so with every unlocked ship, player must learn how to use it properly. Some ships have similar usage tho. Graphics are great but it is in early access and some optimization is needed.There are no paywalls not pay-to-win mechanics. In store there are only skins and items that can be purchased for ingame credits too. NOTE: Skins can be purchased only with real money.Game lack bigger player base. I hope it is only temporary thing as game offers really good fun."",1"
"1010,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewSince the game became free I gave it a shot, the graphics are beautiful and the game play is amazing. The wait times are still there but have been greatly improved."",1"

"1012,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Fractured space is super fun to pass the time. You can have most any ship you want within a week or two using in game currency. Only downside is it is very repetitive right now, not that it has ruined it for me."",1"
"1013,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIn its current form, this plays more like a space-MOBA than a space-FPS. And that sucks. You can't change class during a battle, and respawns will see you sitting on the benches for a minute or more. The biggest holes though are in the gameplay"
"1014,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewMy criticisms of Edge Case seem to have been a bit over-the-top. Edge Case have shown a willingness to listen to the community that players could only dream of from other early access developers. Thanks for making this less of a sluggish grindfest and more of a MOBA, Edge Case!"",1"
"1015,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIn its current early access alpha stage, I think this game is very nice-looking and fun. Obviously it could use balancing and fixes and stuff since it's alpha/early access, but it's fairly good so far. Very interesting and varied ship designs, with nice themes based on factions. If you're interested in graphics, then you might like the fact that the game looks very good even on low settings, although I will say the station models could use work. Not that it's much of a problem though, since you're usually shooting other ships. As for gameplay, it's good that there are a somewhat wide variety of abilities and strategies based on the ships you use. The unlocking system doesn't feel like it takes too long, although it'd be nice if getting credits was just a bit faster. The premium currency doesn't over-saturate the game either, which is a plus. They don't shove it down your throat like other games. Also, I might be a tad biased because I got the game for free. Props to these guys for the free weekend that let me keep the game. <3"",1"
"1016,Fractured Space,2018.0,""Once a great game... This was once a great game bt was ruined by a poor UI rehaul about a year ago and now the developers have decided to move on to greener patures, I hope for the best for them in their future endeavours."",0"
"1017,Fractured Space,2018.0,""so... I see that the developer is updating the game and upgrading it and what not..... BUTI started playing this game 2-3 years ago and ok, I was new and in development. Then devise optimized it and added """"for laptops"""" feature, basically scaling everything down so it's less hardware heaviest. But at the time game wasn't that balanced so I left my second visit after a year. This is my 3rd visit and I see that game progressed a lot. New menu UI and a lot of graphics elements added. That being said, its more hardware heavy now... AGAIN. All of that would be OK if I had graphics options that would render my game playable. I forgot to mention that I'm playing on IntelHD 5500 integrated gpu. So... I would recommend adding more options to ingame UI, and graphics alike and solve problems that game has:-ton of (motion)blur (I dont even have an option to add/remove thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ its just eating my gpu power and its just blocking my vision)-camera angle (I wonder if devs had this in mind"
"1018,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGame is in early access which is usually a turn off but even so it's extremely fun to play.  The different ships provide very different roles very well and it's been a blast trying them all out.  Strategy is paramount but in the current very small community it quickly devolves into ring around the rosey and/or team deathmatch.  Overall this game has huge potential when more ships/upgrades/game systems are implemented, meantime it's a very fun time killer."",1"
"1019,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I've been playing this game for over 2 years now and have watched it go from pre-alpha to alpha to beta, and if the developers keep the pace they have set with all of their updates and patches I have no doubt this will be one of the top independent online multiplayer games ever. This game is consistently fun and intense enough to alway keep you on the edge of your seat. While the game may seem like it is pay to win, I do not think it will be like that once the game is officially released. I just think it looks that way because the developers are just trying to get the funds to keep the level of quality they have established going."",1"
"1020,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewFor those who want to know a little more before getting this game, here is a basic overview of what is going on:-The game is a 5v5 conquest style, the objective is to control key strategic areas in order to gain access to the enemys base and ultimatly capture it-Strategys are very important, there are two left and right side wings where you must work up to the enemy side in order to capture a key jump base to get to the enemy base, this plays very well as they are effictevly two seperate maps.-In order to get between the maps you must """"jump"""" to them, it takes one jump to return to base and two to cross to the other side (ignoring the middle gamma for now), this is very similar to games such as league, where there is effictevly a time gap one can use to make pushes but also allows quick defense, depending on what the other team is doing.-On each side of these two wings are resources you can capture to help buff your team (like a leveling system) - hence control on these is also important-Behind these two wings are the bases on each side, which also act as basically seperate maps-Finally there is a middle map, that every few minutes will open up. Capturing this gives your team a strong buff. Battles for these are often heated and are a great way of turning a losing fight around or making the final strike to win a battle. If your team controls one of the enemy's base jump points you can also jump directly to the enemy base.The Ships-You play with massive space ships (this is simply the coolest thing ever)-There are three manufactures, each with thier own designs letting you pick/choose your prefered ships-Each ship has a role, the basic three being defense, support and attack (With many permutations, but for simplisity these are the main three)-At the begining of a match you can choose your ship and as well talk with your team on your prefered ship and find a suitable team composition-The ships play very well, I find many enjoyable and balancedOverall I am very impressed with what the devs have put together. I personally enjoy balanced competitive games where there is little luck or """"dice rolling"""" involved and that victory is because you have played better than the other team. So far the community has been great as well, which is fantastic.Final comments, the game is free and probably the best space game I have played in a while. Just awesome."",1"
"1021,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access Review  It was in fact the recent slew of negative reviews that first brought this product to my attention while exploring my que and got me curious as to what the hubbub was all about, then later on that same day a Twitch/Youtube streamer that I frequent started streaming the game and got me REALLY curious once I actually saw the gameplay.I think this game is a blasty blast.  It brings thoughtfully strategic AND tactical gameplay in a 3 dimensional environment to a broad genre of games that are very similar to each other.  Longtime RTS, MOBA, and shooter fans alike could all find different reasons to like this game.  The ships are gorgeous and remind me of cover art for sci fi novels out of the 80's and 90's.  (i.e. Larry Niven, Steve Webber, Isaac Asimov and the like)  If you were ever that guy that liked the idea of MOBA/arena style gameplay like LoL, Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm, Paragon, Smite, etc etc but were looking for something that slowed things down a little bit (not the length of match but the pace of gameplay) then this could be the game for you.  Add in the fact that you are piloting massive warships with kilometers long engagements ranges instead of a wee widdle Hero/Champion trudging down the same dirt path and it gets even better!  Fans of games like X2/X3/X4 that thought the world was a little lonely without other people, or the strategy gem Sins of a Solar Empire that wanted some more fast paced (and shorter game time) matches but still want to get their blowy up the space ships on should give this a try.  People who like the concept of EVE Online and enjoyed the basic pvp gameplay but got turned off by the way super hardcore community, world, etc may also want to try this out.  Hell, even Starcraft fans might find something to like in this game.  The community is dangerously small, (I hope this game makes it to full release) and the overall level of content has a long way to go before this game is ready for the masses but it has that magic spark that could could develop into something awesome.  If you want more on the negative aspects of the game go find another review, if you want to figure out what makes this game awesome just install it and give it a try.  And be patient, this isn't Call of Duty in space.   "",1"
"1022,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewHoo-rah this game deserves more, more than a whole universe galaxyThis game is not really meant to be f2p. At least 10 eur is good. Why making it free to play? ^,,^ I just don't get itBtw it's not such a bad game and the balance is good.They update it and at least the people who made Fractured Space are trying and trying and they won't stop trying not like the others, like just do it for over 2-3 years receive the money al'ight then stopping with the updates and etc but this a-a it ain't like this, Fractured Space the developers admins etc are really good as you can see on the forums. Yo people, start making games something like Fractured Space! Thinkg about the game not only for the money think about the players, not the money! No need p2w.Such a dirty game  such not a bad game.I recommend you this game, you won't want to refund it I am tellin' you!Have fun on the space battle field haha.and don't forget! THE GAMMA!! Gamma!Wonder how to type on All chat?just hit enter then write: /all [chat message]Also I didn't knew the ship Sentienel (supporter) Gotta help dem"",1"
"1023,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I like this game a lot because I've been big fans of games like World of Tanks and League of Legends, but I also really liked EVE online for awhile. I always love space games and this game gives the combat Eve didn't really have which is being able to control where your bullets go. I know for many this concept doesn't really apply to them, but this means alot to me. I do admit that the game has its problems such as game crashing when minimizing the game or the waiting for games can be funky. For example, sometimes my friends and I have to restart our client to get a match or the match would be aborted. I also love the Battlestar Galatica references and the concept of controlling entire ships which supposedly hold thousands of crew is really cool. The game's graphics are excellent which I love and expect from space games. However, do take into account that the game has just been released not to long ago and that the player base is still growing. Plus its free to play and the game has no """"play to win."""" They follow similar stragety to League of Legend with people being able to buy skins for money. Therefore, give the game a try and if you don't like it then uninstall it. Simple as that."",1"
"1024,Fractured Space,2016.0,""World of Tanks in space meets MOBA, being F2P with no F2P nonsense attached to it (no premium ammo, no premium ships, no tiers, nothing like better or worse craft - just size and roles with unique skills), quite generous credit gain rate and build from the ground up on Unreal Engine 4 (meaning it looks and runs very well). If this sounds good, go for it. I did and I am having a blast."",1"
"1025,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewLots of strategy and tactics and a lot more as this game develops. I play a ton of WoT and this is more involved in your strategy and tactics options. I would recommend the short tutorial, then go to the firing range for a few minutes, then do the tutorial again, and then jump into the game. There is a match making rating system to try to keep balance and have new players with new players. You can fly with friends, you can have your own test matches against friends.  Currently there are issues with matchmaking struggling to put together games, so the two minute wait can sometimes be more like 5 minutes. The game is much more about playing than grinding. I put my money on it to support it, and thus far it is not pay to win. Games can last 20 minutes and the action ratchets up as you get bonuses built up. The win or loss as the players get more experienced can almost be a surprise - you thought you had more time, or you didn\'t evade and get to where you were needed. Watch the videos on the starter ships also.  Definitely worth a try, and coming back to again and again as they finish polishing it. Remember it is in the final stages of alpha, but it is completely playable, and just darn good."",1"
"1026,Fractured Space,2016.0,""It's more like a World of Tanks in space, but with a better community.I love the fact that I don't need to grind the ships as I bought the Armada pack. In similar games the unlock of all the tanks/ships/heroes would cost much more time and money."",1"
"1027,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAhoj,The Idea behind this game is okay, its pretty fun for a while - solo and with friends.The Free to play Model works and it feels """"okay"""" (not unfair/at this very moment).It got a little boring (at least for me) after ~19 Hours of playing"
"1028,Fractured Space,,""its really sad how this game ended. This game was really amazing. Great gameplay great ships great visuals. If it was 1 year ago i would say buy but sadly it isnt. Queue Times are like Endless Space 2 Games... Endless, literally. This game just slowly died to not enough players. No real singleplayer mode make it pretty much unplayable. I dont think that anyone is still playing at this point. So great game and thumbs up but still dont install it"",1"
"1029,Fractured Space,2018.0,""This is a really great game ... however there's a huge BUT!The system promises that if there's low numbers of online players, they will fill in the gaps to make sure you get a game.However the reality is that you'll sometimes be waiting over 30 minutes to get a game.

"1031,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewI really liked the atmosphere and the ability to control large capital ships so overall a fantastic space shooter that i've been looking for, however two things i found lacking on a first impression and limited play. First off in general i felt it  was too fast, from combat itself to the speed and destruction of the larger capital ships. And second the larger capital ship seemed really undergunned for such a large ship. Frigates, corvettes, and destroyer style ships should be quick and manueverable with limited options for weapons sacrificing heavy weapons and armor for manueverability and speed. Where as the larger cruiser, battleship, and carrier options should be much harder to kill and have an assortment of heavy weaponry at the severe cost to speed and manueverability. Of course i only played about an hour, so i may be missing some of what the game has to offer, this is just first impressions."",1"
"1032,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game well on the way to the top. The graphics are great and have been improved recently. Recent updates have fixed a few of the even fewer problems. Starting ships are excellent and their company based tech trees have more in store.Getting this game would not be a mistake, whilst the player base has yet to grow to its potential, the current number of players enables fun and teamwork based gameplay other than each player jumping about the sectors trying to """"lone wolf"""" everything. Teamwork is a must for a win."",1"
"1033,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewFor an early access game, it is very well done. The controls are responsive and combat feels very fluid. The ship models are well detailed and beutiful. Unfortunatly, they are the best looking objects in the game, with space stations and asteroids looking very polygonal (think N64 graphics with much better draw distance). There are a number of bugs. Some only cause the UI to crash, but i have been crashed to desktop a few times.Overall, i would reccomend this game. The core gameplay is great, and while it does have the occasional bug, and the graphics are pretty bad, you have to remember that this is an early access game.7/10"",1"
1034,Fractured Space,2014.0,Early Access ReviewRequires ALOT of teamwork. Still needs abit of work. It's worth ten bucks even though within the next year or so it shall be free to play. The only thing i think it needs is an explanation of the different weapons and upgrades for the ships.,1
"1035,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's a really cool looking game, but with  a hell of a learning curve.

The minute to minute play is fun, I just really had no idea what was actually going on."",1"
"1036,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is pretty well made. It seems a bit simple at this point, but you have to think that its still in alpha. It's like War Thunder or World of tanks in space, with fewer models to play with."",1"
"1037,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI've had fun playing this game. I like the idea of a land grab game in space, using HUGE machines of war. It's a fairly pretty game"

"1039,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewLet me start off by saying that this game needs a LOT of polish.  Let me also say that it is currently day two of alpha early access, and we've already seen SUBSTANTIAL polish with a patch.  I first heard about Fractured Space by watching a video on Youtube from The Mighty Jingles.  If you haven't already seen it, it's definitely worth a watch.  The dev team behind this game is a hard working machine.  I've been a part of several different alpha tests/early accesses, and I've never seen a dev team put together a patch on day two.  To drive my point home, the newest expansion for Warcraft just dropped, and they're STILL having problems, and Blizzard has an almost infinite number of resources throw at its problems.All of that being said, if you're a fan of DOTA-types or World of Tanks/War Thunder, then this game will be a definite download.However...There are still currently a lot of bugs.  A LOT OF THEM.  I have been playing off-and-on since official early access release last night, and I've only been able to fully complete one match.  This is the nature of the beast when signing on not only to any early access game, but especially one that is this young.  I knew it was going to be like this going in, so please don't take this as a complaint.  The game is MAGNIFICENT.  The gameplay is fantastic, and tactics and patience are well rewarded.  So, should you buy into the early access?  Only if you want to support the dev team as they continue development.  If you are easily frustrated by constant game crashes and unbalanced powersets, then please wait until the game has been developed further.  Also, if you just want to pay to be able to play the game early, you should probably rethink your decision.  I would, at this time, only recommend this game to people who genuinely enjoy testing games in early alpha and having their voices heard by the dev team in order to enhance further development."",1"
"1040,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewSpace Piracy??I downloaded this game because I thought I could be a Space Pirate.. HahahaTurns out you couldn't.. Well jokes aside, this is one nice game. The graphics are smooth, the controls are pretty easy once you get the hang of it, although I still couldn't do escape maneuvers and got hit by a few lasers.. The """"Point Defence System"""" is great for intercepting enemy missiles, and never forget to use it when you encounter an enemy, because it could mean life and death.Leveling up from 1 to 3 is pretty quick too, once you hit level 3 you can start playing co-op and pvp. Haven't really tried all the features yet, but it's a decent game for anyone who wants to feel a fresh space fighting thing-a-ma-jig.. Sad thing is, it's a bit long to find players for PVP, dunno if it was me who played at a wrong time, or because not many people have installed the game yet.. Hopefully there are more people playing, because it's hard capturing the bases on your own while tanking 3 enemies.."",1"
1041,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewEven though it has had it's fair share of bugs. I still find myself coming back to this game time and time again. I do like the battles even though sometimes they can be very very 1 sided. But all in all i do love this game it is fun to play and trying to get to that new ship is what drives me to play it more.,1
"1042,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is amazing to say it is only in Alpha. Definite must buy for anyone who likes games like STO, Star Conflict or Elite Dangerous. + Also it's a great price at only Ã‚Â£7."",1"
"1043,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured space puts everything we love about Space games, and PvP like WOT. This may not have the super deep universe of the MMO space games coming out like Star Citizen but it's simplicity is what makes you wanna play match after match using all kinds of tacticts to crush your enemy's. The possibilities of combat are limitless with this game, massive capital ship battles with coordinated teamwork and amazing effects. Fractured Space is the online game of year! And worth double than what it is charging, this is a no brainer."",1"
"1044,Fractured Space,2014.0,""!!WARNING!! If you are not aware of it being in a ALPHA state. Please realize, before you buy. This game is in a infant state.Thanks.Early Access Thoughts:I must say that I have participated in a few Early Access games. For the amount of content that is available, at this very moment, is already worth my 10$.1: DetailAlready in its early state, Fractured Space has some good eye candy. There is some things that are placeholders, Im sure. But, so far, it is very nice looking. The ship explosions are some of the best I have seen for a space game. It looks just as I would think a explosion in space would look like. The asteroids look quite well done. (I am hoping that the """"Main Base"""" doest stay like it is. Looks more like a fighting ring, than a """"main Base""""..lol) 2: ShipsThey are going for more of a team play mechanic. So you have your Heavy, Med, and Light crafts. Then you have some different """"Roles"""" tied into the ships as well. From a sniper, to a close up """"run and gunner"""". Plus there is support class ships. Like a healer, and one that can disable a enemy. Very versitile, and logical, how the dev's have planed so far. 3: Game PlayYou have two teams. Fighting for control of Five """"Sectors"""". (Which is quite large) Two """"Home Bases"""", that are the """"Primary"""" capture point. The ships fly by using w/a/s/d/q/e.(sitting still will get you killed..lol) Space bar will raise you, while CTRL will lower you. You aim, zoom in(like ADS), and scroll in and out to zoom, with your mouse. There is a health bar on the Hud, around the cursor/reticle. Your abilites are on the numbers. You hold shift to pick a near jumpoint. (The animation for the jump does need some work. Which Im sure that they will) Some ships cature points quicker than others. So finding the right balance for your play still shouldn't be too hard. Now, In these five sectors of the map"
"1045,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewWhile I didn't play for very long, it was like a complication due to the manner in which I was playing (over a verizon dsl network, streaming from a windows 7 pc to a windows 8 laptop). The main problems I encountered were a slow network connection (from the router, not the game), fuzzy graphics that did not want to play nice and display properly on my laptop (likely a result of not configuring them properly on my desktop first, or even having to do with the router again), and dropping from games in the middle of a fight (Which I can blame on verizon, once more, but it may have had to do with the game itself).Overall, I would recommend this game. The gameplay I did experience had a focus on teamwork, on strategic maneuvering to enable you to appropriately apply the force you had at your disposal from flying a capital ship, and, well, 3 dimensional movement in space combat is always nice. This game is for you if: You have the patience to play a moderately paced game, are willing to work with your team mates (even if they are strangers), and have been looking for something that focuses on large ship space combat. This game will not scratch your itch if: you are looking for a game like tie fighter vs x wing. You will not by flying small, fast, fightercraft and engaging in dogfights. And that's okay. There are other games that do that, some in space, some not so much. War Thunder (last I played) did a very good job in giving you planes to fly around and dogfight in. Overall, it looks like a game with a good amount of potential that has already lived up to a fair bit of it. It's an early access game, so expect bugs, but the features that are already in (from what I've seen) lay out the foundation for a solid game."",1"
"1046,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access Reviewnice concept, but what I often miss at those giant spaceship game is to have a feeling for that scale and the meaning of it.. a fast gameplay where a single person controlls a whole ship with quick kills kind of... disapoints me.. I'd like to see something similar where single players control smaller ship classes and the big ships are like team / guild bases where player can dock and can take different positions on board of the main ship"",1"
"1047,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWow!  What all those Star Trek ship battle games should have been!!!  Imagine a starship with 5000 crew, and each ship specifically outfitted with unique technologies that makes you invaluable on the battlefield and fits your own playing style.  Again, wow!  I'm impressed.  I haven't had this much fun with a space game since Wing Commander.  When I fire the guns on a ship called """"The Enforcer"""", I feel like I just fired the phasers of the Enterprise (new version). To be honest, I have favored single-player games more than online multiplayer, but this game has helped win me over.  And, you don't have to be an expert to make a valuable contribution to your team!  When you work with the team, you help the team.  Sometimes it can get a bit frustrating playing with noobs, but I have to laugh when I see them do the same things I used to do.Yes, the devs are really on track with this game, but keep in mind, it is still in early development.  Some of the changes that have been made are a matter of taste, but it certainly becomes more interesting as the devs add more and more features.I can see Fractured Space becoming one of the best space games of all time.  I enjoy playing this like I enjoy Risk.  It involves much more strategy than just blowing stuff up, but when you do blow up another capital ship be prepared for the best effects that I've seen in any space game."",1"
1048,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewFantasic game it looks and feels great. Massive 20-40 minute long space battles take place where you and your teammates have to fend off the other team. This is game does require some strategy and communication between other players to win matches. For a game in alpha it plays great making it worth buying.,1
"1049,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewLove this game! -Diverse ships: each has a type of ship it is really good against and a ship type it is really bad against (based off of one-on-one) and as the game keeps being developed more ships are added with different load-out options (usually a standard, faster firing speed but lower damage, and a high damage but lower firing speed).-Each battle is different: every ship has a counter and a ship to compliment it. For examble"
"1050,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGood:-Easy controls-Easy to tell friend from foe-Interesting ship designs, vareity and roles!-Team work is important, but you can still manage on your own-Combat is challeneging, but that also depends on your opponent-The game isn't super fast paced, so you don't have to play like an MLG Pro.Neutral:-It's only 5 v 5.. Sometimes that isn't enough!-Population isn't as big as it needs to be.-Don't expect fair fights, haha. Good luck trying to get a 1 v 1 going.-Sector map is kind of plain-Ship blowing up animation could be WAY betterBad:-Early Access-No party system (At least that I know of)-No custom controls-No other game types or scenarios -No single-player campaign -Screen feels cluttered-Enviorment isn't very interesting. There should be some defensive stations on asteroids, the stations themselves or on satillites that should attack you.-No evacuating your ship option. I think if we are about to blow up, we should be allowed to evacuate our ship and decrease our respawn time.-Sniper class is the least useful unless all you want to do is get assists and deaths. Maybe I'm a bad Sniper in this game? But one play through left the worst taste in my mouth. Long range combat isn't very engaging or rewarding, so I'm sticking to close/medium range.Conclusion: -Despite the longer list of neutral or bad, you must understand. A lot of that will probably be addressed sooner or later.Personal Story:I decided to pick this game up today and was surprised how much I enjoyed playing it.The most epic, yet traumatic moment I've had so far was when I finished capturing an enemy base. I spotted a weakened enemy vessel and I went ahead to pursue it in my Enforcer when I heard more enemies are arriving! I glanced to my left and saw four.. yes.. FOUR enemy ships warp in. I said, """"Oh F$%^ me!"""" and I was dead in seconds, haha!Despite my most epic moment was me being destroyed, I only went -2.. With 5 deaths and 3 kills. Our team even one, even when the other team was far more coordinated with their assault and maneuvering."",1"
"1051,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewSo I shoulod start off and say this game is amazing the team behind it are the same that made strike suit zero, the actual devs are awesome people to talk with and the game is very fun to play, think league of legends dominion but with huge capital ships in space if you are after a different game to play grab this as its lots of fun, and the devs are great as well as the community see you star side people!"",1"
1052,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis is a fun Moba style game involving large ships. Where usual Mobas are fast paced this one however requires a lot of strategy and planning how you are going to attack your enemy. Team coordination is also a huge part of winning a match. I highly recommend trying out this game.,1

Controls are tight and precise taking a bit of time to get used to, and combat is crazy at times, but it all adds to the fun!Now though, I'm not sure. I played this when it first came onto greenlight, and since then I joined the Military. If only my Military issue internet was worth a damn, I could actually play it."",1"
"1054,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewMOBA with capital ships. Love it. Needs more maps, more ships, and more game modes. If it can get a few more modes, a few more maps, and a few more ships, it'll be on par with the big mobas, and would, due to the theme, be my personal favorite by far. It's also highly immersive.Needs more support and development! What an awesome base game and concept though."",1"
"1055,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I am new to this game but have played other MOBA's like: LoL, DOTA2, Paragon, SMITE, and HotS. I love this games new take on the genre and how it has the feel of a MOBA but does not try to replicate other MOBA's. The whole 'spaceship' as your character is great and so are the graphics in this game. With everything set to ULTRA itâ€™s just spectacular to look at and play. However, the game is not for beginners of this genre, as it does have a learning curve, but that may help with kiddy population that plagues a lot of other MOBA's. This game is not a game that you win on your own, you need to coordinate with your teammates and make sure your risky plays will be worth it and backed up by your teamâ€™s other ships. Otherwise, you will find yourself capturing a mine and out of nowhere 5 enemy ships have surrounded you.... Good luck and have fun..."",1"
"1056,Fractured Space,2018.0,""So, I played this game back when you paid for it once and then played. It was good. The environment wasn't complex, but it had enough in it to make ship positioning interesting and strategically relevant. There were just a handful of ships to choose from, and they were distinctly different from each other both visually and functionally. The community of players was pretty fun to play with too.Now the game is 'free', but actually not. The current total cost of all DLC is $179.96. The game is not good. Jumping from one tiny box to another makes everything feel cramped, and more congested than before - flying now feels like driving in Los Angeles. Ship positioning is mostly irrelevant because there are very few long sight lines left. The ship design has gotten lazy, and it's hard to tell one conglomeration of plates and girders from another anymore. And the player community... well, read the other negative reviews (most of which are well thought out and written by experienced players) and then read the comments on them. The people who attack the writers of those reviews personally, instead of reading and responding to the criticism... that's the current player base. It's like playing with all the people you know and love from YouTube comments.The recent updates are a pretty naked cash grab, and don't make the gameplay better than it was. Pay to win and lootboxes... this sort of thing is so disgusting it should result in developers being ostracized by the game community at large. EA would probably give you a medal though. Maybe if you're hurting for money you could sell out to them? I'm sure you all would get along famously."",0"
"1057,Fractured Space,2017.0,""This game satisfies my desire for a fast-paced space battle with capital ships. These ships are lumbering kilometre long behemoths but a majority of the ships are actually quite agile. Don't get me wrong,. When I say fast-paced, I mean specifically for capital ships and not dogfighting. A majority of space capital ship games will have you spending a minute to turn 90Â° while this game has you turning on a dime. The best part is, they also allow strafing.The ship models are simply amazing. They are very detailed and there is a nice variety of ships. Not all of them are 100% symmetrical as well which to me is great as symmetrical ships seem to be a sci-fi trope. You can also tell a ship's purpose just by looking at them. If you see an enemy ship with a huge gun strapped to its side, you better hope you're not in its firing arc!The learning curve can be pretty intense though. You will fall into the trap of tunnel vision in your first few games and Leeroy Jenkins your way into an enemy team's kill zone. But the thing is you will only blame yourself, and not the game's mechanics.I'm having a blast with this game and I can't wait for what they will do next. Try it out yourself. It's free!"",1"
"1058,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is Early Access, so you have to understand what you're getting into: it has some game-crashing bugs, balancing needs fiddling, the menus are frustrating at times, and there isn't a whole lot of explanation (particularly regarding controls). If you want a game in a more fleshed-out state, with only a few, minor bugs, and polished interfaces, this is not the game for you!That being said, as far as capital-ship-fighting games go (a sadly limited genre), this one is pretty damn good. The graphics are impressive, with lots of explosions back and forth, and ships that are well designed with all the blinking lights and gew-gaws we've come to expect. The controls are simple and (mostly) intuitive, such that some basic playing around will make sense out of most of them, all the while giving you the feeling of being at the helm of a massive warship.The basic gameplay is essentially that of a MOBA (League of Legends, Defense of the Ancients, etc.). You'll jump from sector to sector, capturing space facilities and engaging enemy players. Sometimes it'll be a solo encounter, two ships bobbing around each other, exchanging fire and close-range missiles. Other times, both fleets will meet and light up the darkness between asteroids. Both are impressive in there way, and fans of Star Trek, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica will feel right at home!Ships come in various classes, from your stealthy cloakers, to the fast-attack hunters, to long-range artillery ships, and all the way up to capitals with broadsides that can make a planetâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥its pants. Each has a primary weapon and secondary ability (slaved to the left and right mouse buttons, respectively), plus other support abilities used via the number keys. You can move in all dimensions (x, y, and z for you Cartesian-types), though you cannot pitch or roll. It has that slow, lumbering feeling you would expect in such large vessels, but without feeling sluggish or unresponsive.If you don't feel comfortable purchasing Early Access games, the developers are planning to take it F2P early next year. If nothing else, give it a shot. You'll be pleasantly surprised!Full ahead, helm!"",1"
"1059,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewI really enjoyed my first match of this game! It reminds of me Star Conflict meets League of Legends. Capture the points, kill the enemy, capture the main base! Super fun, very colorful and pretty intense."",1"
"1060,Fractured Space,2016.0,""The definitive MOBA for the modern, mature MOBA player. The gameplay is excellent. Battle concepts are simple enough to grasp, yet difficult to strategize around. Graphics and sound are top-notch, with mighty lazor beamz cutting across space, gravity wells pulling in massive behemothlike battleships, flak cannons spamming explosions, and missiles whooshing back and forth.The ship hanger is something I want to highlight"
"1061,Fractured Space,2016.0,""It's a really good game!When i first started it was sorta confusing, but I got used to it later on.

1063,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI'm a spaceship in space fighting other spaceships while space travelling to capture space mines in space to achieve victory. In space of course.Great game!Did I mention it's in space?,1
"1064,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access Review> Started game with balanced opposition.> Got to Gamma III unscratched, got over 80% of enemy base and ALL of the mines.> Looks like one more push and we're done.> Time for Gamma IV.> Advise teammates to all go Gamma.> They don't.> Enemy captures Gamma IV.> All enemy ships jump in Home Base while teammates are taking a well deserved stroll through the Betas.> Enemy takes our Home Base.11/10 would ignore Gamma IV and lose again."",1"
"1065,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game looks good, and it has a great feel of huge spaceships lumbering around throwing laser rounds everywhere, this is a great space opera online game.However, it lags with me a lot, either it's my PC, or its badly optimised. Yes, the game is in early access, so I'm assuming the lag will change for the better.Apart from that, great game!"",1"
1066,Fractured Space,2016.0,you are interested in fractured space and you want know if its worth trying while reading a review? damn it! go try it by yourself and stop reading thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ nobody can tell you what you might like or not. you have to experience everything by yourself.,1
"1067,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game feels meaty for an early access game. The classes are only in need of minor tweaking and there is rarely a feeling of being unfairly beaten.The slower pace of the game makes teamwork all the more important with come from behind victories possible and individual performances still critical.Well balanced teams are the key here, I'm looking forward to expansions, more content and extra features. This game is still worth a play even in early access."",1"
1068,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewUpdated review......I take back what I said about it being a paid to win game as there is just 1 premium ship that gives you x2 exp. The game is still in live alpha but that doesnt change the fact that its a good game. It get really intense at sometimes and its a great team game. I could see tournamants out of this game... Now like I said in my old review....theres only 1 map but what do you expect...early alpha and its in space... I love the whole concept of base capture then the home base attack but I would like to see more game modes... maybe ctf or tdm in the future.... I also love the whole idea of the customized ship idea... tho it needs some improving and more customized stuff for other ships that dont have any... Also just a bug report.... some times when open the game it crashes or after a battle it crashes...I'm really sure its not my pc....but I usaly just open it back and it works fine....This game will be great when it finishes! Keep it up developers!,1
1069,Fractured Space,2015.0,This is cool.  Its a adventure game where you can multiplayer and try and destroy other ships. This game is a defend style sorta like TF2.  you need to defend your point and try and capture other points with your spaceships in outer space.  I Highly recommend it if your a space game fan.,1
"1070,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewKnowing this is an Alpha product usually means I expect trouble. My experience was smooth. The game is pretty, engaging, with a reasonably low learning curve for getting right into play. Short videos from the main menu helped.The community was immediate welcoming. Teamspeak is a good pairing and greatly enhances the game. Very excited to see how it progresses."",1"
"1071,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewNote: I have only played 2 games so farThis is exactly what it says, a spaceship battle game. It is well done considering the point at development it is in. There is a bit of a problem with just picking up the game and playing, as it does not explain how the game works, and what the goal of the game is very well, but once you figure it out it is fine. The people I played with were friendly and helpful, so if you ever do not understand something just ask, and they should help.I look forward to further developement of this game!"",1"
"1072,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewSo far I have spent a few hours on this game and I have to say it is really good fun with or without friends. While I usually play with people I know, when I go on by myself I still have a good time. The ships currently in game are really good fun to use and it doesn't take that long to get the ship you want, be it the Leviathan or the Infilitrator. While the matchmaking doesn't fully work and at times it can take a while to load, the gameplay from it is very enjoyable, with two current game modes I am still satisfided with the variety in the game cuased by different ships and team members creating different scenarios.Locking down a lane as a Gladiator or sneaking behind the enemy as the Assassin both are fun in their own ways and I recomended this game to anyone intreseted in having either brawls in massive capitals or a quick hit-&-run on the enemy."",1"
"1073,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI've been a fan of space flight games for some years now and this one is right at the top of the list. Great game and simple to jump into and start playing when new to the game, and then dip into for a quick battle here and there or to say goodby to an evening!The emphasis is on teamwork and is cruitial to whether you win or are defeated. What is nice is that whether playing with an basic ship or an all singing all dancing upgraded ship no one can simply destroy an opponent in one or two hits, making the game playable across levels. Upgrades are simple to understand and easy to achieve if players are bold enough during game play to earn them and the bonus points on offer each time you play. Although it is in Alpha Deveopment there is already a strong range of ships, from the mennacing USR Flag Ship to the small Tital Corvette, each with a role that has no less of a function than others. Get it and love it!"",1"
1074,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewWell this game is still in Alpha and my review may change over time but so far it's a extremly fun game! Multiplayer is well balanced and team focused as long as they keep adding new ships and do larger teams this game is well worth the money!Now iif only I could fly a star destroyer in it......,1
"1075,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is incredibly fun, but i would like there to be more ships, maybe a fast and manuverable fighter, meant to use hit and run tacticts to destroy enemy ships? i would also like if a first person view was added, and i wish that the servers were more populated, but other than that its a great game"",1"
"1076,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewYes, I did not play this game for long yet.  I intend to spend more time on it though.Looks pretty cool and solid.Only thing I did not like was that someone wanted me to be kicked of the team play just because I am a """"noob"""" to the game.Really, I am sorry that I shot at you but when the game started all hell broke loose and everybody was just shooting.  I did not know scratch, so I just started shooting to whoever was closeset ...  oops!  That was a mistake.  Then I was still trying to figure out the controls and interface and they say I am """"just camping"""".  Come on, it is the first time ever I got into the game and you scowl at me like that ...  Seriously, that was a bit rude, man.I really am sorry I shot at you.  Please forgive me.Wait, I have an answer.  Next time just be in the other team and you can take out on me. Ha!  Now that will be more than fair, hey?C'mon mate, let's make some peace and shake on it.*Oh ya,  the game looks ok for now."",1"
"1077,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you ever watched space movies for the battles between ships, get this game. Its affordable, and worth more than is being asked.Edit: Had a chance to play a bit more, and I'm very impressed. Imagine a mix between Allegiance and Leage of Legends with a little Star Wars space physics to keep things light and focused on the ships and abilities, which are varied and specious.The game is like $5 right now. But it or else God doesn't love you anymore."",1"
"1078,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is amazing.Got it for free as part of the special weekend, already invested Â£40 into the game (Bought it for a friend, and bought the Vanguard Founder pack)This game is well optimised already, even my friend with his terrible laptop can run it on max settings.Well worth the money guys."",1"
"1079,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space is one of the best mutiplayer games I have played on Steam. It's highly strategic, exciting, fast-moving and a game where you need to use your brains. It has been improving rapidly over time, and I thoroughly recommend people check it out."",1"
"1080,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFun game that has a bit of a learning curve.  Very small player base, usually only about 60-110 people on at anytime. Never had a wait to play though, just saw a lot of the same names. Up to you wether thats good or bad.  Most ships play very differently and you have to adjust your playstyle to match otherwise you'll have a bad time.Good communication with devs and they regularly release updates for the game."",1"
"1081,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access Review- October 11, 2015 -Truely a Unique MOBA that has a lot of potential and a great Dev Team!- May 21, 2016 -The game continues to be an amazing game that is really fun. It has problems, but we're confindent the devs are doing everything in their power to fix and improve the game. If you're complaining about droppods, dont. This game needs funding, and drop pods are a non pay-2-win way to achieve this. Though I find it needs to be adjusted, spending 134k credits and get 2-15k credits from a roll is NOT good. It's a spit in the face. They need to make credits less common and improve the drops or add new things.9/20/16The state of the game is really good now. 5 person teams + Paragon-not-Gone is a win win! The MMR actually feels balanced, because I no longer see rank 5 and below players in our matches (when I'm rank 58).Balance? Honestly everything feels like it's in a nice spot, cant really complain about any weak ships or OP ships. Sure, you'll always have the bullSh-t ships, but those can be countered. It's not the situation where it defeats everything. The community is pretty small still, but it's active with new people joining all the time. Over the years I've gotten to know a lot of familier faces in FS, most of them are really nice and want to help out new people. So if you hate toxic moba communities, this place is for you!"",1"
"1082,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewBeing a long time fan of space games, such as Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, and such, this game fits into my comfort zone quite well. I've been watching for the release of Dreadnought, a similar game, but have actually turned my eyes away from it, because Fractured Space seems to be more of my kind of game. Wonderful ships, gameplay, graphics, I really don't have much to say about this game that isn't good!"",1"
"1083,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space surprised me. I didnt expect to enjoy it that much and picked it up on the free weekend, but its turned out to be a very solid space game with a lot of finesse. Each ship has its own character and methodology: This keeps it constantly feeling fresh. I highly recommend picking it up, I bought a founders pack after a few hours of play. Im confident it will only get better as it expands and branches out."",1"
"1084,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat for Early Access - witholding some bugs here and there, it's one of the better FPS/Strategy space games out there that actually need thinking and team work rather than reflexes to play well. No grind issues for ships and premiums dont have a single advantage over the regulars - just slightly more earnings and exp post battle. Definitely not a P2W, shows good promise - hope devs dont screw it up in the future."",1"
"1085,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAs many people can see, I only played this game for two hours so far. However I had a lot of fun doing so, the sound was great, the ships are detailed and feel unique and powerul. The maps are well designed and detailed, the core game mechanics are very solid.Overall since it will cost you nothing to try it, I would say give it a go. There aren't many space based, coop MOBAs out there."",1"
"1086,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWhile Its still in alpha and thus without a proper matchmaker or perfect balance, this game is alot of fun. You fly beautiful capital ships into combat and them blow the hell out of eachother. Get on the teamspeak server and join us as we have epic space battles."",1"
1087,Fractured Space,2015.0,I see a great future for this game. i hope they add more ships and more user generated content!Edit: well i payed for this and now its free to play... still a good game but i wish early acces people also got something for helping give feedback,1
1088,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewOk so I saw this game for fee on the store for the weekend so got it under the asumption of well cost me nothing so worth a try. I am recomending this game however there are some bad points which I am going to get out of the way first. When first loaded I did have some major bugs one crashed my pc completely and another was if I tabed out I could not get back on without restarting the game both seem to have fixed on their own. Another problem is limited content and microtransactions the bane of a gamers existance however its mostly to speed up getting ships or getting skins and there is more content on the way hopefully a few more maps as well as a new gamemode. I have just played over 10 hours in the last two days some with a friend some alone and have now come to the end of the exitement phase and the next ships I want are hours of gameplay or real money away so will not be playing all the time next week but will pop on for a match or so as it is very fun.Now onto the good stuff..The combat is simple and entuative but rewarding flying a massive capital ship into battle is awsome.The ships are amazing they look good and they do play differently so you can play a variety of roles as well as the starter ships being competative so you can get on fine from you first game.Playing with a friend you can comunicate with makes you far more combat effective and more enjoyable would be nice to have the option of being a team of 5 but that may be unfair.Finally the value if you can get it on the free weekend Just do its free fun if not its not overly expensive and it works not like half the alpha junk you find on here begging for full price for nothing. Suffers from a few alpha problems but fun and plays well.Have fun guys.,1
"1089,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI started playing Fractured Space about a year ago and, being early access, have seen many features (and their problems) come and improve over that time. The team at edge case have done an amazing job with this game. It is one of the most fun and addictive games I've played in my gaming career. Would definitely recommend giving this game a go, but make sure its a good go, at least to level 5, so you get to experience some of the nuances and tactics possible. Thanks Edge Case Games, you've done a great job!"",1"
"1090,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewEarly access. Ok. Alpha, Ok. A 'moba' stile game with no social. No chance to play with friends. A team based game...c'mon! Way too early to access. I gladly keep playing this game with worse graphic, worse sound, worse gameplay. But alone, it's a bit too much.Play this game if you have no friends or enjoy casual teams. It's not bad at all."",1"
"1091,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe makers did a very solid job importing a successful template into a 3D/space battle evironment.  Finding a good server to enter before it fills up is the trickiest part right now.  I'm also getting the impression that in some situations (when a game just ends), you can get stuck in the connection screen, thought I haven't really verified.  Once you're in the game, the performance is solid.  I haven't really encountered the memory bleed issue that other people have talked about.  Even at this stage I can see a ton of potential down the road.It is in prelaunch, so realize that:1. There's not as much content as a finished game, so battles do get old when you play several games in a row.2. You will be asking a lot of """"what does this ability do,"""" again, this game is in pre-launch.3. You will ask questions in chat, and most people have been helpful"
"1092,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured space has been a really fun experience for me so far. The game plays like a MOBA in space, and has excellent ships and control mechanisims. (Vertical and Horizontal strafe in addition to standard controls)  The objective based gameplay is, in my opinion, much more satisfying than a simple deathmatch setting.With the game now free to play, I would highly recommend trying it out! Make sure to try the tutorials, and you can check the Fractured Space youtube for ship guides on the starter ships to help you get started."",1"
"1093,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you are waiting for Star Citizen to be released and desperate to play a space game, try it! In fact, it's not a space sim. But who cares, you can fire Laserguns!!"",1"
"1094,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewOne of the best games i ever played,straight up,GREATâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥GAME.its team based,great gameplay and its only in alpha.AAA++++.If you missed out on the free weekend where you if you logged on and you got the game for free then you missed out BIG.Besides that its worth the buy in for the early access,Its just a greatâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥game if you like space ship types games.Again one of the best games i ever played"",1"
"1095,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewExcellent space combat game. Its what i would imagine space warfare would look like in the next 200 years, if we dont kill ourselves. Worth the price just in alpha."",1"

"1097,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewEARLY ACCESS and PROBABLY ALPHA!... NOTE THAT ABOUT THIS REVIEW!!This game need ALOT of fixing and adding if its going to be worth anything.However.. I will give an easy setup of good and bad parts of this so far.Positive:- Good space mechanics: It feels like you are flying a massive ship in space. Which is good cause its a space combat sim.- Ships and critical points: There are ship classes that are somewhat ballanced. Some unfair (looking at the cloak and short range 1 hit kill switch one) , but it all makes it better when you can damage parts of ships and take even MOAR damage!- Combat: Combat is slow, yet fast. Its like I have said.. It feeeeels like a space game that you see in Homeworld and typical space games/sci fi games. Cannons takes time to turn and same does the ships. Its like Star Conflict done more realistic.NEGATIVE PARTS!!!- Cloak and short range weapons: Probably the most broken ship in the game. Dont remember the name of the ship (assault I think), BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE!! It is stupid. Compare to the Sniper class, this ship is broken and either needs a huge nerf or be terminated.- The game outside graphics and game mechanics: Apparently from what I see, its going to be a MMO PVP MOBA ish game. It also has a cheap version of Star Conflict with the lobby. From what I see, there will be only online gaming with this game and no PVE.- Gamemodes: Capture the enemy headquarters... oooooooooh thats boring... that is the only gamemode at this point. OOOOOOH THAT IS BORING!There is really not much to say about this game, cause there is almost nothing in this.Its not a bad game, just feel the DEVS are holding it back. ALOT. They could have added Deathmatch, team deathmatch or anything else to make it more fun, or even have more variants that are not so """"straight out of the class system book of any mmo / RPG game"""". Owell. I suggest not buying the game yet. Maybe later? Only time will tell.Gonna give it a thumbs up cause... the devs to see that they can do it."",1"
"1098,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access Revieweven in the current (beta/unfinished) status this game shows a lot of potential. i jumped in for a quick battle & ended up playing all night. this is not typically the kind of game i would play, but it was quite fun and addicting.crafts are unique, have thier own style and are customisable on top of that. at this point there are not a lot of options, heck, some ships have none, but i guess some of that is to be expected on a work on progress title.there is also a leveling & craft upgrade system, but it appears to be more of a placeholder at this point than fully functional.i have not noticed any """"pay to win"""" elements so far, while there dos appear to be a """"premium"""" option (ala-robocraft etc..), it speeds up progression but do not give any advantage a non-paying player can aquire (with more time investment) graphics & effects look good, though they may be taxing on lower end systems.  i have not tried the game on a low end PC so i cant comment how well performance scales. but its pretty darn good looking & i have a hard time believing it will look as good on a entry level setup.TLDR. game is awesome, but still has some places that need work, if you can deal with that & dont mind paying to support development of a game that will eventually be free/F2P, then go for it. (i believe there are plans to reward early suporters) "",1"
"1099,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewNot bad so far. Very clunky and slow, there are seemingly drastic power differences between ships, and the loadout upgrades feel underwhelming/not compeling.The servers and game itself seem to have a bit of lag to them as well, even on a machine that far surpases the tech specs for the game. Still strangely fun though. Think MOBA in space, but not like you would a normal MOBA. Much of the skill elements involved in MOBA games are removed, especially reactive skill simply because the game is seemingly designed around being large, slow, clunky space ships. The only near exception to this would be the blink ability (flash from LoL) available to some ships.Recommended. Might as well try it, and maybe it will get better."",1"
"1100,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Its a nice game, and its still in Early Access, though it already looks pretty amazing!!! From what I see, I am sure they will keep up the great work and this game will be one of the best very soon! At the moment, the gameplay is cool, especially with friends, but it needs improuvements, such as being able to add and play with friends in game, more content of ships, upgrades, crew etc. What seperates Fractued Space from the top currently is the number of bugs, which make the game literally fractured."",1"
"1101,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewNot played a great deal to be honest, the game seems pretty good, i like the mechanics and the combat system. Biggest issue really is the wait times. 10 minutes between games is just not acceptable and I can much easily play another MOBA game that doesnt make me wait as long between matches. I cant blame the game for that, its obviously a small playerbase, but due to this it's kind of an endless loop, no players = long wait times = less players = longer wait times!"",1"
"1102,Fractured Space,2017.0,""TLDR: A MOBA in space without Minions, but classes that matter.This game is truly unique, the only other game that comes close to describing it would be Star Conflict. However in this game the grind is more enjoyable. It's basically an Arena MOBA without minion laning, instead it's a 5v5 match with taking objectives and preparing to meet in the middle for an all out clash every few minutes to gain a powerful buff. This can be a fun pick up and play type of game, I did find it a bit of a letdown there is only 1 actively played map, and the playerbase appears to be dwindling slowly once you get into the higher ratings, but there is still plenty of action in the lower ELO levels."",1"
"1103,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI have to say that this is pretty good for an alpha. There are bugs and glitches and incompatabilities, but that aside the game is solid and i quite like it. I tried DOTA and LOL and could not get into them, this i can get in to. I can't wait to see how this game developes."",1"
"1104,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewSo far I'm loving this game, coming from EVE, looking for something a little more laid back but still Combat based and this topped the cake.Only con i've had so far is the wait queues for matches, seem to be in the 10+ minutes at the moment."",1"
"1105,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is fantastic, the battles are epic, the graphics and gameplay are awesome. There is some issues joining an active game and I tend to lag out a lot of the time when loading all the ships... especially when people join the game. I love it!"",1"
"1106,Fractured Space,2016.0,""More fun than I was expecting, when you see a game this pretty in space and hear words like MOBA tossed around it makes me want to hold off. Checking out some play footage on youtube and a F2P price point to get into the game I gave it a shot and three hours later I'm having to pull myself away. I mean it's no EVE online, but I mean...if it was.... If you buy stuff in the cash shop it'll be worth saving you some grind time. Some may say a cash shop is pay2win but not this game, its down to pilot skill and teamwork.The only down side is some of the asteroids feel a bit clustered and would love an FOV slider so I can use my 3 screens comfortably. "",1"
"1107,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewSo far I am still new to the game and trying to find my footing but I really enjoy the experience. The graphics are superb and the game seems to be very """"playable"""". I am finding that it is taking awhile to adjust to using the keyboard as a controller. I am sure that as the game is further developed there will be a dedicated controlled available for us PC users. The developers are doing an excellent job and the game is amazingly mature for an """"Alpha"""" release. I have already recommended it to others and will continue to do so. I look forward to having more """"throttle"""" time on the game!"",1"
1108,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewI sincerely hope this game takes off when it goes full release. The alpha thus far is incredible. The game looks beautiful and the gameplay is enjoyable. 10/10 will continue to play,1
1109,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewStill Alpha but lots of fun - surprisingly free of bugs and some awesome graphics. It is demanding on machines but if you are running graphics cards from 2012 and beyond you should be good.Online play only at the moment but it gets very competitive and the battles are versatile.,1
"1110,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space is an immense and at most times intense Space Ship shooter. As it is a team based """"Control Point"""" style game you require team effort and support from other players on your side, tactics are an important part of the game and the worst thing you can do is follow your team into the enemy base and get yourself killed!I'm going to do a serious review on this because I actually like this game!What is Fractured Space?Fractured Space is a team-based space combat game with a lot like the """"Control Points"""" gamemode from TF2, the ships themselves in the game are based around Capital Ships for example, Frigates, Cruisers, Battleships and the things you see a lot in Sci-Fi games. The ships feel large and weighty in space (even though there is no gravity) and they are slow to control, just like a large capital ship would feel like (If you catch my drift!) The aim of the game is to work as a team based fleet and capture control points A1/A2 or B1/B2 to make your way to the enemy base, though Beware! The enemy will try to do the same, the combat in the game makes it epic and this game, though in early access is very promising and is definitely going in the right direction!With 3 starting ships, you fight to earn XP and different Corporation style currencies to upgrade your ship or buy your own! (More on the 3 types of ship later)ProsCombat SystemThe Combat system in this game fits well with the style of the game.The Capital Ships in the game feel, fly and fight like capital ships!There are many different capital ships in the game with different classes, Corvette, Assault, Flagship, Support, etc.The different ships have they're own classes! Corvette for support, Flagship for Defence/Mid-Assault and Frigate for Frontline assault.The combat is competitive.Each ship has custom abilities from Launching Missiles and disabling beams to Hanger based defenses for launching fighters and drones.Different skins for different ships.Different crew members which add extra things to some stats.ConsIt does have some pay to win features, which I dislike, a lot. (Not the actual P2W features but the fact it has P2W anyway) So the Pay to win isn't really much in this game, it mainly includes extra skins for your ships and extra crew.There is an in-game upgrade system, I don't know anything about it/how to use it other than """"It makes the Rich Richer and the Poor Poorer"""" essentially means that it gives your team/enemy teams better buffs for some ships, making the games quite unfair.""""Requires agreement to a 3rd-party EULA"""" Now This... This is something I do not like in a game, I hate it honestly, I understand it allows a set up for an account, but if the register sites servers are down then you cannot register and cannot play, also it Takes Time out of your excitement when you want to play this game, So you better have an email address ready!This might just be me but being in Europe, and playing in Europe servers I still get quite High Ping, so did my friends and some of their friends when we last played some games of it.Can be grindy at times but that's only if you want upgrades/currency, and to get that you have to get kills so if your bad at this game your kinda Screwed!So should I buy this game?Well that depends! If you like the sound of playing a space shooter based upon larger ships instead of fighters then Go for it! but if you don't fancy it then don't bother! Personally, I think you should buy this game, Perhaps Â£6.99 is a bit steep for some people but for me it seems perfectly reasonable.Final Verdict:Buy this Game! "",1"
"1111,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is still in Alpha, but I don't have to be too lenient.Pros: The game is quite fun, allowing you to move a """"massive"""" capital ship and attack other """"Massive"""" capital ships.         The game features SEVERAL different designs of ships, each with very different play styles.         You can fly in all three dimensions.         You can't be team killed.         You can play with a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ internet and still do good.Cons: The game needs some balancing to be done, and they need to better express how to play some ships, like the frigate. The description for that ship is EXTREMELY misleading. It's essentially worthless, unless you're attacking the sniper or the destroyer. Speaking of, that ship needs an overhaul as well.             The game is resource intensive, and has limited to no playability on medium to low grade rigs.           Although you can fly in all three dimensions, you can't turn on your Y axis. You wanna point your ship at the """"sky""""? Hah. Haha. Overall: It's a good game and it's promising. Very respectable for an alpha dev."",1"
"1112,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewSo far I have really enjoyed playing this game, particularily the larger ships like the leviathon and destroyer. Definately recommend this game to anyone who likes space. I do think there needs to be some changes to HP for some ships, especially the cloaked ships and sniper.  A ship that has devestating alpha, can cloak, has decent speed, and 2000 more base HP than the fast ships that would be hunting them seems slightly unbalanced to me.  Don't get me wrong, I love playing them but they are just don't have enough weaknesses for the role they are filling.  Sniper ship also needs less HP and its guns should have slower movement(not too much slower but a sniper shouldnt be able to follow a frigate 5km away(and to the side) and hit every time.  Think a tank destroyer in world of tanks vs a fast medium or light.  They can hit but it's much harder.  I think the Carrier damage rating should be reduced 1 point as well.  It really is more of a support/defensive ship and even in close range with max upgrades(vs a max upgrade opponent) it doesnt seem to match the offensive output indicated by its rating.  Just to be clear, I think the damage is fine(but I wouldn't complain if there were a few more bombers per wing) but that it doesn't seem to meet the current offensive rating from what I've found.  These current specs are not game breaking by any means and pilot skill usually always wins but I do feel these are relatively easy fixes that would help game balance."",1"
"1113,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI waited til the game went free to play because of how much heat it's gotten over a certain clan.It's pretty fun and coming off World of Tanks and Warthunder, the grinding to unlock new ships as well as earning exp isn't as harsh as it is in WoT, plus I actually enjoy being able to respawn in the same game. I don't really like LTS type games. Plus with a more MOBA type of format it's been pretty easy for me to adapt to it since I play a metric â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of Smite. The queue times aren't bad either, only took a couple seconds to enter a game when it says that the average queue time is 3 minutes or so and at the time only a handful of players were online (430).I only played two games so far and I can already tell that some ships aren't exactly in a good spot. The Conquest mode is faily easy to understand and I like how the map is layed out and is pretty much reminiscent of the standard 5v5 MOBA maps. The main reason I wanted to play this game was for the space combat and being able to use these massive ships, that part hasn't disappointed. I'm going to give it a positive review for now. It also being free to play helps it since it doesn't really offer much and only has the one mode to play. Whether it was worth $9.99 when it was still Early Access I wouldn't know."",1"
"1114,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIn essence this game simulates a naval conflict, at sea, however as in space it allows going up and down, as well as all other directions. The maps are basically the same which is a slight annoyance, but the astroid cover makes for some great battles where everyones at eachother's throats!It's a game i am passionate about playing"
"1115,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI freakin' love this game!I have been looking for years for something like this ... was greatly disappointed in Battlefleet Gothic, Star Conflict as well as a few others ... this is/was exactly what I was looking for!Hell i even created tabletop games like this because I love the subject so much!I can't wait to see where else this will go ... would love to perhaps see like a community warfare to conquer sectors or a free-to-fly and encounter/battle cosmos."",1"
"1116,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewOk so I got this game when it first came out, I played a bit and then i left it but now I have come back and wow its gone from strength to strength I love playing it and I cant get enough of it! and to top it all off its free 2 play now so people have no reasson not to try it out. So if you are reading this then hit that download button now as this is one game you dont want to miss out on! :)"",1"
1117,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis is a really fun game two teams in space trying to take over reasoures and stations you pick from ships that suit the way you play (i my self use the sniper class ship which is a long range shooting ship) there is only one map  but it is early access and there working more on the game play and sorting out ship stats than maps from what i can tell but this is a must try game,1
"1118,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access Reviewfractured space is a space opera moba. except there are not enough ships on the map. total of 10 at a time more ships = more fireworks =more fun. the visuals for the larger combat arenas is fantastic. the controls are good with the exception i would like the ability to add more inertial the the ships or turn off their inertial dampers. After a couple updates there are a ton of ships now with only the one sniper being incredibly annoying to fight against as it can tick off half the health of most ships from accross the map. The game has gotten another game mode that is a little more singular but more modes could help.So long as you have a decent game you can earn a new ship regularly and there is a shared exp system for factions that is for both ships and ship upgrades. Unfortunately the one thing i usually run low on in between upgrades and ships is in game currency which is earned at a slower rate than exp and is slightly earned differently somehow. Honestly the attachment of currancy seems more like licking at the coattails at more established games, mainly other mobas and the only other need for it is getting crew which is permanent status adjustments in lew of the normal in game status adjustments which is replaced with just normal leveling dictated by a team shared resource system. meaning its harder to carry a team as you are always the same level as your allies even if your the only person working towards winning.the only real reason i cant really recommend the game is the stupid prices of the premium content. 15 dollars for a skin is rediculous. the game is 10 how can it be suggested that 15 is a good price for a model changing skin. pallet swaping skins are still only 5 so thats still silly. 5 dollars is #1000 premium currancy and buys 1 #990 palletswap skin or 9 sets of 4 #110 boosters. so the boostes may be worth it but its a little weird that you will always have a few bits of currancy left over. also as far as i can tell 1 booster is 1 match so if this is your game of choice you will end up burning through them."",1"
"1119,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI started playing on the 'free' weekend. I did remap my keys since trying to hit LCTRL while in a fwd turn was too much for my fingers to manage. Overall I'd say 5 out of 5 stars! Reason is it is early development and I like what they are doing and where they are going. They have pretty much gotten a handle on ship OP so now it's up to the operators style!  And seriously, when you re-equip your Hunter and take out a Sniper solo . . . Awsome!  Not very easy and definitly not in a direct conflict, but blink in and fire from behind, then blink out and reposition. As long as you stay behind the gun and use your missles as soon as they are ready, Sniper is not that advantageous. Sorry guys! Thank to the devs and keep up the great work!"",1"
"1120,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access Reviewlooks very nice and runs smooth, i bought this for Â£5 and its definetly worth the money, i normally pay Â£10 for dlc for a game and i bought this whole game for half of that."",1"
"1121,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI've just gotten the game this last week, and as much as I love it, I can't help feel there's a massive imbalance going down.I mean I'm only a lvl 2, (Don't Laugh).. and I'm being pitted against players that have Lasers that slice through your dam ship & they seem to zip across the battle space lol, no wonder I'm getting a kicking.I guess this just means I'll have to buckle up & keep upgrading, though I'm sure Noobs such as myself can be pitted with a matching class.However, all being said, I still love the game & will keep upgrading, you can also spend cash to help speed shti up.From what I've seen, there are a few playing it like this, and if you like to stay ahead, Then you will have to spend a little cash getting there, though you could still play for FREE if you wanted.Great Graphics, excellent scenes, Wicked Sounds, Great Space Battles."",1"
"1122,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access Review     This game seriously deserves more than 76% positive ratings. For an alpha game, the graphics on the ships are flawless, and trust me, only having 1 map doesn't make the game tedious since the fun doesn't come from pretty scenery, it comes from great plays and battles. It's a complicated rock-papers-scissors that requires coordination and strategy even if the idea is simple.      My only gripe is the tech and upgrade trees, how one has to unlock a certain ship or ability when their end goal is a different ship or ability. The ships and abilities are sidegrades anyways, fitting your playstyle so why not be able to directly unlock the ship/ability you want?     Overall, a wonderful game that's only going to get better. One worth sinking your harpoon (yes you heard me right) into."",1"
"1123,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is in its early stages of development, it is an awesome tem based game.  Give this game a chance it will only get better.  Its a game you have to  work your way to get ships and equipment.  There are many different ships to choose from and they are unique in their own way.  Many of the ships are mission dependent.  If you work as a team you succeed more than individually.  Strategy and tactics are the keys to winning."",1"
1124,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewI haven't played this game for long at all but i know its great already! Its very fun (even though i suck at it)10/10 Would blow myself up in a HUGE spaceship again!,1
"1125,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI've played 25 hours, and I can safely say that this game is great and It's only getting better.If you are on the fence about buying this you should totally do it, because once you get past the tier 1 ships it becomes really fun.The Sniper is a fantastic ship in particular and one of my personal favorites. Once you get past the learning curve, there is a ton of gameplay and lots of fun to be had"",1"
1126,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewA pretty space mobalike game with ships that feel unique to play and have great visual design.  Balance is fairly o.k. and is being worked on but so far I've been having a lot of fun with it.  The latest update adds the dropship system which is a nice departure from the previous method of obtaining crew in my opinion.  I look forward to seeing this game grow and hope to see the community expand.  Also of note - some people complaining about F2P but this was always the intent and Edge Case was always up front about this.  People bought into early access and also recieved ships and boosters for it so they've not a leg to stand on.,1
"1127,Fractured Space,2018.0,""Immediatly fun because....space ships. Hidden depth and strats abound. the grind feels like alot at first but you quickly get ships and crew that you enjoy. Each ship feels very different & the crew you choose can add alot of personality to your ship as well, with sometimes badass other times funny commentary, and live combat responses. It doesnt just feel like driving an empty lifeless ship through empty lifeless space.Combat is mostly slow and methodical with bursts of of intense heavy firing action. When both teams are on point the battles are extremely rewarding. Its a game where position is everything. predicting enemy movement while also trying to win rock paper scissors. While at the same time you can be on the losing end of a type matchup and still come out on top with superior piloting and alot of heart. The devs seem to not only love & play there game but are rather active with updates which is a mega plus"",1"
"1128,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewEarly Access at this point, but a really solid and fun online space battle game.  It's a perfect blend of strategy and action....nothing like jumping straight into an epic space battle...reminds me of BSG."",1"
"1129,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI have to agree with everyone - great game so far! It is an alpha and it can be unstable (it crashed twice in an hour of play), and there aren't many upgrades or customizations to ships, but it's a lot of fun. I remember another reviewer saying it's unbalanced. I actually disagree. Each category of ship has a very distinct feel and great strategic potential. The problem is that most people playing this game right now are just like you - intrigued gamers just trying it out a bit. Because of this, no one's coordinating and no one's really trying to win. You also can't currently change ship types in game. So if the other team is full of assassins and snipers, and your team is made of nothing but flagships, you're going to get your butt handed to you. But if you happen to get on a balanced team? It's pretty fun. Get it. Try it out. Love it. Anticipate the future."",1"
"1130,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Update 09 May 18:       Much has changed since I last made any comments about FS.... I would like to say they have brought the game many miles and really changed, evolved and improved the game.  I still enjoy playing and the new wave mode called Last Stand is a great deal of fun and will test the best of players.  I've managed to reach wave 14 a couple times with some other skilled players.  A great bit o fun.  I would like to see some AI changes to the waves.  For now, they are predictable, which is okay, and part of how we can prep for each wave and attempt to push futher into them ... However, taking that to a new level of unpredictability would be cool.  Early Alpha Comments::So far the game is fun ... It does have more balancing to work out, but that's always typical for Alpha state ... Anyone who loves space games would enjoy it ... Maps are very limited right now in Alpha ... Latency is a HUGE issue ... my one true negative ... yes, its free service, and in Alpha ... but its very hard to play with horrible latency ... Crashes a lot ... to much, hopefully more polishing will fix these bugs ... and the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ part about the crash, once you drop from a server, you loose all stats from that match ... so if you are playing for 30 mikes and boom, you crash, everything from that game time is wasted ... NO way to rejoin a match ... hopfully this will change in the future when more of a solid state of the game is created ... So far, I like the game, it has much potential and I'll play from time to time and really hope for the best."",1"

What amazes me is i play on a lower end laptop and it works and doesn't look half bad, not great obviously but very playable. Really hope they keep up the good work and they dont try and bleed the player base dry. From what i have seen though i do not think they will try to pull any bull on everybody. Would i recomend someone getting into early access? Yes absolutely, need more people playing*EDIT* Really needs a system in place to discourge people from disconnecting from a game, i know that will be some time off if it does happen, and i also know that not all disconects are not players quiting because the game is not going the way they think it should (trying to be nice) but something will need to be done eventually"",1"

"1134,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt plays a lot like World of Warships in space, and I like the different roles of the ships and if you have a team that communicates well it is a great experience. Some ships feel very niche and not worth playing if your team just does whatever they want, so team play is pretty essential. It feels very MOBA-esque, but would be nice if they added some more maps and maybe some sort of creep-wave? The good news is the developers seem to take player feedback into consideration. TL"

"1136,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI really enjoy this game. The matches are quick, brutal and and require a lot of teamwork, starting with ship selection. The ships are varied with many quirky features. It takes time to master each so I don't mind the grind, as each one is pretty fun to play.

Boldly going where no man has gone before.Fractured Space is one of the most polished and well developed failures in steams recent history, if any game deserved to do well it was this one, and yet far from doing well, the game has struggled to break 350 peak CCU in recent months, matchmaking times are often measured in the 10s of minutes vs minutes and its only peaked over 1k once in near 2 years, for a game with 500k+ early access registered users, there surely must be a huge problem with the game for it to have such a low ccu? or maybe not.The most realistic multi user fleet simulation ever.Amazing graphics, decent mechanics, great sound design, a very fair free to play system, a wide choice of ships, on paper there is no reason for Fractured space to have failed the way it did.Developers deserve a medal.With such low CCU, and having lost over 99.9332% its user base (basing on the 500k users figure, its probably even higher % by now) you would not blame the developers for leaving this game to rot, and yet the developers continue to push out new content, even launching a new co op campaign mode, allowing PVE to go beyond simple player vs bot missions.So if its so good, why is it failing?The game was the opening volley of a possible genre, a Space Moba that focused on capital ships sounded amazing in principle and was executed about as well as possible the problem is.. it seems the genre wasn't one gamers wanted or embraced.Worth a play?There is plenty of free solo content to keep you busy, but the overall long term survival of the game i would question, its never managed to attract a large user base and with upcoming titles in the genre it cold lose some of what it has already.https://bluntlyhonest.review/2018/09/18/fractured-space-a-polished-product-without-market-appeal/ "",1"
"1142,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I came accross this game on steam many times and have always found it interesting as a concept. I was a bit turned off at first and avoided downloading it because I was worried this would be a super-complex space game that would take forever to get into. I was wrong. Though Fractured Space offers it's fair share of complexity, it doesn't take long to learn the basics. You'll enjoy it right off the bat as you slowly learn each ship, one by one, as you would heroes in a regular moba.Even if you're not a huge fan of mobas I would recommend the game. Though the objectives clearly reflect that of a moba, the approach in combat is totaly different.Pros:Very good gameplay/concept.NOT a pay to win.Awesome ship and level design.Cons:nothing comes to minddownload it!"",1"
"1143,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Awesome tactical combat game. If you like games like War Thunder or World of Warplanes, but want a more sci-fi setting, this is the game for you.

"1144,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewDecided to give this game a try now that it is F2P and I am very positively surprised.First impressions after a few battles.This is a very fun Spaceship moba style game.Space combat is engaging and you have to keep an eye on what side of your ship you show the enemy to prevent him from punching through your armor as well as trying to hit the enemy ships were there armor is down, which leads to some nice maneuvering fights.Playerbase could be larger, but that as others have mentioned is most likely because it just went f2p, the game certainly has what it takes to attract a lot more players and I would not be surprised if the player numbers go up quickly now."",1"

"1146,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I've been playing this game since beta and let me tell you, it's FUN. Games can get hectic and you can win or lose a close match by a fraction. You also don't need to worry about unlocking ships right away if you're a new player, as the other ships aren't better or more powerful than the ones you start with, merely different. The Venturer is particularly good in the right hands.This isn't a FPS. You don't join a game and just fly around shooting the enemy (even though some new players think that's what you do). No, you use your ship's strengths to help your team capture the mines, gamma and eventually the enemy base. Kills and combat are ultimately secondary to those goals and theoretically a game can be won without anyone ever firing a shot at the enemy ships.Combat is fun though, and you will be fighting often. It gets pretty damned hairy too.And it's free to play! A game of this quality that's free to play? Why aren't you playing it?"",1"
"1147,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Its kind of funny that I put down Battlefield One for a F2P. I will admit, I bought some of the in game currency so your mileage may vary, but I feel like it is not really a pay to win. Sure, if you put money in you get more powerful ships, but they come with drawbacks as well. My biggest complaint is that matchmaking takes a while. That is due to a smaller playerbase so it isn't directly the games fault. Overall, if you were looking for a different sort of deathmatch or team strategy shooter, this is a good choice. AND it is free."",1"
"1148,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewAs a long time fan of the space genre, i for one thoroughly enjoy this game. It only has 2 crews and six ships at the moment, but enough veriety in them that no match is the same and that every battle is enuiqe. now for a new game (and keep in mind it is a early access game and will be for a while) there isnt to many players, and it is a little buggy. some matches lag and freeze then all of a sudden your in the main menue again But the devs are fixing it every day and are lisstening to us the playes to make this game batter. but aside from that i highly recomend this game to people who love space battles, the sounds, the styles, the combat, the ships, the easy to learn controls, to the custom loadout ships. Its simply a good fun game."",1"
"1149,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewI have no idea how I got this game, but I am glad I did. While it is early access, it is a very playable early access that has built a solid core of gameplay. Each ship available plays differently, there is absolutely no sense of 'same ship different look'. The abilities are varied without being overwhelming, and so far their use has been rather straightforward.My only gripes at this time is that the menu UI is a bit clunky and not terribly informative, and that I have been on the recieving end of my entire team quitting not even partway through a match leaving me to be stomped on by 6 flagships."",1"

1151,Fractured Space,2014.0,Early Access ReviewThe Game is quite good lots to learn (in terms of your shops +'s and -'s) and keeps you thinking. The leveling process seems to be a bit slow i did really well in a game and only got a few XP for it so it seems like to get to level two would take an age! From what i can see there is currently no options to level up your ship or train crew its a simple fly around kill/ capture and if you do this enough you will earn enough xp or credits? to buy the next ship. It would be nice to be able to level up the crew or even improve on the ship.The interface isnt quite as clear as you would like but this game is in its Alpha stage!I think its a great start to the game and the fact that im hooked on the Alpha says it all! If you have ever played a space game and wished you could command the capital ship this is for you! Give it a chance! I will update my review as time goes on.,1

No different modules, no fittings, at best you might have a chance to use different ammo.-point above leaves you with changing crew and their implants as only way to """"modify"""" your ship, which is a) not really modifying, it merely changes some number values and b) annoying asâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥as you buy pod that costs as much as a ship that contain RANDOM crew and then you have to spend even more â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ currency to actually unlock it. Same goes with implants. Good luck getting speficic member with specific stats you want...-grindfest, to get another ship you need to farm like 3-30 hours. And then hundreds, maybe thousands more for decent crew + implants... With no feel of progress whatsoever.Pros:+ ship models are well done+ you can try ship you dont own+ aiming system is good (or better say as you might expect in this kind of game)+ spaceships (well... if you are that kind of person)Verdict: Not worth it. Latency issues ruins everything this game might be good or enjoyable at. And there is almost nothing to ruin anyway. If you like fights with big ships and dont enjoy neverending grindfest, or you want some actually useful results of grinding and/or actually be able to make some modifications to ships, go play Dreadnought, EVE or something."",0"
"1153,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewWould definitly reccomend this game to anyone who loves big spaceships and explosions. While the game still has some ironing out of its progression system (as well as current meta), the core gameplay, mechanics and visuals are there. The game has tactical depth and is worth the time to learn how to play. So stop reading this review and go blow some space ships up!"",1"
1154,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI was having problems starting the game and wrote about the issue in the Community Hub and BOOM one of the devs of the game answered my question in about 5 minutes. I've never had this good customer service.Definitely thumbs up for great game and devs!,1
"1155,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI have played this game A LOT.And it is a very good one in my opinion.I don't get all the hate lately. Most of it is due to angry kids, not getting everything at once for free or confusing facts.Pros:- Real money only buys you exclusive cosmetics in this game. EVERYTHING else is achieveable with ingame money. I didn't spend a dollar on this game for progress. Real money also buys:: Boosters (they will double your XP or Credits after one round. But you can get them through rng drop pods after playing a couple of games): You could buy a ship with Platinum (real money  currency) instead of credits. BUT it would be expensive and you also have to pay with XP for the ship, which isn't buyable with real money. So most likely you have enough credits after getting enough XP for one ship.IT ISN'T PAY TO WIN!- Higher tier ships aren't better than the starter ships. In fact the starter ships are very powerful. The higher tier is just more complex to play and imho more fun. They try to balance every ship the same. So you don't need the most expensive ship to win.- Every ship has it's own style to play with. So it is very different and brings a lot of depth to the game.  - You can't win this game on your own. You have to play as a team and you have to communicate. If you don't do that you are doomed and more experienced players will turn from helpful to salty. So if you are new and you red this: Please play as a team and have an eye out for your mates. Let people help you.- Graphics are good and there are a lot of visual improvements with most updates.- Long term fun.- You can play as a team up to 3 in public matches. Which will get raised when there are enough people to play against as a premade team. So it doesn't screw the balance too bad.- There is a shooting range so you can try any ship before grinding for it.- 2 game modes. Conquest that takes a little longer (25-50 minutes depending on the teams and balance). And Frontline, which is fast paced and gives you a random ship out of all ships and will provide a big battle arena (just one lane) in which you have to win in 12 minutes. After that it is sudden death.- People are in general friendly if you treat them the same. Even though the climate in the lower brackets seems to be a little more salty.- Devs are super responsive. They read the forums every day and provide as much help as possible and give answers directly. Also they are taking a lot of criticism and suggestions into the game to improve it for the community.Their balance is ongoing and when they messed something up they try to fix it fast.- There are monthly updates with a lot of content (new ships, new gameplay features, etc.)- It is free and no money grab. So why not play it guys?! Go get the game.Cons:- Small player base. Matchmaking takes up to 10 minutes in off peak hours. And then the balance is somewhat messed up, for experienced players have to play with new ones. Which isn't much fun for both sides.In peak hours it is more like 3 minutes. Which is OK.- The grind is very big. You need to play A LOT to unlock everything (which isn't really necessary, for there are no """"better ships"""" in general). But it could be frustrating.- For the time being if a player disconnects you don't get a new team member. They have to reconnect to the match. Or else it would be 4 vs. 5. The disconnected players can't get into a new game until their left one is finished though..."",1"
1156,Fractured Space,2018.0,Played since November of last year. The game is great for all but one aspect. Graphics great. Gameplay not bad (or used to be not bad). The BOT AI is really nothing but cheat code. No real AI at all. And it just gets worse and worse. I have not seen one single team win a game in days now. None. They have repeatedly been asked to hire a DEV to write a real BOT AI but refuse to listen.  The game is now unplayable. Want proof? Over 6k members but only around 100 a day now. Does that tell you anything?  And a real shame. I really loved this game and spent a fair amount of money supporting it. I own all the ships in the game. I want (ed) the game to succeed. But I doubt that is going to happen now. I can't believe they would trash their own game over one DEV (BOT AI DEV) when the rest are doing such a great job. Sorry to see this happen. Don't waste your time.,0
"1157,Fractured Space,2018.0,""I want to like this game, I really do. But I just can't get into it, and that's because PvE is broken. Our entire gaming group wants to love this game, but we just can't when we can't get into a PvE lobby. Yes, we realize it's a PvP game, but we want to put 5-10 hours in to learn controls, strats, etc, without getting blapped right away. Yet every time we try to play with 5 guys, we get the dreaded 'Error finding game"""" message. Sometimes we can get in with 4. Never with 5.And as such, they're now playing Mechwarrior. It was going to be HotS, but we spent so much time trying to playu this tonight, I got tired and decided to go to bed."",0"
"1158,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is simply incredible. The controls are simple and gameplay requires heavy teamwork and tactical planning. The graphics are also quite good, and the game should be able to run on older or less powerful machines, though on low graphics. My GTX 960 runs the game on ultra at well over 70fps, so some newer iGPUs can probably get 30-40 on low, maybe even higher. However, the game has some issues with balance, but it's only in Alpha so you can cut it some slack. I'll go into detail about some of the features available right now:Crew customization - you can customize what crew members are working on your ship to give your ship special buffs, that really can make a difference in battleShip customization - there are various skins available for each ship, although they cost a large amount of a currency you must pay forVariety of ships and ship classes - There are 3 different manufacturers each with a decent number of ships. In these catagories you can find stealth ships, attack ships, support ships and more. However, each ship has its own weapons that can't be changed.Again, the game is in Alpha, so it has a long way to go. But, it's definitely playable and super fun as it is. I recommend that you check it out!!"",1"

"1163,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewA very fun 3rd person shooter MOBA set in gee dee space y'all! It's very tactical, since the ships move and die slowly. It has a great balance of mechanics to keep you hopping around the battlefield trying to push, grab Gamma (which gives a combat buff), and push on base.It's in alpha at the time of writing this review, so there are bugs abound. But, surprisingly playable despite matchmaking connection issues, lag, and other bugs.PROS:Very tactical, teamwork > individual skillShips have different playstyles/rolesExcellent graphics (except Gamma and Bases, which I believe are stand in models)ECG is very transparent with their development model, and even allows voting on certain gameplay issuesIn game boosters are used when YOU want to use them (they double the XP or credits earned on a single battle)Friendly communityCONS:Lots of disconnects right nowLagginessShip unlocks are still being developedHonestly, I hate to put those cons in there, since it is Alpha, but just to inform anyone wanting to get this game... there are still quality of life issues.

1164,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewI loved this game from the day i started playing! It is a beautiful combat environment that allows you to combat in these spectacular battles with dozens of capital ships that allows for the perfect combat experience.,1
"1165,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFirst thing I want to say is, I've had this game for over a year. I bought the Harbringer pack and a few thousand platinum. A good 25-30 dollars. I enjoy it tremendously. I'm at nearly 300 hours, (as you can see xD) and I must say every second was enjoyable. Also stunned by the amount of progress this game has made. Amazing graphics. LOVE the blend of FPS and strategy this game offers.   Gah. Not good at long reviews. Here are some things I like: Graphics. Lovely. (such graphic)  The community. Best community ever. I mean it. The fact that I get to talk to developers. And be listened to 0.0 It makes me feel special. (Y'all probably dont remmeber me hahah)The team play aspect.  (much wow) (many friend)Graphics. Amazing. The constant addition of new ships and features. I disappeared for a month or two and I swear they've changed the logo and added like 6 new ships. Plus other really cool features. Awesome graphics.The fact that I can run it on my OC'ed Pentium 3258 (4.4 ghz for you nosey people) and GTX750ti on high/ultra settings.  (Many FPSes) (Wow)  Graphics/ Did I mention the graphics?Things I don't like: The fact that I can only play an hour or so a day. (Much bummer)The lack of steam achievements.

1167,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is fun. Matches can take a while but you will always be having fun. it is kind of sluggish for now but im sure thatll get worked out as updates come out. ive been wanting a space battleship game and this is awesome. Just saying.,1
"1168,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewReally amazing game. I bought it a few days ago and I am hooked. The game runs very smooth, and the gameplay is quite fun and engaging. In addition, at least playing in pubbie lobbies, ships seem to be fairly balanced, and it feels like every ship plays quite different from the others. This game plays a lot like world of tanks or world of warships, but with spaceships and with a 3D range of movement. However, it also has MOBA-esque qualities of having multiple """"lanes"""" and having to push defensive structures to kill your enemy's main base. What makes this very enjoyable is the fact that you have to position, shoot and maneuver your ship on a micro level to defeat your enemy - but you also have to make sure that your overall map positioning and timing is good on a team level as well (i.e. making sure your team arrives at gamma together and on-time, making sure you are defending base when the enemy has access, etc). It can be a little daunting at first, but the learning curve isn't too steep, especially if you've played MOBAs and understand positioning, timing, etc.TLDR: Great game, plays like a mixture of world of tanks/warships combined with a MOBA-esque style."",1"
"1169,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Well I been playing this for a couple of hours now so I ready to tell you what I think. For the a free to play game I'm impressed you start off with four ships all seem good enough to get the job done. You can earn more as you play prices seem reasonable. The game play is casually competitive with some ship roles that change the way you tatically need to think. The ships comes along with your own crew that provides minor bonuses  to it. Seems this crew is some how customizable but I have yet to get a new member. The game has a reward system for play up to six matches a day. Every Match you play earns you credits to buy new ship. As far as the PvP matches go they seem balanced and most the time pretty close or right down to the wire. I have yet to play a match that I have just wanted to surrender. Has coop vs Ai if you like that rout. All in all for free to play this game I would recommend it and even think of a future purchase cause of how the game is structure to make it ends meet. So if you like space, action, ships and a team based game then give it a try."",1"
1170,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewThis is what Early Access games should be like. The game is fully playable (even if there is no group lobby) and has a diverse and well balanced set of ships. The development to be done seems to adding features and options (new ships / ship options),1

"1176,Fractured Space,2018.0,""This was a great game.  Good graphics, good balance, good gameplay, even good AI when you didn't want PvP.  Now they're ending development.  They claimed, when they announced the ending, that the servers would remain in operation for the forseeable future.  Well, I don't know if they transfered to a different server or what, but it's now unplayable.  Major and never ending lag infects this game now.  We didn't even get a chance to say goodbye to this wonderful game properly.  Shame on the developers for ending the game this way.  I *thought* these devs were good to this community.  They have failed that thought in the worst way. An awful way to treat those of us that have played this game, some a lot longer than I have played.  I will not be playing any more games by this developer."",0"

"1188,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Fractured Space seems to consistently be referred to as a MOBA, and while it technically is it's sort of a stretch. Two teams face off trying to capture the other's base. That's about it (so far), and is the essence of its MOBA classification. That makes it a bit boring, especially if the team you end on doesn't adjust their ships to complement the others'. That's really the only negative I can see with Fractured Space, which is a rather big deal since it's pretty much the game mode you're going to play.The other extras add up to make it a solid f2p game, though. At $39.99 to unlock all 31 ships isn't outrageous (and they go on sale for $19.99 from time to time). The graphics are excellent, and the added battle chatter from your crew adds to the immersion - although I know, """"Millions of lives were lost...to your incompetence"""" everytime I die.I recommend Fractured Space since it's free to play and you have nothing to lose."",1"

The alpha build shows itself, but the gameplay thus far is solid and fun.You can unlock more ships as you go by achieving kills, wins, and captures. You do not have to buy anything in game (from the looks of things in the store it's skins and 5% experience boost (and I think there is one premium ship that can be bought but I don't know if you have to later unlock it))."",1"
1203,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewIt's a beautiful game with a good learning curve.My only problem with it is that there isn't any real single player content.

"1204,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is a great game and its just in alpha. Thats how im starting this review. It's playable, there is a tutorial that is very helpful and explains and well actually does what a tutorial is suppoes to do. Teach you how to play. Also you unlock a ship and some experiance and credit boosters. Experiance? to rank up your account. The ranks seem to all be captain something so far. Starfleet captain or expedition captain and such. Credits? to buy new crew members or ships or ship upgrades.  There are 3 ship manufactures with multiple ships to buy from witch all do have unique guns and abilities. Crew members your limited to only 5 and they do greatly effect your ships.  You do start off with some, but hire more to gain just what you need to make your selected ship really shine.   All these things effect damage, utility and defence of your ship. Make a load out of what you want ship and ship guns and abilities and crew wise and launch from hanger into ( as of now in alpha ) conquest games. Capture points and as a team lv up and upgrade your ship to take the enemy base.   Its a fairly simply game to understand and play, but mastering it and really owning the void with your behomoth titen of a ship is gonna take some time and experience. Grab this game asap if your all for space battle. Oh, and the music is space/void like and reminded me of the Alein movies...and everytime I got hit by some missiles I imagined my crew being rocked around and explosions like in the old Star Trek..."",1"
1205,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewSo far this game is alright the gamplay is smooth and graphics are nice.but their are a few things bad about it like the matchmaking system and lag but dont let that hold you back its still a great game .7/10,1
"1206,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game has a nice space moba concept. Really enjoying this game so far. It desperately needs more maps and more targeting options, aka targeting systems and such.Some minor latency issues, nothing too serious. 5v5 is a nice start, but I can see this game being epic with larger scale battles as well.Graphics are on par, ships are realisitically designed.Hud/ minimap needs improvement.The game does require communication and a good sense of tactics once your mmr has gone up a bit.Base race with my 1 collossus vs 3 of their ships in our base. Win 100% - 99%. 10/10Ghost stealth behind asteroid, pop out and flank for a fast kill klingon stlye 10/10Disperser push ship out of delta cap zone for the buff capture. 10/10I hope they add a lot more to this game, currently feels like a """"mode"""" in a bigger game.I believe they can even make a campaign with this engine."",1"
1207,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewVery fun game if only more people played it I can't get in any games due to very few people are online at a time. The're a few lag spikes here and there (probably due to my internet),1

"1209,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAbsolutely ingenious, amazingly fun and overwhelmingly addictive game. The gameplay is well balanced, the graphics are gorgeous (Unreal Engine 4) and the sound design is mindblowing - imagine a huge Destroyer ship jumping into the vicinity and opening up its broadside bombardment on enemies to save you from certain death - the feeling is undescribable.Premium elements do not in any way give paying players an unfair advantage, as their effect is strictly cosmetic or time-saving (getting more XP and/or credits so you can get your desired ship(s) faster).I got the game for free to keep during the free weekend in January, 2016, but its overall quality convinced me to buy the the top tier (Vanguard) Founders Pack very, very fast. The only problems I have come across so far were related to matchmaking, but usually went away quickly. I would also welcome an addition of bigger lobbies in the game (you are currently only able to invite one friend to join you in an epic space battle).    Bottom line, Fractured Space is the first game in ages which I am seriously hooked on."",1"
1210,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewGotta say I am impressed.  Never knew about this game till free weekend and I am getting into it now.  Battles look amazing and gameplay is fun on a good team.  Graphics are solid.  Its still in Alpha and pretty good.,1
"1211,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game shows us that 3,500 people per ship can die intantly like it's nothing. It's kinda like an arcade shooter but with spaceships on an x, y, and z plane. It's not like """"real"""" space, but its still a lot of fun! Each ship has its ups and downs and own unique weapons. You really have to communicate well with your team or just bulldoze the other ships to their HQ. My only downside is that my poor i5 processor melts each time I start this game and runs it at about 13 frames, even with the lowest graphics. So I probably won't be playing it again until I upgrade."",1"
"1212,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI do very much love this game and for anyone who likes both combat and space. I've played multiple hours of it and would play many more except for the totally overlying fact that is the problem with the recent patch. It has rendered the game useless because of the continuous graphics driver crashing and I've tested that it isnt my driver because I uninstalled them 5 times over the course of a day and tested the GPU on diferent games and had no problems. If the devs would put more effort into getting a patch out soon on this, that'd be great but overally a good game."",1"
"1213,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewYes! This game is great! Should get it for sure, although I recomend it only to people who are patient and like strategy type games. It can cost a lot of money to get different items but it is an all around fun game."",1"

1215,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewNice game and a good take on the MOBA game. Even though it is in early access there is much potential in the game if it does not already fit that criteria. However finding multiplayer games fails too often.,1
"1216,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Where do I begin?Eyecandy? Check and double-check! Kudos to the graphics department, these ships look beautiful, kinda makes me feel like flying ships like Alien's Nostromo or the Sulaco (yeah, fangirling much, ain't I?). I always get pretty nervous when I see my own ship starting to spit sparks and flames and the hull seems to melt under enemy fire. As much as it feels so sweet when you see the same thing happen to enemy ships... oh the giggles when they finally pop.The maps are nice as far as I can tell after just a few hours of gameplay. Navigating between asteroids, ducking in cover behind anything that the environment offers: neat stuff! (yeah, try to """"duck for cover"""" with ships that huge)Gameplay? It's FUNFUNFUN! As far as my PvP matches go, a big chunk of the community is friendly and helpful. Really appreciate that! A smaller part is pretty quiet, but I prefer the quiet ones over the toxic ones (I experienced in some well-known tank game) anytime :)I can't really tell at the moment, but a gut feeling tells me this is NOT p2w. I got myself the armada pack, but as far as I experienced you can get your butt handed to you in any ship if your opponent is just more experienced, so I think there's nothing like this one """"UBER"""" ship that has the """"I win"""" button installed.I really do like this game. Very.Much! And if you're still skeptic: give it a try, it's free to play!PS: thanks to ol' Jingles! Without you I would -probably- never have known about Fractured Space.

"1220,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewVery addictive and visually stunning game to play. Racing form sector to sector to conquer gives the game a sense of urgency and does not get boring what so ever. Only complaint is the matchmaking system - spent over 1/2 hour trying to connect / join game. Only to be gutted when the dreaded, """"Game aborted"""" popped-up everytime. Not having the option to stop the dreaded matchmacking loop, I had to Cntrl, alt delete out of the game to stop this evertime.

"1224,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewA great game, everyone dreams of captaining a huge capital ship into battle! The community is brilliant, and cooperation is fostered amoung players due to the tactical nature of the game. Ramboing and selfishness are punished my a quick destruction. One of the best features is that no ship feels especially OP, each ship has its strenghts but one of the 3 starter ships can still fight it out with a gladiator and, with the right tactics and teamwork, win. World of warships in space. The only area for improvement for me would be the nature of using the 3rd dimension. The X axis feels wooden and rather 2 dimensional. Still a great buy and would heartily recommend."",1"
"1225,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game, really addictive and the pay to win is on a very small scale. Very fun and easy to justify grinding and although matchmaking at points is very slow they have made up for it with the amazing game that this is. 100% recommend"",1"

1233,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThe game has some issues when it has a glitch that prevents hyperspace when the game starts and requires a rejoin as well as some ping issues when other game pings run better than others possibly lack of many servers but besides that it runs smoothly even if its at a low fps you can see everything going on and the graphics are amazing as well as attention to detail. One thing i look forward to seeing in this game is more ship damage like an ablity to ram a ship in a weak point and tearing it in two. I look forward to continuing to support and play the game and its potential for the future!,1

"1238,Fractured Space,2016.0,""This game brings the best of a lot of others.World of tanks / warships like ship-on-ship combat. Each ship having different abilities, weapons, and upgrades that increase or decrease the effectivness of that weapons stats based on your playstyle. (Think increased duration but decreased buff, etc) The Really Good. The game is fun. Teamwork with friends is rewarding and games that are won really feel like there was an accomplishment or outsmarting that happened. Matchmaking seems to work well though I haven't leveled up far enough yet to experience the higher MMR amounts.Graphics are beautiful. Windowed full screen available, and all the bells and wistles you could really ask for to make the game look great.Lots of ships to chose from. Skins, upgrades, and crew that can flesh out your ship and maximize it's performanceThe badQueue times are sometimes slow for matchmaking. I blame this mostly on the game trying to keep MMR working well, and secondly on amount of players. As this game continues to grow in popularity, I see no reason this problem will remain.Re-balancing is needed in some places. This is expected and will improve as the devs continue to update the game beyond release which they have shown they intend to. It's been the same experience in games such as Overwatch etc.More missions / rewards are needed. Currently there is a daily set of 3 missions you can complete. They are to play 2, 4, and 6 games. (With the 6th game completing the last mission) This rewards you 3 times with an increasing valued amount of platinum (in game premium currency), silver, DNA (used to buy and create crew), crew templates (used to create crew from), and boosts (which give a credit boost at the end of a game if you use it in the after action report screen). The game would keep me playing more often if there were other daily challenges to complete. Say for example, complete 10 takedowns in 1 game or something like that. The difficulty of each mission can then be scaled with reward.The Final Word Highly recommend. Really I do. This game only can be BETTER the more that people play it and play with friends. With the onset of competitive play coming soon, and rebalance changes, as well as hopefuly more ships, skins, and someday game modes, this game will continue to keep me coming back for a while."",1"
"1239,Fractured Space,2016.0,""An amazingly balanced game that gives you that feeling that league of legends did the first time you played it, being amazed by all the content and a sense of wonder and an eagerness to learn the game and then the meta. my only gripe with the game so far is that the HUD could be tweaked to make it more noticeable that you are about to die (but that is jsut me being a noob) and that there isnt much variety in the skins.I hope that they will be able to hire more people for the skins department because the game looks like its going to go far."",1"

"1241,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewSeems interesting so far, I'd need more time to play as the game develops. The concept seems good in theory. The flight controls do seem a bit sluggish to me. I'd enjoy them more if they were closer to actual space flight. Lateral movements aren't possible. The controls behave more of a earthbound aircraft than spaceflight."",1"

"1243,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewA tactical, 3D spaceboat shooter.Much to think about as you jump into a sector and make a push for a mining facility. Each ship has different speed, weapon ranges, and armor. Get up close and brawl, hide behind an asteroid, or flank the weaker ranged ships. Death in this 5v5 match can mean the loss of the important Gamma buff or significant (irreversible) capture progress against your home base. Movement is slow and has momentum, which is atypical for a shooter. But that means every movement should be deliberate and tactical. Put cover between the farther enemies and the closer target. Rotate your ship to spread out armor damage to different faces. Adjust your vector before you jump so that you are facing the correct way at the destination. Even the reticle rotates slower than the camera--modeling the turret rotation. (It's not that slow, but it prevents the turrets from whipping around 180 degrees instantly to a new target.)I've heard the game compared to League of Legends (although there are no creeps, and everyone is the same level), World of Tanks, and Mechwarrior. To me, it feels as if EVE's PVP combat were transformed into a less-punishing, action-oriented version."",1"
"1244,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space is in Early Access, and the game is already great. I cant wait for what will come in the future of its development. The game consists of space battles, and the ships you use arent those agile space fighters you see in other games and in movies. Theyre large, slow, and cant turn on a dime, and honestly that is refreshing to see and awesome to play as. It makes you have to commit to you actions, because you cant just bail from a fight if it turns sour.**You have the ability to warp back to base, however this takes time to boot up and drasticly reduces your defense. So unless you start the jump before they turn their attention to you, youre most likely dead. Also, some ships can jump short distances, but that doesnt mean that they escape your weapons range, and some ships can disable abilities.The game also has MOBA-esq qualities. You have to capture the enemies base to win. You have to push up side lanes in order to access said base. After a set amount of time, a zone opens up that if captured, provides a buff to the team that captured it. Ships are classified as DPS, Tank, and Support.You could call the game a MOBA, but it doesnt FEEL like a MOBA, so if you have a thign against MOBAs, dont write this game off.I highly reccommend this game."",1"
"1245,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game! Great graphics, fun PvP, no OP crap that I can see. One on one is normally anybodies game instead of one ship just pulverising. Only downfall of this game is the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing matchmaking is broken half the time, as in y ou can't connect to a match to save your life. Other then that, great stuff! Excited to see where it goes! (Hopefully not pay to win)"",1"
"1246,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIÂ´m not familiar with this Third Person Strategy Genre, but I can tell you this is a good title. The Space Ship models look amazing due to the Unreal Engine 4. The big ships feel """"heavy"""" as they should in real life. You need some practice with this game, but the menu controls are pretty good. You get familiarized with the keys pretty soon and start to enjoy the last part of the tutorial (Advanced Battle) even more. I havenÂ´t checked the game online cause I need friends who own this title to play 5 vs 5, and this is where the game must really shines. Unfortunately my PC specs are in the low section and IÂ´m quite sure you need a good system for that kind of multiplayer.The lack of Single Player Missions is the downside here. I bet they can add Randomly Generated Missions (Arcade Style) and Campaign mode soon. Remember that the game is at Early Access so theyÂ´re probably considering those options.I enjoyed the in-game tutorial a lot. Im glad I downloaded the game for free.

"1251,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAlpha Review: Not representative of Final ProductFractured Space. What a game. I have bought 3 copies of the game, one Vanguard for myself and 2 Forerunner packs for friends. I've been a living, breathing advertisement for Fractured space and so far everyone I have recommended it to have agreed with me. Fractured Space is addicting. Gameplay - 9/10I want to give the gameplay 10/10 but I feel like some of the cooldowns are a little long when compared to others. For example the Phantom Ghost (And by extension the Ghost) has such a long cooldown on it's primary missles, which means after Ambush -> Missles you have to wait much longer than everyone else to start firing again. There are of course a few minor issues with balance with some ships but as for an Alpha game the game is amazing. The gameplay revolves around huge Space Battleships BLOWING EACH OTHER UP. What's not to like?Graphics - n/aI will give it n/a because there isn't many textures in the game. There are the asteroids, ships, mining/base ships and an endless expanse of space. Yeah. Exactly. With what we have, the graphics are great so there is no problem but I can't really review it. Matchmaking - 8/10I like the matchmaking, not sure why there is an MMR system with no ranks but oh well. The queues can take a while and I can't seem to stop the queue if I want to invite someone or search for Frontline/Conquest instead of vice versa. The games seem balanced usually but there needs to be a penalty for Disconnecting. In too many games does someone disconnect and there is only a 30% faster respawn time. We should get a damage buff for the loss of manpower too. If not then at least add a bot. It's better than nothing. Progression - 8/10The progression seems rather slow. I can't seem to discern how your performance changes your exp/credits earned because it seems about the same whether you win or lose (the only difference being you earn massively less when you lose). Then the exp for each faction takes forever to earn. I know you don't want people running around in the best ships right off the bat but it feels like I have been grinding for ages to earn my Watchmann. Overall score 9/10I REALLY want to give the game 11/9 but with the few problems that I mentioned above (as well as some FPS issues and PING which doesn't make sense. I get 200ping on London servers and 100ping on further away servers. I don't understand myself) however the game is a definite must buy. If they add a campaign it would only make the game better but I feel like they are going to go the Counter Strike route and not add a story, and just focus on the ships and gameplay which is already pretty polished. I've seen games in beta run less smooth.."",1"
"1252,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewBeen here since it was first on Steam, developers visibly work a lot on the game.You'll be in for gorgeous ships and skins.You'll be in for teamwork, strategy and MOBA-like elements.You'll be in for punishment for reckless playing, e.g. rushing to the enemy thinking you're a tank (Even if you have a tank ship, you're still gonna die that way unless you give a bit more thought to your actions and play properly), or waltzing into an empty spot not expecting any enemy ships to uncloak or teleport there anytime soon.Matchmakes aren't too long, only about 2 minutes, and each match itself is on average around 10-25 minutes.

I used to LOVE playing Asteroids as a kid - kudos to whoever thought to use it as a while-you-wait minigame (I sometimes find myself wishing the main game could wait a moment or two longer, which is just...wrong).The actual game itself is very well presented - as space-sims go this feels solid and generally balanced (though there are a few niggles, though it's only really an issue when your team choose their ships badly). The graphics are great on my 5 year old pc, and the devs are great at updating and bug-fixing. In fact, they seem to be listening VERY hard to the players - I sent in a ticket about an issue I had, then 3 days later the next fix has fixed it. Result!10/10 Lobby mini-game genius"",1"
"1255,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Very very fun game.  Built in VOIP functions should come standard with all games nowadays but hopefully that's something that can be added in the future.  Space combat in Fractured Space is semi-simplified yet the mechanics and strategy make this game a very difficult game to play at times!  If you're looking for a space moba with large spaceship combat, this is the ONLY choice as of now that I would recommend."",1"

"1260,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Having fun with it, ignore the """"its p2w"""" comments, its not, you can easily dominate in the starting ships which are all very different and unique.team play is key and understanding the basics (such as capping gamma point) I can tell to many stupid ppl play it and charge in 1v3 get smoked in 10 seconds then come on here or the threads page to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.Cons: needs some new maps, my ping even at 200+ (playing on US servers from Australia) is barely noticable and very playable as its less about twitch reactions and more about positioning and teamwork.Would deff check it out if you are a fan of space games and MOBA, wont be everyones cup of tea."",1"
1261,Fractured Space,2016.0,Exceptional is the best word to describe this game. I have yet to buy the armada pack because I'm earning ships the old fashion way.. but I don't see myself holding out for long. So many ships... so much fun.Best space PVP game on the market in my opinion.Get the ghost. Make it rain torpedos. Laugh at the destruction your enemies never saw coming!,1
1262,Fractured Space,2016.0,Incredible graphics good gameplay and tutorial - one thing I will note is I have a decent pc that plays games like csgo at about 55-60 fps whereas - I only get 25-35 on here but all in all Good game. 8.5/10,1
"1263,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is a ton of fun. No Pay2Win BS either. Its all skill, and teamwork. Just how PVP games are meant to be. I gotta give a shout out to the developers of this game for not including pay2win micropayment boosts,items, etc. This is in early access just keep that in mind, and so far I haven't experienced really any bugs or glitches yet. So far  its been pretty smooth. If you are reading this review. Get this game. It will only get better over time as the developers add more content. The only reason I bought the Vanguard DLC pack which really didn't offer much other than some skins, a ship, and some xp boosts and a few other extras here and there.(Because there is no pay2win items) Was to support the developers of this game. 0/10 "",1"
1264,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewPretty badass game where we finally get to fly Dreadnaught size ships. The graphics are very nice and the sound/ crew banter is well done.  I got this for free this weekend and I am very surprised at how polished things are for an early access title. The only thing that has been a negative for me is the matchmaking being busted for a few hours but I seem to be finding games now.,1
"1265,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Fractured Space has evolved rapidly over the last year, and thanbkfully the developers have eliminated nearly all of the glitches and failed connection issues in the matchmakeing system. The game mechanics are well balanced and it runs great on most mid level PC platforms. The controlls and strategy have been made easy to grasp for beginners, but remain complicated ehough that hardcore guys can get invested in them.PROS: Fractured space was a qnigue concept at the time of its early access launch. The orbital science fiction elemests and arcade phisics esssentally add a Z axis to what would otherwise be a naval combat game. The simplicity of naval combat simulators have incressed recent and Fractured Space's initial idea is appearing on other games like World of Warships. That said its still an uncommon idea that adds a waft of fresh air to the steam market.The typical initial learning curve is about an hour, and the system matches you with bots in initial multiplayer matches so that you can practice, gradually introducing live players who match your skill untill you become compeditive. The typical match is about twenty minutes, but there are no cutoff timers so two good teams can go at it for a ling time, with the longest match I have ever played lasting just over thirty minues.CONS: There is no single player campign, plot, or story, to contectualize events in this game at all. Something it would greatly benifit from given that crew characters with names and faces have been thought of. Alongside a lor of concept are that is included in the interface that shows a lively world that we really dont see any of. This is clearly a world that could easily have these elements, but I have heard no mention of them anywhere.The turd in the carpet for me has always been microtransaction systems because they are manipulative and nearly always result in games that require rediculus and protracted economics in order to unlock everything. These games almost always have random number slot machine dynamics that keep you from only buying the things you want, and these games are in a near constant fight between the non paying playerbase that demans balance, and the paying playerbase that demands a good reason to pay for extras.Fractured Space shows signs of this fight in its game store in that you have two entirely different kinds of objects for sale, Skins and Modifiers. Skins are cosmetic changes to how a ship looks, and modifiers are crew, implants, or boosters which change how a ship performs in a given match. You get a starter crew, but no implants, which means that players who pay for implants early on have a performance advantage over players who dont. Crews and implants can be earned over time, but a long long long time. Having bought into this early I have about half of the crews needed. As I have played, new implementations of the game economy have gradually increased the amount of time between crew unlocks dramaticly. The problem is that the effect crew and implants have is minor, to the point that an attentive free player could theoritically outmaneuver or out strategize a pay player. Which makes the varous packs they offer kind of mute, even when they have been on sale I struggle to find a reason to buy them because I cant controll what implants I get in the dedicated packs, and crew pods can give out the same crew over and over, in which case the crew gets autotraded for DNA, one of the three available in game currencies. Its designed to make it exponentally more difficult to unlock the last half of the available crew options.I can recommend Fractured Space overall, but new players should understand that they are jumping onto a treadmeal that seems to get longer with ever update, one which has alienated me as an older 90's era gamer, and one which the younger generation seems all to eager to accept as """"just the way it is"""". I still play and I still have fun playing, but I get irritated every time I finish a match and get awarderd what little earnings each match gives me as a vanguard player.It takes over a month of frugal in game currency saving to afford the largest implant or crewpod pack in game for free. The thought of that, alongisde the constant reminders of how you could just buy platnum and get it now almost mocks me, because the economy is made so that you have to buy platnum in tiers that the random content packs all fall between, so you have to buy more platnum than you actually need in order to buy the packs themselves.If developers what to have microtransactions fine, but please have an """"unlock everything option"""" available so that people like me know exactly what the maximum possible spending amount is and can choose to skip all the randum number BS.Also, just let me spend real money off my credit card for exactly what I want to get in the game. If I want to gamble, I'll drive an hour down to Las Vegas and hit the slots, at least then I have a chance, however reomte, to walk away with actual money."",1"
"1266,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewRecommended to me by a friend, he said that he got it a year ago, and it was barely playable back then, but now, it's pretty awesome. As far as I'm concerned, it's a bit like League of Legends meets EVE online... Without the Ã‚Â£100 a year subscription. The graphics look pretty sweet, and there's no evidence of pay to win (which is great) it's more pay to get something that looks cool, but is really difficult to use and there's a non-premium version of the vehicle anyway, so yeah, really nice and fair, despite me struggling at the game because it's very heavily tactics based...

"1267,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewQuite fun and interactive, this game challenges the player to learn and customize their own ships to capture objectives and defeat enemy craft.Pro/s:-Customization can fit how you want to play well.-Diversity in gameplay: master a ship, or try something new.-Graphics are great, even on my old set-up.-Not p2win, hopefully it stays that way.Con/s:-Multiplayer disconnects. If a teammate disconnects, even though you are granted a faster respawn, it can more often than not lead to a loss. Need stricter penalties for players who frequently disconnect.tl"
1268,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game has a lot of promise. They messed with the match making or MMR in late January and it is really pulling the game down atm. Once they get the match making under control...this game will be amazing. Right now...this is a 3 out 5 stars. Great team based play with tactical skills you have to learn as you go and a tech tree that is spot on. However...getting a game together is grueling...,1

As in any other MOBAs, knowledge of the game mechanics and other ships (charachters) is a huge advantage.I read around here that is a bit of a grinder and it may be true, but I don't get the feeling of """"ffs I am so done with these crappy ships but I have to play them to get the one I want"""".

"1274,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFun space themed moba. What is great about this game too is that the actual movement of the game is fairly slow that latency is not that big of an issue. The biggest thing is positioning and teamwork. If you have those, you will win easy."",1"
1275,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewAlthough it's early access this game is still great. The ships look very nice alhtough minor details are needed but core gameplay is superb.Getting in to games isn't difficult espescially since the tutorial does such a good job at explaining things. Games are usually kick to find and last between 10 to 30 minutes. Matchmaking does need a few tweaks to get people of similar ability. Other then those small things I would recommend this game without any problems.,1
"1276,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Played the game during pre release and it was pretty fun. Now I can't play with it without an incredibly boring intro cinematic, followed by a uselessly long and unskippable tutorial mission. Which I do not need. Wanted to blow my brains out after 10 minutes. Dropped out of tutorial to avoid certain suicide. Will play when I can skip."",1"
"1277,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I do not have a tremendous amount of time in this game yet, but I am enjoying it so far.That is high praise from me, since I generally dislike MOBAs.Many other reviews have pointed out the slow pacing.  This is true.  However while many MOBA vets find it boring, it is the twitchy, frenetic, reflex-based games like League of Legends and DOTA that I have never been able to enjoy.The ship classes are generally uncomplicated and it does not take long to understand the roles that each play.  While some classes are at an obvious advantage or disadvantage to others, no support ship is helpless, and no attack ships are insanely OP.In other words, the balance seems pretty good.At the end of the day, it's free, so if it looks interesting, give it a try."",1"

"1289,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI don't know what to say about this game. I don't have anything to really compare it to. It's a co-op big ship combat simulator. You do get the feeling that you're controlling a capitol ship most of the time, but without smaller destroyers and the likes, it sometimes feels like I'm flying a really slow fighter. Only being able to target one ship at a time might have something to do with it.Still, I do recommend at least trying it. Once you get a feel for the game, it can be quite fun. Can't wait to see how it turns out."",1"
"1290,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space, in it's current Alpha state, plays well polished. The development team is good at keeping the news current, and features are added/tweaked in response to feedback from the community. Are there some good old Alpha antics? Yes, but they seem to be few and far between. Overall my only issue with the game is lower player count leading to occasional long matchmaking wait times.I expect that this title will continue to grow and when it is released in its mature state, it will be phenominal.As far as gameplay, the controls are pretty smooth and intuitive. The battles can be intense at times. Your success is largely dependent on your ability to think strategically and respond tactically. It focuses on teamwork, the  leroy jenkins' will fare poorly.Good luck, and good hunting!"",1"

"1295,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewBased on this amount of minutes, I conclude that the game is similar to Robocraft but it's more of a tactical game.Your ships move slowly and you take your time to plan where to attack the enemy. The controls of this game is not hard although it's quite a lot. You can view guide for the controls at anytime in the game by pressing the button O and K. It's not only base on speed and reaction time as strategizing is taken into account. You need to work as a team and you cannot solo-rambo style like other action PvP games. "",1"
"1296,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is actually very good, its still in alpha but the performance is ok, theres a decent amount of ships and the battles are alot of fun once you figured out the mechanics and the controls.Currently theres only 1 map and 1 gamemode, but its still loads of fun playing.Dont be discouraged if you get wrecked during your first few games, it will take a little time until you know when to engage and when to run (probably the most important skill in this game)And equal mix of tactics and piloting skill is key to success."",1"

"1299,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewMost fun I have had in a new game in a long time! Learning curve is there, but very slight, in my opinion. Rules of the game are easy to follow and understand. User interface is pleasent. The Premium (real money) currency is unneeded, as gaining experience and credits through game allows you to """"master"""" the starter ships, and after only a couple of matches, I believe I was able to Credit a new rig, and played the heck out of it, before I went back to a starter ship to build more experience in another Faction. Fun game. Glad to be a part of the Alpha stage. Excitedly looking forward to beta and the full release of Fractured Space! Do not let the """"moba"""" title scare non-Dota/Leage/HoTS players away.

"1300,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewSo far it seems like a fun game, although I have only completed the tutorials since I am unable to join any games at the moment. The graphics could use a touch up and the game would benefit from some true Anti Aliasing options but what is present now is a step in the right direction. The gameplay is fun so far, some good voice acting from the AI and the sound design is pretty spot on thus far. Appreciate that they have made the game free as well, and don't really mind the microtransactions because of this. This is one of the only games in Alpha that I believe will actually leave it."",1"
"1301,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game clearly isnt finished yet but for an alpha the game plays very well. It has more of a """"tug of war"""" feeling tham other MOBAs. Its not just about farming creep and pushing towers since there are neither (atleast not in the game mode i have played). Visually the game is stunning and there are may different ships you cant play as with varrying levels of customization. The is a micro-transaction system inplace much like League of Legends. You collect in game currency (credits) to spend on ships, crew members, and ship upgrades. Or you can buy Platinum for all the same things plus skins for you ships.All in all i give the game 8/10."",1"
"1302,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWe've all played the space sim games that revolve around fighters. But what about the cruisers, the battleships? This is what you're looking for.I have never been happier to play this slow lol."",1"
"1303,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat gameplay and teamwork.  The different types of ships you can earn make it dynamic.  Right now, the only multiplayer mode is 5x5 and the games take about 15-25 minutes.  It'll be interesting to see different arenas and map types later on.  Note to Players:  You can't be a hero in this game.  You need to pay attention to what your team is doing and figure out your place.  Being a support ship and either healing a large attack or defense ship or sacrificing yourself to steal an enemy's ground can make all the difference, so don't knock what seems like a lesser role off the table without giving it a try.  Sometimes glory is achieved in unexpected ways during this game, which gives it great potential.I paid the $20 for the Vanguard Founders' pack because I enjoyed the game and want the devs to earn what they deserve.  Let's hope they continue to do the job right."",1"
"1304,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's a space battleship game, what more do you want? Still in development, so there are a few forgivable bugs. An excellent pvp multiplayer game that's best played with a premade group of 5 for maximum teamwork and coordination. Just prepare for lots of grinding to unlock that new, shiny battleship. Pros:Gameplay is fun and exciting. Sounds and visuals are excellent, exactly what you would want out of a full-scale space battle.Cons: Some of the controls are a little out of place, but the majority of movement and weapon commands are easy and straightforward. Communication system with teammates could use some work, as you have to be isolated from combat to effectively communicate without a headset."",1"
"1305,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is pretty buggy for me (still in Alpha, so understandable), but when I finally get a game going it is fun.  Ships look great with lots of detail and adds to the immersion. I know this will sound generic, but this game, for me, just makes hopping in a big ship and shooting other people fun. I love space based settings and this game just makes me happy. As for gameplay, I've only played Conquest mode, not sure if the other one is available yet. It's kind of a MOBA-lite. No juggling of items, your ship is your character and they have a nice lot of them to  work toward, you choose from 3 types of upgrades once you get enough resources (attack, defense, utilities) and they simply just make your skills better. You still need to work as a team for map control (resources for upgrades + access to other teams base) and eventually attack the other ones base. This conflict is what leads to the glorious looking and fun space battles.I figured I would play this one and forget it, but I keep playing a  bit each day and it hits the spot."",1"
1306,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI am really angry you guys have reset my account for updates but anyway...---------------------------------------------------------------------------------The game is well done and i enjoy unlocking all the ships AGAIN,1
"1307,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is just amazing. The smooth quality and gameplay of it is just amazing, especially if it is in Alpha. However, when matchmaking is finally fixed, the networking for the game went completely downhill. But overall, amazing game! Kinda reminds me of World of Tanks though."",1"
"1308,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game for Early Access.  Only issue is no VOIP in games. Kinda of difficult to co-ordinate with your team by typing. Though, since this is Early Access I am sure they will eventually add it. Incredibly beatufiul. May need a decent computer to play it, some frame-rate issue, but not really an issue.Can't fault it personally."",1"
"1309,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game is a really nice twist on the MOBA genre. I personally do not like MOBAs but with this twist, it works really well. I have seen the development changing and evolving, and the developers are working hard to make the game great, and improve their product.Definitely Reccomend."",1"
1310,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game has high potential of being a very successful game but it lacks some stuff like playability and servers but all and all I would give this game a 3.5/5 in my opinion.The only thing I am going to ask for in the next version is to have 64 players in a SINGLE server and having to play conquest  with that many people.,1
"1311,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewDo you like big explodey space battles?If you answered Yes give Fractured Space a try.It is free, Nothing to lose.Very small learning curve. The ships look amazing. They look like something that could be made in 50 years.Yes there are things you can buy in game, like skins, boosts, and even some ship skins.You unlock ships with with company xp.It doesn't feel grindy, you are too busy trying to win to notice.You can also get rewards daily for playing 2-4-6 games.So far I have received credits,crew, and even platinum(Premium Credit)"",1"
"1312,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is great. It is like World of Tanks but better and with constant updates coming out, that just makes the game better.

1313,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access Reviewawesome gameplay with good game mechanics. but if you're new and don't purchase good ships from the beginning without even playing the game properly you're gonna have a hard time finding a game i've spent this entire time writing this waiting for a match sooo yeah....,1
1314,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewWonderfull graphic with great and simle systemalsow good dayly event sys - alsow it's not that hard to buy new shipsMuch better balans than in other popular mmo vechaicle gamesJust try if you like sf :D,1
"1315,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewBest game ever, Team based combat is great, no isues. Would recomend to others if you have errors like missing files on pc, check vcredist from game release to current date."",1"
1316,Fractured Space,2016.0,The game is a very surprising blend of MOBA and capital space ship arcade game! Takes some time to get used to and can be very punishing online but wow it looks incredible and you only gona get better at it the more you play! Tons of ship classes and three unique factions. Lots of content whilst being free. Recommend!,1
"1317,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Overall I'm very happy with this MOBA and even though it is under development, I can see it is on the way to becoming a top tier title within the ranks of the LOL and the DOTAS of the world. I recommend this to those who have a knack for pushing lanes, blowingâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥up, and having fun.   Plus, you can shoot other ships that are 20000m away."",1"
"1318,Fractured Space,2016.0,""A very good MOBA while still feeling and playing like a capital spaceship sim.  There is a huge variety of ships and playstyles, similar to Smite but with more customizability for powers and weapons. The unlock pace of new ships and abilities for a free-to-play game is very fair. I recommend this game to anyone who likes spaceship combat games and to anyone who enjoys MOBAs. The feeling of commanding a giant capital ship, along with its crew, fighter/bomber sqaudrons, nukes, cannons, turrets, etc is so fun."",1"
"1319,Fractured Space,2016.0,""For a free game it is great, i have got some issues though"
"1320,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I never play MOBAs (mostly because the community for 99.999% of MOBAs are pure toxicity), but I cannot get enough of this game. It is a game that focuses way more on skill rather than how much money is in your bank account. The ships are all evenly balanced, and I feel like I can compete against anyone. It is one of the most balanced MOBAs I've ever played and I cannot put this game down. 9/10 for sure. It's not perfect, and the asteroid fields in Alpha do make me rage a bit, but for the most part, the game is very solid, well-polished and the community has yet to be toxic (fingers crossed it'll stay like that, even though I highly doubt it). Would take to Flavortown again."",1"
1321,Fractured Space,2016.0,The mechanics of the game are amazing and I never liked strategy games but Fractured space is awesome and offers so much more than your tipical strategy game. I would highly recommend playing Fractured space if you like fighting with spaceships.,1
"1322,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Review of the 1.0 release.Fractured Space is a 5v5 multiplayer game about territorial control. You control a capital ship in 3rd person, and each has a handful of abilities. The team coordination required is similar to Dota and as a result it is not properly played alone or with a group of random pubbers. If you are looking for a single player game or a casual pick-up multiplayer experience this is NOT your title. The game does not contain built-in voice communication so I suggest that you join the official Discord server to find players. Once you have a few people willing to talk tactics on voice comms the game takes on a totally different character, which I highly recommend.The combat is not terribly fast paced and it gives you time to think about your placement and objectives, so those adverse to twitch-gaming need not be deterred."",1"
"1323,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Hey Devs, how about you make it so i dont get the same crew several times in a row.  I takes forever to save up enough cred to buy just 1 and i have gotten the same crew member that i already have, turning it into DNA.  I'd rather have my credits back and have another try, or something bette than saving up for 6 or 7 games only to get nothing."",1"
"1324,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewOk first review from me ever.Never saw a MOAB where winning depends so hard on your skill and getting your own playstyle.This game is Alpha, but it's very balanced and I don't run into any annoying bugs so far, keep fingers crossed! "",1"
"1325,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI bought this game within a week or so after it came out on steam, bought the Harbinger Pack when it did come out, and recently upgraded to the Vanguard Pack because of how well it plays now.As it stands right now, I wish there was a Maybe on the recommened button section, I cannot vote for nor vote against the game, it is not quite pollished enough for my liking but its still a great game which makes me torn over whether or not to recommend to friends.Pro's:-Good graphics at Max Settings 1080p. Getting 60-90 fps with my current setup.-Ok balance between classes.~needs a bit more tweeking~-Good overall selection of ships and skins.-Love the EXP and credits mechanics, which were nonexistent when I quit before.Con's: -Missing skins, What happened to the Ghost G-Type skin? Its missing from my invintory and know I had it before I lost interest in the game. Edit: Seems I was mistaken, I did not realize that there were two versions of the Ghost, one being the premium ship I got from Vangard and the one that you have to gain EXP to get which I believe would have the skin I thought was missing.-All I seem to ever get are EU servers, thought by now they would have implemented US servers or ones that are closerto the US for the sake of lag reduction for US based players, Honestly this is one of the reasons I quit the last time, No way this is on my end seeing as I have a custom gaming rig and over 60 meg line, plus, I have seen alot of complaints from other people about this in chat since I started to play again, really, fix this soon or you may loose more people again.-Price point. Price is perfect, IF and only IF the server issue gets fixed. Either faster server net speed or add US servers.-From what I can tell no way to make a 'Platoon of more than 2' in a group, I could be wrong since I havent invited anyone to the game.-Practice / Test area vs dumb AI to test a ship would be nice, which I would have thought would have been placed in this game, and the way the key layout is, would be nice to have this to test a rebind of keys on a ship.-Random Matchmaking throws me off a bit, I remember ability to create servers and and remeber the servers identifying as EU or US based off the host.----------------------------Not really a Con, Dev killed me. Enough said lol. Honestly this is a cool thing, Dev's actually playing the game that they design, which to me surpised me and made me smile. 10/10 would die against a Dev again."",1"
"1326,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewJust a really well thought out MOBA/Space combat mash up. Fast enough that the battles are exciting and slow enough that you have to be really thoughtful with your actions. Seems like a really fun space combat game that's just going to get better from here. Payment model is pretty solid and I haven't found any pay2win transactions in there yet, so that's a nice relief from the usual barrage of free games trying to get you to buy advantages."",1"
"1327,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access Reviewi can describe it in few words .... Positive surprise of the year for me :) cant belive how good it is in early acces.

"1328,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat Game, requires alot of teamwork and communications and you really need to be aware of you surroundings there is no mini map to tell you where ships are around you.They use a system very simular to world of tanks/warships/planes. There is a tech tree and you earn experience and work your way up the tech tree. Only thing i personally would improve is add more weapons to the ships.. "",1"
"1329,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFirst Impression Review(+)Nice Graphic(+)Gameplay is fun, not too fast paced and not slow either.(+)Each ship has its own playstyle and things it's good at compared to others(+)Ships are also quite balanced IMO(+)Strategical actions are rewarded nicely(+)Matchmaking is not illogical(+)Doesn't feel like cash grabber at all, currently(-)Limited 3D manouver, ships can yaw and pitch but cannot roll.(-)Party is only 2-man based.(-)UI feels like it's not refined, cannot cancel matchmaking search.(-)Some Asia-based player might have high ping and occasional lagging even when searching for games in Asia on Matchmaking (Might just be me though)(-)Bugs and technical issue (like being stuck in victory countdown after the game ends) might occur since it's still in Alpha.Conclusion: It's like playing World of Warship inside Space Conflict with a twist of MOBA because of the sector. :>This game is good. If you have already played some Wargaming game (""""World Of"""" series), Space Conflict or WarThunder, the UI and control is quite similar. Gameplay are fun and require teamwork and strategy more than reflex and mindless actions. Having high ping or lagging didn't really affect what you could do to contribute to victory, since some ships have autotargeting weapon and ability and ship movement is not that fast so you could still play fine. I have only played the Conquest Gamemode, the map is divided (or instanced) by sector rather than one big open map. You could still see what happened to other sector and see what your teammate could see though. Moving from and to sectors is done by """"Jumping"""" ability to forward base in each sector or to your home base. This makes up for the generally slow paced gameplay inside the sector, making it faster to reinforce pushed friendly sector and helping pushes faster."",1"

"1331,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is amazing, tons of potential here. If you like capture point moba style games and you like very large capitol space ship battles, this is the game for you. The movement and by extension game is actually quite slow but very strategic, however the combat gets hectic. The main game mode is conquest with two main bases, two """"lanes"""", and a center map called gamma sector that has a team wide buff available periodically. I am VERY glad that I decided to pick this up on the free weekend and I am going to be buying a founders pack, GREAT JOB devs good stuff here."",1"
"1332,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is honestly a lot of fun, and very challenging during your beginning hours, due to not having the best layout. After you learn this, it can be a lot of fun, i definetly recommend this for anyone interested in fighting games"",1"
"1333,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game has everything that an epic team-based combat sim needs.

"1334,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI have purchased quite a few Early Access games, and as most of us know, doing so can be quite a gamble.  On the one hand you have developers like H1Z1, who promise the world and never update, and on the other you have Space Engineers, where content comes out weekly and the developers are actively involved with the community.I'm pleased to say that Fractured Space falls in the latter category.  The game itself feels extremely polished for an Early Access game, the gameplay is deep/fun, and the asymetrical balance they are currently working on seems to generally function quite well.My only regret is that I did not get this game sooner."",1"

"1336,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewEven though it's still in development, it is a fully functional and FUN game! I'd say 8/10. And since it's free to play right now, I figured I'd give it a review!Gameplay: It's like any other MOBA- 2 lanes with 3 resources per lane (mining colonies, captured """"king of the hill"""" style), and a center lane with a 5min cooldown capturable combat buff. Your spaceship/barge moves in 3D space- hide/escape behind asteroids, flank enemies around or above/underneath.Controls: Are difficult but fun once you learn. **these ships do not steer easily!!!** ... all movement controls are keyboard, and the ships steer like barges!!! They are all battlecruiser style ships, so maneuvering them among asteroids while aiming the turret is definitely where a lot of difficulty comes into this MOBA.It has a lot of nice functionality- lots of ships, different loadouts, crew to choose from, etc. I think it will make a solid release!"",1"

"1339,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI clicked Yes to recommend because for Early Access, it's pretty good.  The concept is really cool, it's beautiful and the physics are nice.  Unfortunately, I'm (yet again) participating in PvP where everyone on the other team ALWAYS has better ships, better gear in those ships, hits harder and flies faster.  It's frustrating to say the least, not knowing how much of that is on me and my team or on the matching system.  I hope they do somethign to force a bit of balance, maybe only allow X number of Flagships, Y number of Corvettes etc.  Right now, I run into 2 Enforcers, 2 Assassins and maybe a Frigate.  I've only been playing for about 5 days...how do I ever compete with that?  I think if the Devs based the matching on the level of the player (in the ship type he chose before going in) and limited the types of ships per session, it would be more like a Fleet and less like a gathering of like-minded people.  All in all, I like it and will try to keep playing.And yes, I recommended it to a friend of mine despite the above comments.  For Early Access, it's a damned good game compared to, say Race to Mars or Maia.  Hats off to the guys who coded this game, you all did a way better job than I ever would have.  :)"",1"
"1340,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game, still in development (alpha stage at the time of my posting this), but it is basically a space based MOBA with a 3D map (not this 2D or 2.5D map bs).

"1341,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewSpace combat a la Star Conflict but with capital-scale vessels, slower and more methodical. Ships have a variety of tactical abilities to use. Full range of ship movement, but handles more like a submarine then a spacecraft: your ship autocorrects its pitch, and can move forward/back, strafe left/right, rotate, and up/down. Maps are divided into """"lanes"""" that must be jumped between using a warp drive ability. Progression is exactly like Star Conflict or War Thunder, there are three ship manufacturers and using a given ship earns you XP which is then spent on higher level craft of that manufacturer. A thinking person's shooter, with a far more forgiving damage model then Star Conflict."",1"
"1342,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you Like the PVP in Star Trek online but with a Dota2 playstyle,  then this will be a game for you.

In my personal opinion it got the better versions both genres. As a MOBA its LANES are not filled with AI controlled CREEPS, rather the lanes are controlled by the players. So, the players have the all the control over the game. And as a spaceship game, it has spaceships with proper and detailed """"space"""" aesthetics and game mechanic. By the way, the game may feel bit slow at the beginning as the ships seems to move slowly (even jet also seems to move slowly when we see it in relation to sky). But game play is quite fast because average match length is 10-20min (if itâ€™s not, then either both teams are really very good or horribly bad) "",1"

"1357,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFirst of all the problems: *You cannot add people from games, once the match is over and people disconnect you've lost your teammates. *It can be hard at times to move although with practise using the key's becomes second nature. *The tutorial is a big confusing. Good points:*I enjoyed this game, I can see it not being for everyone. The ships do move slow but this is actually a good thing, during a dog fight it makes you think about your movement more as you cannot simply run away. *It is not a pay to win game, I'm still playing with the very first ship and still competeing against others. *It is not too complicated,  after a few matches you'll get the hang off it.

"1360,Fractured Space,2016.0,""FRACTURED SPACE REVIEW/IMPRESSIONS:Video Version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bpZCXike7AGAMEPLAY: MOBA, over-the-shoulder shooter, with abilities, different types of ship, WASD+space+ctrl to move, mouse to aim and shoot. CREW: Tactical, Comms, Captain, Engineer, A.I., Navigation Officer.INTRO:Fractured Space is, first and foremost, a free-to-play game. It was developed and published by Edge Case Games, and was released on September 22nd 2016. Winner of the PAX West award for Best MOBA in 2016, Fractured Space is a game where you are assigned with badass spaceships to take over the other teamâ€™s facilities and enemy base with the help of your fellow comrades and ship crew. GAMEPLAY:For starters, this game is hard even while playing against an AI. The difficulty of controlling the ships is as hard as if you were controlling an actual bigâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ship. Your team consists of 4 other ships that go against 5 enemy ships. Your crew includes a tactical, a captain, an AI, a comms, am engineer and a navigation officer that will communicate via â€œradioâ€, alerting you to system destruction, facilities taken, new enemies in sight or allies down. Your team must create a strategy in order to take down the enemy ships and use their respawn time to take over the facilities in each location to follow until you can get access to the enemy base and win the game. While needing to pay attention to the enemy ships that spawn, you also need to control your facilities, capture new ones, beware ships that are shooting you, take cover and make sure youâ€™re not destroying the ship by hitting meteorites on your way. Phew! Seems like a lot to do just in one go? Just wait till you see the minimaps! There are 5 locations in each round, these being the home base, beta 1 and 2, alpha 1 and 2, gamma and enemy base. On the minimap, you can see how many facilities are in each location, how many are under your teamâ€™s control, how many under the enemyâ€™s and how many teammates are there, as well as the number of enemy ships. BATTLESHIPS:There are different kinds of ship, such as Attack, Defense and Utility. Even though you can relate to most MOBA that these types are the usual DPS/TANK/HEALER system, each ship has their own way of handling, shooting and gameplay. Attack ships are, as expected, specialised in ship destruction, but they can go from Sniper to Bruiser ships. Defensive are the ones that hold the front line and have their own squadron of fighters to help them, some even have repair drones that surround them during the combat, making them tougher to deal with. And Utility are ships that focus on supporting their comrades, not just by healing, but with abilities that buffs and clean debuffs. Their speed and attack effectiveness also change depending on your ship of choice and abilities vary according to the ship you choose. You can give the ships a try and see how each of the abilities work, I strongly recommend trying them, because on the Firing Range there are tips of how to play correctly with each ship. PRESENTATION:The shipâ€™s design looks great, specially with the various skins for each. Their texture and color palette turned out really good, and you can appreciate them from each side and detail shown in the ships. The scenery is amazing, some locations seem to have been taken from a sci-fi film production, though it doesnâ€™t seem to vary that much. I felt specially satisfied with the jump sequence, since it has been well planned for the game and reminded me of the Millennium Falcon Hyperdrive or the Enterprise warp jumps. The gameâ€™s sound effects are flawless and well-explored, though the voice acting for the crew seems a bit too robotic and a quite stereotyped. The epic soundtrack brings you the feeling of being in a real sci-fi space war. CONCLUSION:Considering that I played this game for nearly 5 hours and I plan to play more of it in the near FU-TU-RE, the amount of 25 dollars worth 5 hours were definitely worth the hours spent playing for free.Seeing the final product, it's easy to notice that a lot of time and effort have been invested in this production. Since itâ€™s a free game, our real question here is whether it is or isn't worth wasting your time to play it. Well, Iâ€™ve played this game for 4 hours and was getting as excited as a child to see my ranks and stats going up. I got impressed with itâ€™s visual art and gameplay, even if it was a bit hard at the beginning. You may get a bit bored from some repetitions in scenery (sometimes, it may be just a bunch of asteroids on the way and thatâ€™s it) and your crewâ€™s orders and reports. It is a fun game to play with friends, though! Teamwork is important here in order to create a strategy and make sure someone donâ€™t just pop into a location and gets killed because they were alone. Well, seing the overall, it is a very fun and beautiful game that you can enjoy playing non-stop for hours. Itâ€™s cost for the buyers is lower that the cost of production, and even if they wanted to establish a price of, say, 20 dollars for the game, it would be worth it. Since itâ€™s free, I donâ€™t see a single reason why you shouldnâ€™t spend the next 5+ hours having an amazing time with this game! What are you waiting for? Go download it! Live long and prosper, yâ€™all!Reviewed by Almatari"",1"
"1361,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space is sheerly amazing.It's [at most so far] a 5v5 heavily team based PvP game where you control massive ships in space and take on multiple objectives while coordinating with various allies/ships to conquor the enemy team. Although in Alpha stage, i find myself enjoying each encounter i come across. I hope for the best in the production and release of Fractured Space when that time comes, and hopefully further more as well ^__^As a """"nearly addicted"""" tenno in Warframe, this is one of very very few games i put Warframe down to play on occasion. Like 20% of my time at least, Fractured Space is absolutely gorgeous in my eyes. I hope you all can share the same view.If you're looking for PvE type gameplay, this isn't the place for you. If you like fast gameplay, go play COD Blops or one of those speed shooters instead. Fractured Space is a mix of medium sectioned battlefields, specialized teams and massive arsenals that define each player. Also, it's in space, that's a win already :PIf this review isn't to your tastes, bite me. I'm not here to be professional, but to share that I greatly enjoy Fractured Space and will look forward to its progression in due time."",1"
"1362,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewBig ships, bigs guns, big explosions, and lot of tactics.All the ships are very different, with very different roles, and teamwork is the key to victory, more than in any other moba's I've been playing. There are no """"builds"""" or """"op stuff"""" for you, everyone plays at about the same level. Individual skill isn't vital, even if it helps. Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork, nothing else. And with this friendly community, that's really fun.Pros:- Rookie friendly, with a simple tutorial, good matchmaking and progressive learning curve- Ships are very different from each others, from the light fighter to the super-heavy capital spaceship- Way more players since last """"free week-end"""", from 150 max a day to 3000 average- Not pay to win. Except cosmetic or early access starter pack, you absolutely don't need to pay to rule the galaxy.- Not another """"three-lanes-minions-towers"""" moba, the arena is nothing else than an asteroid field.- Ships are really niceCons:- High pings can occure, that can slow the game and can make it difficult to play. I think it's because there are a lot of people playing it now.- With the last update, the tech-tree is now larger, and it's harder to get the ship you really want to have. - In game movement and camera are hard to master, shooting an ennemy behind while fleeing will makes almost everytime you hitting an asteroid, and being struck in it. Maybe a """"watch behind"""" key would help a bit. - We want even more ships. I hope these will come for free, and not as DLC. Great game overall, do not hesitate to get it!!"",1"
1363,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis Game Keeps goin all Paul Walker on me . . It would be badass if I could actually play it but I can't keep it running for more than 5 Minutes. . . got a pretty decent rig I don't understand why it won't run. so with a total of 19.33 (repeating of course) minutes I still say thumbs up!,1
"1364,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI must say it's a gorgeous looking game and very hard to run on an old system however, I enjoyed playing this game but also found it extremely hard to find a game, maybe lack of players?? "",1"
"1365,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAs of now, the game is early access, so things may change. But as for now...this game is pretty great.It's an interesting take on the MOBA genre that I think has a pretty nice payoff. The ships all have their own fun abilities that make the games all drastically different from one another. As for graphics, even on low settings, this game looks amazing and the ships themselves all have rad designs. The textures could use a little work at the moment, especially on the asteroids in the different areas. I can't wait to see what more comes of this game. Good on ya, Edge Case!"",1"
"1366,Fractured Space,2016.0,""The grind is there true and the recent change to viewing loadouts prior to purchase is really upsetting, the game overall is really enjoyable, albeit slow paced at times I recomend it wholeheartedly"",1"
"1367,Fractured Space,2017.0,""The Starship Asss SimulatorThe loading screens, the video at the end of a game and the camera show us the wonderful bums of our beloved ships.This is also a part to take care of, because the enemies will often shoot at it! So watch your butt.More seriously now.It is basically a MOBA but with less tactical elements and less important deaths. The emphasis is put on cooperation, as what serves as exp is shared between the team. Every few minutes, an event is triggered in a special area"
"1368,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI've been so hungry since my oven stopped working. That was until i found this game 0.3hrs ago.That was all the time i needed to cook some eggs benedict on my cpu. I'm sooo full! Thanks devs!Thanks so much guys for the awesome oven simulator.I was gonna give it 8/10 but...9/10 for making your bread toasting function compatible with my Geforce gtx960 G1 Gaming graphics card. It performs so well with my card that it only took 2 minutes to lightly toast some sourdough. I was tinkering with it a little bit and i found that this function is a nice little piece of reusable code! You can adjust the graphics options to high for grilled cheese, while putting everything on max allows for the perfect environment for a delicious roast pork or, if you can spare the oil, some deep fried Mars bars! Whatever it is you guys are doing, keep it up!I'm certain you could get 10/10 if you integrated some kind of timer into the oven simulator so people could be warned when their supper isn't far from done or something like that (but i'm not a game designer, so i don't even know if that would make for a better cooking experience, that stuff is way too deep for level of understanding). Good luck!Kind Regards,Fellow Comrade (A.K.A 'Durry Duck')"",1"
"1369,Fractured Space,2016.0,""A great 5v5 action/strategy game (PvP).It is NOT a """"rush and shoot everything"""" game, you actually have to use your brain to win.It is a bit difficult at first to get all the game mechanics, but once you do, it is REALLY a lot of fun.You might feel discouraged after a couple of games, but just give it some more tries and you'll start seeing the possibilities.It is free to play, no pay to win. You can get everything that makes a difference ingame (ships, crew, implants...) for free. However, you'll need quite some time to get all the items you want (moderate grind). Starter ships are GREAT, after playing for several hundreds of hours, I still use them very often. A higher price ship does NOT mean it is stronger (it just allows you to add variety to your ship pool).The crew and implant systems require a little more effort in order to get something good, but are still manageable with some patience.

"1370,Fractured Space,2016.0,""gameplay pretty good graphics are alright(need more options though) and audio is crispecertain ships require a bit of playing around and some feel like they need a few tweaks to be more impactful in a match, I bought the carrier to see how using fighters/bombers(guilty of dipping into the wallet) would do and in turn it didnt go as I thought and I've played few other games that have carrier mechanics rather it more about trying to use the fighters and bombers to harrasse while you're using the mini-cannons to deal low, rapid persistant damage but it didnt deter me from using it rather it made me want to figure out how to utilize a carrier in this game over other games where my carriers are just hang back heal allies and spawn more units into the fieldso lot ships take time to learnlot of interesting ship conceptsvery rugged look to many of the vessels so would I recommend this game? try if you like it stick with it if not move on this game is one those 'better with friends' it not pay to win least in my eyes it more like pay to learn a new style of ships!(carriers are tricky to use maybe need more work on them later)asides from that this game needs a quick chat system so you can just hit a key to send a short message(like in other shooters) would love to see more load out options for weapon batteries and more options"",1"

I have not encountered any pay to win victories (I get sunk through my own mis deeds "
"1374,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewSo far Fractured Space has been fun. I have had some issues with the time waiting for a group to form. It usually says that the average wait time is 2:55 but I've had some ques take up to 30 minutes with me giving up. I know the game is in Alpha and probably doesnt' have a huge amount of players at this point but it's still pretty boring just waiting in que. They did add a mini-game to mess around with while waiting which can help kill the time....As far as the gameplay goes....pretty badass! I've played in about 10 5v5 matches and everyone has been a blast. There are a good selection of ships, all with different abilities and different styles. I'm still pretty noobish at this point but look forward to trying the different ships. One thing that I think they should add to the game is a chat function while in the lobby. I have no way of seeing how many folks are sitting staring at the counter just like me and it would keep my in the game longer because I would have someone to chat and asks questions to. This might be something they are working on.Overall the game is very fun and I look forward to see what it becomes!!"",1"
"1375,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewA great MOBA-style game with pacing that makes it feel like you are flying capital ships. Great improvements have been made over the course of this year and the game is about set to come out of Early Access. I have little interest in other MOBAs, but the awesome ships, the pacing, and the feeling of being part of a team keep bringing me into this one!"",1"
"1376,Fractured Space,2018.0,""This game was great as soon as the dev team realesed it on steam few years ago. Not many people play it, but now that the last update (with the servers on for the record) is released everything can be purchased with ingame credits. I recommend you to give it a test with friends and also an oportunity. If you like space games this one is easy to understand and fun to play, needs a boost of players!"",1"
"1377,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Update as of November 2018:The game development has been stopped and since the release of the final update the playerbase has diminished from small to almost no-one playing. Therefore anyone who is looking for a new game to play should avoid Fractured Space.I will leave the recommended tag on this review because I had a lot of fun with this game while it was still active.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The purpose of this review is to go over the free to play model that the game Fractured Space uses. As for the game itself, Fractured Space is a well balanced team based multiplayer game with the main attraction being the variety of large space ships that you can pilot.Fractured Space uses a free to play model which lets you play the game starting with access only to a few starter ships. To unlock more ships, you need to earn in game credits or pay money for a special currency called platinum. Credits can be earned upon completing matches and from completing missions. On average, completing a match will get you ~10,000 credits or more. Missions are side objectives listed in the hangar such as """"get 24 takedowns"""" or """"capture 15 mines"""". Completing missions will typically get you a drop pod, which can contain extra credits, platinum, and other useful items.Ship costs vary from about a half million credits to about one and a half million credits. If you want to unlock ships without paing for anthing, you will need to play quite a few matches. Since the average match time is about 30 minutes, that translates into a lot of playtime.Personally I would recommend buying the """"Fleet Pack"""". It is normally priced at 50.00 USD, and usually go on sale for 25.00 during major Steam sales. The Fleet Pack gives you access to a staggering 34 different ships to try out. This means you can spend more time playing as ships with playstyles you like instead of feeling like you got stuck with something terrible that you need to use for another 40 matches before you can test out another ship. And while you try out new ships, you will be able to spend your credits on different weapon types and crew members to personalize your ships.There is only one thing that I have seen in Fractured Space that you cannot get by using credits: ship skins. Otherwise, you can use credits to purchase what you want.Fractured Space is not pay to win. Fractured Space is pay to avoid grinding, and I would recommend avoiding grinding."",1"
"1378,Fractured Space,2018.0,""You like space and action? big space ships?  epic battles in small scale? This is for you!Now seriously, I love this game. its not perfect but who is? i give it a solid 9/10 because there is nothing this good looking, free and unique. "",1"
1379,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThis game is very much like MOBAs where it pits 5 players against 5 other players in an arena sort of combat. but instead of having to buy heroes or something you instead get to research toward space ships in a fashion similar to World of Tanks or similar games. when players leave there is a sort of balance system in place to where it is still possible to have victory over a larger team. what ship type you pick and what you're up against is not entirely what decides the game. it is how well you play that ship,1
"1380,Fractured Space,2018.0,""Exciting fast paced space moba that is third person. You control a large ship with a fleshed out crew. Every ship is pretty well balanaced from what I've seen, and most have a high skill cap. Some ships are simply better than others in one area, but might be totally outclassed in another. My paragon is effective mid/close range but something like the collosus can often times rip me apart at that range. Knowing the enemy's ships are very helpful. I'm still pretty new, but this game is probably going to remain in my library for quite some time. Friendly devs that still work on the game (however they dont really say what their patches are, and appear silent on steam forums) with an active (official website) forum.However, I wish people would actually use the chat function more."",1"
1381,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewThe ships are awesome and have the feeling of being huge juggerauts without beeling sluggish. The designs are original and very unique. The gameplay is action packed and tactical. This game will be something big one day! I'm sure of it!,1
"1382,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewOpinionImportant:Game needs the camera to rotate in with the ship, perhaps as a tabable feature?  More importantly the ship should be able to rotate in the Y axis (hopefully dynamically) and it is in space after all."",1"
1383,Fractured Space,2016.0,Flying giant space ships while playing LoL. Everything is well balanced all ships are purchasable in game without needing to buy anything. The starting 3 ships are all epic even after all ships are unlocked. Good game.,1

"1386,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI love this game. It totally scratches the itch that EVE leaves out, dynamic 3D space battle between capital ships that somewhat like LoL in a sense.What I love about it:1. Easy to pick up. The game isn't hard to understand and provides tutorial as well as a shooting range map for you to test your ships weapons etc.2. Graphics. Nuff said.3. Developers that actually listen and read player suggestions and comments.4. Paced research speed. Not as demanding as WT or WoT, but not easy enough fo ryou to breeze through the game in no time. 5. The game looks like its ready to roll out of Beta but still has the development support of a Alpha game, this means that changes will happen and patches/updates will still be frequent. Lots of uncharted space to roam through still.The down sides:1. Slightly long wait time for matches.2. Not much teamwork going on at times but that is on the playerbase and not on the game or its developers.Note about the mixed reviews:Notice most of the negative reviews are either players who have bought this pre FTP Alpha and demand refund or players with few hours on the game (I have this on my 2nd account and has 100 hours on it). I believe that this is a issue between the consumer and the developers and shouldn't be used as grounds to judge the game itself. You made the choice to support this game, this game took off in a different direction but it shouldn't be surprising that it might go FTP to gain more playerbase."",1"
"1387,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewOnly started playing yesterday, but I've already put in quite a few hours. This game rocks! Visually stunning graphics, varied gameplay that requires skill and tactical planning, and a great non-pay-to-win set up all adds up to a great game. AND it's still Early Access??? I can't wait to see what the final game looks like!"",1"
"1388,Fractured Space,2018.0,""This is a great arena style game. The visuals are awesome and the gameplay is even better. There are enough abilities on the different ships to all make the unique, but no so many that a player feels overwhelmed with options such as in league of legends (this is my opinion, I could never get into LOL due to this, other opinons may very). The gamepley is well paced and the progression of levels whilst in game (not out of game rank) is steady enough so that the game isn't instantly over, but also not so long that the game drags out for ages. The release of the new """"story"""" missions that come out with every new patch is a bit of a double edged sword"
"1389,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game. Has Alpha state server issues, but after owned it for a weekend I can say I love this game. Looks great and the pvp requires the teamwork to win that makes a game replayable. 10/10 for Alpha-- 5/10 for Servers"",1"

Me and another guy, as we were both hunters were to attack from above and below to engage the enemy fleet while our two snipers were to position themselves near the checkpoint and attack from afar. As we finished up our plan, we waited for the coming battle. Soon enough, the enemy fleet had arrived and began approaching the last checkpoint. We charged into battle, Our tanker approached the enemy first and began blasting the enemys ships. Me and my fellow hunter joined our tanker and began attacking the fleet while our sniper provided support from long range. After a long battle, we emerged victorious but suffered two losses.

1403,Fractured Space,2016.0,From what I have played (Which isn't very much but enough to justify this review) the game overall is pretty solid. MOBA style game and map with 2 lanes and a center lane for a buff that spawn randomly. It's fun both alone and with friends. The only bad thing about this game I find is the UI can take some time to get your head around espcially the main menu which just has buttons and doohickeys everywhere.

"1406,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Honestly, this is one of the best f2p game that exist bar none. The grinds are not bad and the rewards are decent. The best part about this game are the DEVELOPERS which I have said about no other game ever. They read the forums and will react to feedback sometimes responding to your post directly. I have literally only had 2 issues with the game and after submitting a ticket they were resolved in less than 24 hours. The gameplay is good but not overly complicated. The graphics are good but again strike a good balance for my machine aka I can run everything on high but not ultra. This game is a great fit for me because I do not have a bunch of free time and just want to unwind for a couple of hours and get in a few co-op matches and snatch a few drop pods. So if you are a casual gamer who doesn't have a ton of free time I highly recommend you give it a spin. It is easy to learn but not so easy to master so there is depth.  The maps look good, the ships look good the ai is decent. If you are more competitive it can accommodate that as well. The only thing holding this title back is it needs more players so install it and give it a try. If you like space combat/sci-fi then it will not disappoint."",1"
"1407,Fractured Space,2018.0,""If you like Capital ship combat arenas like Dreadnaught, or even the idea of piloting spaceships in general, then you will like this game. The Combat is great, with many ships to choose from, whether you like to be the big and slow Leviathan or the small and nimble Hunter.The daily reward system does not punish you for taking a break from the game.There is a surprising, but somewhat shallow level of customization.There are quite a few gamemodes to choose from, and the option to play either pvp or vs AI.There are quests that encourage you to break out of your shell and try ships you may not normally play.There is a satisfying grind to the game, though it can get a bit shallow once you unlock the one ship you only play as.The only issue I have had is frequent crashes, but I play on a laptop, and there is the ability to reconnect to matches you have lost connection to.Overall, this game is a great example of a ship vs ship game, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a new Free to Play game to play."",1"
"1408,Fractured Space,2017.0,""I will review this fairly.:Update of March-17:They added a update where you can play all the ships for free in solo matches against bots wich is great for proving ships and for people who dont want to play with others.-The game has drops with varius items. Got a 3000 platinum ( premium money ) skin from it. This is one of the good games of free to play. : ^ : Gameplay: Meh, its pretty much same thing over and over and lack maps and gamemodes ( only 2 to choose from )Learning Curve: The first ship with USR is crap. ( atleast from my point of view )  Choose Zarek or Titan in the start til you can buy a better USR ship. The game itself is a bit hard to get in to but after 5 matches you got the hang of it.Menu: Its a bit confusing if you read your way thru you will learn it no problemSound: """" I fly your ship, you buy me new hat """" - Russian Navigation officer. The game has characters that talk midbattle, taunt the people you destroy, give hints and are generaly fun to listen to. 10/10 would hire Russian Officer again.Overall Deign Of Flyable Ships:...   I think you know what most of my playing hours went in to. As a game its pretty meh, nothing special and lack of features BUT as ship design goes...  See you in a while, i will study these more."",1"
"1409,Fractured Space,2017.0,""I'm pretty new to the game but i just had to make a review , thing that i rarely do.First i want to talk about the community , in my many years of playing video games i had rarely encountered such a friendly and welcoming community , they embraced me from the beginning and they were really cool when we lost games because of my noobness ( which was quite often ) . The devs work pretty close to the community , most of them are big fans of their own game , you will play with them quite often , if you wanna team up or you have any questions  just join the official discord.The game is pretty cool too , beautiful ships , beautiful enviroment , and plenty of pew pew and explosions . You can get all the ships in the game quite fast just by playing the game , no hidden stops or sneaky micro transactions , you can get anything in the game with credits except the skins , which still have a chance to drop from cargo boxes ( i got 2 ). This is the purest form of free to play that i have ever seen in a game , especially in a moba. This game is awesome , not perfect , don't get me wrong . it still has some issues and it can be rough around the edges sometimes , but you won't even notice it , the community is awesome like i said but i still had 1 or 2 bad encounters , morons are everywhere and you can't really avoid it , but i used that lovely red report button. It's a game you should really try , nothing to lose only to gain.Sorry for the horrible formatting and the huge block of text :D ."",1"
"1410,Fractured Space,2018.0,""Great game, especially fact it is not P2W. As all stuff you need to play can be bought for normal and premium money, only skins are for premium only and you can get the premium for free in little amounts from daily login rewards."",1"
1411,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewA great game that has an awesome system to earn new ships and a great way to fight. Even though it is hard to maneuver ships it adds a challenge to the game that litterally makes every move count.,1
"1412,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access Reviewi dont know, once i bought a raviolli that was good but yesterday i bought the same raviolli at the same place, but tasted like crap so, how do i get this newt out of my elbow ?"",1"
"1413,Fractured Space,2016.0,""This will probably be my first ever review of any game and I have a lot of games that I've played. Fractured Space came off of early access recently and it reignited my love for space combat. Let's hit this off with segmented sections.Graphics: 9/10 Unreal Engine 4 has always looked good, but the amount of detail in the ship models is insane, the lighting, the beams, the rockets each ship has it's own distince style with each manufacturer having a different theme.Sound: 7/10 The Crew say interesting things and the sound is very good but there's nothing worth noting about it, it serves its job well enough to not be a nuisance.Gameplay: 8/10            Balance: It's definitely not pay-to-win, the ships are well balanced and there are no sure win strategies as this is also a game of deception, it's slow-paced and you will find yourselves dying by a decision you made 30 seconds ago. That means every warp in and warp out you decide cas consequences that can have an impact in the game, early deaths are less punishing and an early lead can easily be over taken with the right coordination and being at the right place at the right time.           Ships: Each ship design is vibrant and no two ships are alike with different roles even if both can do heals. Support craft and attack craft do have their counters but certain strategies can subvert that counter and the map often makes for interesting encounters that you won't feel unfair to either team.Payment Model: 8/10 Nothing is unfair and it's very much like LoL, I do feel the Crew could have more methods of acquisition, but overall it's not unfairTL"
"1414,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Interesting game, its easy to play, easy to learn if you read the manual and the updates, unfortunately its riddled with bugs and everytime they fix one bug two more seem to show up.Thats not the worst part of the game though, the worst part is the player environment. Players will target other  players including on their own team. They will harass and bully players they believe are causing them to lose the game thereby diminishing their mmr. Mmr is the developers way of rating each player's skill at the game which in itself is completely uncontrollable by player since you are randomly assigned team members some with skill some without. The mmr is the source and cause of the harassment and bullying in the game which is responsible for causing a hostile playing environment. I would not recomend this game if you just want to have fun, its taken to seriously by some players as if it has some real life applications. Its just a game and a fun game but is entirely ruined by an unneccesary rating system that inherently creates a hostile environment."",0"
"1415,Fractured Space,2017.0,""A decent to good game ruined by some annoying mechanics and a small, rather hostile, playerbase with limited variety.Good:Gameplay (overall) is really good. The ships are slow and require some patience. They are supposed to be big hulking capital ships. The combat is pretty good as well. Bad:Variety. 2 modes, conquest and frontline. Conquest has 2 lanes towards the enemy base with a middle lane for a bonus fight every few minutes. Frontline is... basically the same thing, but with only one lane and no middle bonus fight mechanic. So, you have 2 modes that both have the same/similar mechanics and objectives. If you don't like one mode, you won't like the other. Ships (stealth). Some ships have stealth, which, in and of itself, isn't a """"bad"""" thing. The problem is that they drag the game down and are just unfun to play against. Games like Dota2 do """"stealth"""" right, where you have some heroes who counter stealth in and of themselves (which this game has) but they also have items you can buy and deploy to reveal those heroes (which this game doesn't have). So, if the enemy team drafts a team (you can't switch ships mid match and you can't see what the enemy is bringing) and you don't have one of the few ships that have a reveal skill, you are SoL. Double (or tripple) the frustration when compared to Dota2 because you also have a 3 dimensional space your stealthed enemy could be. It's just not a good game setup as it has locked in ships where you can't see the enemy's draft but no option to counter if you don't draft one of those few counter ships yourself. Sound. Game audio is mediocre. Ship fire sounds rather lackluster. Playerbase. It's no secret that the game suffers from a lack of players. The problem is that in the few recent pvp matches I've played, people are rather hostile. That might not be an issue if the game had a decent playerbase, but if you run into someone you don't like, be prepared to see them in the next 20 matches because odds are you'll fight them again and again. Beyond that, finding a match, for me, has taken everything between 1 minute and 10. Grind. Unlocking ships doesn't seem so """"bad"""" but I also bought into the game's early access and so had a lot of credits stored up. However, ships range between 300k credits and ~1mil credits while you earn about 10-15k each match. It just feels like too much of a grind for me, and that's before you buy the sidegrades for the weapons and abilities the ship might have. Menu. OMG I HATE THE MENU SYSTEM IN HERE!!!! Such a pain to visit the """"hanger"""" and find a ship as you have to scroll through a small little menu window to find it. There are some filters, but they don't help as much as you'd think. Overall, the menues are all convoluted and fill up way too much of the screen offering too little information and still managing to feel overwhelming.Overall, the gameplay is good, but it feels like half a game with some rather unfortunate design decisions.

"1418,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI've played a few dozen matches and have loved this game so far. The ships look great and are detailed, the weapons are varied, the matches are interesting and dynamic.There are different ways to win, and even though blind pick is a little annoying, they are looking to fix that to bring more mix into the game.The game is young, but I'm amazed at how complete it feels in it's current state. There was a HUGE update (that some poeple weren't happy about, I'm okay with it) last week and development shows NO sign of stopping. We get teased all the time, and the devs are super friendly/stream multiple days per week.No other game has gotten me into the development process like this, I love it! Now that this game is F2P (and it truly is), I HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying this game out."",1"
"1419,Fractured Space,2016.0,""If you like this genre of game (World of ___, War Thunder, Mechwarrior Online, Armored Warfare, etc.) and you like capital ship vs. capital ship space combat, then you'll enjoy this one. It's cheap to get into ($10), visually stunning, hectic at first, but easy to learn, and features lots of dakka. You won't spend all night analyzing builds like in MWO, but it's not nearly as arcadey as the World of series and involves a lot more strategy. It fills a void in this niche of gaming nicely."",1"

Good graphics on the ships, MOBA teamplay, And best of all, large ships. This game is reasonably priced and worth every penny. Nothing is too overpowered, and its not pay-to-win.

"1424,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game. Like World of Warships but in space AND without the insane grind.

"1426,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Updated 5th October 2017:BE AWARE THAT YOU CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED FOR NO GOOD REASON BECAUSE THE DEVS DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO PLAY THE GAME OTHER THAN IN ONE SINGLE LINEAR STRATEGY.  1 week suspension received because having anything other than the devs strategy means you are accused of throwing a match.----------------------------original review below...This game has just gone from bad to worse.The match making is horrendous and alway has been since the introduction of team win / loose MMR opposed to personal skills / contribution being rewarded.  The game just doesn't have enough experienced players for you not to have a team peppered with lower skills or lack understanding of the main objective.  The problem with this is your MMR value is penalised due to MMR only being awarded for a match win (so regardless of how well you do personally).  The devs solution to this is not to fix match making but to hide the MMR value from almost everywhere, with the last remaining mention of it earmarked for removal if/when ranked play is finally introduced.Furthermore the matchmaking has been bust since players were able to group and raise their MMR by often queuing against solo players.  There is no option as a solo player to opt out of being stomped by a team on a 3rd party VOIP that has a team coordination advantage.  A solution to this was introduced to split groups during balancing if the team MMR disparity was above a certain threshold but this has subsequently been removed.  The shrinking of maps dumbed down the strategy in the game and increased the death match style it currently has with very short respawn times based on level rather than personal death rate.  Other changes such as opening up a path to your base if you loose a gamma 3 fight further dumbed down the game as it made the match almost entirely about the outcome of gamma 3.There are so few players that the queue times for a match are insane, i'm talking around an hour or more waiting for a match in what is known as the bracket 4 player pool.  This is the case even though over 2 thirds of the previous days highest concurrent player count are ingame.Expect AI bots in PvP until you reach bracket 4 too.Still no VOIP service available in game and the next most pressing feature to be added is the addition of a new in game store, eh yeah go figure the priorities...EDIT:  You also aren't given the choice of what game mode you wish to play within PvP so if you don't like the Frontline mode it's tough because you can be placed into either Frontline or Conquest.  Another bizare decision as both modes require the same number of players.  It's like they deliberatly think of ways to cheese off the playerbase.Since the current experience is beyond frustrating I can't recommend it with the problems it has."",0"
"1427,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewOverview:A fast-paced territory control game set in space with five players per side. Before the game starts, you select a ship available to you, and possibly make modifications to your crew and armament (except in the secondary Frontline mode where you are assigned a ship semi-randomly). Once in the game, the objective is to capture your enemy's home station while defending your own. To assist in the objective, you must capture resource stations that passively generate income which is used to upgrade your team's ships.Gameplay:The Frontline game mode has only one sector and allows warp jumps within the sector, but the main Conquest game mode has five sectors, and allows jumps only from sector to sector: one home sector per team, two """"lane"""" sectors (alpha and beta) with three Mining Stations and a Forward Station per team each, and a central Gamma sector with a base that can be captured at certain times during the game in order for the team to gain a short-term overall buff. In order to get to your enemy's home sector, you must capture the enemy's Forward Station in one of the """"lane"""" sector which will allow your team to jump from that lane to the enemy's home. If the game goes on long enough, capturing the base in Gamma will permit your team to jump to the enemy's home from any sector. Each home base has stationary defenses that can be destroyed by the enemy.Progression:After the game you will be awarded experience and credits which can be used to unlock new crew, ships, and weapon loadouts from the ones available to you in one of three tech trees. There are three manufacturers with a unique aesthetic each, but ships are broadly classed into """"offense"""" """"defense"""" and """"utility."""" You can spend money to buy Platinum to purchase new skins.Cons:-Early access. Small player population, things constantly change, ships and loadouts are re-balanced, bugs. The game is not done. It has been in EA for a while and I've had the pleasure (?) of seeing it evolve, it has come leagues from where it started. The UI has improved considerably, the game has become more optimized, awful game-crashing bugs have been removed. But ultimately you are paying to beta-test a game. Even if you paid no money by getting in on one of the free periods, you are paying with your time. Unless you really want to play this game RIGHT NOW, wait. It will be better when you do decide to play it.-Difficult. Skill and situational awareness is a big factor in a team's success. Until you have played for a while, it is hard to say what you should be doing right now. Flanking? Warping to gamma? Engaging in combat? Distracting the enemy? Back-capping? Each ship plays differently: some are slow, others are fast. Some ships fire better from broadside, other ships fire better head-on. Some ships can charge in head-first, others cannot. Some require stealth and waiting, some require you to zip around in 3-d space and orient yourself correctly. There is a lot of depth here: this is not a casual game!-Teamwork-focused. The game tries to balance teams, but teamwork is hard to quantify and predict. A moderate amount of teamwork will result in leagues better overall performance. And then you get a player on your team that doesn't know how to fly their ship, and you start the slow slog towards losing the match.Pros:+Looks beautiful with amazing attention to detail. The ships activate tiny side-thrusters when you turn. The ship turrets articulate individually as you move your reticle around. Explosions, beams, rockets, railguns, and all similar effects look fantastic and carry proper weight to them. +Challenging and deep. See """"difficult"""" above. It is fulfilling to gain mastery, and this game delivers it in spades.+Good progression. The game has a short tutorial mode that teaches basics. Ship selection is limited at the start and requires that players through some """"simple"""" ships in order to unlock others. But do not think that the """"simple"""" ships are in any way bad! The later ships are just more specialized, and by the time you get to them you will have hopefully realized the niche that the ship fills. In some ways, situational awareness is more important than how good you are with a ship. Your ship skills will broadly transfer between ships, but situational awareness wins games, and it does not depend on your ship.+Good pacing. The game has been fine-tuned in such a way that it feels like there is always something to be doing, but not so much going on that you don't know what to do first.Verdict:Recommended, provided that you can handle it being in Early Access and are OK with a non-casual game."",1"
"1428,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access Reviewhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp4Lb0uKWH0 First Glance at it, full review will come later.My first impression is it's a pretty good game all around, needs work but is clearly on the right track. The biggest issue right now is the final win condition of taking the enemy base. It's a sluggish process and the auto-damage field kinda needs changed to something else like destroyable turrets or something, since even if you've tecnhically won it takes forever to get to the actual win. Otherwise though a good game so far, but like I said I need to play more to reach a full review verdict."",1"
1429,Fractured Space,2017.0,I was so excited to play this game... and really want to enjoy it. It has a lot going for it....Problem is.... No one is playing it (at least the matchmaking can't seem to find a single person to play with...) Friday night you would think it could find a game.... Nope... now maybe this isnt an issue for people more skilled or leveled up.... but sadly .... I can't level up because.... I can't find a game because.... matchmaking can't seem to find anyone.... Got the armada pack... wish I could get a refund since i can't do anything but play against the computer solo.... and its no fun :( Great game though... wish I could play it with anyone.....,0
"1430,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewReminds me of Hawken with Capital Ships.  Very fun game and I can't wait for more features, ships, and weapons to be added.  Great idea to make it F2P... now keep it that way to maximize the server population!"",1"
"1431,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Fractured Space is one of the outstanding games I have known lately :- There is a real developpement team, releasing frequently new updates, contents, bug fixes.- Very immersive game, good-looking, highly-detailed ships and vibrant sounds.- FS is one of those games that requires mature players and a lot of teamplay. The joy you can have from this game is not about winning or losing a match, but how the two teams put up fierce fight, with often close end. There is entertainement in a difficulty.- A lot of ships to play. As far as I'm concerned, I have unlocked all ships and yet I haven't played with all of them.- The gameplay combines a lot of different combat tactics, from stealth, decoys, speed/rush cap, support, defensive or offensive strategy.- On top of that the game itself is completely free, very far from other pay to win bull$hit you can find on Steam.In all honesty, the only drawback I could find would be about the about players. I would dare to say that this game is somewhat hard for the average human being of today. People are too lazy, even for a video game. You have to take the time to fully understand how to win a game (game modes), understand how to play your ship and thus, at least, read its full weapons description, understand how other enemy/allied ships work too in order to take advantage of them."",1"

Any round I have had the misfortune of playing with a SNIPER ship, they ALWAY have a KDR above 15, which is usually at least twice that of the next best player in the match. http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45376357721222168/D4A9B9E9FC707E2E3609A9C4E8472F121A598C64/Then the round usually falls apart as players RAGE quit, and the poor new replacements leave even faster.I hope the Devs are collecting match Data, and do a """"balance pass"""" on this ship.Now back to the game."",1"

1440,Fractured Space,2017.0,Great F2P game.  Has a learning curve but also be prepared that when you master it you'll likely be teamed with others who haven't.While on the surface you can buy a ship and play it there's a lot of customisation available.  You can use crew and implants to modify a tank to deal extra damage or make a small ship much more durable than people expect.Recent changes to ship prices have made it a little harder to get some of the more dynamic ships but it doesn't take too long and encourages you to learn each one you buy.  I've also seen 'starter' ships waste the newest ones when played by experienced players so it shows you just need to learn and adapt.,1
"1441,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe games addicting. That's legit the only thing you need to know. If you are going to play this game. Expect to get a bit addicted. Its hard not to enjoy this game & not be excited to see new features, or ships, or practically anything, because your mind is constantly captivated to what can be done with the game. For Alpha...NICE.I read a couple of reviews before I decided to write one, but I did notice someone mentioning they couldn't join servers & they were not given a reason why....Don't join almost full servers. Join a empty one & it'll fill up EASILY."",1"
"1442,Fractured Space,2018.0,""For a game I didn't expect to like, I went in with low expectations.

"1444,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI have been playing this free weekend out and I really enjoyed the game even if there are some minor bugs or some optimization that is needed to be done. But hey don't worry, this game is still in Alpha so much feedback is still needed. Think about this guys that you need to send in feedback if you are in a game that is still in alpha. That is what makes the game change. You can't just sit there and wait for the developers to make everything. We need to contribute with feedback and help them step by step to get closer to a perfect game. I rate this game 9/10 and I will be here to support this game untill the servers will go down. Thanks for bringing Fracture Space to us. Thank You"",1"
"1445,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewDo you enjoy slow paced,  well thought out combat in real time? Do you enjoy barely scraping by with your life as your comrades blow up beside you? Do you like spaceships? Do you like World of Warships? Do you with World of Warships was played on a 3D plane? Do you like Battlestar Galactica? Do you like fun? Fractured Space is a little of all of these.  It is simply fun. There is plenty of action"
"1446,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewNot a bad game.  Just disable pirates and random event.  I loose more to these things than any enemy activity.

"1448,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewA beautiful and great game. A fun community, with little talking during the match, but none of the negativity or hostility you'd expect from bigger name MOBAs. A great game and well balanced. I expect a lot of good things from these guys!"",1"

"1451,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewOnly one way to describe this game for an 5v5 interstellar basecapturing game: WOW. You are the captin of a huge ship and try to destroy the other team base with amazing weapons, abilities and all that on a skill base only. Then there is a jumpdrive that you use to jump into a battle, I love this kind of stuff. Teamwork is key, to stratically win. There are so many types of fleets you can pilot. And the gameplay looks and performs fantastic."",1"
1452,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access Reviewthis is such a well designed game. it's too early to say if theres any balance problems but i think it's safe to say it's pretty balanced so far and theres a minimum amount of cancer. 9/11 would crash into enemy ship again,1
"1453,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIn my opinion this is a fairly fun game nothing to get addicted to but not a waste of time either. Combat is enjoyable and if the teams are balance can be quite awesome along side this games visuals. My only complaints is not how long the loading screens are but rather how many there are and find this slightly annoying. Next complaint would match making and long wait times, but this is due because of the small community and probably the wide variety of skill and the only way to fix this issued is either make the games shorter(which please do not due that spoils some of the fun in this game) or get a bigger community which isn't easy. Although there is a wasy for you to help this! Play more! More people playing more in the pool lesser wait times!"",1"
"1454,Fractured Space,2016.0,""While I've only played about 2.7 hrs as of 20160927, the game has pulled me in quite a bit. I am not a fan of MOBAs but the title does a really good job at masking the MOBA concepts it adopts. 5v5 with two lanes, essentially, and an arena in the middle that opens up occasionally during battle. The team based combat doesn't feel too pushed but you can really feel the necessity when fighting against human players, as with most competitive MOBAs. Perhaps my favorite feature of the game is the F2P aspect. In essence, this is how ALL F2P titles should work. If you choose to spend money it does not give you an advantage over others as you're only unlocking the ships and crew members soonr as well as obtaining skins for ships. Overal this title is a must play, I mean come on it's free"
"1455,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewNice game, requires heavy teamwork. * One big problem about the game, 3500 players online, but it takes ages to start a game. Matchmaking kind of sucks, finds players 5-6-7-9, then resets starts againg like 10 times."",1"
"1456,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI hate MOBA's. I love this. No micromanaging troops/minions or lanes. Just straight up combat or king of the hill if you will as you try to make your way to the enemy's base. It's kind of like playing Elite Dangerous but without the suck, and add a couple MOBA elements. Not really sure what else to say. You get to fly capital ships and feel like a badass in doing so.I can't stress enough, even though MOBA's typically require you to be incredibly Asian to even remotely stand a chance, this is more about tactical awareness without all the crappyness of LoL, DOTA, SMITE etc...It's free too, and not pay to win like most every other F2P. Buying the packs really only gets you a boost to one of the ships you can unlock in game anyway. Mostly just cosmetic skins that do not provide any advantage over anyone else. Definitely a solid game right now. 9/10 Enjoyment factor. It's a MOBA without the suck."",1"
1457,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewOk imagine really liking everything about this game ploding along having some nice games then finding out the game was on the low graphics setting for everything....fast forward to ultra...

1458,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewIf Planetside 2 and Warthunder had a love child in space this would be it.Really fun.

Can't wait to play the full game where its less laggy and smoother :D,1

"1462,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is quite fun and is a very nice little space game. So if your interested in space combat go right ahead and buy this game. There are a few small problems, for example it takes forever to actually get into a server also there is not a huge variation in the ships you can get. But all in all this appears to be a great start to an amazing looking game."",1"
"1463,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewI enjoy this game quite a lot. It is a game that requires a lot of team work and you can be like me (not much skill) and still have fun, or be a veteran at the game and destroy everyone. Anyhow, I enjoy the really detailed realistic graphics, and as someone who loves sci-fi stuff  I love the ship designs. Playing is interesting as controling the ships takes time, so if you are under attack, you have to think about that. The point of the game is simple: take control of the enemy base. The games take a while. I've been in ten to twenty minute games. The voices of the crew (they give you updates on the health of your ship, location, allies locations and whatnot) are amazing. I personally love the navigator who J can't understand well. Anyhow, the only part of the game I do not enjoy is the long time for finding a game, and how you might get the same players in multiple battles. Anyhow, it is a great game and I reccomend it."",1"

"1465,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeGreat alternative style moba.Far from a LOL or Dota clone and amazing to boot. One of the only games you get the satisfaction of commanding ships sometimes over a km long.Very heavily team based, as most moba''s are, communication is key.If you're a space and moba fan, this is your thing.I'd like to add, this is probably the most underrated game on Steam. The devs give away so much cool stuff for free, inc skins, game modes, maps and ships.Community is only slighty salty too."",1"
"1466,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I've only played the game for a little under 3 hours at this point, but I'm really enjoying it so far. It's like League of Legends but in Space. I am a huge fan of space sims and MOBAs, and this game does a great job of putting the two together. Also I really do love the fact that ships can maneuver in full 3D space, not just along 1 plane, but up and down as well.I think it shows great promise and will continue to play."",1"
"1467,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewHello folks,I can highly recommend this game.For an alpha it is one of the best games ive ever played.Gameplay:The different ships classes, play different (lel how could guess that).They are well balanced with some little issues in balacing.Fractued Space's gameplay is variable and you need to work with your team.It makes fun to fly against all types of ship and to explore the possibilites of your shipclass.At the moment you proceed very fast in gaining new ships, experience and credits (ingame money).There are some things missing like Matchmaking / friend / clan / lobby systems but for the current stage of development (game was first avaible 11/2014 when i can trust my informants) it is good. Graphics:Ive play the game in ultra aswell as in minimum, the graphic is overwhelming good.Only asteroids are not that pretty at the moment.The graphics remeber me of Star wars and star treck.Sounds:Weapon Sounds and the engines of the ships seem like the generel sound and sound average,Servers:Since the newest update the server's seem stable, i got no laggs and dc's.Developers:The dev's seem to work hand in hand with the community,there are certain events like clan vs dev's or community meeting.Kind regards Challenger"",1"
"1468,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewEven though it's in alpha and many features haven't been added yet, this is an incredibly fun game.The graphics are good, the ships are (mostly) balanced, and the game is determined by player skill and teamwork, meaning that you can play many matches on the one map currently (23 Apr. 2015) available and have a different experience every time.The different ships each have distinctly different playstyles, meaning that just about everyone can find something he likes.I enjoyed it so much during the free weekend that I bought one of the packs to support the devs, even though those of us who played during the weekend got to keep the game for free. I highly recommend it."",1"
"1469,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is FANTASTIC for being in the alpha, i love this game, it's very much skill based and not just who has the stronger ship. Deffinitly a nice variety of ships to upgrade and choose from. Can't wait for full release."",1"
"1470,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's a Strategyc Space Shooter, good to play in a team communicating with each other using voice, terrible to play by your-self, completelly alone.  Just wish my computer did not failed me, but this game is too heavy for my old machine. I still can run just cant play agaisnt another human being with brains such is my fps."",1"
"1471,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewUpdate:  1 Year and 125 hours of gameplay later and this game has risen to my all time favorites list.  Matchmaking now takes significantly less time to find a round thanks to a slowly but noticably expanding player base.  New and awesome ships are being added on a very regular basis by the devs (every month or so).  Visuals are even more beautiful and powerful than before.  A lot of recent reviews are ripping on the new crew drop system, but it's really not that bad.  It's just heavily focused on grinding.  But the devs are active and listening, so I would not be surprised if we see suble tweaks to this system in the coming months.  I would like to also comment on a complaint I've heard a lot:  No, this game is NOT pay-to-win!  Lots of people are complaining that the 'platinum' currency is pay-to-win, but all it's used for is exclusive ship skins that ONLY change aesthetics.  Now that this game has entered free-to-play, you can pick it up and eventually own every ship and weapon available without spending a dime -- though you, myself, and most others, have a significant grind to look forward to before such a goal can be achieved.  Challenge accepted!  Now go play Fractured Space!- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Original review below:Only had the chance to play one round so far but from what I can tell I'm really going to like this game.  There is definitely an initial learning curve, since I didn't get a single kill in that round...and my team lost...terribly, but that was the most fun I've ever had losing!  The ship textures are beautiful!  The weapons are tacticle, diverse, and just awesome!  I'd definitely recommend watching some youtube tutorials before jumping straight into a game, otherwise you might be a bit lost, as there is no starting tutorial at this time (though devs say they're working on it).  My only complaint is some pretty severe, albeit intermittent, lag spikes.  I have a network meter on my 2nd monitor and when my ship would freeze, I'd see the network connection tank.  Would last about 5-10 seconds, then when it regained connection my ship would snap across the map to where it had aparently been going.  Died a couple times because of that.  (Not a problem with my network btw.  It handles all other online games including BF4 flawlessly).  I'm hoping that sorts itself out through development (or that I was just playing on a bad server).  All in all, this is a REALLY fun game.  The sort of game I've been looking for for a long time.  It's like battleships meets league of legends meets starwars.  I'm really excited to see how this game progresses as the devs work on it.  I would definitely recommend it!"",1"
"1472,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFor early access, this is a great game. If you are even slightly interested in spaceship fighting games, get this.Pros:Great graphicsBalanced, Team based, Moba type matchesGood number of ships for such an early gameConstant updates with new balancing and contentCons:matchmaking is still haphazardplayer base is still small (will continue to grow)Lots of DPS ships, could use a few more Support types (hopefully added in future updates)Difficult learning curve (although some actually like this struggle)Only one map and match type (for now)I really feel like the cons will get hammered out in time, and the pros will keep getting better. Great game to watch for, and a no-brainer buy if it's on sale.A note on matchmaking. I mentioned it is haphazard because currently there is no way to know what kind of match you are jumping into if it is already in progress. i have jumped into a game just to catch the last few seconds of us losing. i know it would be a monumental task, but i really feel that leaving players should be replaced with an AI pilot in the same ship, and people looking for matches should not be able to join matches in progress. ALSO i feel that there should be some form of """"partying up"""". if you want to play with friends, it's near impossible to get everyone on the same team. hopefully this is a hot topic, and it gets adressed soon."",1"
"1473,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is awesome.  In essence, it is a MOBA but in space and without the little guys to get in your way.

There is some limit to the number of players and features due to the early state of the game, but this is a potential gem to watch out for.

"1480,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space, a 5 V 5 Moba, with capital ships, in space.I like this game, a lot. A diverse range of flashy capital ships blowing each other up in a ballestic display of fireworks and strategy.The core gameplay consists of you controlling a single capital ship, assaulting the enemy's base while defending your own, resulting in fierce smaller tactical battles in separate sectors of space that your ship can warp to, while the greater strategy of getting sufficient resources (gained by holding control points) and picking up the gamma bonus (capturing a point in a central sector that gets you a large temporary bonus).Overall, there's a fair amount of depth to this game, and it's a lot of fun. Would recommend to anyone fond of space opera type battles, or want to pilot with the big boys."",1"
"1481,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAn excellent game that rewards not just simple ability to aim and shoot, but also communication, constant map awareness and general strategy while also maintaining fun gameplay that feels like you're really flying a giant spaceship! Some people may consider it to be 'grindy', but all the ships are balanced against each other (higher tier is not better), including the premium ships (which are just normal ships with added reward bonuses at the end of a match). The crew system so many people are angry about is going to be reworked according to the devs, with the ability to buy the crew member you want directly with in game resources (DNA). All in all, a great game if you like thinking while watching pretty explosions!"",1"

"1483,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game has had a rash of bad reviews lately, and I just don't think it's current rating is fair, so I wanted to say just how good this is for a free game. unlike many 'free' games, it can be played just fine without spending a single penny, and there are no giant advantages to shelling out for crap. maybe the bad reviews are because it's hard to play, i've played nearly eighty hours now and i'm still not that good, but the game is still fun as hell nonetheless"",1"
"1484,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Fractured Space is a game of giant spaceships, stately and graceful motion, and ruthlessly low TTKs coupled with strategic and defensive play that can go on for 30m or more. It's a remarkable example of how you can take the MOBA archetype as a starting point and end up at something that not only looks totally different and plays totally different, but actually builds on the good parts of the genre.Many reviews for this game go into the strategic depth (they're right), the tactical depth (they're right) or the mechanical level of complexity (they're mostly right). The game plays well, for the most part, and can easily support thousands of hours of play. But I won't say much more on that.I would like to point out the community management for Fractured Space is top notch. The community managers know that having a CoC and banning people based of it will draw a lot of fire on Steam from trolls. But they've stuck to their guns. I have never seen CM's more proactive on banning racists, transphobes, homophobes and even misogynists! It's incredible, and you have to know it comes at the cost of a lot of ill will from troll collectives of Steam.Even the game devs can get punished for bad behavior. While it's rare to see them cross the line, it has happened and the CMs have not handed out special treatment.They do this while still being tolerant of the normal outbursts and rigorous debate we all expect in competitive gaming communities. You can disagree with a dev and call them out on it, even in game or on the forums, and they will listen. They may not AGREE with you or ACT on what you say, but for such a well-policed community the actual level of debate is """"very spirited.""""That's something special and rare all on its own, and ECG deserves a lot of credit for this. It's a real accomplishment all on its own.Finally, Fractured Space's deep gameplay is not marred by monetization mechanics. In general, ECG knows that people want to unlock their content and they collect money for cosmetic modifications and """"boosters"""" (much like any f2p game). But there is no mechanical advantage afforded as of 09/2016 from any store option. It's a fair game, with a lot of depth. You can play it knowing that while enemies may be better than you, or more coordinated than you, they still have the same tools in their toolkit as you do. And they have stuck to their guns on that stance even though it has caused a lot of short-term problems for them."",1"
"1485,Fractured Space,2017.0,""This game is really an underrated work of greatness. The space graphics are completely out of this world. (Tee Hee) The gameplay is smooth and requires teamwork to really win the game but doest deter solo players from enjoying the arena style combat on their own.

You wont regret trying this out, hell drag a friend with you for two times the fun and eight times the rage WHEN HE DOESNT PICK A SUPPORT SHIP.

"1487,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewNormally I dont write reviews, But this game deserved one from me. Even tho it is in Alpha, The In depth system of it is absolutely amazing, ive never played a alpha game that was so smooth, so fun and addicting.Its kind of like a Space MOBA but extremely ballanced, all you need to know is your ship classes, what they all are good against and a good tactic.I mean come one who dosent want to get into a intense dogfight just to find out your the last one left with 3 enemies surrounding you waiting to jump you. But lets face it, you get so into it when you hit your thruster, out of there sight behind a astroid with no hull left but some tin foil, and some rockets speeding at your face while warping out, then makeing the jump back home just to go back out and fight?    This game has so much potential, Not only do you choose your ship, but some awesome badass crew you can hire and put on your ship, with catchy phrases? SOLDI cant wait until the developers add more to this game, its golden, theres so many ideas you can put into this game to keep it the great game it is, I wish i could be on there development team myself thats how great there doing with it.  But yes, I do recommend it and this is a game i wll always come on to play, I want to get more people into it and hopefully see others to warp right ontop of them and tackle them before they can even put there jump drive on.  And if the developers are happening to read this, keep going, its just amazing what you have created, and always remember to keep it nice and ballanced just how it is.Hopefully I will see you all in game and let your bodies float around the Cold Cosmos!"",1"

"1494,Fractured Space,2016.0,""I've been playing this game since late alpha/early beta. I've been active in the community, lead events, and participated in competitions. Not just a paserby that didn't get interested in anything past playing on my own.I have a very serious question. Does ECG ever plan to advertise this game? To grow a player base? To reach out and seek an actual member-growing strategy? Skill brackets in PvPwere removed because the queue times to play PvP were ungodly and caused players to quit. Arguably the worst queue times most of us have ever experienced (often 45min for a game). Now, we are able to play games after probably an average of 10 minutes (those of us a little higher) which, while nice, has had huge reprocussions.Today I played aprox. 9 games where each, in a row, I was teamed with players with much lower rank than myself. For those of you wondering """"How could you know that"""", I asked most, but you get to a point in this tiny community where you recognize just about every name that's near you in rank. One that I played with was apparently on his 2nd or 3rd match in PvP as a whole. Take 2 high rank players on one team... pair then with 3 incredibly low mmr players. Now pin them against 5 moderate rank players. Who will win? Experience always outweighs. But, according to the system, I should've won by a mile. Instead I lost 33mmr. Then 20mmr. Then 15mmr. Then another 20mmr (the average is 8-12 for balanced games). Game after game because """"I should win"""" with green players on my side that unknowingly throw nearly every strategy. The fault isn't with these players - they're new. The fault is with this system and the development.Every update focuses on the flash of the game. Aesthetics, events, so on. When will the priority be to advertise? To fix the biggest issue the game has had since alpha? Two years is a long time. I've been here for what seems like ages"
"1495,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAt last, a MOBA-type game that relies fully on strategy (as opposed to reflex-based, which is almost entirely gone from this game). The 3d and slow movement of the player ships make coordination critical. While there are microtransactions, they are mostly for aesthetic options and any grind present in the game is nearly unnoticeable. Ship customization and stunning graphics are just a bonus at this point."",1"
"1496,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space is a great game, based on tactical awareness instead of fast reflexes. Has a vast variety of ships to choose from and customise. Great gameplay and fairly well balanced. Not pay to win. Beautiful graphics and audio."",1"
"1497,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewDecent game, not pay to win as all currency can be earned using the daily missions. All ships etc can be bought with real and in-game currency and there isn't too much grind to buy with in-game currency."",1"
"1498,Fractured Space,2017.0,""This is probably one of the greatest (and most addictive) games I've ever played. Some people have compared it to LoL but on steroids and in 3D. It's a great team competition game. It's in space using capital ships. I don't know what else anyone could ask for! :D Highly recommended, keep up the good work ECG. Basically, you captain a capital ship with a specific set of abilities and you have to work with 4 other people against 5 other people to try and capture their base. It's great teamwork, and a lot of fun. After reading some reviews: THIS IS NOT A PAY TO WIN GAME. You can buy ALL the DLC and it will NOT help you win a match! It's a combination of team composition, teamwork and skill. implants increase a specific ability in your ship a bit, not light and day. You need to know what ships can deal with what :) Pick your targets strategically, and work as a team! This is seriously one of the greatest games I've ever played!"",1"
1499,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewFor a game still currently in alpha it is pretty well polished for what is there currently there is only one game mode but it is a lot of fun i would definitely recommend getting this game and i am very excited to see how they flesh out the game from here,1
1500,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewOnly 5 hours into the Alpha and I see this game is going places. Lots of ships to unlock and tons of upgrades between those ships as well as crisp graphics that I'm going to assume will only get better.,1

"1503,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis Game is definitely one of the best space combat games out there. The gameplay is satisfying, though it is a change of pace for many people as teamwork is essential, the nature of the combat means that if you are outnumbered even slightly it will very much be an uphill battle which means people who quit the game tend to cause alot of problems for their team. That aside the ship design is phenomenal every ship looks impressive and  each manufacturer has a distinct look to them that they pass on to their ships Unfortunately right now the tech tree is quite barebones, however it is early access and they update with relative frequency, Picking a ship isn't just picking a certain amount of hitpoints with a weapon you like either, each ship has a different suite of abilities that do change the battlefield and a smart captain knows to use them. And finally the community seems quite pleasant if a bit quiet outside the realms of strategy but to be fair I'm hardly a chatterbox myself, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a tactical but still action-packed title.Iron Within Iron Without."",1"
"1504,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI bought this game just before their first â€œfree weekendâ€, and found quickly that it is a challenging game that is constantly in the process of evolving. As an early-access Alpha, the growing community had direct input into how the game evolves, the feedback of the players directly impacting the direction of the game developers. This process proves that the game developers care about what their players have to say, and are building the game around the community, instead of trying to build a community around the game.The game itself does have a small learning curve as there are numerous ships and play styles, along with more complicated tactics and strategies that are always evolving, but itâ€™s well worth it to put in the time and effort necessary to master these skills. With more than 40 hours invested in this game, I still feel like Iâ€™m learning new things and tweaking my playstyle constantly in order to find new competitive edges. Buyers keep in mind that the game is early-access, so not everything is perfect and polished yet, it is only an Alpha build, but its on a good track. What is currently available looks good, sounds good, and plays well. Iâ€™d recommend buying and buying now."",1"
"1505,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThere is a seed of a very good game here that despite the sometimes buggy netcode and relative simplicity of the basic ships on offer is a lot of fun to play. Sadly at the moment the lack of friends lists, decent matchmaking, good balacing and only one game type means you won't get a lot out of it for now but as it grows it has a real chance to be as fun and engaging."",1"
"1506,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewIf you're looking to shootâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥without thinking and play as a lone wolf then this game is not for you. You will be mercilessly destroyed. If, however, you enjoy actual strategic and tatical game play involving capital ships then this is the game for you.

To the devs: you've got a great game here, add some more ships and perhaps more in depth customization (more weapons, support mods, etc..) and you will truly have something special. 9/10"",1"
"1515,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is astounishing and I am not quite sure what is supposed to be 'early access' about it. The UI, in-game graphics, game servers, matchmaking, gameplay, customisation and plethora of cosmetics is simply incredible for a game at this stage of its lifecycle.If you like MOBA's and have an incline for anything that resembles a mix of Eve Online, Elite Dangerous and Battlestations Midway, then get this. It's an absolute no-brainer since you join the fun without having to spend a dime.One more thing, the graphics are drop dead gorgeous!"",1"
"1516,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWhy get this game? Because it blurs the lines between a space shooter and a MOBA so well. The gameplay flows, it is easy to figure out, and yet requires investment to master each of the ship classes and the game tactics. (As it should.) Unlike other free to play games, you are not limited in what ships you can buy, they do not restrict how many you can buy. But is it pay to win? NOT AT ALL!You can purchase boosters, which allow you to earn credits more quickly, but at the end of the day you still play in the same ships and every ship is balanced to play against the other ones. Sometimes it doesn't seem that way, but these Devs KNOW what they are doing, and it IS truly balanced, most of the time. I say mostly, because the game is still Early Access and even they do not know all the ways we the community can learn to use the ships they put into the game. >:)So yes, pick it up. The game is free, and at the end of the day the most you can waste on it is time, and money. But the money part would be your own fault, wouldn't it?"",1"
"1517,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game with a well executed spin on the classic Battle arena genre. Theres no tearing system meaning that everyship is just as good as the next with a wide range of play styles. well textured, easy to navigate. the matchmaking es also very intelligent in the way that you will never face a super advanced play when you first start because there are 4 tier levels which are based upon the amount of wins you have as far as i can tell. you can also test ships before you going head first into battle and then notice you messed up. My only issue with this game at the moment is the avrage wait time during the matchmakeing process."",1"
"1518,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI think this game originally filled a huge gap for me. One where lasers and missiles fly through space and these huge ships can engage in spectacular intergalactic dog fights. There were some updates to the game, and I even got to try it for free. This game even got my money as well. It is a ton of fun.The cons? The players. There are either always people that quit a match or just don't really understand the team dynamics of a game like this. That or there just aren't many players online. That's the recent issue... the game itself it a deep and well constructed game. Flying these space behemoths is so cool, and blowing them up is very satisfying. C'est la vie."",1"
"1519,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAn extremely fun highly skill based MOBA. Kind of a third person shooter in space.

"1522,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewAs a longtime CASUAL player, I would rate this game 5/7. If you guys don't understand Reddit jokes, think of that as a 10/10.I would first like to address a few common points.1. This is not Pay to Win. The grind is on par with other MMOs, like LoL, Wot, World of Warships, etc. There is literally no way a player can skip their way to a ship late in the tech tree. Everyting has to be unlocked with XP, and usually when you unlock a ship with XP, you have close to the amount of credits required.2. The tech tree is not like WoT or WoWs. Ships later in the tree are not simply better than the early ships. There is a reason why you see a lot of Reapers, Hunters, Colossi, Protectors, etc. They are good ships. Very rarely will you see a high end ship, like a Guardian, a Watchman, a Persecutor, etc. Thet take much more skill to operate, which is why they are at the end or near the end of a tech tree.3. Premium ships are not better. They are identical the their stock counterpart, just with a flashy skin, and they are all easily unlocked. The Reaper and hunter are fairly eay to get.Now for the god parts. It's basically all the other positive reviews, teanwork, great visuals, etc.But one thing that most of them don't mention is the great devs. They listen to the community. For example, there was massive backlash over a new crew system, and so the devs have changes in progress."",1"
"1523,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWhen people say this is a moba, it isn't a fast paced, high twitch skill game. It isn't farming waves or pushing towers. I didn't play a whole lot, but I see plenty of potential to start a new sub genre for mobas. It is a chess game, getting your team into place to ambush the enemy before they do that to you.I will not get into the gameplay itself, seeing as I don't have any right to. But I WILL however call the devs out on the fact they have a big massive sign on the loading page that says """"alpha"""", and yet have a FULLY functional store in game, as well as DLC on the steam page. You are not in alpha if you're selling the game, have an in-game store, and have DLC already up for sale. Just push it out the front door and be honest about it. Don't be skittish about reviews if you go live, because they'll call you out on being a money-grabbing alpha like I am. They'll just have more people reading them.End of the day, It IS a great game if you just want to enjoy a slow, team based space battle. I enjoyed the style, even though I won't be dumping hours into it. It lives up to the reviews it has on steam."",1"
"1524,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe games fun, behaves much like a MOBA and has good handle for a game in early stages of alpha, graphics are rather incredible even on medium settings.But there is one thing, there are some balancing issues that needed to be fixed, other wise the player base is just not going to grow positively a few of these examples in clued stuff like the sniper ship (long range is fun, but there is a point when that range can be rather unfair, such as when no one can reach the guy piloting said sniper ship causes he is practically out of the map and out of reach of primary weaponry and drone abilities), and the ability for people to warp out while in the middle of combat with no way to stop them from doing so (oh so many times I'd start fighting a flagship and it begins home warp as soon as the first shot(s) land on it. you gotta take a lump or two children, this game isn't for those who don't wanna get hit)I feel the game has much potential as long the dev team just rub out these issues and balance it out a a bit as well with any future content they put out, I rather like it as it fits my genre of games (spacy, futuristic), but since they got some rough spots in the balancing of game play I can't really rate this game fully until I see if the devs do said balancing or see if they just don't care, hopefully they will care, I hope they do certainly, games so much fun when you actually get a good fight going as I'v had battles last for at least 2 hours. for now though this game gets a yes.(come on developers, don't disappoint us here! weer counting on you to make good decisions here! )"",1"

"1528,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThink capital ship MOBA with no mobs.  Two main lanes and a central point used for bonuses at set game times.  You have to capture a lane in full to push out to the enemy base for a win, with the sub-bases in each lane providing resources that give upgrades over time.Early days, with the tech trees and ships not all released - only one of the three factions of ships has all 3 tiers, but it is early alpha so no surprise there.

"1530,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI play this game infrequently, and I enjoy it very much whenever I do play it. This is one of the best free to play games I have ever played, and if you haven't played it yet, you need to."",1"
"1531,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI like the idea and absolutely love the ship ascetics but the disconnects and poor balance makes the game very unfun at times. Mobility is king and if your ships has blink, teleports or some form of initiation/escape it gives you a significant advantage since there are very few ways to prevent someone from leaving the fight and dictating the flow of the match.The game is not pay to win. Yes, you can pay real money to gain faster access to all of the ships in the game, all of the crewmen, etc but in no way does this translate into having more power. This business model is typical for F2P games.All that being said, it's alpha and I'm genuinely excited for this game and can't wait to see how things change over time. It's fine if you don't enjoy the game in it's current state but don't just dismiss it as being bad. Come back in a few months time, the potential is there."",1"
"1532,Fractured Space,2016.0,""A great game with an emphasis on teamwork and knowledge of game mechanics.Fractured Space is a a beautiful game, with great visual and sound design. It has a very heavy focus on teamwork, so being polite, cooperating and reading your allies and your enemies behaviour is key. You WILL need to learn and fast. Each ship, similar to hero's in other MOBA and MOBA-esk games, has is strengths, weakness' and purpose. Understanding how to play each ship is key. Most games follow a fairly similar pattern, cap mines, fight for Gamma, attack enemy base. Don't let that fool you though, just because the game has a mould, doesn't mean you have to follow it. Each match will have it's different fights, and in each fight you might have to play slighly differently. And if you emerge victorious from a fight, you do feel a sense of pirde.However, it is not without it's flaws. The first and most important one is balance. With so many ships and so many factors to take into account, the game could be said to be unbalanced, and that wouldn't be wrong. It would however be a very narrow view. As a player with over 500 hours playing spread over around  2 years, I've seen unbalanced in FS, and it's done nothing but improve and the Devs have done nothing but learn (if slowly at times), but the game isn't perfect when it comes to balance, dare I say it will never be perfect, but which game is?The single biggest issue however is the Match Maker, or MM. It uses a system called MMR, which is based on win victories and defeats, to """"balance matches"""". Needless to say it's not the best system. It's been endlessly debated, moaned about, changed, tweaked and is a constant work in progress. If I were you, dont get angry about it, others will, but just try to play the game, help others and carry harder.The second is to do with ECG themselves. Having talked to the Devs, I know they are a great bunch of guys and girls that only want to make the game be fun and enjoyable for everyone, they just have a funny way of showing it sometimes. From random experimental patches, suprise launches or lack of communication, ECG definitely have their own way of doing things. Overall, Fractured Space is a great game with fun and varied gameplay, but not always balanced and with a WIP MM. ECG can seem to be a bit random at times, but they mean well."",1"

"1534,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI have jumped in to capture the valuable mining structure for my team. I am the first one here, no allies to back me up, no enemies to contest the point. Good, because my hull is already down to less than 50%, and my targeting system had been damaged so my lasers won't hit anything anymore anyways. I begin capturing the structure. Halfway through the process, an enemy ship jumps in. Not a single scratch on it. I am doomed.I position myself behind the structure, the other ship has no clear line of fire. My only hope is to hide, conquer the point for my team and escape. The enemy is bringing the ship around and I suddenly can relate to the rebels on Yavin IV as they watch the diagram of the Deathstar moving into position to blow them into oblivion. The point is close to being conquered and I initiate the jump, hoping that I will stay long enough to finish capturing the point but not long enough to... get hit by the swarm of guided missiles that is now headed my way! The enemy has brought their ship fully around and I grind my teeth as I anticipate the deadly impact as-ZAPPI am back at motherbase. I must have missed the missiles by half a second.

With 5v5 matches, individual skill in combat alone cannot secure victory. Your team must decide where to focus its effortsÍ¾ when to advance and retreat.

"1539,Fractured Space,2018.0,""DEVS, THE GAME OFTEN CRASHES BEFORE THE START OF THE MATCH. Sometimes I relog and it CRASHES AGAIN. â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING FIX THIS, its a KNOWN BUG. Cool concept, definitely worth checking out, but needs workJust looking at the Menu is quite sweet. Ships look beautiful.Yes, the ships are slow (especially the heavy ones), but it makes sense, since they are HUGE BATTLE ships and not tiny fighter ships. It getÂ´s quite enjoyable once you figure out how to properly fly the ships - saddly the tutorial is very barebones. I actually read the tutorial PDF manual, but until I unlocked PvP, I had no idea you can fire all weapons at the same timeThe bigger problem with the game is the lack of players. You will have to grind Coop vs AI matches for hours to learn how to play the game. If you actually dare to go into PvP, you will get horribly f****d, becuase the people that still play it will fly circles around you, and melt you in seconds.One more problem is that if you go PvP with friends, you will be split into opposite teams...Look devs, splitting up friends is not a good formula. If we get smashed, then so be it. WeÂ´ll practice and try again, but if you divide friends, nobody will keep wanting to play the game. I would keep playing if: 1) They add some PvE maps solo or coop maps, I would definitely play itIf """"Elite Dangerous"""" would have spaceships like this game, then I would play """"Elite Dangerous"""" (which is basically Euro Truck simulator in space)2) OR - they add a COOP with a smarter AIThe Coop missions are way to easy, while PvP matches are harsh and take long to find3) OR - make the FTL jump sound and feel cool (check """"Everspace"""" for comparrison)The gameÂ´s biggest selling point IMO is the bigâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ powerful and cool spaceship feel. If they would expand on that a bit, it could be pretty sweet."",0"

1542,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewI really like the idea of this game. I enjoyed the concept of it and the way you had to warp to the battlefield. If you want to get into the game READ THE TUTORIAL. I didn't and found it extremely hard to get into it but figured out everything by trail and error which took me 7mins so just read everything.  It helps :D Last time I played was some time ago and i do hope my pc will be able to run it... and I hope my internet speed is fast enough.Rate 8/10,1
"1543,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI bought this game with some trepidation at first, but now I'm hooked. I love playing it, I love getting better at it and I love playing it with friends.It is in early access sp currently it isn't perfect, at the time of posting there are some server issues but it is their top priority to fix them and as of late it all seems good now. The devs free2play model is one I agree with, everything you can buy has no effect on your ingame abilities or strength. You can buy purely cosmetic skins, XP and credit boosts (XP and credits are used to unlock ships and loadout options) and premium ships. Since ships are designed for diffident roles, if you buy a ship you will not have an advantage over another player. No one ship is better than the other, they're better at their given role. Also all premium ships can be unlocked in game just like any other ship.If you like space ships, blowing up space ships and laughing manically when you sneak in to cap an enemy's base, this is the game for you.

"1549,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access Reviewive played this game for as you can see about 25 hours and i have to say that im impressed at the rate the Devs are fixing issues and adding new contenthowever as its been stated before that, and i can not stress this enough, that this game isn't for casual gaming as a single match can take upwards to 40 minutes and is very reliant on you and yours doing what needs to be done in a certain situation and we all know how this turns out, either your teammate is worthless or you are.the graphics are good and rendering is fine music is ok as it gives it that atmospheric feel that just calms you down and at the same time makes you realize that its too quiet and that your about to die. The intense space fight music kicks in and you know even while you aim everything you have at that three ship kill team blinking towards you that you can try to escape but should have done so half a minute ago."",1"

"1551,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewWhat can I say about Fractured Space. Its just a good game over all, except two things are not good with the game personally. When playing in multiplayer matches your team can level up and unlock upgrades for your personal ships, thus far, i havent been able to use, let alone get these upgrades.Number two. the FPS runs kinda bad for me. It varies from 60 to 5 Frames, but it thankfully, mostly, stayes within thirty to forty FPS. But its still in its alpha phase so its expected to have some negatives.Other than that its a well rounded, well made, game with aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tone of potential.

But I don't know how the whole game works mechanically like how the upgrades works and so on. :/"",1"
"1554,Fractured Space,2016.0,""This game makes all other MOBA's look 2D. Probably one of my favorite sci-fi games ever, for a few reasons.1. You get to pilot a huge spaceship. (who has not wanted to do that!)2. Ships are very balanced. (hard to find nowadays)3. always being updated and tweaked.4. winning is very satisfying.5. You need teamwork to win or you will lose in the most spectacular way possible.The only con I can think of, is that there is not bot match so I can practice without other players."",1"
1555,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewIf you are tired of being in a fighter and looking at those giant capital ships and wish you could fly one then this is the game for you.

Just don't buy it until it's come out of Alpha, unless you're desperate for the Forerunner benefits, which are currently not immense.It's fun as crap. That much I will say. The issue is that it currently has quite a few bugs to swallow, from an annoying menu-screen flashing glitch to a number of crashes to quite unstable servers rife with disconnections. However, every so often, you'll have a battle unmarred by game-side problems, and those are pretty â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fun.TL"

(Assassin class is my personal fav)Bots fill in empty spots on teams that are missing players, though they are NOT smart at all. You start shooting one and it will stop in place and only try to line up direct shots"
"1559,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeEarly Access ReviewThis game is really fun and although still in alpha is extremely entertaining.

"1560,Fractured Space,2017.0,""The latest update is garbage - you play on a team with 1 or 2 other humans, and watch your AI teammates do insane things.  That removes every element of strategy from the game, and simply makes it a game of chance: did you get more AI or did the other team?"",0"
"1561,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is going to be amazing eventually, I would suggest holding out /for now/ on getting this game. I trust the devs, though, so if you want to get in on the action early, go for it"",1"
1562,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewFractured Space is the game I've been waiting for! It's a great game and It features massive Capital Ships. They have evened the fighting feature to make you not OP. There is still ways to dominate the battlefield if you use the ship they was it is meant to be played. For example the Goliath Capital Ship is a base capturing ship. It  can hold a capture point and take a beating and it is very good at capturing the enemy main base.,1
1563,Fractured Space,2017.0,One of the best free games i ever played in this kind of games. When i first started playing it i wouldnt have thouight that it was much for the world. But after severals hours behind it i could just say that this game gott me hooked! It is not a pay to win game. You could spend money on it but its just not worth it since you will end upp with things you really want after a couple of hours behind it. What you doo need is a good team on the battelfield and you will suceess with almost everything.The only bad things thats commes too my mind when i am writing this is that autobalance some times split partys too get more even teams. We should at least have been giving an option for if we want to be splited or not. Some minor buggs has comes out on the newest patch. But the devlopers of the game is already working on a fix for it.,1
"1564,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewReally fun MOBA-styled flagship battles in space! All the different kinds of ships means you can find a certain playstyle and really learn the ins-and-outs of each ship. I've really enjoyed this game since buying it in early Alpha.The only major problem is the lack of players, but now it's free-to-play there should be no excuse to try this epic game out!"",1"
"1565,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Do you enjoy true competition in a balanced environment where nobody has an advantage that another player can't have?Then this game is for you. It's pulse-pounding, mind-bending totally addictive team strategy. Best defined as 5v5 real-time third person strategy MOBA with spaceships, I cannot get sick of this game.The devs are very generous and responsive to inquiries and the balance is top notch."",1"
"1566,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's a very good alpha game. ALPHA game. Don't expect it to be perfect. The lack of tutorial is kind of annoying, but there are plenty of user videos to help with that. Clicking O will show what each button do but unfortunately, the text overlaps so you can't read anything. I love the fighting style, manuverability is minimal, but it does matter. Timing your abilities is crucial, and sending out those fighter drones are really fun. Overall, I wouldn't pay $10 for this, but if there's another free weekend, give it a shot. After all, it's going to be free on release.TL"
"1567,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space is a rare gem among Early Access/Alpha games, in that it has both replayability and enjoyable gameplay. At its core, it's a lane-based capital ship MOBA, with a combination of great graphics and interesting ships. Each ship is very different in how it plays, and (right now) it doesn't take much work to get a new one. The devs add new ships with every update, along with other features, helping keep the game fresh.Coming from Counterstrike, I was impressed at the amount of teamplay already necessary to win, even if everyone only uses the text chat. Teamwork makes the difference between victory and defeat, and as the community is pretty small still, you will often run into the same players multiple times in a playsession.As an alpha, the gameplay is very well done, but other parts of the overall experience are lacking. It is difficult to play with a group of friends, as there is no party or matchmaking (yet), and the main menu buttons are sometimes clunky. This is certainly made up for by the quality of the gameplay, which is the most important aspect of a game anyways.Overall, Fractured Space is a game I would suggest to people who enjoy MOBAs or space sims, but it's a good enough game anyone can try it out."",1"
"1568,Fractured Space,2015.0,""No, its not a pay to win because theres no buying in game cash. EDIT- You can get all base ships for free, and premium skins for microtransactions. TL:DR: Still not pay to win, as ships all are balanced to eachother (expensive ship can be countered HARD b early game ships)"",1"
"1569,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI've put about 12 hours into this game and have gotten a little less than half of the overall ships available. The gameplay is fantastic, a great mix between capturing points, strategizing next steps, and, of course, gorgeous ship battles. So far the only caveats I have are all alpha-related: the player community is a little small (especially in off hours), the title screen takes forever to load both at the beginning of the game and after a game, and there is a bit too much """"my team is losing, I quit"""" going on. All of those I'd imagine will be addressed as the game is finalized and the community-oriented parts of it included.Highly recommend to MOBA and/or spaceship fans. A little learning curve, sure, but I promise it's worth your time."",1"
1570,Fractured Space,2015.0,Early Access ReviewIf you like comp in CS:GO or like to press the numbers on your keyboard  or like to shoot lazers in space this is your game.Also you will need a good pc. I have a pc in the middle of minimum and recommended and I get good frames(40-50ish) but when theres 6 ship having a lazer party I get like 20.,1

"1572,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFractured Space may be in alpha, but i am already seeing promise. Running on the unreal 4 engine, I am impressed by the visual that blanket this MOBA style game. Alone with the MOBA style game it plays like Assassin's Creed: Black Flag battle ship mechanics...which is something that I wanted to play again. Sad that ubisoft never went into that kind of game. If you enjoy black flag's battle ships and always wanted to have awesome space ships battles like in start wars,, then fractured space is something to look into and support as its still development."",1"
"1573,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access Review(Keep in mind I posted this just after I started playing) Fractured space is a very enthralling masterpiece, that has some flaws which most certainly need to be worked upon.The great parts about Fractured space are as follows: It's unique concept. Fractured space at first just seems like a nerd's wet dream with collosal spaceship battles, lasers, and missiles. But the further you delve unto it's depths you realize it is much more. It has ties to common FPS, MOBA, and startegy games that will bring in just about anyone that likes the styles of any game in those genres.Fractured space has a good art style, by creating beautiful and haphazard looking spaceships. However these are not your average spaceship, as these are the motherships that you would typically deploy from in most other space dogfighting games. Aditionally they are greatly balanced, and allow you to work amazingly together in teams.A couple of Fractured space's flaws: Lack of a playerbase to properly enforce the developers to work regularily and on more core gameplay features.Additionally there is little to no balancing when joining a server. For example it is very common to be teamed against several very high levelled people.Overall, in it's current st8 I would r8 a l8 8/12. Could use some work, but very well established in it's current state already. "",1"
1574,Fractured Space,2018.0,Great game! I would recommend this to everyone. The ship classes are really fun. The maps are lacking (like 1 I think) and there is only one game mode. Still a great game! Worth a try at least seeing as it is free.,1
1575,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewCool game. Though I have an issue connecting to the server for some reason. Sometimes when I load the game it instantly tries to connect and fails. Due to the fail it immediately closes the game for me... HOW NICE!,1
"1576,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewCapital Space Ships 5v5 Capture the Flag.That's what this game is at the moment. If you watch Angry Joe you've probably seen his preview of Dreadnought. Fractured space is very similar in the 5v5 Capital Space Ship premise.What i've experienced so far is just 1 map, with 2 ways to each base.You need to capture the enemy's end of the lane to be able to warp to their home space and try to capture their base.It's fun to play right now. Im looking forward to more features being added, like changing the loadout of your ship/unlockables/progression etc.I hope the game will still be fun if you're pitted against players who are higher level than you. Being cannon fodder is NOT fun!Servers are in London and East/West USA."",1"
"1577,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access Reviewits alpha we all know this, butin an alpha still alot of fun to play one of the best space shooters/tac/srat/ games ive ever played can wait for teh final piece of work..."",1"
"1578,Fractured Space,2017.0,""The grind makes world of tanks grind look like a cake walk,plus the majority of matches I get into are filled with bots.I dont know what they did to drive away so many,there were enough playing a year ago."",0"
"1579,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game's actually really interesting, it's basically a MOBA with a 3rd person space combat theme, and although i'm not usually a fan of MOBA's, the pace, feel and objectives of the game feel really good, and from what I can tell in the item store, it isnt' at all pay2win.So far so good, definately recommended if you're a fan of space games, MOBA's or both."",1"
"1580,Fractured Space,2018.0,""It's one of those games in the niche of spaceship combat that you want to like because you're a sci-fi nerd but it isn't well made enough to be worth your time. I played Fractured Space a long time ago and dropped it after few hours because it was early in development and very rough around the edges, came back years later to see what had become of it and while it has improved significantly it's still not a good game in my book.I also played a game called Dreadnought berfore and it reminds me very much of Fractured Space but both are equally flawed. For those who played it and want a comparision: I'd consider Fractured Space's ship combat and design far better than Dreadnought's but both are not good games in my book due to their assorted flaws so there's no point in ranking which one is worse.At its core Fractured Space is a MOBA with two lanes, no PvE (you just capture stations to get more resources per time) and a special objective in the middle of the map between lanes you have to capture every few minutes to get a powerful buff, which gets stronger with each time it becomes available and is game-ending in the late stage.The game runs horribly because it relies heavily on expensive post-processing effects, affecting the entire screen, to look good. If you disable those it looks awful and still has significant frame drops, despite the devs having worked on and successsfully improved performance over the years - it's just not enough. The ship models are very high quality and pleasing to look at but some effects like large explosions aren't nearly as pretty and you can see artifacts on and around them.For those on 144Hz screens: There is no framerate limit so you could run the game at 144fps but as mentioned earlier optimization makes this pretty much impossible.Currently the main menu's hangar UI are broken on resolutions higher than 1080p and you can't see ships listed to the right end anymore as the bar goes white. You can still click on them though but there is no icon, just a white endless bar. This applies to 1440p and 4K resolution.The game is nearly dead - 350 to 450 players on peak times on EU. A match would require 5 players on each side. You also pretty much never play on the EU servers and get assigned to the US ones instead, which means you can expect 130-150ping. Even on the EU server you experience rubberbanding frequently and according to Whireshark isn't connection related but likely comes from the servers choking in certain busy fights.Queue times for PvP mode during EU primetime are so very high that I never even got into a match and cancelled matchmaking after many minutes. Not sure if that's a matter of not enough players for placement games being around or if nobody plays PvP for other reasons. You can do co-op matches with up to 5 human team mates against AI and if you don't find enough people you apparently get AI team mates to fill up the team. Co-op is the only active game mode and the AI isn't overly smart so you always win. The developers are apparently working on another PvE mode they're teasering at the time of me writing this review so PvE the direction the game seems to be heading into.Because it's a f2p game the required grind to get ships is enormous and due to there being """"crew"""" (which gives very strong modifiers to your ship's performance) and the cew members and crew implants being hard to come by you will quickly realize you never reach the same potential as someone who has been playing this a long time. Most people who consider playing this long-term probably want to buy the """"all current and future ships"""" bundle for 46â‚¬ and then spend the credits they get for playing matches and daily/weekly missions on crew and unlocking side-grades on ships.The in-game UI is a mess and lacks visibility as they do not use clear icons or colors to indicate things. Ship specific buffs and debuffs are mostly visualized as plain text and the quirky futuristic font they use isn't the easiest to read, especially on high resolutions.Camera, aim controls and certain game design decisions around individual ships are pretty clunky. Controls can not handle aiming straight up or straight down very well and because the game has a sense of verticality to it this makes many close-up fights pretty awful as your turrets do a full 360Â° turn because they don't consider radial orienation.For all it's worth you can download and play the game for free to give it a try but if you don't fall in love within the first few matches against AI there's no redeeming surprise to be found down the road. Bit of a shame, really. There aren't many multiplayer enabled spaceship combat games with such pleasant visuals and atmosphere but in the end that's of no use if there are lot of technical and design issues with it. I don't consider myself desperate for games to play so I can safely give Fractured Space a thumbs down and play something else instead. 57 out of 100"",0"
"1581,Fractured Space,2017.0,""I originaly enjoyed the game in alpha... beta.. due to there actually being teamwork. Though, at the time, there were not many players it was fun, tactical, strategic. As time has moved on, and FS have grown with updates, improvements, ships etc... it is a good game BUT only for occasional play. In my view.We cannot force players to teamwork, and unless a game mechanic is invented, never will. As FS has grown the teamwork has decreased proportionaly to it...seriously so much that it is 1/5 Teamwork games (this is out of about 50 games played to work this out). Sadly it has almost become a total solo play experience.Kudos to the developers, who i feel are really trying to give FS a future, but the game population seems to be falling. It can take on average 8 - 15 minutes for a PVP game queue ( again out of 50 games). The quick play idea is great if you just want to dive right in to the action for AI games though not so great if you want PVP.The maps are a good size and tactical. Ships well designed and are continously being updated."",0"
"1582,Fractured Space,2017.0,""I think this is a good game. Recently, they changed the main map, to make it smaller and more fast paced, I can't compare it to how it was before, because I began to play this game after the change, but looking at the changelogs, at least it looks like the devs are listening to the community.The Good:I really like how the combat feels in this gameEvery ship feels different and has a different playstyleIt's F2P, but not pay to win, skill still is what matters in the end of the day, it's not the worst F2P system i've seen, but it's still F2P: you can take a lot of time to unlock ships and crew, OR, buy it with real cash. I don't think the prices are abusive though, the latest released ship costs about $8, and the old ones you can get for around $1, but I would still prefer to pay a one time price and get everything.Frequent updatesThe Bad:Matchmaking is not perfect, you get a lot of people with very different skills, but at least it does try to even the teams a bitThe recent change in the map made people mad, I kinda wish to know how it was before the change, maybe the devs will change it to be a bit more like it used too.There are only two maps/arenas/game modes available. Coming from a MOBA like Heroes of the Storm, I feel the lack of more maps with different objectives/strategies to spice up the game.Overall, I would recommend this game."",1"
1583,Fractured Space,2017.0,What an insane game! Well done designing the ships and sound effects it REALL! blasts you away!!I recommend it to people deffenatly i enjoy every second of it non-stop!!I have only 1 thing to ask of you guys is that you add a few more ships and more ways to earn money and to spend the money on . Other than that absalutly Crazy about this game so fun so so so so fun. On my opinion.Also thank you for making the game free-to-play as i think that was avery good dessicion to make and must of been hard for u guys but you did the right thing shot guys!,1
"1584,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Had alot of fun in this game then stopped playing. From other reviews, it seems they nerfed how much credits you get in-game. Thats enough for me to uninstall this game. Not looking for another grindy game. Ill just go back to EVE online"",0"
"1585,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Fractured Space has come a long way since I first started playing this game. At the time of this review I have 155 hours played since itâ€™s free to play release. Here are my thoughts on the game:While loosely formatted around a MOBA, it doesnâ€™t necessarily feel like Iâ€™m playing a MOBA. Rather, FS plays more like conquest in Battlefront 2: you fight the enemy for control over certain areas, which leads to gaining control of the battlefield and eventual victory (I have yet to play Battlefront 3 so I canâ€™t make a comparison there). While the mission doesnâ€™t change, the way you play can widely vary based on your ship selection, and team compositions. Each ship feels balanced, however some ships or classes of ships (read stealth and snipers) have steep learning curves on how to actually contribute to the game. Unlike some other games, when Edge Case reveals new content, especially new ships, I get excited to play again. Unfortunately, with a lot of new changes comes bugs, many of which have been persistent. There are also some features which I feel should be included but arenâ€™t. In game voice chat would be huge, as well as a server browser to allow players to fill in for an AI pilot. That being said, I feel like Edge Case has been putting forward a lot of honest effort to get the game to where they and the players want it to be. Pros:â€¢Fun â€“ blowing away capitol ships is awesomeâ€¢Gameplay rewards skill and teamworkâ€¢Balanced ships and content (mostly) means this avoids being a pay to winâ€¢All ships available on standard currency, and currency grind is fairly easyâ€¢Relatively consistent updates with exciting contentâ€¢Great communities available on Reddit and DiscordCons:â€¢Bugsâ€¢Lack of certain features such as voice chat or server browsingâ€¢Premium currency (Though with this being a FTP, I have no problem supporting the devs)â€¢SaltClosing Thoughts: My review here is lacking some information as I have never actually played the second game mode, Frontier. Since this game is FTP, there is no harm in giving the game a try, and you may actually end up enjoying it. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes piloting big ships and blowing up other ships. "",1"
"1586,Fractured Space,2014.0,""Early Access ReviewAwesome game, this game has great potential, & at the rate that its going i see great things comeing from this game, I know its a PVP multiplayer typ of game, but i hope as they continue developing this game they will have a galaxy free roam and battle other players from the opposeing faction. I'd recomend this game if your into space games."",1"
"1587,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewPicked this game up to tide me over until Dreadnaught came out but have been really surprised at how good it is. Constantly being updated i have not regretted the early access purchase. Good amount of ships and varierty to the gameplay just wishing for a better variety of map.Very fun, have been recommending to everyone."",1"

"1589,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewBEST GAME EVER! It's so addictive, and when you play your mind is just blow away. The graphics are AMAZING and everything is so detailed, I just wish there were more people playing, most often the servers are all empty and it takes a long time before people are playing."",1"
"1590,Fractured Space,2017.0,""It is an entertaining game, with a large variety of ships.  The good is the fun factor and the coop play seems to be a great time waster.  The bads are that these games seem to take a lot of time, the ships take a lot of grinding, the rewards are slanted to give you the most useless possible items, and my personal annoyance that the support personnel refuse to assist you at all for issues.  I hope that I can change my review, but I doubt that will happen."",0"
"1591,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewHi,Today I will make a review that I hope won't bother you too much. This game is one of the most special games I have ever played on my pc. The mechanics of the game I stunning as well as the graphics which are well optimised for Amd Gpu. Now that sound good I guess. The problem is find with the game is the lack of realism and the control of the ships you should have. The spaceship is stunning but the interaction with other ships and the outers pace environment is not that great. The metorits are too easy to avoid and they are too big. Maybe the goal should be to protect a planet instead of a gigantic ship. Now the next part is of course the game play.  Now this is interesting because it was difficult for me to decide. First of the loading times to find players is ridiculous but understandable for a game that is not a hit yet. The interface inside a battleship match is not as user friendly as you might expect but it is okay. The game is actually not boring at all but fun as heck. You can enjoy 1 game of fractured space and it will feel like you played for 10 hours. This is good for those gamers who  don't have more time than 1 hour a day to play games. Now last problem I have is with people that are AFK. There should be a system that bans them after they're kicked from the game if they repeat that reckless behaviour. I would say that this game is worth playing. You can enjoy the game without putting a penny in buying the great editions of the game. I would give this game a 6/10. This is pretty good score for a free to play game. Enjoy the game and thank you for taking your time to read this :)"",1"
"1592,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewThis... is... an.... AMAZING GAME!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuA78eE5OdoDon't Think, BUY!Sure it has a learning curve, but you will be able to dogfight in spaceships... DOTA style!"",1"
"1593,Fractured Space,2017.0,""Had to edit this review, fair warning, it was originally a negitive. Not because of gameplay, glitches or the devlopment team. It was because of the lack of players. I want to tell you, this game is amazingly addictive. It I hope that its community expands because even if the player base is small i still wait to play another match, its that good. Graphics are impressive, yet the game system is optimized so well its not clunky to play on the GTM 650. This is something alot of early access games struggle to do, and the fractured space team has achieved it with what seems so easy."",0"
"1594,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access Review:TL"
"1595,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeFor something I can pick up and drop into, murder some spaceships and get back to real life fairly fast, it's great. As an early access, sure there has been a few problems with matchmaking or load times but with the new update things are working a lot better. I PREFER THIS GAME TO DREADNOUGHT (which is in beta now) This is a good tactical team based game where knowledge of ships and how to use them can put you at an advantage or disadvantage. I highly recommend this game. It's a shame there isn't a bigger following and I don't know what reviews are so mixed lately.I love this game.**EDIT - I have over 600 hours now. I've seen people with 2000hrs+ complaining. I guess sometimes even you play 2000hrs you can still suck at the game. lol. This game from day one has consistently improved. As an early backer, I've easily gotten all the ships but I can see how grindy it may seem to some. I don't play this non-stop and burn myself out. As such, I've had this for ages now and still love to drop into space in my yellow Enforcer and turn the tides of matches, while escaping punishment (for the most part).As a space genre nerd, this will ALWAYS be a top space combat game no matter if it's MOBA and not MMORPG or anything... Really really good game once you know what you're doing and how to fly what you're in."",1"
"1596,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Product received for freeTL:DR This game is absolutly worth downloading and atleast trying, Its a blend of League of Legends and Battlestar Galactica in one title: and who would say no to that.I originally got this game during """"The Mighty Jingles"""" promotion. Stopped playing it for a while because of performance issues. Played again during the free weekend in Jan 2016 and forgot about it again. Started playing after the May update and immediatly remembered why I was so interesting in it. (Even whilst disliking the majority of Moba style games.)Firstly - the game looks im hesitant to say beautiful but it looks good for a game in alpha, the effects look like they actually came from the weapons you fired and not some b movie looking stock flak effect.Now that the game is out. This game is absolutly gorgeous I cannot fault a single visual effect present within the game. The ships are stunningly pretty, with a varied designs even within the 3 ship manufacturer asthetics.Second - the combat: It feels heavy, its very much like Battlestar Galactic in that the ships don't float about like their made of nothing, they all have inertia, they take time to slow or turn (especially with the larger, tankier ships like the Leviathan, Gladiator or Colossus). When you fire your guns (especially on Destroyer) they feel weighty, they feel like they should for a capital class warship, they have presence that so many games fail to achieve. Onto the monetization of the game: There is premium time for more exp and credits, cosmetic skins and premium skins that provide even more credits per gameThird - the unnecessarily feared drop system: Its effects are minimal on the game. Drops range from credits to crew, Elite xp used to level up/ unlock crew and you can even earn premium currency and premium skins.On to something Ive noticed in other reviews, People complaining about it being p2w (which is completly untrue as there is no paid for only items in the game that have any effect on gameplayThe """"grindy"""" nature of Fractured space isn't a new system. Its been present in plenty of other games without complaint. Fractured space needed a monetisation system, and the one they have implemented is easily one of the most generous systems i've ever seen in a game like this.Overall you should at minmum try this game its free to play after all, and if you enjoy it please play it. Edgecase games deserve far more players for a game that rivals the largest Mobas in gameplay and features."",1"
"1597,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewI was about to give this a negative review because I thought it had no servers, thankfully I didn't write that review and decided to give this game another go. I got addicated to this game after my second chance: got to rank 7 in a day, and the servers were not at all empty, it just takes a while for it to find the servers near you.Now, as for the actual gameplay, I'll list cons and pros:PROS:- The visual graphics are great for a free to play game.- Not a """"pay to win"""" game. You can purchase custom skins/paint jobs for your ship, and 2 """"premium ships"""" is what you can buy. The 2 premium ships aren't that overpowering. To put that into perspective of how weak they are, my free ship that I earned with credits, can kill both of them in a 2v1 against me.- The sound effects are pretty real... if ships were a thing in space, I'd say the sounds would be pretty close.- You can """"upgrade"""" your current ship. CONS:- Only one gamemode (to be fair, it has another gamemode, but no one is able to select it, so I think they may be working on that other gamemode).- No customizablity with the ships, other than the skins you have to buy with real money. You can put your own decals on it, or to create your own camo/skin of the ship to make it truley yours: I don't want a same-looking ship as other players do. I want to make it truley mine.- Finding my location and finding nearby servers take too long. It needs to be fixed."",1"
"1598,Fractured Space,2018.0,""I sort of like the game and yet I really hate the game becasue of what it's become. It used to be 5v5 even in AI but now if you're 4v1v5 as the only human player. You maya swell Alt+F4 out becsue you are not going to have fun. The AI is so tunnel vision that they will literally ignore your base being catpured for gamma, they will ignore your base being captured to capture A/B2 Hell they're even ignore winning to go get Gamma, Gamma is not that important if you can literally jumop to the enemy base (Knowing that the AI can be exploited) and win. the AI is very unbalanced becasue the enemy AI will always perform better than the ones on your team. take note of healers the enemy one wil lalways be where it's needed and will heal on CD where as your own healer will watch you die and then heal itself or it will heal you while you're at home base...Players in thsi game don't care at all they will ignore everything including winning just so they can get an extra kill becasue there's no stats ( which is a good thing ) so all they care about is their own score card.Onto the ships - There is clear unbalanced ships while some are amazingly overpowered and some are a joke.Some good things just to balance off the rant I had about the bull in this game. They give you free premium currency but there's not much to buy with it, the daily missions if done right can give you perminant premium currency bonusthe ships look amazing specially the TDS ones."",0"
"1599,Fractured Space,2017.0,""I used to enjoy playing this game back in the earlier beta stages. Since then, I have grown to dislike the game. Fractured Space went from a """"free to play"""" game, to a """"pay to win"""" game. Players used to have a level playing field in terms of ships, but now a player can buy implants to make their crew overpowered. Implants can be earned through months or years of grinding for supply drops, or by buying currency and getting the ones one needs. It is truly disapointing to see this game turn to the dark side of """"free to play"""" games because I really liked playing this game. I would pay $60 to buy this game, but I will not feed a """"pay to win"""" scandel.In addition to the above problem, getting credits in game is incredibly grindy. A player may get 15,000 credits from a match, but it takes upwards form 300,000 to buy a ship. Combine that with the 5+ minute que time, and the player is looking at a wasted day.I personally have had one last issue with this game. I do not know if this happend to any other players, but I had all my ships reset a long time ago, Shortly after they added the black widow I believe. I had owned all of the ships currently in the game and then, I had to grind all the credits to buy new ones. It was dissapointing to say the least."",0"
"1600,Fractured Space,2015.0,""Early Access Review+ I love the idea of fighting huge battle cruisers.+ I love the slightly slower pace of combat (compared to, e.g. CounterStike GO or Call of Duty).+ basic controls are easy to pick up (WASD and point-and-shoot)+ taking damage looks really impressive.However:- an FPS-like interface is easy, but it loses the feeling of flying in 3D space. This is a shooter with an invisible floor.- the roles of the different battle ships are too close to shooters like Team Fortress or Call of Duty- Due to the camera and the lack of frame of reference, these ships don't look especially big.- weapons and gameplay are needlessly complicated- visual clues are REALLY BAD. I know when I'm hit, and I know when I hit somebody else. That's about it. I sort of understand the base captures and the tug-of-war gameplay because I've seen it in other shooters, but I have NO idea why or when to capture the central resource/base/plant/whatever.Also, you get some beta quirks:- controls are not configurable (I guess they will be configurable before the game goes gold)- animations look like they're static, not physics based and so they look like crap- joining a game is awkward and offers me a choice I don't need to make. Either I want to jump into """"any"""" game with a low ping, or I want to join a friend. Clans would be nice, too. There's very little sense in other choices as the games all play the same anyway.All in all: don't pay for it unless you feel the need to be charitable to the developers."",0"
"1601,Fractured Space,2016.0,""Early Access ReviewFrom what I've played, while not a heap, I can definatly say that, YES it is in development, but even so, still provides a challenging gameplay mechanic that isnt really seen in games these days.Controling these massive ships is difficult and yet somehow simple while using the weapons is a breeze, and takes influences from third person shooters (aim, then click) and on top of managing everything, making a stratagy to win the match.I'd really like to see this game fleshed out more in the future, which I'm sure is coming, but for now, the gameplay is solid with a surprisingly good tutorial (and the O K system is awesome, I'd like to see the controls page be dynamic with changes in your keybinds, but thats just me) and the menu is well laid out and presented neatly, and for an early access game, thats all you need.Servers are alright, I'd like to see more reigons in the server list, but I'm Australian, so apparently I dont matter. xDGraphics are good, but sometimes locks up in highly demanding moments (like their hyper jump or what ever they are calling it)Basically, a great space opera with pretty good gameplay and decent (yet to improve) graphics.TLDR: Its really good, you should buy it, its like Star Citizen, but real."",1"
1602,Fractured Space,2016.0,Early Access ReviewGreat game. A new take on the moba genre or even a completely new genre. Succesfully combines RTS and FPS gameplay together with moba like team- and tactical decisions to create something unique and very fun to play. Recommended!,1
