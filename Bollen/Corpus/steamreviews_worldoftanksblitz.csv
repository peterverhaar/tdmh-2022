"7271,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Pros:-Perfect for those who cant play WoT on pc bcause hardware limitations.-Fun for having such small maps.-Great Community.Cons:-A litle bit of P2W.-Matchmaking is alittle bit drunk.-As stated above the map is too small.Conclusions:Overall a really great game. Perfect replacement for those who have toasters who want to play WoT. And for those who say """"Why u no put original WoT in Steam"""" think about those who have toasters instead of a PC.7/10"",1"
"7272,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Decent game... why hate, if you play wot pc then dont come herei dont even play wot pc, warthunder is the best with logicwot blitz is good low game that even my crappy laptop can play, and really quick paced and casualwhat do you expect? wot pc on mobile? i dont see any short coming since its mobile game that have to keep things minimum and of course its only casual games at best and cant be compared to real medium to high end pc gamesi recommend to play on phone/tablet too because you can play it when you are not near your pc/laptop when you're bored at someplace7/10"",1"
"7273,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Played a few matches and it was too much already. As a side note, I got over 25k WoT battles under my sleeve but I only play some 5-10 matches each month these days because it's way too broken, the players in randoms are horrible, and there are better games out there (yeah, talking about both WT and AW).WoT Blitz on PC is a thing that should not be - graphics are 1997-ish, players just as bad as in WoT, all in all it's a very boring grindfest that does not deliver anything special.P.S. I played Beta and I quickly uninstalled it. I have absolutely no illusion that the """"final"""" product will get better. It starts with a rotten foundation."",0"
"7274,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""This is, in a nutshell, World of Tanks lite. In fact, it's literally the same game that you can get on your iOS device. You may ask youself what the point of putting WoT mobile on the same platform you could play the real WoT on, but the difference, simply, is that if this can run on an iPhone it can run on ANYTHING. I personally have never been able to play WoT on my computer, because I have a Macbook. Heck, I can barely even run Minecraft on this thing, but WoT Blitz runs 60 FPS without even sweating. That alone makes it worth it for me, at least."",1"
7275,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,this thing actually a great game but World of tank blitz actually made for mobile so if you want play this game i recomended this game -----> https://worldoftanks.com/ it is a same game from same developer but made for computer,1
7276,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,This game is one of the best I have ever played. It is a slow game but in the end it is a very fun and satisfying one. It has battles in which you will have a team of 7 (including you) and you can either capture a base or destroy the entire enemy team. This is a very active and demanding game so I would only recommend this to people who have spare time and can be committed to a something like this.,1
"7277,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""This game is amazing! Unlike other free to play tank games, it is not pay to win. You can easily advance through the game without ever buying, but if you want to buy something to give you a little bit of an advantage you still can. The phyisics and graphics are not the best, but this is made up for in playing experience. There are always players online so you can easily log on and get into a fast paced battle. Whether you like staying behind and laying down cover fire or if you prefer to go in guns blazing and take as many bodies as you can before you go down, there is always a tank that will fit your playing style! So what are you waiting for? DOWNLOAD THE GAME!"",1"
"7278,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""Wargaming why the hell would you put this on Steam and not regular WOT?On a side note it's a great game, primarily aimed to those who can't run the original game. Graphics are nice for being a mobile port and there's alot of variation in tanks. Wargaming certainly hit the spot on this one. My only complain is the YOLO it players, they most certainly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed alot of the matches I took part in. Fun fast matches with good looking tanks. And you can team up with a friend against those bastards, what else would you want? "",1"
"7279,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Great graphics, full of action, easy to control and playing against real players instead of a dumb AI. With Free to pay you would expect to have to pay something to win more, but fortunately that is not the case in Blitz. Those who buy premium Tanks have no advantage over those who don't have one. Spending real cash will just let you collect tanks. That's all.As each game only lasts 7 minutes max. It is great for playing when you have only a few spare minutes. I used to play it on mobile, but completely s^c^^ at that. Since I moved to my laptop my Win Rate dramtically increased. Try both to see which fits you better."",1"
"7280,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""I've been playing the World of Tanks series of games (started out with normal World of Tanks for the PC, calling WoTM for now) for almost 6 years, and WoTB is quite a fun replacment. I lost my interest in WoTM because of the very broken artillary mechanic (and yes, I used the Arty as well, and found it quite broken, although they claimed to have changed it but I am skeptical), and when I was watching videos on WoTB, it had no arty in it what-so-ever, and I desided to try it out, and I found it to be quite fun, and I have been playing it non-stop ever sense. PROS: Smaller matches compaired to WoTM means quicker grinding for tank lines, and sometimes comical more chaotic battles. New Equipment System: Many players will disagree with my statements (and that is fine), and yes, although the old equipment system was very good, the new one is even better in my eyes. And I will say, at first, I absolutly hated it. The new system allows players to mount 9 different equipment types on there tanks, and all it takes is some grinding for """"Spare Parts"""". Many players think the old one is better, most likely because all the needed to do was grind IGC (in game credits), but it only allowed us to mount 3 equipment types total, and some classes of tank, such as tier 5 tanks, wouldn't even get to mount certain equipments because they were too low tiered, namely the Gun Stabilizer, which in the old system could only be mounted in tier 8+ tanks, and now can be mounted on almost any tier. Tons of tanks to choose that fit most playstyles:There are tons of tanks in here, just like WoTM, bar Arty. If you want quick, zippy, deadly tanks, go down light tank paths. If you want a balance of power, go for medium tanks. If you like to camp in bushes and torture your victims, go for Tank Destoryers, and if you like to sit an laugh at people trying to hit your armor, go for heavy tanks. And as the game is still improving just like WoTM, more tanks are in the future. Good graphics and gameplay - nothing much to say, although they are not as HD as WoTM, for low-to-medium-end systems (somewhat like mine) they are perfect, but I am not into games for fancy graphics, I play for gameplay.Cash grinding is quicker do to smaller matches.Cons:Smaller matches compaired to WoTM. Although it has it's perks, if you come from WoTM, you might have some withdrawls from the old 15v15 and have to deal with the 7 v 7.Spare Parts System: Although the new equipment system is good, I will say that the Spare Parts system is somewhat flawed. We should at least earn 1000 spare parts for a victory and maybe 250 for a loss. I've only won about 300 for a victory. This makes getting equipment quite slow and somewhat annoying. The only way to get more than 1k spare parts is to complete missions, but these reset only every 12-24 hours (forgot which lol) To be honest people, the new equipment system really is awesome, but the amount we win spare parts at is too slow for it to be truely effective) - Update 3.10 claims to add new ways to earn more parts per battle. Overpowered tanks: Although a somewhat realistic feature (example, a Tiger II in real life would blow away a Sherman no problem), many tanks in here are too powerful for what they are. Some notable tanks are the Leopard Light Tank of tier 5, KV-2 of tier 6, LTTB of tier 7 to name a few. What makes them flawed is the raw damage output they can deal, the Leopard only had 2 varients built in real life, so not much is known about it. The KV-2 in game can 1 shot anything at tier 6 and below when using the 152mm gun, however in real life, this thing couldn't even turn it's turret when it was on a hill. LTTB reportedly broke it's suspention when traveling over rough turrain. The LTTB is also a light tank, and it moves as quick as many light tanks of lesser weight and armor, yet it has 90mm of hull armor. I don't think it should be moving that fast (perhaps why it failed in real life) However, these tanks are luckily not without flaws. Leopard has a long clip reload and poor armor. KV-2 has an insanely long reload (upwords of 20+ seconds), and the LTTB is quite large for a light tank and can be easily shot.There is also somewhat of a """"Russian Bias"""" with this game, and many of the Russian tanks are quite overpowered, and seemingly the German tanks are underpowered (even though a real scenario would have the German tanks with the upper hand, depending on the crew, with a few exeptions on tanks) - luckily this bias isn't as great as it is in some games though. And yes, I am parcial to German tanks, but I also use British, American, and Russian, so this is from personal experience. The new """"Millitary Honor"""" system:Absolute **** in my eyes. I've been having some stability issues with my computer, so sometimes my computer will crash during game play, and I don't exactly have the cash to buy an entire new rig (luckily I might know the problem and am fixing it) but because of  this new """"Millitary Honor"""" system, you're """"honor"""" stars go down because random players think you're botting, or AFKing when you could have issues like I am experiencing. In my eyes, this system needs a major reworking or removal. And my final and main issue with the game: NO THREE MAN PLATOONS LIKE NORMAL WOTM - I understand that 7 v 7 might be difficult to have 3 man platoons, but we need something cause 2 man platoons is just too small. All I can really say about that. - honestly we should start a petition on WoTB for 3 man platoons for those that agree with this.Another thing for new players is DON'T JUDGE THE GAME UNTIL YOU'RE AT LEAST AT TIER 5, AND THIS GOES FOR WOTM AS WELL. I've seen too many people quit because they don't invest the time into learning this game. It's not just """"point and click and get a kill"""" (unless you're an old arty or KV-2, then it sometime is). There is tons of mechanics in the game for armor, a skill called """"sidescraping"""", and many other things that will help you survive in battle. Learn you tank too. A Panzer IV will have a completely different playstyle than a T1 Heavy or KV-1 (these are all tier 5s too, so not compairng two diffrent tiers). Use youtube for education and training, and you might enjoy this game more. Note: These are all my opinions, ignore misspellings, etc. And that concludes this long winded review. "",1"
"7281,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Overall, I'd recommend it to anyone. You progress quite quickly through the game so money doesn't have to be spent unless you're really desperate. However, the biggest problem is the match making. You either smash their team or get smashed. You can be afk on your team and win with maybe one casualty or work your â™¥â™¥â™¥ off and lose awfully. This can be fixed on future updates but apart from that, it's a solid game. Also, you can run it on a potato so that's always good."",1"
"7282,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Can I say its more fun than some other tank games? Because it is. Very recommanded even for a free game. At least I don't have to boot my Windows 10 PC to play the game, now I can play it on Windows 7"",1"
"7283,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""The PC version is much more stressful and messy. 15 v 15, maps are too huge and things are likely to get chaotic. Imagine playing PC version is similar to playing CSGO 10 v 10.In this version, it is 7 v 7 with all the same basic features, which means everything is much simpler. Tanks still look good, not as """"fabulous"""" and """"shiny"""" like the PC version but they do look awesome enough. I strongly recommend this game to people who want to relax and have fun. Pretty chillin game. The community is not toxic also."",1"
"7284,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""The progression through the game is incredibly slow. Most will say that they enjoy lower teir tanks anyway, but the truth is that when the game forcibly matches you against better tanks, you can only do so much. Armor is harder to penn, your armor is useless, and the tanks eare faster, bigger, etc. Only download if you plan on sinking thousands of hours into the game. I hav eplayed this on the tablet for years, and now retired it on the PC, and although i have 300= hours on the game, I have only managed two teir 7 tanks, about half of the grind to get to a point where you can't be matched with higher tanks. They also censor too much in chat. Clearly a game made for profits."",0"
"7285,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""So far so good, Played World of Warships from the same company and this is just as good. Definatly playable without spending on micro transactions. Although very enticing to pay to go straight to a higher tier. I'd give a 7.5/10 due to the fact the mobile version of the game is the saem and you add to your credit tallies by playing that too."",1"
7286,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,so unbalanced if you've previously played the full pc version (worldoftanks.eu)as a unicum (pro stat padder) on the other game i can say that this version is like killing puppies if you have any skill,1
7287,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,if you like war game team games  that can teach you stuff along the way about tanks get this game befor i started playing this game i had no ider of what tanks were out there now i know i heap like my farvrot cromwell end uthors like kv 1 vk hesla   mouse t1 t34 t34 85 just to name a few,1
"7288,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""Why oh why did wargaming decide to put a mobile game onto steam. The graphics are crap, the gameplay is bearable (just) and game time is too short. The only thing this game has going in its favour is that it's easier to grind each tank than on the pc. Otherwise it's a waste of hard drive space. Should have put the PC version on here wargaming, just saying."",0"
7289,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,Having trouble. It let me play the trainer then it would just say synchronizing data showing the picture of a tank. let it sit for ours no change. uninstalled and reinstalled several times no luck.,0

"7291,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""I find this game commonly frustrating yet, a game I continue to run back too. Something about the challenge of improving, outplaying enemy players, and moving onward to new tanks, keeps bringing me back in, and although the developers make some questionable desicions from time to time, they typically aren't as bad as the community makes them out to be. All and all this game dosen't deserve bad reviews simply for being ported, as not everybody has $600+ computers to run the actual PC version. A game should be rated on it's gameplay and preformance, not it's origin. Either way, this game is a double edged sword, that both frustrates and exilrates, and can be both tense, yet slow at the same time. Overall this game is one I'd reccomend for the casual budgetted gamer, who wants a fun, competitive envrioment, without the need of some exuberant machine."",1"
"7292,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""First of all, I first played War Thunder on my PS4 because back then there weren't much games offered on the console. I got hooked and got serious so I installed the PC version of War Thunder. I never looked back to playing on my PS4 because the controls of keyboard and mouse were just natural to me. Fast forward a year after getting married and there is just not enough extra time to play the game on the PC. I suddenly saw World of Tank Blitz on the android store and I tried it. The concept of a tank having HP was alien to me because in War Thunder once you get shot either you die or you live. Then I began to learn the mechanics and did a switch from War Thunder to Wot Blitz. Fine it's a played down version of WotPC but the matches approximately last only 7 minutes a round and I carry it in my pocket. I got hooked. The mechanics of the game are pretty complex once you get past tier 5. You realize the weaknesses and strengths of each country and tank in particular. You also notice that players get a little more talkative and mean because it really is competitive in the higher tiers and people want to keep their win rates up.All in all I installed it on my ANDROID phone, my wife's IPAD and now my laptop. It's the perfect game for those who don't have much time on their hands or those who are always moving around. I love the game. First bunch of people who did cross platform right. No wonder the owner is one of three billionaires involved in the gaming industry. I already have a year's worth of playtime in this game through handheld devices. Can't wait to try it on my laptop."",1"
"7293,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Had the mobile game for a while and reached tier 9. Fast paced game, good for a few quick matches when you have some spare time. You can pay for premium tanks but you still need some level of skill to win, they're not amazingly overpowered or anything. Still pondering about why they didn't add the PC version of the game to Steam, though."",1"
7294,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,One main point and it is a game ruiner. RNG. The RNG in this game is obcenely broken and out of the hours i have played this game i have won about 7 games.  To make matters worse if you pay to get premium tanks and parts you basically just won the game right there and then. Metric tons of potential ready to be ingnited but it is raining on your parade.,0
7295,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,PLEASE PLEASE NO! i love world of tanks but world of tanks blitz is a bad game i looks likeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥it is possible to get enough gold to buy a premium just by doing the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing tutorial all the player are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you should thank me for going to this hell so you don't have too this is a free to play game that is trying too hard too get your money overall a 2/10,0
7296,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,Very good game absoulutely loved the mobile version and glad its here now on steam.This game is a vast paced ww2 tank game with an objective of kill all players or capture an important point.Includes multiple styles of tanks and customisation.Runs very well on my macbook and has good graphics compared to the mobile version.,1
"7297,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Gave it a try, and sadly its the same old bad """"world of tanks"""" game. The only good thing about it is the fun killing artillary is removed. Beyond that, its the same unbalanced bad match making game its always been. Battles are just a mish mash of every sort of tank, from every nation and era, and of differing tiers, that create battles that are often so unbalanced that there is no battle. One group of tanks simply gets to take out the other group, and all the victims can do is try to run or scratch their killers paint with a couple shots. Not fun for any player actually looking for good gameplay. Why WoT thinks this is a good gameplay model is beyond me. This game has so much more potential if WoT would put some effort into balancing their match making system. Like putting nations together into teams, and put tanks together of the same time period and crew skill level. And no multi-tier'ed matches. The game seems like it was being built to be like that, but the devs quit and put this out instead."",0"
"7298,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""Meh...It's somewhat fun.  Here's my issue:  The game kinda boot-to-the-neck grinds your face.  The tutorial I get...do this, okay now do this.  But after the tutorial, the game still doesn't let you really play to your liking.  It still tells you what you  can do next, which is only ever one option.  Basically, most of the game is click next to continue, and that button moves.  Then you get to battle, yay, then go back to click next to continue.  What's that? You wanted to buy more consumables to help you? Nah, you gotta buy a tank from another country now.  But I wanna upgrade my gun!  Tough, now sell that important thing you probably will need.  But I wanted that, here, let me buy one back from the shop...nah, time for battle!â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ that, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ this game.  If I wanted a comic about tanks/video games, I'da downloaded that."",0"

"7301,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""I didn't even get into the main game and already I was disgusted. The graphics were so bad in the tutorial that the treds were speghetti. The turret didn't move, just some jumbled garbage did. Whenever I aimed at the enemy, the whole thing lagged. When I piloted the tank, the response was so terrible that I couldn't reliably drive, already making me think it was a terrible tank game. Now, I was going to give this game the benefit of the doubt since my computer is so old. But then I got to the game and tried to change the graphic settings. THEY WERE AT MAX! How can a game like this be able to have such incomplete visuals for a THIRD PERSON SHOOTER! I know I should be more compationate since this game is very recent in being developed for a different platform, but it just isn't a good first impression.

(in beginning)but the devs have lost their way making profit higher priority than quality.if quality existed i would even support 8 years not once have i supported because they just keep thinking up ways to improve their wallet not quality of gamepay and ill give you the better rng rolls and match making (mm) a random battle starts set for 1 team to win and 1 to lose not a 50/50 chance at start 1 teams rng has been set to low rolls  in other words shots are set to miss bounce not to do damagesa random battle should always start 50/50 chance to win. the devs appear to be greedy and want more than their willing to give thumbs down after 8 years. the arty didnt need removed just needed the damages nerfed down thats it,instead they first ruin arty with manuverabilty issues and real SLOW reloads in real life it doesnt take me 30 secs to load a 75lbs bullet 15 tops myÃ¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥is on the line. the awards they have won.the people who gave out awards obviously did not and do not play the game and gave awards for broken game.. the devs need to go and just drive a bulldozer and get a real feel for how tracked vehicles work. the devs need to reread dictionary for definition of (Line of Sight) and while there, they need to re read the definition of GAME.using the radio listen for other tank in area was not used until latter half of beginning of tanks proximity spots need removed another skill stealer. cant properly flank when game cheats for enemy and spots you up even though not 1 enemy can see you.being spotted through big rocks trees and bushes is a joke not moving not firing and enemy can spot you but you cannot see whats spotted and attacking you people disapear right in front of you in open and your the 1 getting fired upon GAME has a lot of broken aspects especially for F2P players most paid players are children with their parents credit cards.i believe you need paid yes but not for purposely broken stuff."",0"
"7318,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""If you're playing on a toaster, i'll suggest this game, if have a half decent pc, get the actual thing.

BUT!! is this game bad or worse than World of Tanks (original)????? NO, I must say NO. And here is reason why.. *There are many things that World of Tanks Blitz is doing better. For example : Friendly fire off (so no idiots can kill you, because ''they-he donÂ´t like you'')Friendly colision is off (if your friend or just another player RAM you,you will not get damage)You donÂ´t have to buy modifications for tank (like turrets,cannons,better engine).There are no artillery tanks in the game. (I think it makes WOTB better in my oppinion).When you get on tier 3 MM can put you into match on A LOT, A LOT BETTER AND BIGGER MAPS WHERE YOU CAN USE BOTH STRATEGY AND ENVIROMENT.*MAP DESIGN: before tier 3 I was putting on not so well looking maps or interesting,but after tier 3 maps get bigger and a lot fun,interesting places and UNIQUE maps.*BAD THINGS/DISOPOINTMENTGraphics: I must say this: I played WOT =WOT is a lot better looking , hovever my PC ISâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥SOO...

"7324,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""The usual reason to play WoT Blitz is to speed up waiting - be it on the Porcelain Throne, on a bus or in a queue. Now I can add 'just for the heck of it (without using BlueStacks)' to my list.After 826 battles, I've unlocked:Chi-Nu, Japanese Tier 5 medium tank,AT-2, British Tier 5 tank destroyer,SU-85, Soviet Tier 5 tank destroyer,KV-1S, Soviet Tier 6 heavy tank,Leopard, German Tier 5 light tank.I was initially very impressed by others bouncing dozens of shots off the armor of the KV-1 and decided I must also have it. The Soviet heavy tree has been a boring grind for the most part though with the only exception of the T-46 (tier 3). The KVs are very slow and virtually blind. It's a lottery if you'll manage to position yourself for a few hard-hitting shots and absorbing a good amount of damage or you'll getâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥from behind by a Leopard within the first 2 minutes. The KV-1S was incredibly weak until I got the best gun for it (costing 20k experience), but even now it reloads so slow that a single miss can mean I'm more of a burden than a boon to my team.The British AT-2 is the closest you get to cheating in this game. In a battle where you're the highest tier and you manage to keep enemies off yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥and shooting at your front you'll quickly ruin the other team's game. It has 203 mm of frontal armor, which would be good at tier 7 (you're tier 5). You're going to sacrifice speed (it's really-really slow) and view range, so you kind of still depend on your team to scout baddies out for you, but this is probably the easiest tank to steal the show with by shrugging off thousands of points of damage and destroying most of the enemy team.The Soviet TD line has been pretty much okay all-around. SU-85 has a nice low profile for hiding behind rocks and hopefully making the enemy aim a bit too high and miss.German light tanks require skill. A masterful Leopard can punch much higher than it's weight, but it's also really easy to speed into a group of enemies and get killed within 30 seconds of the start of the battle. It's an okay tree to unlock, but nothing that exhilirating. German TDs are quite enjoyable, especially the Hetzer with it's small frame and very well angled armor plates for bouncing off shots even if you do get spotted.Surprisingly the Japanese tech line has been by far the most fun for me. I chose the light branch (Ha-Go, Ke-Ni, Ke-Ho) winning 62, 61 and 50 % of the battles respectively, being 'productive' in each battle. The tier 5 Chi-Nu is on the useless side starting out but also quite good when fully upgraded. What made the light Japanese tanks so fun was that I could reach any mountaintop, their small size (all stats being equal, a smaller tank is better) made almost any bush viable for total camoflague and guns with high maximum depression angles and fast reload times enabled me to keep shooting almost every second of the battle. Shooting opponents is the fun part of WoT Blitz and the Jap tanks offered lots and lots of this.I think it generally holds true that the higher level you play at, the more boring it gets. At Tier 6+ everyone's pretty much a veteran, knows all the sweet spots on the map and punishes any mistake you make harshly. Battles where you can kill 3-6 tanks on the enemy team via sniping cleverly are pretty much behind you by then. So I think it's fair to recommend playing multiple low level tanks instead of focusing hard on one.Why I generally like WoT Blitz:1) Best time killer app I know - kills lots of it without getting boring, difficult or whatever, effectively a time machine when waiting at the dentist's for example2) Very short match queues - I don't want to queue while I queue3) Progressing through tiers of tanks feels good4) At least for now, no-one cheats, almost no-one pays to win5) I get to learn tank names6) A lot less of a cl*sterf*ck than the original WoT for desktop"",1"

Its very unfair in that respect as PC players are at a extreme advatage. That held up very true. Most battles I could just rush behind or besides enemys and they would die quicly and be confused.  This game should have stayed on iOS and Android and not for PC. It works good there and should have never left.  Wargaming, like most other companies, is just here for cash grap and not listening to anyone in the community. People thought they would make World of Tanks be accessable from Steam but all they did is rerelease a mobile port that really sucks.

"7337,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""First, i want to say that like many reviews before me, i also have played World of Tanks PC for several years, and also have played WoT blitz in my mobile for a short time before i uninstalled it because my mobile is even worse than my PC (not to mention third-world country mobile connection...).When WoT: Blitz available on Steam, i am intrigued. I think 'hey, maybe its a nice side game to unwind after losing so many times in PC version'. So i installed it and played it again.Hoo boy, how Wargaming always find a way to annoys its player.Soon after installing i am automatically logged in with my Steam account, not given much chance to switch to my Wargaming account and forced to play tutorials, and forced again to play two mandatory random matches. IDK if i missed something, but i only managed to switch my account after finishing mandatory tutorials.The game itself.... well, graphic aside, its lite version of WoT. Nothing really new for PC WoT players. No Arty is a plus, match is faster, some gameplay mechanics are really simplified. In comparison, WoT PC version offer better graphic, more in-depth gameplay, more tanks, more nations, in price of inclusion of Artillery class (which you will learn to loathe).My Verdict?Old WoT players might want to skip this, or just play it on mobile/tablet, no point playing this on PC really. No artillery is the only plus side for WoT:Blitz for PC (and occasional promo vehicles).New player... well, why not. Its not resource hungry, its relatively simple, graphic is actually okay-ish, and i think it better to get used with Blitz first before playing original WoT."",1"

Alright, this game is about Tanks (obviously) and is highly recommended to people who are into tanks, or just like competitive games. I absolutely adore this game for numerous of reasons, one of them is how simple and great this game is. You just set your region, log in (through steam preferably), do the tutorial and after just enjoy the battles as you slowly progress and upgrade your tank. This game is really nice visually, and it ALSO supports really low Specs such as my laptop's! Here are the proper cons and pros to avoid confusion:Pros:-Really simple and fun-Supports nearly any system-Its settings allow you to run it on a potato-Good competitive gameCons:-Mostly the community, I've met a bit of ragers and children, but only a bit-A bit difficult to start with a weak tank compared to all the strong ones.That's basically all pros I could find.

Just a hint: If you play the PC version, and then play a few rounds in blitz the same way, you DOMINATE all competition. :)only ONE thing that really makes me mad is that they are starting to create more and more disadvantages to the people who dont pay any money on the game.

"7345,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""This is from davidecz of the WOTB forum.Hi there,i' m here to talk about the premium account.No doubt, with a premium account even if you lost a battle, you got enough credit to still on the race to buy a new tank, no doubt there is no lost, and way more XP.But my point here its to really compare closely the different in game with a premium account or not.The last few week with some good friend we make several test, and we can tell that with a premium a count, your tank, any of your tank its way better in the battle field. Strong, powerful, not easy for the ennemy with no premium to take your down.In the other hand with no premium account you are the weak of the game. Like i say with some friend we make several test, shooting each other.At first, i got my premium account. I have a IS8 upgraded best gun, so my friend got the same. We was making the test shoting each other with the same aim. He cost 9 shots to him before he take my tank down ( he was not on premium account). He take for me 3 shots to take him down! HUGE difference! Then the next day it was my turn with no premium account, and this time my tank was down with 3 shots! And he cost me the same 9 to take him down ( he was on premium account.I can understand that with a premium account you got more credit and more XP, but i really not agree with the difference in the battefield. Premium or not, we should have the same chance. This is not fair at all. I like the game, but not fair between premium account and no premium.Premium or not, tank should be the same.I'm prety sure that some people will answer my post saying that they are not agree, and everybody have right to say what they think, but first saying anything, please grab your friend, and make the test like we do and you'll see.World of tanks its a good game, but should be fair with everyone and not only with who pay premium!"",0"
"7346,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""DISCLAIMER: Just because the hugeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥thumb above points up, doesn't mean I fully endorse this game.I've played World of Tanks, World of Warplanes, World of Warships and World of Tanks Blitz, and WoT is my favorite out of them all. A cool, fast paced game. Great for a quick arcade-style game of action. This coming from a dedicated War Thunder player. Though WoT may not be the mose realistic game, it is definetley very fun. No, War Thunder isn't all that realistic either, but it has a more relistic feel to it. While most people don't consider HP bars and health points realistic, it gives WoT predictable gameplay. I stopped playing WoT after a few months, as I play the majority of my games on a crappy toaster, so it could barley run even the most simple games. About a year after, War Gaming came out with World of Tanks Blitz. At this time, War Gaming had a fairly bad reputation because of War Thunder. I decided to try it out. It was awesome. WG kept pumping out interesting and stable updates, keeping the game alive. Although it had the extreme P2P feel and grind, it was still loads of fun. I still play WoTB mobile today, and the release of WoTB on Steam was pretty cool. While Steam isn't the ideal place to put a MOBILE BASED game on, it did prove quite good. I expected my """"toaster"""" to not be able to run it even on minimum graphics, but it proved very smooth and playable. After all, they probably just did a copy/paste of the game engine from a phone to a PC. Though I did find a few flaws: frame rates may be good, but it is very unstable. Controls have not fully adapted from mobile to PC. Mouse sensitivity is very sluggish, even when bringing it up. if you are familiar with mouse acceleration, this is exactly the problem. For those who don't know, mouse acceleration is the speed at which your cursor moves dependent on how fast you physically move your mouse. For example, if you physically move use slowly, the cursor will move slowly, and if you move your mouse fast, your cursor will move fast. And for a fast-paced game like WoTB, where multiple swipes/movements are required to keep up with your aim, this makes aiming very hard as it is very slow and unpredictable.Another problame I found was when launching the game. The game hasn't been out on Steam long so there are bound to be bugs, specifically game launch bugs. Every time I launch the game via Steam, it says it needs to do the """"First Time Launch"""" stuff with the """"Windows bla bla bla step 1 4908134"""" or some crazy thing like that. (It's really just 3 steps) It took the game over half an hour to complete 2 steps and took another 20 mins to finish and launch the game. This does this every time. I was actually waiting for the game to load and decided to write this longâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥review. It almost an hour for it to boot up for the second time.

The very things that they complain about and term """"pay to win"""" are accessible to everyone from the very beginning of the game, provided you allocate your earnings correctly and understand how the game works. The learning curve is quite steep, so this is probably the reason for many quitting and terming this a P2W"

"7351,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""I've Played somewhere around 2.000 battles in - ( May just call it the original WoT ) and I can't say I'm too disapointed with this one... The system requirements are really low and the casual way the battles play out seems pretty suitable for just """"a quick game"""" maybe before school / work.  There could of course be more vehicles and maps in the game, but I would say it still makes a decent """"little brother"""" of the original WoT.  Now despite what the hardware requirements say, the game ran pretty much flawlessly on a 1.80Ghz single core cpu, 3GB of RAM and a 1GB graphics card, getting 58-60 FPS almost the whole time using the highest preset and no AA.  And to people talking about some """"horrendous paywalls"""".. you can actually claim a premium account for a couple of days for FREE. I currently have an IS (tier VII), a Matilda (IV) and an SU-85B (tier IV) and a couple of lower tier tanks that don't really matter and I've played 70 hours so far, where in the original WoT you would probably be still stuck at some tier 3-4 without a premium account. Also you don't lose credits by playing the heavy tanks as in WoT i actually wasn't able to pay for the repair + ammo resupply costs thus resulting in having to sell my IS and go back to low tier tanks just to be able to still play the game. Of course you could just pay some real money to get back into the game, but that sort of becomes a damn """"Pay2Play"""", which is not suppossed to be happening in a free game.  Now you would be right saying that I was probably an avarege or even bellow averege player, but I had decent performance in every battle butI always gained around 2-10k credits for a win and lost around 20-30k for a battle that you lost - now mind that I wasn't using nothing but a gun rammer to reduce the loading time to I think somewhere decent. And that obviously isn't going to result in any huge profit in a longrun.I would recommend you playing the original WoT though, Its better in many ways for players that are actually into the game and want to improve."",1"

"7360,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""I'm a WWII nerd so obvs I like this game, esp the WWII era of the tanks, you can some what learn some history if you do your research etc etc on the tanks, the way it was made, the reason why it was made etc, anyway personally blitz is much better vs World of Tanks (the normal one or whatever tf you wanna call it). Blitz is a much faster pace, with less players on each side and a much smaller map. Along with that theres no ARTYS aka """"artillery"""" which is blessed bc artillery is annoying. Playing this game over the years on both the pc and mobile version not too big of a difference of movement, I guess thats the term idk, anyway cross platform of both pc and mobile version no big difference. Whatever your better at controlling either holding a tablet or ipad, or just keyboard, personally keyboard a bit annoying simply bc sometimes harder to move left hand away from wasd while trying to shoot the enemy tank while trying to dodge, so you kinda panic ish but whatever. Just depends your play style. No big issues with the game, lots of updates frequently not very bad, from time to time there are events or speical missions pretty cool tbh. Currently most annoying thing has to be """"afk"""" ppl, some I will say are afk others are not an afk issue, simply bc sometimes not often but maybe every so month you start a game, you load and don't load in until maybe 30 to 40 seconds after the game has started, pretty annoying. Second most annoying thing is when ppl say """"oh your a pay to win"""" buddy stfu honestly you literally have a tank that cost money too....... even than whats worst is they run into open dies within the 1 min of when the game starts than blames on the team saying yall """"camping"""". Personally I think once you start out playing this game, is kinda meh or boring etc, feels """"grindy"""" bc you need to get certain amount of xp to research something new than go to next tier etc etc. Tier 8 in my opinon has the most action all type of skill level, you have players that are new if they bought a tier 8 premuim tank (not really pay to win, bc each and every tank has a advantage/disadvantage against any other tank, along with that it depends on how you play and how your team is). For example, some players with heavy tank (Powerful gun, strong armor, but slow speed), some players will literally sit in the back of the map -___- not saying you can't, but you really can't win the round if your gonna sit in the back and let your light tanks, medium tanks, or tank destroyer die, now not all are like that, some are very skilled, they're able to read on what they should do, shouldn't do against another tank, others *sigh* they yolo it as in push 4 tanks and die right in the open while shooting once and probably never hitting anyone or pen against them.Obvsly you start off with low tier tanks when you start the game, but theres a reason, to teach you oh how the game will be etc, you have many nations that you can pick (USA, USSR, FRENCH, GERMAN, CHINA, JAPAN, or BRITISH tanks) each one of those has there own special """"perk or skill"""" For example German tanks, very heavy armor with strong armor, same with the soviet tanks, the french however are less armored, BUT they have a """"mag shell or autoloader"""" as in they reload maybe 17-20 seconds depending what tank, but they have the ability to move fast pace and shoot total of 3 shells in less than 5 seconds, as in lets say the AMX 50 100. You have 4 shells total in a mag, it takes 17? idk something around that seconds, but you can shoot 4 shells, you shoot once, than it takes 3.3 second to reload the next one and so on, until you shot all 4 than it reloads again with the full 17 seconds. Very overpower in its own way, if you have the timing, but can be annoying bad in times as in close combat or 1 v 2 just depends. Now the British tanks, very good, but they have one of the most if not most of all the tanks fires less than 7 to 9 seconds. Which as you get to higher tier it gets annoying and you'd want to take the british tanks out first simply bc their gonna keep nailing you before you can even reload the next shot. However some tanks like the Americans and Japanese tanks, you wont really see much of Japense tanks simply bc they kinda suck, however for American tanks you wont really see any tier 6 or 7 tanks, I hardly ever see any, simply bc every tank for any of the nation beats it. *COUGH COUGH* fix T20 bc its useless, but leads to the M48 Patton which is very good, not only that looks good too. Other than those tanks, you'll see a few tanks which don't look WWII era or """"stupid tanks"""" However its nice to see different tanks instead of going against the same old tanks. Overall for customization, does not look bad, very different from the other World of Tanks, less things to add, but here the camos don't look as bad, they help you in the game, along with that I really look forward when they can create attachments for each tanks, like IS3, IS6 all the attachments looks sick, the American Eagle looks great on some of the American tanks, but position very odd. Kinda sucks that all Tier 10 tanks have their own Legendary Skin and attachment. If wargaming can make it so the customization is same for both platforms on blitz and the normal orginal one, it'd be blessed.Somethings to note about this game, there is rank, however not many ppl play it or atleast it takes awhile for me to get into a rank game. Theres 2 modes, team deathmatch and supremacy mode (capture the flag, theres 3 or 4 depending on the map first to 1k points or to knock out the other tanks win). Graphics aren't too bad, looks the same from my eyes on pc to mobile, sadly on pc version you only get to 60 fps max. Bit annoying at times when fps drops but whatever. Another thing, you won't be placed in a match in different regions, never had that happen, never really had bad ping unless you play mobile without wifi aka not at home or idfk aslong as you play with wifi done you have good connection. Replay is nice, you can sometimes learn from mistakes on what you did etc etc, by rewatching the matches that you played. PS it is not a """"Pay to win game"""" I haven't paid a single dollar to get from a tank to another tank in a tech tree, I only pay for the tanks that I really want aka lets say the scorpion, is a new tank that came out a couple of days, I had a dollar XD, was so stupid litterally just click and BAM got it with 1%, ppl get salty bc you get it and they couldn't but whatever. Anyway as I was saying only time you would pay is for getting more garage slots if you really want to keep every tank that you have gotten, PS you wouldn't really keep every tank, theres no point, just some tanks you play you will hate and once you get enough xp for the other, you instantly sell it XD. It just takes time to get enough xp for the next tank, not only that you need enough credits to buy it and have enough to resupply ammo, camo, gears etc many factors go in it. <---- also why people buy premium tanks is bc it gives good credits so that way you can """"grind"""" faster. But you don't have to buy it you have a 1% chance from a crate idk off top of my head but free crates every so day, week, so you have a chance."",1"

I have seen some folks mention in their review to skip this and get the full WoT game from their website (also free) but I would say skip both and go for War Thunder. I started playing that game in 2012-2013 and I never played tanks until recently and it took a while to get used to / into it (coming from planes) but now it feels much better and more natural than this game.

Please for the love of god tell the company they are dying quicker than pokemon Go. This game was intended for people over 18, and oh boy. their feelings get hurt so easily they boast about reporting anyone like checkmate kid, I win by proving you suck and need to uninstall.

"7365,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""World of Tanks Blitz is a mobile free-to-play team-based MMO action game dedicated to fierce tank combat. Available both on smartphones and tablets, the game puts a mobile twist on traditional dynamic online tank combat.The game looks pretty nice with graphics, and doesnâ€™t really requires a high-end PC unlike War Thuder, making it a perfect option for players with worse PCâ€™s.The only problem with the game is that itâ€™s tank mechanics arenâ€™t super realistic, doesnâ€™t even makes sense sometimes. The first drawback is that the tanks have HP bars, and to destory a tank, you need to first drain all their HP, the case is that, sometimes it will be frustrating, as sometimes a tank with super low HP will kill you, but in reality that tank would probably stop working after taking many hits. The other unrealistic mechanic is the enemy spotting mechanic, now when you are driving around when you get closer to an enemy, you will instantly be notified, and will see which tank the enemy is, their HP and pretty much everything else. This pretty much ruins the ability of ambushing, or hiding, you will sometimes also face an frustrating problem when you have spotted an enemy that is far away and when they move slightly back then you will not see the enemy. Besides that the game being free-to-play it has a lot of in-game purchases, itâ€™s not really a pay-to-win game as with cash you can only get better tanks and a better crew, although when you get a better tank you get matched against other users with better tanks. The game also sometimes holds events but free users canâ€™t grab anything from, you need to pay if you actually want something from it.So in conclusion, I just didnâ€™t liked it, Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s bad, it's just not too enjoyable"",0"

"7377,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""This is a fun game. Can be a little unbalanced at times, and sometimes you get stuck with a derp team. But it is fast paced, within only a day of game time I've already reached the point where you actually have to grind a little to earn the next tier tank. I think this game has alot of potential.Edit: After a few Days of """"Grinding"""" I think its only fair to update my review.First off, the teams are rarely useful, Tier IV tanks are also rarely useful. I cant tell you how many matches I've played where everyone just up and leaves you to fend for yourself, which only dooms your team. And dont even get me started on the HUGE gap between Tier IV and Tier V tanks. at leas in Tier I - IV you can damage the enemy, I've played the German, Japanese, and American Skill tree (working on the Russians now) and I can tell you Tier V's are way too over Armored, even using Premium Ammo I only damage them maybe 1 out of ever 6 shots. and its never enough to actually contribute.Grinding in this game to get from Tier IV to Tier V means you join as many battles as you can and Watch your win ration slowly go down. Earning a mear 150 to 200 xp per match until you have the staggering 15k xp it takes to research a Tier V.... With all that said, Tier I - III is super fun and usually fairly balanced.

There aren't, to my knowledge, extraneous skill mods like XVM so it's less competitive and you are able to relax more. I was given 1300 gold and 4 days of premium just for starting the game which is a huge boost and makes it easier to play and learn. This game is relaxing compared to WoT and I don't have as much commitment or salt as a result (so it's quite fun to play).7 v 7 tank combat, unlike any fps around. Tanks have varying levels of penetration, damage, and armor (as well as many more nuances) that change how they are supposed to fight. You need to either kill all 7 enemies or cap their base to win the battle. Battles last on average about 5 minutes, but it could be more or less depending on your team and if people try to camp/hide. There are over 400 tanks in the actual World of Tanks, and Blitz has a couple hundred as well (I'm not sure how varied it is, but there are some differences).

Almost every battle doesn't even last 2-3 minutes and it's not only low tier thing. Also, having no arty isn't a good thing but I know, it would be too hard to pull on mobile game. There is no trace of tactics left.I really wanted to play it for much longer but sadly I won't. I don't really understand the reason why mobile port makes it on Steam, not the normal version.

In its earlier iterations, it was more akin to WOT-lite, whereas now although still retaining the main components of WOT has changed it's feeling. 1.NOT EVERYTHING IS BADThough I am still just quite the casual gamer, I do find enjoyment when I can find those random matches with others and have a bang up time because teamwork is awesome. Being able from time to time unlock premium tanks is a plus. IE Tankenstein and now the GuP """"Kuro Mori Mine, Panzer Anko SP., and the Hetzer"""" is quite nice.2.GAMEPLAYDoesn't last all too long and is often quite enjoyable, it's called BLITZ for a reason. Adding new lines slowly and fleshing out old ones is always appreciated. Though there is a disparity in ability for PC vs Mobile since its expansion as PC users can more easily maneuver and aim than when compared to mobile touch controls. The implemented non crossplatform option works as advertised though it does limit the pool of players thus I find that I use my PC as opposed to my iPad.FINAL THOUGHTS ( June 10, 2017)-Thouroughly enjoyable for all players looking for tank on tank action though some mechanics are far from perfect-MOST content unlockable without having to pay, though it is a struggle especially with some glaring """"money grabs"""" though it is a company providing entertainment has to make its revenue somewhere-Sweet visuals and asthetics as both the vehicles and environment are pleasing to the eye-Events that keep one coming back for more as well as implemented clan/training rooms"",1"

Nameless is a nice anime heavy tank-rather cartoonish graphics compared to the pc version. this means that the graphics are polished off to give the game a lighter feeling and weight, it's nice for a phone game, let alone seeing it in 1080p, but compared to wot pc's ultra or even war thunder's high it's far behind.I'll give this 7.5/10 based by how light and little the game is, this game could run on potatoes, have somewhat similar gameplay to the actual pc version, and is not bad on the graphcs side. however the significantly less number of tanks and nations means you have less choice on tanks "",1"

The entire game is based around premium features such as premium ammo/premium consumables and buying your way to the top. Converting free money to premium ammo is non-sustainable even if you do win with top-gun and 10 other medals and starting off with free crew is just asking to be farmed for 100 games because 50% crews are so blind that they can't even see a tank in front of them even if they are 100 meters in front of you in plain-sight and no camo bonus.When you do get to the top, you will eventually realize that the only reason you put so much effort into this tiering-up is because you wanted to play a game where players have a even advantage but you end up realizing that high-tier games is exclusively for wallet warriors."",0"

You can even buy a new turret, nothing changes with your gun, and you still need to buy ammo.A small issue, but ends up literally frustrating the living hell out of me.

Come on develop some real battlefield maps these tanks actually fought on not these 3rd rate maps you have now.

I do understand that this is a BETA game, and I may change my review if the following changes:- More detailed maps--->better graphics (I don't mention on improving graphics in many reviews, because I get the target auidence that the company is trying to fullfill, but I believe the target auidence for this game are for those who want immersion and a better graphical experince. I understand that this is a free to play game, but on that same note, """"World of Tanks"""" is also free to play with much better graphics.- Better physics--->I'm not sure what is off with the physics, but I do detect something is dull about it.

Please don't make the mistake of getting this and spending alllll of your money for a horrible game."",0"

"7432,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""Was bored through the entire forced tutorial, only to be matched with only people with the exact same tier tank as mine, which means progression means nothing, your competition will always be just as strong.

"7433,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""Kinda fun until you reach the level where everyone else has either bought the better tanks (pay to win) or is somehow cheating (hard to tell which, can't be bothered to find out). Couple that with being placed on teams where half the players are either AFK or just there to drive into walls, and it's a recipe for frustration."",0"
"7434,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""It is pretty ok for a phone game,but you can see the controls were made for phone.I recommend playing this but only after you played the regular World of Tanks for a bit,to understand the mechanics."",1"
7435,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,Most people are gonna get mad about the armour and the way the bullets work but I played the original world of tanks and this although its a little different in things such as map size its still fun to play in world of tanks the original version alot of battles could be dragged out so all im saying is dont judge it until you play it.,1
"7436,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""So ive had World of Tanks Blitz on pc for about a year now,and in my opionion its one of the best free games out there!

"7437,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""So, this game has really nice graphics, a decently fun gameplay, and neat things to earn, but I've discovered that it's giving me about a tenth of what I've earned in gameplay. Whether this is a poor tutorial (which I think exsists anyway), or they're actually cheating me out of my time, it was the last straw in my opinion of the game, and coming before it were shots hitting me about an in-game yard away from me, as well as not being able to hit another player with my barrel literally inside of them. I would not reccomend this game, especially to people who get frusterated easily."",0"
"7438,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,"" Not much different from the actual PC WoT, just that there are no artilleries and interfaces and some others are made simpler. No Artilleries... If you don't like them, this will not frustrate you (I personally don't mind). Maybe one possible problem is the # of people in queue.... The matching is not as fast as PC WoT, or maybe it's simply because of time range when I play this game :)"",1"
"7439,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""I edited this.

"7440,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""Is fun at first, but the poorly made physics engine and crappy graphics honestly ruin it. It is very much a pay-to-win game, as many steam games are, but this is too extreme, any player that hasn't spent more than Â£50 is practically instantly destroyed, and is almost impossible to go up in without spending some cash. Would not recommend, sorry."",0"
"7441,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""If you have played battlefield, this game is just like the tank system put into a single game. Plus all of these god damn tank upgrades and micro transactions.

7442,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,Feel like im cheating using the steam vers of this game so im going to play this how it is ment to be played. and that is by smartphone. those who play blitz on steam and the windows 10 vers are just making a poor excuse by playing this version against people who are at a severe handicap. i say remove this from steam and get rid of the pc user base off the mobile vers all together! there is a pc version of this game and it is ment to be played on pc not this.the only reason for this to be on here is to encurage the pay to win aspect that is not present in the pc version and increase their profit gains not bad for them i agree and i understand why they do these things but its not right to mix mobile with a pc user base hince my digusting 63% win rate at almost 2000 games on this new account alone and a 53% winrate on mobile.,0
"7443,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""If you like the origional PC WoT but don't like arty and want smaller maps with less players and a somewhat more fair matchmaking experience along with servers called training rooms (kinda like server browsing), this is the game for you. 10/10Would chill in chill room again."",1"
"7444,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""What the hell guys? I thought you guys wanted World of tanks without arty & here you are complaining. Why? Cause it's not what we wanted since it's the wrong one! Hey you guys do know that WoT PC. Big Wot(The one on Worldoftanks.com) not Baby WoT(Blitz)is a huuuugeee file. Like 40GB's i think. Maybe? I dunno & i don't care all i know is that it's a good game. I'm not looking at this like """"Oh for shame on you WG.. We wanted WoT on steam.. & this is how you pay us? With WoT Blitz? UNACCEPTABLE!"""" If your like that. Fine! Go play World of tanks. But WORLD OF TANKS BLITZ is DIFFERENT!! They both do great at what they want to portait here. WoT(big WoT) is great at realism while WoTB(Baby WoT) is good for those who have a terrible computer & still want the World of Tanks expirience. In my opinion they are both different games, you cant say that one is worse that the other cause one of them is originaly a mobile game. AND dont say that WoT(Big WoT) is a saint. Cause your wrong. They both have thier flaws, & thier stengths. But they also have different audiences. WoTB is for people who dont like the console version but yet still wants a competitive yet fair playing field in a quick matter. While WoT(The one that EVERYBODY is saying that you should go DL instead) is for those who want to play a game that is a bit more detailed & historicaly driven but pretty is much the same. imo. I mean c'mon your still shooting enemy tanks & if you do damage credits & XP come out."",1"
"7445,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""For a free game, world of tanks is a lot of fun. No transactions are really required and there isn't a paywall to prevent those who didn't pay anything from being competitive. Occasionally, competition can be annoying when your team doesn't really care or one of the players on your team go MIA on you. There is also a lot of grinding after a certain tier which can be frustrating when you've had a long lose streaks. If you don't like ginding by yourself the best way to play this game is to drag in a few friends with you. The moment I started learning from my mistakes and started grinding with friends, my gameplay got a lot better and I started enjoying myself more. Great game for its price!"",1"
"7446,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""I don't understand why people dislike this game. I know this is not World of Tanks, but a pocket/mobile version of it, hence the name World of Tanks Blitz. I've been enjoying the game. If you want to enjoy the game think about it as a fast-paced game."",1"
"7447,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""Controls are floaty, graphics are bad, maps are tiny, tank balance is a complete mess. Overall just a worse version of PC wot in every single way except the absence of artillery, which is the only plus."",0"

7449,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,Just like mobile but alot sexier( because of very good processor) and alot easier to work then on mobile. One problem though is there is no way of leaving the game when inside the game. So just know how to force quit the game if you planning on jumping in. (also if you have good internet you can get your ping up to 100 since your on computer. For me anyways),1
"7450,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""Alright. So here is a list of things that make the game horrible.-The community is full of cringy 9 year olds, who will scream at you if they die or make a mistake, as well as blame the team lossing on you, when they were the one who messed up.-3.8.

"7455,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,"" Note: i have played about 14000 games of blitz and 5000 games of pc wot, so my steam hours are by far not everything.This game is just like real life: it requires a lot of skill but is mostly based on luck. The grinding possibilities are almost endless! Also you will never have to go to the shop to buy salt again. Brought to you by wargayming. To be serious though, it is a fun game but there are a lot of annoying aspects to it, would get 6/10 from me."",1"
7456,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,well it's still bias garbage and teams still suck so nothing has really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing changed including the annoying RP rate so i feel like i'm playing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing warthunder because only russian tanks do the most damage and recieve the least ammount of damage CONVENIENTLY.,0
"7457,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""I downloaded this on the second BETA run.My son and I thoroughly enjoy playing this. One of the features I most appreciate is that I can play it on my Tablet PC or iPhone. However I must say my hat goes off to anyone who has mastered playing this on their phone.I also appreciate the fact that the developers have made this available for free and that you can easily play, win and progress without paying $$$ to play. Since I don't believe anything should be free and we enjoy playing this so much, I have happily spent my hard earned cash in the game which enables you to enjoy more tanks and faster experience.I'm sure many die-hard WOT fans will consider this trivial in comparison to the full game but for those of us who like to pop-in and out for a quick distration now and then it's a perfect format.We enjoy playing this game so much we started our own Clan MAYHM"

7460,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,why this game better than PC version ?1. Good Matchmaking(tier 1 not facing tier 4 max tier 2)2. No arty3.

"7461,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""This is kind of a long review i have some stuff to say about this game.This game could be so much better if the game was not pay to win, Its fun at first with tier 1 and 2 but when you start getting into higher levels, you start meeting more and more players who have spent money on the game, witch is not a bad thing to do, You know game devs need money right xD But unfortunately people are spending money for all the wrong reasons like:    ( premium consumables, ammo and even tanks ) This makes the game unbalanced and a pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥to play xD If they removed all pay to win mechanicsAnd added cosmetic items that do not change gameplay like:   (Tank skins) I think it would be a better gaming experienceand alot more fun to play. I also think match making needs alot of work. As joining a match and finding out the other team as 5 premium tanks its just a night mare.and theres alo.....  oh who even cares the game devs are not going to listen, Its there business model, Its not a good one but Its how they make money. So i would just give it a miss if you dont like pay to win mechanics in video games.  "",0"

"7463,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""Do not confuse this game with World of Tanks.... This game is a knock-off.... To find the original game you need to go to https://worldoftanks.com/ Both games play about the same. They are PVP.... They ARE BOTH PAY TO WIN :(...The original game has much better graphics. Both games are basically a set of maps with Tank Battles of 15 PVP 15, unless you set up private battles, are training, or setting up your tank for a battle. That's it tank battles and pay cash for equipment.The argument that you can play without paying is a lie. Well, only if you want to preview the game, but you can't realistically compete, without paying cash.... The grind is so ridiculously slow without dumping real world cash into it, you will ether give up or buy gold."",0"
7464,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,just amazing needs more tanks like the actual one thats why i always wait for more updates hopefully it is still diffrent from the console versions / bigger versionsperfect for smaller running laptops or perfect for handheld devise (i have it on my tablet with same account and tanks so it nice that it can be transfured from multiple devices),1
"7465,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""I like the pace of this game, it is quite slow and you have to play for quite a long time to get used to the controls and gameplay. The graphics are fantastic in this game, even though i set the graphics to medium. There will of  course be some in game purchases when playing the game. I had so far played for 12 hours of the game and i had quite some fun with it. Overall a good game to get if you are into stradegy games."",1"

"7467,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""I prefer this game a lot over the actual World Tanks for a few reasons:1. Games are more appropriately timed (Not twenty minutes in the PC version, this usually lasts five minutes)2. Community isn't toxic3. Easier to progress4. There aren't so many good players like in the original version, so you actually have a chance to learn how to play well in this5. Matches are actually fairly created in this where in the original if you're at the bottom, you're probably screwed. This game gives you a guaranteed fighting chance."",1"
"7468,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Hell yes! Controlwise and other stuff, it's fantastic, if you're here for graphics, hard luck. If you're aiming at an enemy, but need to turn your tank in sniper mode, the turret stays fixed at that position, not following the body, which is excessively helpful. The gameplay is amazing, maps are smaller and game times are smaller than the original world of tanks, but this is really fun because it gives you an average of 500xp per 6 minute match, I really enjoy these matches as the queue time is nearly none. (0-2 seonds).What I like the most is the fact that it's easier to communicate and there is only two gamemodes. So I say a big, big big big big big big big big big big big biig BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGG yes to this thing"",1"
7469,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,i like it so far mainly because it can run on my current potato of a computer.Edit: this is too pay to win to be good but it's play able on â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ laptops so atlest you got something to play.,1
"7470,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""i like the WOT blitz more than the WoT PC ... reasons??? i just hate arty's , and in WoT blitz u the game is fast and only 7v7 so my medium tanks game of play style suits really in here :) and now i up to 60% victory in wot blitz unlike my 46% in wot pc .."",1"
"7471,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""WoT blitz is a great game and is the only succesful tank war game out there on steam or iOS platforms. the game has very good diversity like france, Soviet union, UK, Germany, USA, and Japan tanks. it includes light tanks, tank destroyers, mediums, and heavies throughout the game. the game takes awhile to beat and gets progressively more difficult as you progress through the """"levels"""".something people would look for is gameplay with friends. if you love tanks but want to battle other people with tanks, WoT is your game. it offers platooning which is basically you teaming with your pal or family member to fight other people in this battling multiplayer.this game also offers many iconic tanks many people would recognize like the M4 sherman and it's variants, the IS-3 and it's variants, and many other ineteresting prototypes that most people don't know about. i would very much agree to play this game also because it has little violence meaning if younger people want to play this game parents, i would let them.another thing to consider is graphics and compatiability. weak and old computers/devices can play this too. and if you have a gaming PC it offers HD graphics and sound. They also have training rooms fr you to explore, train, or do other stuff on the game just in case you get tired of battling. i would definetley reccomend thuis game"",1"
7472,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,It is a pay to win game Uneven match making putting tanks that have no uses on teams that cant hurt the other side where machine guns kill you faster than and 7.5 cm shell.it is a money sink cant sell you old tanks trying to force to too buy new slots .,0
"7473,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""World of Tanks Blitz is largely the same as World of Tanks, which can be counted as a older brother to Blitz. Gameplay wise is quite similar with the older patch of World of Tanks physics, gun shoot sounds, armour profiles and etc. Both of them are F2P and grinding the top Tier 10 tank without any premium tanks or premium account is possible as long as one plays smart and saves credits.Compared to Warthunder, Blitz falls on the arcade type of game which is much easier to play and master than Warthunder due to the more smaller learning curve, although Warthunder gives a higher sense of pleasure after you have fully mastered it.The rather major difference compared to World of Tanks is the lousier graphics which means a better frame rate for slower computers. Also, one will note that unlike World of Tanks, Blitz does not have artillery or Self-Propelled Guns because of its smaller map size, faster gameplay and shorter match time which makes implementing arty impossible. Then people will ask: Will the developers implement artillery into the game next time? The answer is No, unless they make special matches with longer match times and bigger maps which I think is not going to happen. Another point to note is that its faster gameplay makes tanks with a certain amount of mobility play more aggressively and become able to keep up with the pace of the battles much easier.Overall, if you are looking for a quick multiplayer tank game that is easier to play than World of Tanks, then Blitz is great for you. If you are a hardcore fan of tanks and would want to try something much harder, then Warthunder(intermediate skill and F2P), Steel Armour: Blaze of War(high detail and big learning curve, same for the other two listed) along with Steel Beasts and Steel Fury: Kharkov 1942 are good games to try with thier higher realism.Here are some tips for people who are starting in Blitz.1. Take a look at the tech tree and see which top Tier tank is appealing to you. Then plan which tank line you would want to take towards that Tier 10 tank. Note that some top Tier tanks have only one tank line to choose.2. After that, I would recommend people grinding the Russian medium tank line because they are rather easy and fun to play with. Or you can choose a tank line which has tanks with good enough mobility like the IS heavy tank line. You can also choose not to grind any Russian tank if you prefer sniping(Germany) or would rather be a jack of all trades(US). It is the best to avoid the British tank line because they are one of the hardest tanks to play in my opinion.3. Dont use premium ammunition(as in ammo that can be bought for credits but in a very large amount of credits compared to your standard ammo either because they have higher penetration against armour or deals more damage against enemy tanks) unnecessarily but only use it when you cannot penetrate the enemy tank with standard ammo and etc. Also, dont buy provisons and camouflage for a tank you are using it to grind a hefty amount of credits as the result would most likely be a loss of credits or only a few hundred plus credits even if you had a great battle.4. Lastly, have fun and dont get angry about a match. If ever in a bad mood, take a break and play again later. This can help you concentrate and perform better in battle.5. Dont forget to learn techniques to use your tank more effeciently. You can find that out with the forums or youtube videos. World of Tanks forums and videos also applies to Blitz."",1"
"7474,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""Well, I honestly think this game is really cool. I have a 57.95% WR. I have made great friends on here too. The game if extremely good. But there are downsides. Of course like any other online game there are rude and mean people, especially in this game (They are mostly people who are good at the game like unicums or whatever), so it usually gets me mad when I have to deal with stuff like that. Plus, it's kind of  -Pay to win- type game (Which I know it is common in most online games) but it is crazy here. They make events for premium tanks so hard that you WILL need gold to get through it unless you invest hella time and if you are good at the game. Besides this, the game is cool. I would recommend if you are willing to invest time in it and you like fun. But I don't recommend if you get mad easily, or if you you are impatient"",1"
"7475,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""I'll make this simple and give you a few pros and cons then my general opinion.Pros:It is World of Tanks on a smaller scale, making performance on some tanks much better than the original game.Seperation of tiers is nowhere near as bad as in WoT PC, if you've played WoT on PC you'll know that you can play tanks two tiers above you, that doesn't exist in here.Good graphics for a Mobile game which makes it playable on low end laptops. (I use to play WoT on PC but recently the graphics were causing my laptop to overheat)Cons:Same ol' Wargaming paywall, some premium tanks are a bit overpowered (Such as the BT-SV) and the Blitz Biathalon is a load of BS. I almost made it through Spring Maneuvers if not for not owning a Tier V tank and it was okay, but the Biathalon features a special currency that can only be earned once. I failed to earn enough of it and can no longer play the event unless I pay gold.While the uptiered problem is less in this game, it still exists and some tanks are underpowered when they play higher tiers.The problem of HAVING to play the next tank is very prevalent, as compared to War Thunder where any vehicle can be researched by any vehicle of the same nation, and the garage slots is annoying especially with the more expensive Tier V+ vehicles.Consesus: While I can complain about WoTB all day, I still enjoy it. I'm pretty good in certain tanks and the game runs well on my laptop. If you suck at the full PC game, I suggest trying this, it is easier and quicker than the other game, not to mention the graphics are easier on laptops. The biggest fault is that Wargaming accounts do not transfer over, which means you have to set up a new account and cannot have the tanks you have in the full game. I would definitely want to see this game expanded and have other nations added (I.E. Czechloslovakia), but would love to see Wargamaing fix some of their major problems.8/10 pretty good but not without major fault."",1"
"7476,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""This game really isnt that great.Its too much build on team effort and a bad team means losing all the time it doesnt matter how good you are, it does not matter if your trying to communicate with your team, most players have no insight in the game and that causes a lot of frustrations. Also this game is more build on money gives you more power and thats also quite bad. Specially if you look at the prices of the bundles."",0"
"7477,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""It's fun, competitive, and a constantly evolving game. Not at all pay to win though there are some in app purchases available. 1 issue is the toxic playerbase, but there are settings available to minimize that if you so desire.Love the game won't stop playing it until they shut the servers down."",1"
"7478,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""if you're on steam, you have a computer, if you have a computer and want tanks get world of tanks, or war thunder, this game is nothing but a waste of time with cash â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ as its developers"",0"
"7479,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""Been playing since 2015 [mobile device then] with over 13 K battles. Still is a good game.Simple to learn, hard to truely master. Balancing? Some would complain, yet War is never fair. Gameplay is enjoyable to an extent with multiple maps and tanks. Grinding could take time however, events could be dislikeable to some. A number of toxic players now and then and pricy tanks. Most battles are different. Sadly, depending on the person, sometimes it's frustrating like RNG. Not much else to complain. Blitz is a fast paced game.When it first came out in 2014, originally was mobile. Take note however, this could be outshined by the PC and Console versions in graphics, game, content, and that sort of stuff, so you could have that, if your PC can handle, it's less demanding.

"7486,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""its a decent game that receives a lot of criticism because of its """"paid to win"""" approach. What more can you expect from a free to play game? War Gaming is  a business, you need to remember that, their aim is to make a profit for themselves so that they can live their personal lives and expand the game further. People buying god packs or premium tanks pay so that they can enjoy their good tanks, of course War Gaming needs to give those said tanks a slight advantage over other normal tanks. DUH!!! However, if you think about it, most premium vehicles have pretty serious issues and if you are smart, you would find ways to counter them.KV-5: its slow with good frontal armour, flank around and hit is from sides or rear. If you are a heavy, hit its obvious and big machine gun post.Su-100Y: big tank with little camoflaughe capabilities, its armour is pretty weak as well, it has a big gun, thats all.IS-6: good all around tank, but bad ROFE25: bad base damage so a peek a boom method will suffice.\T54-Mod 1: good armour, but pretty bad top speed and penetration level for its tier.and so on, you will see that there are pretty obvious weaknesses, if you are a good player, you will learn to exploit these weaknesses.Overall, i dont encounter cheaters at all, pretty rare if you do find one. There is a problem with AFK's though, so if WargGaming remedies that problem, it will be a good game. Overall, don't hate so much on Wargaming, they did a decent job developing this game and I will give the props to them. Come at me hatersthanks for reading my review and have a nice day, constructive criticism can be usefull"",1"

It's quite obvious that wargaming wants your money, nearly all game developers wants money, but it shouldn't be this extreme (I know it's not that extreme but as of the looks of it it will become VERY extreem indeed). The game also needs alot, and I mean alot of work on the matchmaking. The tiers are very good indeed but when it comes to tank types it needs heavy work. It's not fun coming in a game with only lights on your team and the enemy is only heavys and tds for example.

"7508,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""It's a good game, but people get too salty too fast. It's considered camping if you use a TD for it's actual purpose. And half the time when some event comes along, people just buy the tanks and don't work for them. And the people that work for them, get cut off when the event ends. To top it off, some people act like they control the entire team, so when they die, it's everyone else's fault (Give or Take). It's better just playing World Of Tanks instead of this.

"7524,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""This game...I feel as if when I started playing way back, from the Windows Store, the game hadn't yet succumbed to the P2W meta. However, I feel like the game has been slowly slipping further and further from being fair for all, including F2P players. I have spent money on this game on quite a few occasions and, don't get me wrong, I know that it gives an advatage to people that do, what with Premium ammo, acc. time, tanks etc. I feel like this shouldn't be a thing, games that get this right only allow you to pay for cosmetics, stuff that looks nice but has no other purpose in-game. It's also becoming increasingly hard for new players to get a foothold in the game before being met with seal-clubbers in PzIIJ's and Ke-Ni Otsu's.The gameplay is hard to fault (apart from the afore mentioned issues) and the map devs have done an overall good job in my opinion, making maps fair for all classes as much as possible. Obviously, Russian tenk OP, but the nations do seem to be evenly balanced and have little quirks that keep them interesting to play.The game runs smoothly at max settings on a Ã‚Â£200 laptop so the optimisation is there.

"7526,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Uh... kind of surprised at the flak this game is getting. I've played the non-Blitz version before and it is a bit better with richer tank team progression and tech trees and such, more vehicle types too. But this is a free-to-play version that works with mobile interface, and I find that pretty exciting and well-executed. I get an almost identical immersion experience as the original version and it's not graphically- or gameplay-inferior. There are a few extra indicator arrows and things that would be absolutely necessary on a mobile device but don't detract from a PC experience, so I don't understand the whining. If the orginal version of the game was a first-class ticket, then Blitz is business-class as opposed to coach.

"7537,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""Its World of Tanks 'Lite' or Diet World of Tanks. But is that necessary a bad thing?Its not but as far as games go from Wargames (the company) this one is blatantly after your money and divides its fan base by not giving the historical guys what they want (the game is now plagued by fantasy tanks eg dracula tank).Now I dont mind buying the odd rare tank, gold for upgrading here and there. I dont spend money on coffee throughout the week and thats how I justify it. However in world of tanks and world of warships you dont need to spend real money if you dont want to, in this game its constantly trying to get you to part ways with your cash. It does this through its terrible equipment upgrades where it will take up to 3 days to upgrade after purchasing, or you can spend real cash now to have the upgrade instantly... Yep.Over the 3 years I played this game I have seen upgrades that meant my past purchases were made null and void. No sorry from the company. Therefore if you spent real money on upgrades or a tank with good stats, there is no guarantee that a future update will make your equipment obsolete, or your tank nerfed. This is bad.World of warships for me is more a stable platform, where I feel its not actively trying to steal money from my wallet. If I do purchase a premium ship or captain points they dont nerf the ship at a later update or invent a new skill point system that makes my past purchase of captain points null.This would all have been fine if you can play blitz without spending dough, however the game is made so you cant.I would avoid this in the long run.PS The game also harbours a terrible and toxic community.

"7542,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""While i have only played 30 minutes on the steam version, i have already clocked in a good 70 hours on the original World of Tanks on pc and another 40 or so on the mobile version of World of Tanks Blitz and another 10 on the newly released World of Tanks Blitz on the Windows store. The game is great, it's basically a downscaled and simplified version of the original World of Tanks, it has less tanks than the original, and less maps. it still has micro-transactions in it that is available in most free-to-play games. However, micro-transactions only allow you to progress faster in the tech tree, the further you are on it, the tougher your enemies. The micro-transactions are not pay-to-winThe gameplay isn't very different from the original World of Tanks, only that it's faster, the maps are smaller, and matches generally last less than 5 minutes. a new armor highlighter system has been added for this version of the game, letting players see which parts of the armor are easier to penetrate. this however, may turn off some of the more hardcore players, you must understand however, that World of Tanks Blitz is designed as a casual game, not a heavily competitive one.progression is somewhat of a grind, where you have to collect xp coins to upgrade your tanks, and to progress in the tech tree. as mentioned earlier, there are less tanks in the Blitz version of the game, however, regular updates every month or so add more tanks and armored vehicles into the game.graphics is as previously said, the same as the original world of tanks, but downscaled. the textures are not as sharp, and the models are simplified.overall, it is in my opinion that it's a great game and worth a try for anyone who likes simple and fast tank combat. if the beta is closed on steam but you still want to play this game, you are able to download it on your mobile phone or from the Windows store"",1"

BS you can get hours and hours of VIP for F R E E i have around 16 1-hour vip certificates from the free crates that i paid NOTHING for , and that's the only thing that gives others an advantage of doubled earnings just to make the grind shorter  which in no way affects your or other's gameplay experience Overall , it's a very good game and the gameplay is fantastic , The Multi-nation spectrum of tanks is guranteed to give you something that you like , would recommend it if your pc can't Run the original WOT , otherwise get that since it's the big developed pubescent brother of this gameEdit: The game is starting to fall down the p2w hole these days, will update."",1"
7553,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,all the rejects who cant play the real version of tanks play this. you have all these idiots rush in with their light tanks and expect to destroy the enemy heavies. horrible idea from a horrible russian company.,0
"7554,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,""This is a GREAT game. ( I think personally.) This is why I think it is a great game, to start the training rooms are just minigames if you don't want to do regular battles. Secondly you can meet some really nice people on this game and then there are the not so nice people. The not so nice people can rage over ANYTHING even the smallest detail. Although they are here they are just as competitive as the next person. So give this game a try and you will hopefully not regret downloading this game. Peace out âœŒ"",1"

"7558,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Why this? Why mobile game on Steam? I remember playing original World of Tanks couple of years ago.I grinded so â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing hard to get better tier tank. Matches took so long and you were getting so little experience and credits. I finally managed to get to tier 5! American M4 Sherman IIRC... only to realize how much that tank sucked. And then I saw how much more grinding was before me in a bad tank to get anything better.Thanks, but NO! WoT is awful!Then I played the mobile version on my phone and had many more tanks in shorter time, also grabbed free tank slots on promos, so I'm not that limited. This game looks rather bad, is dumbed down, but it's at least a bit more REASONABLE in GRINDING FEST.It could be better, but it's still fun, especially that you can play on mobile and have same account. Game still requires a LOT of grinding though."",1"

"7566,World of Tanks Blitz,2017.0,""A ridiculous game that prizes itself on completely unbalanced teams. There seems to be no discrimination towards experience and vehicle strength. Example, I've seen one player slug six shells into an opponent only for the oppenent to turn around and one shot them.

You can not no longer battle with NOOBS, NEWBS, and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥S anymore if you are a decent player. Rating like CS-GO is best, it shows us what we are and who they are to fight to."",1"

7578,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,Good fun game BUT dumb stats of tanks too try and lvl things out. Sniper tanks cant see far but there gun is for hitting tanks or other tanks miles away. dumb dumb dumb. Even the mighty teir 10 Grille cant see    sh it   teir 2 tanks have the same view range or better lol sad game. History has this TD and or other tanks  shooting  many shots at the good guys tanks before the good guys can even get in range or ambush them with big gun. But the game is fun even with all the changes in the years of playing all the tanks are different now then what they where. The game makers know that these tanks are not balanced thats why they were made stopâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥things up so much. So after all this time I vote so so game $$$$ â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s out there wow gold bullets all over there are lots. ps    try to play for fun it

"7582,World of Tanks Blitz,2016.0,""Not a bad game. I'll write the bad things first: The interface is very slow, aiming is slow as hell too, you should make it quicker. Another problem is the zoom. You just can't zoom, its pretty annoying. A big problem is the seizure warning even for those who does not have epilepsy. I mean when you use scope, the shot makes a flash, and its already bad, but using machineguns is eyecancer. These are the big ones, maybe i forgot something. Graphics and sounds are not a big problem yet, cuz the game requires potato pc only. The upsides are the the things that are problems in the big game, so its good that there is no arty, smaller teams equals better balance, and bigger influence of ONE player. I like this one. First fix the uncomfortable interfacer, and then it would be awesome, if you would make also good graphics and sounds. I like this game."",1"

7584,World of Tanks Blitz,2018.0,While the game itself is enjoyable as of late lag and fps have become a real issue. Gameplay is choppy while near groups of tanks there is a terrible lag when the enemy is spotted. It is much worse when they are spotted en-mass.

First two games played against AI's but after that it was clear seal clubbers populate this game.Would give it a more favorable rating if the control respose and aiming were not so clunky and not locked in to a pre-determined game progression.
