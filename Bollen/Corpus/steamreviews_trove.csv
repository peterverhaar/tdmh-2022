"10481,Trove,2018.0,""I really loved this game before, but that was before.The game is about completing your collection of cosmetics and being stronger and stronger,i liked the collection stuff because i'm that kind of person that like collecting stuff and cosmetics but everythingis so grindy and hard to get or completly based on luck.For being stronger you have to complete dungeon over and over and over forever that you get so much annoyed by them you just bomb your way to the boss, for to collecting gems and equipment to recycle,its easy early game but end game is a nightmare , the chance of upgrading your gem is so low you feel like you are forced to waste all your ressources to buy the most powerfull upgrader.There is also some update i didn liked at all , 2 of them :It really annoyed me when i realized that the chaos chest and a lot of other loot box will be no more tradable and all of itscontent will be no more tradable, it maked the collection stuff so much more harder and so ridiculously expensive !And then the adventure club update, i loved the content and was happy about that but i was not really happy about being demoted from my own club that i created and spend a lot of ressources and time in it, this is just unfair and broken.The lags, for some reason the game is laggy as hell , you get rollback , when you fly you get smashed to the ground because of rollback , you finally climb dungeon ? no no rollback do it again, load a world and disconnected from server, do a shadow tower boss but then you have a huge lag and when you are back half the team is dead ? just trove things.. Over time it become really iritating and this issue is in the game for so long i'm surprised the devs still did nothing about this. "",0"
"10482,Trove,2016.0,""well for me having more than 100 hours on trove... and this new update that is coming out, or is already out, it made the game more pay to win and it will be way harder for new players to get classes or stuff like that."",0"
"10483,Trove,2018.0,""Gamigo just bought Trion and now they are gonna do what they know best: milk it until it diesThe game itself was a fantastic idea, it didnt deserve those companies running it. Also it went downhill since the gem boxes updateRIP Trovef"",0"
"10484,Trove,2018.0,""I think I started playing back in December of 2015 on my old Glyph account and Trove during that time period was so much fun, after getting it now in 2018 I am disappointed. Everything in the shop costs credits now and the game is even more grindy than before."",0"
"10485,Trove,2015.0,""This is an edited review so bear that in mind. Trove was a fun game for me, before the Mantle of Power update, I enjoyed it heavily because of the new stuff that it offered and the goal of getting radiant gear. It offered a gallery of item cosmetics designed by others that I enjoyed experimenting with to make each of the 12 or so classes I had unique. Doing the shadow towers was also a fun experience for a time. Clubs were also a large part of why I stayed as it allowed to meet other players to converse and help one another as well as to build in a sandbox world unique to that club. Crafting mounts and pets was very fun as well - I loved the variety.However, these things only last a certain while. Over time I realised that this game was nothing but grinding. You would complete a dungeon out in the world in less than a minute to move on to the next one, and so on and so forth. Rinse and repeat 200 times a day. I didn't mind the grinding part because it was removed in a sense by the time the marketplace came out where I could earn my fortune by buying and selling items on the market place for money to buy better gear and I could live with that. Then, Mantle of Power. It's what turned this game into a grind fest. There's no avoiding it other than spending a large amount of money on gem boxes to increase your odds of ranking up gems. Gems, by the way, can only be earned from boxes that you get from a dungeon. They offer three varients of"
"10486,Trove,2016.0,""Challenged to write this review by Jason of the Baxter. 11/05/2016. 02:48 PM on a Saturday rainy evening. Myâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥is big but i have to write this review before switching on the good old porntube. There is many things you can say about this game... Some say it is Da Vinci's own masterpiece that has never been discovered until the recent years of Trove. Some say it is Jesus Christ himself but no, it is Trove. This game will grip you harder then a asianâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥at a cheap club after taking too many MDMA pills. The graphics are revolutionary and the game is just breathtaking. I cannot recommend it more then i recommend voting for Trump. 10/10 goodsirs 10/10."",1"
"10487,Trove,2015.0,""Trove is a blocky MMO which is MASSIVELY Multiplayer. It's so fun. You can raid dungeons, claim cornerstones (houses), your noble steed, and even different catagories. I've got EPIC! (Coz im EpicFaceLol) If you like massively multiplayer, open world, blocky MMO's, this is the game for you!"",1"
"10488,Trove,2018.0,""Been playing this game for a long time. not in Steam, on trion launcher. and I can tell that this game is so good. But after its release, the game changed really much. It was a good game, but this """"pay2win"""" thing finally reached this game. Thanks devs, its all about money, isn't it ?Welcome to grinding simulator 2018 everyone, in this game, you pay all of your money to the devs to get actually good, or spend hundreds of hours just killing thousands of enemies and completing hundreds of dungeons around the world with dumb puzzles in it, which you don't even need to complete them just dig the block under you until you reach the boss or if its above just use your multiplied jump boost to get all the way up.The game is really fun,but only if you want to goof around with your friends or if you'd like to just chat and get to know some random players around the world, this game's for you. Which I'm actually doing this, chatting with random people while playing the game and grinding.The grinding is really bad, boring and makes you mad, I know that myself. But If you manage to find a way to grind this game without getting bored, it can actually work out. Like, you can actually have fun in this game. I actually don't play this game anymore since the game is completely dumb right now, but you can try it out.Also there is """"Test Servers"""" for experienced players to try out upcoming things in the future, in these servers I believe you have unlimited access to everything, you have unlimited money, you can spawn things, you can get any kind of item for free on store and so on. But there is a Queue or some kind of thing for this server for a reason, I don't know why they did this, but one day I tried to join the server, I was the 12th person in queue. I left it open for several hours, around 6-7 and nothing happened. I was finally down to 6, then for a reason i kept getting up to 8 or 9. Finally i was 2th person, then 1st and poof. That was it. It just got stuck on 1st, i thought its having connection problems or some kind of a lag so i left it open again for several hours. And nothing. It still said 1st. I tried to get this server working for several times, and everytime i do this i started at as 10 or 30 in queue. And the same problem happened, maybe waited even 2 days but it kept getting stuck on 1st.I would pretty much say don't play it if you don't have any friends to play with. Because this game is hella boring when you don't have anyone with you.Overall, pay2win -7it needs grinding -3Only fun if you have friends +1Nice community (Its actually the only good thing about this game) +34/10"",0"
"10489,Trove,2018.0,""Grind is fine but this is over-repetitive grindy. Farmable rare items are hardly tradeable. They used to be tradeable and helps with the player trades. Now majority of the items are non-tradeable and locks you away with paywall. Older player might have a more leisure gameplay but for newer player I imagine it is dreadful.Building stuff is hella fun since you can pretty much build whatever. IF you love minecraft, this is probably a game for you.The MMO aspect however. :("",0"
"10490,Trove,2016.0,""It is really impressive to watch a dev team take a game and make it absolute dogâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥from one of the best mmos around. with all the cash grabs and untradeableâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ i may as well go back to playing combat arms. atleast that way the devs dont even pretend to give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.just a little add on to this. logged on recently just to see how much of a mess this game was now... turns out, with the new club update they did at some point, they gave club ownership to the most active officer, if the leader wasnt active. or just to the most active member, if none of the officers where active. avoid this cancer at all costs, if you get attached to something, and leave the game for whatever reason, dont get shocked to find its gone next time you check.yet another addon to this. they keep rolling out """"updates"""" that, best i can tell, only serves to let them try and push new content onto the marketplace, so they can part the stupid few who still play this from more of their money."",0"

"10492,Trove,2017.0,""Glad to have wasted 1k hours on this game, endlessly grinding for no reason. The objective of this game is to go from dungeon to dungeon, killing enemies to gain xp and loot, such as items (weapons) or gem boxes. Doing this results in boredom and makes me want to die.There are several classes to choose from, some being OP, such as high dmg shots, or firing 500 arrows a second, and some being useless and never used. It's unbalanced but the developers don't seem to care about their game but rather how much money they can make within their updates. The updates usually happen around special events, such as Christmas or Easter ect and even if they do proper updates, fixing stuff and remaking something, they include a """"heads-start"""" pack that includes things that are either hard/impossible to get while grinding for them.Overall, the game is a piece ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ don't spend money on it."",0"
"10493,Trove,2015.0,""To me, Trove feels like the developers got a few inspirations from Minecraft and a few inspirations from Terraria and applied this to a common MMO formula with a fair business model that is """"Play to Win"""" and """"Pay to Look Fabulous"""" with decent crafting times and a ton of other stuff. Of course you gotta work for all that you have and want to acquire but still, it is very much fair. However, Trove shall not be compared to either of the aforementioned games as Trove poses something inherently different and sets itself apart with multiple features (or the merging of features). But I am getting ahead of myself. If you want to skip the lengthy part of my review, you may skip to the pros and cons I've listed below.To get us started, what about Trove's lore and story? Well, as far as I am concerned, there is none. A goddess split the world into multiple, infinite realms for you to explore, venture into, slay dangerous foes and collect tons of loot and level up. So Trove has, in my eyes, the nessecary things to be an electronic video game providing fun and entertainment. Also, talking with a few community members revealed that most of the players aren't too concerned about the lack of lore as Trove is almost 100% about gameplay.So, let's switch to the gameplay!Trove's gameplay has multiple aspects I'm gonna pick apart one after the other. Starting off with character creation.And the character creation in Trove is very simple. Pick one out of 11 possible classes at the start of the game and choose a hair style and a race to go with it. However, hair styles and races are purely cosmetic and do neither benefit your character nor do they influence gameplay in any way whatsoever. For instance, I made a female robot Ice Sage-class character, a robotic mage based on ice with a nice, female hair style. Hair- and eye colour may also be chosen, though there are only a few select colours you may choose.As a new player, you will be most likely concerned with the following: Building, raiding dungeons for loot and XP, leveling up and customizing your character a little more. In terms of building, there are, in every world that is generated and the game throws you in, so-called cornerstones. The cornerstone system works like this: it's a plot of land that is 16x16 blocks in size that you can claim. Upon claiming, a basic starter house with basic equipment spawns. On your cornerstone, you can customize your house any way you want, building up to 150 blocks high (for tower enthusiasts like me) and the stone is the only place (apart from club worlds (clubs are the guilds in this game which have their own world that you can shape the way you want it)) where what you build gets saved and nobody can grief your stuff as it is protected on your little plot of land. And you can switch to another cornerstone, which then triggers the buildup of your house there and the wiping of your house from the previous one. In essence, you got a portable base.Then there's raiding lairs. There are 3 types of lairs, small, large and recipe lairs (the latter are used to craft furniture). Every lair features a boss (in case of the large lair it is 3 bosses) and every boss drops a chest with loot in it. Speaking loot, there are no armours in this game, only class skins. However, the game has weapons, masks and hats with unique styles based on the biome you've found them in. There are 12 biomes in total with entirely different themes and you are able to build your house around said themes if you wish to.Anyway, upon getting better weapons you might think """"Geez, I sure wish I could keep the style of my previous weapon and apply it to my current weapon!"""". Well, you can. With the loot collector you can (and kinda must) build to advance your game experience and collecting styles for the multiple items.Upon collecting styles you get valuable resources (but a lot of resources also have to be mined and acquired through drops or the gardening profession) and mastery points. The mastery rank is a different scale compared to your class's level. You have to level each class you get individually (getting you more mastery points) where as your MR (mastery rank) carries over to your whole game experience.What do you do with all the resources? Crafting and building!Trove features multiple crafting stations for multiple professions that either unlock powerful items, stylish new blocks for you to build with and reward you with mastery points upon leveling up your skill. Your MR also rewards you with stuff such as storage currency, stat upgrades that carry over to all of your classes and items.The professions involve: Ringcrafting, runecrafting, gardening, fishing and building (the latter does not award you MR points however).Other stuff includes, but is not limited to:Mounts, allies that give passive bonuses, boats to ride on the seas, sails for your boats, mag riders (another form of mount) and much more.Now, switching to the term """"variety"""". Here are some gripes I got about Trove.The enemy variety is barely present. Of course, every biome has its unique enemies and with unique looks and sounds, but the overall variety in terms of attack patterns and abilities of said enemies just isn't there much. Basically you will be fighting the same enemy over and over again with a different skin. Save for the shadow realm bosses of course (which are in more advanced worlds).Then the class abilities. Each class has four abilitites, two of which have to be unlocked with progression through levels. In my opinion, this is not enough combat variety. But I spoke with some community members and it revealed that the majority of players actually don't mind that too much as Trove's main focus isn't combat. Because to me, Trove has no main focus so to speak, as you can do a myriad of other things within the game.Another thing that got me disappointed a bit was the music. Don't get me wrong, the music in itself is fine by me. But it is almost never present. When you enter a new biome, the biome specific music plays for a minute, then stops for about half an hour and starts playing again. This is not much for such an explorative game like this I dare say.What I loved about Trove was the amount of biomes there is and the possibility to style everything, even your character, with a specific biome in mind as well as the amount of possible blocks for building your house. Another thing that I found really neat were the tooltips for almost every item as they, in the majority of cases, reveal how to acquire them. You can view all available items in the game in a certain List (default press Y and check out that stuff) and the tooltips for every item almost all of the time tell you how to get them. This is pretty neat as it reduces the amount of times I have to ask somebody or look it up in a wiki.One last thing: the devs.They punch out so many updates and server maintenance to ensure everybody gets a good gaming experience. If they notice there is a persistent issue with even a small percentage of players, they warn us beforehand and then get right to it by shutting down the servers and solving the problems. In my opinion, that's good work.But now, off to the pros and cons:Pros:- Vast world to explore with a lot of variety in landscapes- Fly, hop on a boat or ride your mount- Ability to style your equip the way you want- Ability to have your own, personal WORLD for yourself- A portable base of operations that you can customize the way you want with a variety of different blocks- Great development team so far- Fair business modelCons:- Lack in enemy variety- Lack in musical presence- Lack in class ability variety- Getting some resources might get tedious- Lack of combat varietyWould I recommend this game? I had a ton of fun with it so far, so yes. Totally.And it's free, it's not like you're paying anything so give Trove a try today!"",1"
10494,Trove,2016.0,This review will be divided in three parts:1. Is Trove for me?2. Pros and cons about Trove!3. Conclusion!Part.1:Looking for a hardcore mmorpg? âœ–Looking for a mmorpg with a great story? âœ–Looking for a mmorpg that has an immersive open world that you can explore? âœ–Looking for a PvP focused mmo? âœ–Looking for a fun mmorpg?  âœ” (Trove might be for you)Part.2: Pros: *Fun to play*Doesn't take itself to seriously*Very good building mechanics*Mod support Cons:*Pay 2 win*Can be boring*A lot of grinding*A lot of RNG in the gamePart.3: In conclusion Trove is a free to play mmorpg (Not really an mmo in my opinion) and there is fun to be had. That being said the game faces lots of issues. The game is free so you aren't sacrificing much by giving it a shot.Hopefully you found the review helpful.,0
"10495,Trove,2015.0,""After a decent amount of time, I think I can give you guys an overview of Trove. If you like my review or not, feel free to like/ dislike and comment on it.Pros:- balanced classes, even if you only have 4-5 skills to use- fun with friends for a period of time- funny and innovative dungeon design, like Candoria (Candyland) and Dragonfire Peaks (fire and dragons)- biome designed dungeons- no pay2win- A LOT of styling items- fun through the first 20-25 levels- interesting and innovative building mechanics- enhancements in weapons and armor- fighting system is very activeCons:- bag expension etc. will cost up to 50â‚¬ if you want to unlock every bag- no new expensions, just a lot of new shop items (stlye etc.)- late/never answering support- it's fun, for 2-3 weeks, it gets repetitive- no pvp at all- same biomes all the time- a lot of grinding in your professions like gardening or ring-crafting- after a while you just run through the dungeons to kill the boss- mastery level 30 and full radiant gear means you've beaten the game, there is no """"late game"""" contentAll in all, I would recommend this game to everybody who wants to have 30 hours of fun with his friends. Nothing in long-term, it ends in grinding and gets repetitive with time."",1"
10496,Trove,2018.0,iv played this game since i was 8 years old. i had to sitch accounts and i made this one. trove was a good game. now all it is is grinding. nothing changes and if you have money you can do what people takes mounths to do you can do in minutes. personaly this game was spacale to me because i played it with friend and made great memorys. i hope the devs do something about this game because i can say right now it isent realy fun,0
"10497,Trove,2017.0,""Pay2Win, business model like Clash of Clans, where if you spend more money, the faster you advance & obtain a higher advantage compared to other players that don't spend money on this game. At the moment, this game is dead. This may also be caused by the extremely long queue times when the game just came out, which has driven away many potential players but of course, that was last time... oh how the mighty has fallen."",0"

Mantle of power legit ruined this game everyone i pretty much played with stoped playing it and putting money into it. some streamers that loved this game stoped streaming it. its fun to build in this game but its really not worth playing anymore. just wish it wasn't so hardcore P2W and pretty much everything is non-tradeble now the ranking system is stupid. its just ruined to bad was a fun game to play"",0"

They hyped us for the class and gave us absolute trash.The devs are awkward, ungrateful neckbeards who refuse to address issues or any concerns the community has other than 'ganduh', 'draguns', 'gemms' and 'peevepee'.Not once in every stream I've watched have they ever addressed community concerns about money, the item store, or the sheer amount of displeased players. All they care about is your money now.Their other games are just as unplayable and terrible. Hard to want to get into, boring to play, and pay-to-win. Don't get anything or support Trion Worlds/Glyph.The community of the game is just as bad as the devs. They come and white-knight them every time you have a concern, disagree with them or have a question - they berate you, trap you, and shun you. Moreso, they're disrespectful like Minecraft kids.PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME OR ANY GAME MADE BY GLYPH/TRION WORLDS.

Now you have to have credit to buy classes, its way to grindy as well. Like, back then, it was bearable, but now... it's just way to much. The developers are being to greedy with it...

"10508,Trove,2015.0,""I do not  recomed this game because there needs to be a more interactive tutorial. When i joined the game for the first time I did not know what to do or play! Also when people play this game there needs to be a map or somthing were I can look on too to see were I need to go. There should also be missions to kill eniemies or other people also the multiplayer world should be much bigger because when I first started """"trove"""" which I don't play anymore I killed like one enemie I was confused what I did after that because there was no more islands to go to or anything so that is why dont recommend this game!"",0"

10511,Trove,2016.0,Trove was ok for a bit then it got repetitive quickly the only reason why I have over 200 hours is because I forgot to close the glyph launcher I guess the game can be fun for some but not for me.,0
"10512,Trove,2017.0,""I enjoyed my time playing this. It has pretty simple, yet fun combat, and when you aren't exploring the game world, you can create your own. You get a house you can bring with you to each world like a campsite that you are free to customize to help you out on your adventure, which gives you a great chance to show off your building skills to other players. This game is definitely worth checking out. I'm a big fan of MMORPGs, and while I realize this style is a homage to Minecraft, this style isn't really seen in an MMO setting very often, which makes the game unique since it is trying to make the voxel style appeal to a vastly different market.

This game is very very fun and addicting. Until end game kicks in like any other MMOs. It used to be okay. The max gear quality used to be shadow and 8*, but now they added radiant which is pretty hard to grind. I love this game and recommend this, but the end game is mostly grinding.Do remember Radiant needs SEVERAL high level shadow gears to make and you still have to work hard to make it 8*"",1"
"10514,Trove,2015.0,""Pros and cons of this game: + Free to play + Dungeons are easy to find, and doesn't rely on team effort unless you need to do it faster. + Creating your own area and having it seen by people. + Classes are simple and creative in that they provide different roles in the game.  You can choose to be a sword wielding tank, a damage heavy character or a spell-toting dragon.  (There are more characters) + Family friendly (lol) + Mounts, pets and wings provide smoother gameplay but doesn't make you overpowered damage wise.  Most of these things are just pleasing to look at while defeating mobs. + Questlines give you free """"Cubits"""" that you can spend in the shop for classes, emblems, and mounts. - Gets grindy if you aren't spending the gameplay with people. - Only two abilities for each class - Long que timers which are still being worked on.I recommend to play this game with friends and if you have a couple of hours to destroy.

"10515,Trove,2015.0,""I played a lot of Trove before it came to Steam and participated in Alpha/Beta testing. I have got to say not only has the game changed a lot. it has improved along the way! There are tons of new features, more items and an over all more refined game! For the uninitiated, Trove is a voxel based sandbox mmo where you create your character and travel through different worlds completing dungeons, collecting loot/gear to progress your character. There are many classes in the game, and more classes added regularly. Each class can be switched to """"on the fly"""" all you need is a wardrobe. In Trove each player gets there own plot of land that they can take with them everywhere they go, all from the start! this land can be customized in anyway you can imagine as long as its withing the size limits. There are also shared worlds for building called Clubs, that act sort of like guilds in other mmos.  Linking all the worlds and features together is the hub. Hubworld is a place most """"trovians"""" pass through regularly to get from place to place, so its always pretty lively. I completely recommend Trove to anyone who is a fan of voxel based games, sandbox mmos, or just getting lots of loot!"",1"
"10516,Trove,2015.0,""I've been keeping my eye on Trove for awhile, when it hit Steam I thought """" why not"""" and gave it a try.Its Awesome, far exceeding my expectations. This is the game CubeWorld could have been had the dev decided to keep working on it, Instead, Trove got everything and it is magnificent.Pros:- Enjoyable Voxel Graphics, very bright and vividBiomes are awesome compared to normal ones (Candoria, Neon, Dragon are awesome)Cornerstone Area is great for building your own little part in the game (Pixel art FTW)Plenty to do from gardening, Crafting, Dungeon delving.Numerous classes to choose from, with the ability to change once unlockedNot Pay2WinCons:-Dat Queue tho.Has somewhat of a grindfest feel to it, But the loot all over the place makes it less tedious than most MMOs.overall 14/10 would stick it to CubeWorld Dev again."",1"

I give this game a rating of 3/10 lots of potential but the grind makes it boring and repetitive and the fact that the classes cost """"Credits"""" which you have to buy for real money turns newcomers offSpent too much time on thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥game..."",0"
"10520,Trove,2016.0,""To no one's surprise, Trion has yet again ruined another game with their greed. While the game is fun, the recent stream of patches has placed player-friendly systems (cubits for classes and monthly dragon acquisition) under an increased grind to encourage real money microtransactions. These changes have been rapidly churned out and much opposed by the playerbase (who are all largely ignored), which indicates that this trend will continue in the future.Play if you must, but don't pay them a dime"
10521,Trove,2016.0,After sinking a reasonable amount of time into this game (Including Beta and before it came on steam) I've seen it go from a promising title to a pay2win game riddled with microtransactions and 4+ hour downtimes nearly daily.

"10524,Trove,2016.0,""When this game first came out, it was amazing so much do it in the game.But that's when the game first came out. Whilst this game is still quite a good game to play but you will quickly come across the problem of grinding for hours and hours. I'll go into more detail on the CONS near the end.PROS:-Great fun with friends if you're all new to the game!-The massive range of items in the game-How they submit workshop creations into the game-They keep updating this game and adding more content e.g. new classes!-This game is """"Free 2 Play""""CONS:-The grinding in this game is stupidly long.-In-game purchases-Quickly gets boring if you're a casual playerOkay, the reason why i'm not going to be going into the PROS into more detail as they're self explained from my view. But i'll be going over the CONS as quite a large range of people who've played this game have encountered this problem as i have.First CON: The grinding. If you're a casual player as i am when it comes to this game you'll quickly notice on how much a grindfest this game is. This CON is quite a personal opinion as other people might love this game for the grinding as it gives them something to do for hours on end. Okay, once you start this game you'll notice on how easy it is to start but as you get bout the first 4 hours in you'll notice on how material you'll need for your new weapon to upgrade but you'll just go along with it untill you finally notice how it takes about a few more hours to just level it up once which to me is quite stupid.Second CON: With the in-game purchases this is completely optional, but what the in-game purchases give you are quite stupid. But the in-game purchases you don't have to purchase but what they do is give you quite a big edge on things which is why you'll see alot of reviews saying """"Pay 2 Play"""". In my opinion i don't see the game as """"Pay 2 Play"""" as i haven't spent a single penny on this game and personally have gotten quite far into the game but i can see where the others are coming from.Third CON: If you're a casual player like me, you'll notice on how bored you'll quickly get as this game will take ALOT of your time e.g. the grinding in this game. I'm not saying it's a bad thing to be a casual player as i love this game but because they keep releasing the new content before i can finish the old content they added (which i think a few have encountered) i find myself quite far behind in a sense after putting a handful of hours into this game.My Final Opinion.I recommend this game as of now as this game is more for the dedicated players which isn't a bad thing. What i suggest they change is the amount of time it takes to grind for items as it'll help the game progression for players which don't have the sort of time like others.Thank you for reading my review.

10525,Trove,2016.0,trove is a great game and with the addition of craftable classes it means all classes are fairly easily obtained of course like most games these days trove has microtransactions which can be used to skip a lot of grinding.however there isnt really to much to do in the game and it becomes repetitive this means that it isnt to hard to learn the basics and if you ever need help you could always ask people in global or your club.,1
"10526,Trove,2017.0,""To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the point of playing Trove. The gameplay is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the gameplay will go over a typical playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head. The fans understand this stuff"
"10527,Trove,2015.0,""I like this game. I really do. But, it has some aspects of pay to win, which I hate because i'm not a spoiled rich kid who gets anything they want. Now i'm not saying the only way to be good is to spend money. You can be perfectly good and not pay a dime. But, In order to get most things in the shop, you have to use currency you can only use real money to get. It's not even an unfair system like this:Shirt: 5 pay to win coinsPay to win coins: 1 ptw coin=12938479132874 normal coinsSo final verdict: It's a great free mmo game. Lots of people play it, and I have had no connectivity issues or have been stuck on a loading screen. It's a great game, and its free. Give it a chance and download.8/10 would be 10/10 if there were no pay to win aspects"",1"
"10528,Trove,2017.0,""    The new update just ruined this game really bad. Progressing in this game is still just mindless grinding, farming and chasing after nothing, now with extra steps in the recent updates. The shadow towers are completely unbalanced and overdone, some lower floors are even harder than higher floors, which makes no sense at all. And then trion increased the bosses' healths too much to the point that every boss fight is a long, boring and competitive """"run and hit"""" fight. Furthermore, this update made classes way too unbalanced, melee classes become weaker and nearly turn into useless classes in shadow tower, on the other hand, range classes such as Gunslinger or Shadow Hunter are becoming more powerful in shadow tower, like every group must have at least 1 gunslinger and 1 shadow hunter.    I used to enjoy helping new players dashing through hard shadow towers with my 16k classes but now I can't even help myself to get through the first wave of the last two floors in hard mode, and normal mode is now like ultra mode to newbies, I have to say it's ridiculous.     Seiously, trion only focused 20k+ players in this update and overally ignored newbies and anyone who are progressing to the """"end game"""".    To be honest, you gain very tiny rewards comparing to your many hours of mindless grinding and hard works because the whole game is based on RNG and RNG and RNG in every single thing. Don't waste your time on this game, find something else to play because you won't progress anything, except if you pay because that's what trion wants you to."",0"

"10531,Trove,2015.0,""Just to get this straight this game is just like freaking Minecraft! But positively like Minecraft. The game starts off as a tutorial and when your in the tutorial you get to pick between a variety of classes. Originally, the main classes you got to pick in the beta of the game when it first started was a Knight, a Gunslinger, a Candy Barbarian, or a Dracolyte. ClassesKnight- Mainly used for tanking. Can withstand many enemies. Great damage. Close range. Has a passive skill that when hit your next attack deals more damage. The great thing about Knight it is good for soloing but damage is not that great.Gunslinger - Has an advantage at range. Uses a gun. Good for damage. Has a passive skill that when shooting in the air while attacking an enemy in the air while airborne your next charged shot will be instantly charged without cost. Candy Barbarian - Mainly uses melee weapons as an advantage. Close range. Can withstand many enemies. Skills provide healing and can hit multiple targets. Good for damage or for soloing.Dracolyte- This is most likely a overrated class in my opinion but I'm not saying the other three classes are bad but this class has just got more advantages and it's just so overpowered to use. Uses a staff and the freaking skill is a flamethrower that lasts forever until the enemy dies. The most awesome thing about the last or ultimate skill of this class is that you get to transform into a fire- breathing dragon that is most powerful than your flamethrower and it can literally annihilate everything well I'm just exaggerating if you know what gear to equip. Also in Trove you get to build your own house and make cool pixels like Pokemon, and other stuff which are like the things you need to build in Minecraft but your going to have to mine for blocks just to build stuff.In that case, the game is fun, building is enjoyable, and having a fire - breathing dragon is the most coolest thing I've ever seen in my life."",1"

"10534,Trove,2016.0,""Here's the short of it.""""Was"""" (in some aspects still is) a Good game with a lot of ways to kill time with friends, but now its all about the $$$. Oh, you are new? â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you, pay me!Here's the long.The reason I cannot reccomend it anymore (mostly for new players) is because of changes made to the game around the time of this review. Classes in game can no longer be unocked with cubits (currency earned from grinding). Instead classes must be purchased with money, which is going to affect new players the most since they will be stuck playing out as a single class, which for their sake I hope they chose wisely. Mabey if they like the game enough they will buy a new class, but it will be hard to enjoy a game where you are stuck using something you regret choosing, no? If you have enough in game resources, you can buy a class coin (unlocks one character) for a hefty fee from another player. New players wont be able to afford these class coins. Another thing that has changed is the acquisition of dragons. The update was supposed """"to make getting a dragon easier"""", lies. It is now more difficult to get a dragon as they must be crafted with a hefty(er) amount of resources, unless you would like to pay money to make things feasible.  I understand that running a F2P online game takes money, what i cannot stand is when corporate does not come out with the truth behind decisions. If a game cannot sustain itself with its current marketing structure, just say so and explain that this is the reason new financial implementations are being added. Do NOT decorate the playerbase with colorful rhetoric and dry PR statements saying """"this is to make things better for YOU!"""" Doing this makes people look like greedy parasites with only financial gain in mind *cough* starts with T and ends in N *cough*, and I for one do not wish to give my money to such people. Pay to support good people and the good work they do? Yes, absolutely. Line their pockets with the scalps of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥hillas? NO!If you want to try this game, look up each class and determine which one you will enjoy playing as the most. Just be aware that this game just got VERY grindy in two main aspects, and is likely to get even more so in the future. Avarem be praised! (he does the in game announcements, hence the """"skygod"""" title others and I have given him) screw the devsEDIT: Well... look what the game has come to. I warned the playerbase the moneygrabbing would get worse, and they said """"no, this is just to support the game"""" and """"this game takes money to run"""". Well I'm fairly certain those players have since said â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ it and abandoned the game as I did so long ago."",0"

This year i got a new PC,and remembered me playing Trove,so i wanted to download it again,when i did,the launcher was just the same and everything,except that when i spawned in the Hub,i was instead using the Gunslinger class,checked the classes menu,and my Neon Ninja wasn't there,it was deleted and EVERY.â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING.CLASS.

"10536,Trove,2016.0,""I started playing trove awhile backk before it was even on steam and I thought it was really cool. I saw update after update come in and things seemed to get better with a few downsides. After months of inactivity, I decided to play it again, it was still okay with new classes and just things in general. It was about the time trove was added to steam and it was super easy for new players to get otherwise rare items and I wasn't really put off about it, but then the update in january basically screwed trove completely. Drilled in the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ with garbo. It is currently unplyabe in its state. New players just give up, it weakened veteran players and it more of a money grab at this point.

"10537,Trove,2016.0,""I loved this game for a while. It was a grind for power and items, but it was fun enough to keep me around. You could pay money to shorten the grind or to make your character look special, but it has always been too much money for what you get IMO and you could get by without spending.Recently they've made the grind infinitely long to achieve most goals, and they've moved some items behind the paywall. But their prices remain too high. So you basically have to dump a bunch of money into it to get anywhere, or you grind toward fewer goals that now have no end in sight.They took a big step in the P2W direction. I understand that they are trying to make money, and it's their right, but I'm positive they would've made more and lost fewer players by going about it differently."",0"

"10539,Trove,2015.0,""Super fun and addicting. The game makes it fun to do both building and fighting, and makes it so its hard to get bored of either. The grinding for mounts, ores, levels, etc, makes it hard to stop playing after you start. Still, over the past day or two, it's basically been a lag simulator for me. That doesn't make it any worse of a game, especially since I think part of it has to do with my computer, so I would still definitely recommend Trove, as it is the only free to play game that I have enjoyed without spending any money on it."",1"
"10540,Trove,2017.0,""What has happened to the game I once knew and loved?Me and my best friend were searching for some games to play, we got bored of TF2 and found Trove. At the time you had to download the Glyph Client in order to play, but we didn't mind. We played a lot, had so much fun and I had that much fun that I got ahead of my best friend by a lot. Then shadow towers got introduced to the game and it was fun to battle to Titan bosses. I would always be one of the last players standing with my end-game Dracolyte.Then it all changed, the game I once knew and loved vanished. It became a grinding game where the P2W players would most of the time have the upper hand. Classes became Pay to Get, and their reason was to make players feel different from others, it pretty much didn't change anything. I wouldn't have minded, but the developers are the most laziest. The servers areâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ most of the items are community created right now, they keep on doing the same events, do some quests, get a reward that isn't worth it, and the amount you had to farm for it was just dumb. I have around 1000 hours experience and I can say that I wish they could just revert back to the beta. And the new players think they are so smart, saying â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t like the game is not P2W, it is not bad and keep on arguing. If they were here in the beta  they would have known why we even starter an argument about theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥the game is.Seriously, Trion World, if you wish to become a better company, you can start by fixing theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥load of bugs you have, some that are still here and have since the BETA.

On a more positive note the general gameplay (although repetative.) and building component is nice and the classes are awesome, they add tons of variation to the game (Although having to farm to get them all was'nt good.). The cummunity is friendly and Trove is REALLY easy to mod (I modded the game when I tired of playing it. The amount of rng in the game ruins it though, (A ton of farming needed to progress in the game, not much variation in enemy functionality, basically point and shoot or point and slash.).

You can mine any block(with the exeptions of dungeons) and then replace that (Yeah it's Minecraft all over again)While you have to unlock your classes with money (either ingame currency or realy money) you can switch freely between them at any guven point. They also share the inventrory which can be handy and a cures at the same time.

Nope, its 5DAYS. 5 Days of clicking one button every 20-40 secs. Want that cool dragon mount? 12 Days of doing chalanges every hour, not even counting other needed materials.. If you would like to get all the collectables there is, i bet whole life wouldint be enough, and even if you bought everything you can for cash it would still take a year or two..It could be a great game, but i dont think i can waste half of my life on this game."",0"

PROS: -A very fun and addicting game that is actually Free to play!-Item gear rankings, The higher the gear the better,  Once you get to uber 1 and above its a every time legendary -Very smooth frames and fun gameplay mechanics-Each class is something new not just a recycled concept which can lead to hours of fun gameplay-No PvP, which means no overpowered uber 5 players kick new players arses in combat-Club worlds!

"10559,Trove,2016.0,""Trion Worlds is awful. Really pay to win. Going backwards in that direction even. You used to be able to unlock more classes with a daily currency called cubits, now you must pay real money. And the new gem system. You could buy protecting items for upgrading with cubits, now you can't, and they upped the credits price too. Rip. You can potentially buy almost anything from other players who have paid real money as well but it's really outrageously priced. It's hard to acquire flux and stuff without shelling out real money. They keep making the paid bonuses better and bigger.The core gameplay is pretty solid. It's... kind of like a very simplified Diablo. You run around and do dungeons and kill things with your 4 types of attacks per class. You find gear that has semirandom stats and upgrade it and stuff. It's fun. There's also building in the form of your personal house that you can summon in hotspots found all over. It's like a house in your pocket. There's also club worlds which are like guilds that you can build your own world. It's cool.But man this real money garbage being shoved down your throat sucks. It'll only get worse, too. I don't recommend this game."",0"
10560,Trove,2016.0,The fact that the game was free and I was actually able to play without buying anything was the reason I liked it. Now that you have to buy classes is just plain old stupid. Bad move Trove. Dont make a game free just to make it a pay to win game. Bad move Trove.,0
10561,Trove,2016.0,Trove a free to play pay to win oh sorry I mean free to play I cant  say anything else because if i do then the money hungry jews i mean the devolpers will sue me anyways what im getting at is that the game is just terrible in many ways one is that most of the time you cant move because a glitch second no one wants to be your friend of talk to you in any way unless you have gear for them and best of all every thing costs money yaaaaaaaa!,0
"10562,Trove,2017.0,""This is the most money demanding game I have ever found.  Basically you spend hours and hours of doing the same thing over.  Then the worse part, the luck.  If you wanna get something good dont expect it since everything has to be super rare forcing people to buy over priced packages.  Also if your trying to buy something that they dont have a pack for good luck.  The packs range from 10$ - 100$ there is very few 10$ packs though.  This game is P2W (pay to win) since everytime someone bought something in the 100$ packs they get something.  Although for those who bought a small pack that has like 1 - 10 super rare chest your not getting anything.  The best chance you got at getting something good is 75 chest.  I would not recommend this game since it demands so much time and work put in to it doing the same thing over and over.  Now every few weeks the devs add another new item or pack that has exsclusive items that players want that can only be obtained by buying.  For anyone that plans on playing this, just know that you eventually end up buying something and regretting it."",0"

Now, I'm sure you can manage to play this game without having to buy stuff, (I have bought nothing so far), but it is definitely VERY helpful to buy something (like a better flask). I bought a better flask at one point, and a new character, but I purchased both of these with the credits or whatever the currency was with what I got for free just by playing the game or by special event things.The gameplay is very fun, and it is quite relaxing, honestly, the just roam around and take over all the dungeons you see. Although I haven't delved into the later game stuff, (I think there is PvP?), or the Shadow tower stuff and many other things, but I have almost 30 hours in the game at this point and it is still quite fun!I totally recommend this game and it is a lot of fun to play with friends."",1"

"10572,Trove,2015.0,""Trove is a classic grinding MMO, with an option to fast-forward the grinding with real money. The game is fun, the different classes lend some diversity to an otherwise routine game. The enemies balance well with the player level, and the game is paced so as to offer the player a reward at intervals that make it fun and keep the game feeling like an adventure. One of the greatest features is the """"cornerstone""""- your own plot of ground that you can build and outfit as you see fit and move with you as you move from biome to biome. The downside is that grinding MMO's require functional servers to enjoy, and the developers can't seem to maintain a server or push a patch successfully to save their life. In the past two weeks since I began playing, with 48.5 hrs on record, there was not a day that passed  without the servers going down. Disruptions of less than an hour or 2 do not make the forum ( I think the dev's see them as common) but looking at the forum you can see that the server goes down for long periods at approximately 2 day intervals. (http://forums.trovegame.com/forumdisplay.php?21-Server-Status).Pros:Free to playfun biomes to exploreblock buildingmobile home baseCons:Servers are down regularlyEnemies and bosses lack varietyGame play is repetitive "",0"
"10573,Trove,2015.0,""Went to play for the first time, got put in a 1000+ player queue with an estimated wait time of more than 30 minutes. And then, to add insult to injury just as I got near the front the game crashed and I was back at the end. Moving on to something I can play NOW.Tip for the developers: attracting new players is key to growing your community. Putting them in a queue the first time they play will just send them someplace else. Let first time players jump the queue, and then if they like the game they'll be willing to wait the next time.Also, get more servers to meet the demand, or you'll also lose the players you already have."",0"

"10575,Trove,2018.0,""One of the most engaging MMORPG experiences out there. You never run out of things to do, but you don't feel burdened and guilty for not being productive because everything you do is productive. You can just go around mindlessly killing andâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥and pillaging while enjoying some music for some hours and BANG, you have made a lot of useful stuff to use later on. Zero research, zero preparation, just go out there and kill stuff.Some positive points about the game:- The game's depth varies with your mood and it remains fun. You can play light and casual, you can work the market, you can go hard and achieve great stuff...you can play it any way and still have fun.- Graphics are pleasing, unless you really hate voxel stuff.- Sound effects and ambience have a nice retro feeling.- Market system is pretty straightforward, simple to use and efficient. Not a lot of depth though.- You don't need to be anywhere, you can do everything you need without having to visit NPC's.- Classes are very unique and fun to play.- Leveling is smooth.- You can have all classes without spending a single penny, you can switch classes as you please and the class is like a whole different character, with other equipment, and you level each class separately. Same as having several characters, but without having to log off to switch between them.- You can be very stylish. The appearance of every equipment you loot is added to your collection, and then you can make your equipment look however you like.- You can build your place (pretty much like Minecraft) within a predefined space called a Cornerstone. You can spawn your home in any cornerstone you find here and there. Why is this useful? Intead of having to visit NPC's, you build your own workshops and portals in your place and use them. Plus, you get to show your friends your unique home! - It's fun to move around. You can glide, you can ride, your can skate on rails, you can sail, you can fly around sitting on a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing majestic rocket flying golden throne!- Userbase has low toxicity (for an MMO).- Game is light, highly optimized, runs great, looks good.- Good servers, low latency and downtime.- High fantasy setting with a comic twist.- Many quests to do. None of them feels grindy and they're really useful and rewarding.- The game is grindy in a way that it's doesn't make it feel so grindy. And you can always do some other stuff and have fun.- Fantastic and very rewarding crafting system which is pretty straightforward and easy to grasp without being watered down or boring.- Fun events.- Responsive staff.- Few bugs.- No need to partner up. Just go out there. The game has a unique and seamless party system that rewards nearby players with exp and loot every time someone is killing, looting or completing a quest, and it will include a limited number among the nearest players. So just go out there, find people and smash stuff together without worrying or even knowing them, the games encourages that.- You can actually convince your normie and casual friends / family and actually enjoy it together, 'cause they won't have to understand much about the game to enjoy it. It can be fun in a superficial way, and is still fun when you get more into it and dive deep into it's systems.On the other hand, there are some negative aspects:- PVP is fun, but it's very far from being the center of attention. There are no open PVP areas in the wilds, there are no turf wars or factions, there are no big battles, there's not much reward in PVP in general. People very into PVP will probably hate it.- Everything is too damn colorful. It's a matter of taste, really.- Too many notifications.- Lacks a minimap.- Character building has little depth to it.- Not much strategy involved, the game doesn't encourage you to join a clan, organize and make a plan to get things done, like killing a boss.- BGM could use some more tracks. It's always the same track for the same kind of place.- Multiple jumping makes most dungeon designs totally pointless. They should at least remove that when you enter a dungeon, it feels like you're cheating and the feeling of accomplishment is overshadowed by the fact that you're basically jumping around mindlessly and ignoring mobs 99% of the time until you get to the dungeon's last chamber.- Sometimes the camera acts like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ when you're near walls, if you're in a small room or a narrow passage.- Battlefield is a mess. Sometimes too many mobs on one place, too many skills and explosions, always too many colors...very often you can't seeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥- I feel that potions aren't the ideal approach to this game in particular. Not sure what it could be though. Maybe a new potion system, with craftable potions, recipes to collect, levels and different effects.- Dungeons very often are generated in a odd way and you loose too much time trying to find the entrance.- Classes are not balanced at all, for both PVP and PVE. Some will always stand out, while others are pretty much useless and not so fun to play.- They should add a proper dashing system so that you could move around more freely.- Not a single class can fight while mounted, even the summoners and tamers. Like wtf."",1"
"10576,Trove,2017.0,""It's a very nice game although it is Pay to Win. Players need to stop complaining and play the dam game if you don't like it too bad cuz there are plenty of players who do.

Or, you could be like me and start out with ice sage, like the worst class to start out withXD.Overall it's a great game, but if it lost the lag it would be even better.One other thing is you can build tons of stuff in trove and you can check out lots of clubworlds to see what other people built.  Some clubs have some fantastic mag rail music tracks, and others have some pretty awesome mazes and creations.  There's lots of pixel art to see too, as well as some pretty cool castles."",1"
"10592,Trove,2015.0,""Hello People... First of all it was long time ago since i made a review but ill try to keep it simple for the info that i got so far and Im a Newbie my self in the game i have played for 35 hours and some information might be incorrect and im not even near end game! ^^.At the first ppl look at the game... oh sh... its a copy of minecraft... well ITS NOT.The game is basicly allowing you to make a house where you can have your personal stuff like loot and you can spawn your house at worlds with you... you can costumize your own building how ever you want and have working bench and portals and other crafting benches... the house is personal and people can join you and have fun...What you can do in this game with friends is Going out and Farm monsters and do these Dungeons that is everywhere in the map and gain awesome loot with amazing stats in it. i would say its more like Diablo 3 farming style. you run around in dungeons and get loot and you can share items with others... the loot system is personal but if you find something nice you could take the loot and drop it to a friend if you want to :) and the loot that you get and dont need you turn them into materials for crafting. well i dont really know how to explain it better than this... i would say hey... give it a try and dont read comments like this and just jump into the game and give it a go  :) The bad thing is atm the Que Timer, but i hope they fix it really soon... its about 1-60 mins long, some times its really not showing the right time and if it says MORE than 60 mins its just lying to you... so dont trust that it can really jump and just lie that its 300 mins in que. just be patient and youll get in to the game. if you havent played TRION WORLDS game and need an account why not take my link to Recruit a friend link for the game its on my Steam page soon.AND THE GAME IS FREE GUYS! and NOT a pay to win game. just go for it!and i hope you guys understood any of what i just have written above, english is my third language and i hope you enjoyed my review and thanks for taking the time to read it! and write in comments if theres something incorrect what i wrote about the content of the game!"",1"
"10593,Trove,2017.0,""Once upon a time this was a great game. An MMO with creativity and fun mechanics. With each expansion however the game eventually revealed its treachery as a P2W money-making scam. The development team continued to add features and pay walls to limit the new player base and increase the amount of money you needed to spend to progress. The game no longer feels lighthearted and fun, but grindy and boring. AVOID THIS GAME, IT WILL CAUSE YOU ONLY HEARTBREAK."",0"
"10594,Trove,2016.0,""This game used to be fun. until they went too far with the microtransactions and basically went from customizeables and occasional pay to win, to full pay to win. everything that used to cost ingame currency, like new classes, have been thrown out the window for real cash only. I have stopped playing this game because its not the game i was interested in when i first played. it used to be a sort of childish fun with a cool rpg feel to it. Dragons were farmed for days, but no. they created eggs which i have to either fork money over for or spend months trying to earn one. Next problem the devs created, which i would go back if this got scrapped, is gems. it made no sense to me to add these in and the game would've been perfect if it stayed the way it was in november - mid december. i would not recommend this game to NEW PLAYERS, but to retturning players, i say play with the changes and see how you feel about the changes."",0"
"10595,Trove,2018.0,""The game is repetitive, grindy and pay to win. The game itself is childish and so are most of the people that play it, you can tell just from the reviews of this game that most of the people that play it are below the age of 12 and thats why the game is rated as """"Mostly positive."""""",0"

The game has come a long way since last i played it and i have gotten hooked on it again, altough i can get random crashes for no reason the game is fast to restart (annoying yes but dosent matter that much), but aslong as you send reports the issues will be fixed eventually!You can also build like in minecraft and make music and so on, there exist alot of clubs to just hang around in and explore what others have built.All in all this is a great game!"",1"
10597,Trove,2018.0,this game is just awesome the best mmo i've everyplayed so much things to do great community  had and still having alot of fun on this game its just fills my free time .however with all of these good sides the game have some extreme lag  and memory leaks i like the direction that this game is going for with those big updates. I hope for less lag and better optimazation for a better gaming expierence.,1
"10598,Trove,2016.0,""After playing almost two hundred hours i will say the game is not bad it has a lot of grind if you want to reach max level or do the endgame content at max difficult.The game is pretty easy to learn, there's not a way to customize the character passives or abilities and that makes it pretty much limited to gearing.Hear has ranks and near the top tier its pretty hard to afford one or build it, expect hundred of hours of grinding, i played for almost 180 hours and i am still far away from getting a single piece of the top tier equipment.The new Mantle of Power expansion made it even harder for people to grind, now its easier to get some good gear but still need lots of grinding for best gear and hundreds for top tier gear.The new expansion introduced gems a new """"gear"""" for people to grind even more and its worse than equipment, equipments was easier to get the status you needed on it and them all you needed was upgrade it.Gems take lots of resources to try to upgrade it, it has a chance based to upgrade / break / not upgrade, and its very bad at high level gems possible 50 more hours just to farm a good gem and it can turn into a not so good gem because the way the upgrade works.Every a few levels it will add a large amount of status to one of the three status on the gem, if it upgrade the one you dint wanted the gem will not be as good as it could, and this upgrade happens a few times on the top tier gems.Theres also the problem with the people that manages the game, they really did a good work with how the game looks and everything besides the grinding.But the costumer support is bad.They only want your money and the game is not a pay 2 win but it really encourages people to pay for things unless they want to grind hundred hours for something or pay $100+ for it.There's also the problem with things that you cant get with in game currency only with real money, and they introduced a market for people to sell almost anything for almost any currency, and now people are more encouraged to buy real money things and put it on market for in game currency that can be """"good"""" but also makes it swings more to be a PAY2WIN game.There's also the problem with LAG every now and them you will be disconected / the game will crash / that probably happens because there's to many people at the same map.Ive been playing since closed beta and open beta, also played for a month after launch and supported this game a lot, but because the problems i listed here and the costumer support i will give this a not recommended review.http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhadnar/recommended/430260As you can see on that link i brought the DLC and i received a used code and the costumer support said they will shut down my account if i try to refund it, and there's no support on steam for in game dlcs.

"10599,Trove,2018.0,""Even with the limitations of time and game engine, I still find this to be fun.

Kill the boss and take the loot5.

"10601,Trove,2015.0,""+: Combines aspects from other games in a way that makes the game truly unique in its own way.+: One of the only if any MMO's that allows you to dig on the terrarian itself (although you can't build on the terrain unless it's in your own 'cornerstone' which is basically your own portable headquarters that you craft things at).+: For an MMO this game took an interesting style of graphics that I haven't seen done before (in an MMO).+: A bunch of classes to chose from, all seeming quite different from one another.+: The game is free.+: Can be a good MMO for someone who's never played one.+: You can 'deassemble' a weapon or accessory you don't want to turn it into crafting materials that you may find more useful.(Stating this) Many reviews on here say that the problem with the game is that it takes so long to connect to servers but this has been fixed (to my understanding).-: Although there is a huge arsenal of weapons (that you are pre-assigned based on your class e.g. Shadow Archers will ONLY receive bows) none of them actually change the way you fight or for that matter give you any feeling of variety.-: You progress so quickly that an item you picked up that you may have considered to be really good at the time can quickly become outdated in terms of stats. The game tries to make you feel good with this system of constant rewards and progression although it fails because you don't actually feel accomplished.-: No storyline, NONE.-: This game is repetitive, most of your objectives in this game are basically 'kill this and receive this' or... 'mine this and receive this'.  Due to there being no storyline you find yourself asking 'why am I even doing this?!'.-: No actual quests, you have a pre-determined set of quests that every player in the entire game is also doing. You have no freedom to do what you want (that is if you want to actually make progress within the game), you MUST complete the assigned quest to move onto the next one.-: The  entire game  is randomly generated making there feel like there's nothing to actually explore, it's just randomly generated terrain and dungeons (that also seem to be very repetitive). -: You must make an account for the game itself, this isn't so bad on its own however it can be very frustrating trying to get your verification code from your email to work (both me and my friend had the problem).-: Character customization itself is bad, (not the hats, there's plenty of those). there aren't many color options, as far as physical traits just about all you can do is change your skin color (e.g. you cannot change your height, width, etc.).-: Things in the tutorial seem to be out of order, for example around my first hour of gameplay I was being being told the buttons used to attack even though I had already killed loads of enemies.-: Does not have very much music.-: All drops are marked as uncommon/rare+ when it comes to the rarity tag of an item, I've never seen a single item marked as 'common'. I feel the game does this to make you feel more accomplished.This game has/had a lot of potential, it really did. Sadly I have to say that I must give this game a 4/10 for the reasons listed above."",0"

"10603,Trove,2015.0,""I've Played this game for almost 1 years! (July 2014) And I have to say this game is amazing, I havn't found a Voxel game quite like it, Sure There's Minecraft, SkySaga, and Cubeworld, but They can't hold a flame to this game! This game gives you everything you really want, Mineing, Exploreing, MMO like feel, Loot and treasure, And then there's a whole building area.. Club worlds pretty much a Minecraft Server, but Free!Sure the game had a rough start on Steam... We beta testers knew this... it was the same way when they went from Alpha to Closed Beta.. then Closed Beta to Open Beta.. The queues were there then too.. Granted it wasn't this scale.. Steam is a very populated area, and the Dev's knew this would happen! Just give the game a few months to fix its server's and it'll be goingSpeaking of Dev's, they are some of the best I know, they may be not the most expereinced when it comes to support! and they may not always listen to the community, but when things go bad, They're on top of it within an hour trying to fix what ever the issue is, I've reported several bugs that have been fixed almost immediatly!Knock on them all you want, The Dev's from Trion are doing the best they can and I support their game!"",1"
"10604,Trove,2015.0,""A nice third-person action-rpg with randomly generated world, dungeons, loot and a fully destructible and rebuildable environment. Or a sandbox buliding/crafting mmo with rpg elements and combat.  Either way if you don't mind voxelized graphics and you're a fan of a genre you're most likely going to enjoy it for some time.While I do recommend trying this game out, it has a pretty big flaw which shortens its replayability in my opinion:Trove has a huge crafting list and literally thousands of customization options for you blocks, decorations, character equipment parts etc., I'd say this game is pretty solid in terms of 'explore, mine, craft and be creative'-thing. But when it comes to combat and RPG features - it's rather lacking. While there are plently of classes and skill mechanics are polished, each class only has 3 skills(and a class passive) which are unlocked almost immediately and... that's it. There are no talents, no item-modified special effects, no skill changes of any sort. And while equipment stats are randomized, the options are pretty limited.  I like the game so far. It offers great variety but unfortunately it lacks depth. I just wish there was more of 'RPG' in Trove."",1"
10605,Trove,2016.0,I used to love Trove. It's turned into a complete pay-to-play nightmare. They're destroying their own game. All reward and progression has been nerfed/slowed to a halt to force players into 2 choices. 1. Agonizing grinding for any progression or reward or 2. PAY ME!,0
"10606,Trove,2016.0,""I have almost 400 hours on record, in what I have always considered an awesome game. Trion took a loved artstyle, gave it a new life, and made something a lot of people have enjoyed.But then the devs got greedy, and like most F2P titles that I've HEAVILY enjoyed in the past, they've hurt the playerbase with the worse possible update they could dish out.When I first shared Trove to my friends, I made note that one of the most awesome things Trion did was make the game F2P with microtransactions that only affect how your character looks. Unlike a lot of F2P titles that furiously try and milk the community.If I was making this review 2 weeks ago, I could give it a thumbs up and recommend it. But as of today, and finding out how greedy they've become, I can do no such thing.I give this game a thumbs down, and can no longer recommend it to any of my friends.This is why we dislike microtransactions.This is why we hate greedy game devs.This is why we can't have anything nice."",0"

See people complain about them not being banned though at this point if they did ban them it would mostly likely kill the game off completely.. Its just not worth it the game isn't going to live long, unless the devs actually add some more content to the mid game which at this point itsn't going to happen. They also seem to only add new items to the store menu and call that a update seems to me they also have given up in caring about it and are just getting what money they can get out of it.They are just repeating the same things over and over again.. Just like with the rest of the games they have its always either no story or only a little story and then the rest is all just mindless grinding..

It's fast paced and easy to pick up. You do get tons of loot easily, but there is also tons of rare loot that almost no one has. There are boxes that drop after level 10(Chaos Box) that have a rare chance to give you cash shop items. So it's possible to get pretty much any cash shop item just by playing the game.I've seen no Pay to Win features all, this game probably has one of the best microtransaction systems I've seen, also many of the cash shop items are purchasable using a currency earned in game(Cubits).Once you get around lvl 15+(Uber 3 and up) the game starts to get pretty difficult. I didn't expect this with how easy the earlier worlds are, but it actually has some decent challenge. It has some good 8 man group content in Shadow Arenas, and soon they are adding Shadow Towers which I don't know the details of but I'm guessing its similar on a larger scale.I could go on but the game is Free to Play.

It is one of the games where you do not have to pay to become one of the bests, everything can be earned with legit play but it takes time, I personally love this game and I have played it so much recently I am taking a break from it, the only thing missing is pvp, but as usual great job by the devs they have half finished the pvp items, such as the portal to pvp worlds and etc. and I can't wait for it.You can choose from over 8 classes, each with unique abilites!You can form a club for you and your friends and build massive structures that appeal to other players.Very friendly community and players.Lots of fun.So many items, over 30 mounts, over 100 items for each class, over 30 badges to unlock, level 200 mastery to get to.10/10"",1"
10632,Trove,2017.0, Give it a try This game is kinda fun at a basic level and if you like minecraft + mmorpg games then this game is worth a try. I wont say much about this game as I honestly don't like it that much but that being said i cannot say it's a bad game just because I don't like it. It's a pretty good game and you should give it a try. It's just not my cup of tea.,1
"10633,Trove,2017.0,""Stable as Kim's bombs. sudden disconnects, no ddos protection, app crashes - it has it all! Guess what you get along with a ping spike from 20ms to 200ms (admit no package loss)? A disconnect!UX is myth. I swear, browsing the market has never been that hard before! I'd even say that you actually can't browse the market - it feels more like you gotta know nearly everything about the game to find something there. Making a lobotomy to the guy who designed it is now on my bucketlist.Micro-transactions! So you wanna play another class? Just go grind the loot to craft it like a nolifer. Don't wanna spend time grinding? A new class will cost you 5 EUR then. Want a bigger inventory? Maybe a bigger stash? Want to put more items for sale at once on the market? Want to unsocket the gem? Easy - just buy it with your IRL money.The most logical logic brought to you by the best logic programmers ever. You just logged into the game during the coins collection event, there's the entrance portal right in front of you which will get closed in 1 minute. Hop in! Yay, even starts, and will last for 1:30min. But you actually should waste time on it. Because once the portal will get closed and you're still in process of you coins collection run - you'll get no coins in the end. Hey, Trion Worlds, how about not generating the event instance if there's not enough time for its completion so players won't waste their time? Or maybe you should fix the logic instead, mm? Because if I'm in and I'm on it - I'll complete it. And I want my rewards for the time I invested.The most robust mechanics math! Who needs defence parameter? Right - not Trove. We're completely okay with simplifying the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and making mosters have gazillions of health, making monsters harder and players stronger by basically raising only 2 parameters - HP and DAMAGE.Newcomers friendly! I bet the first question you get after completing tutorial will be """"Where da â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ are the dungeons?""""

"10634,Trove,2018.0,""Well i have not much to say to give it a good review.But its a great time to spend on.And fun blocky game to play.But it gets boring over the time.I never had to contact the staffs for any in-game issues. what i mostly experience was graphics glitches, But not much to care about.The game materials are difficult to get(some).Characters takes a lot of time to lvl up and depending on how you play.The company plus players are a bit greedy.The chat is hilarious sometimes to read when people are trash talking. (Also contains nsfw sometimes and that isn't nice)And the lag has become more unstable over the years unfortunately. Which is annoying.The rest. Idk what more to say.That's it."",1"
10635,Trove,2018.0,the game is very fun at first but after a while it become obvious its pay to win for more characters mounts ect. if you dont want to spend any money its a long boring grind that gets very boring after a while and its the same thing for everything in the game with just a couple new enimies and some new drops.,0
"10636,Trove,2017.0,""So, here's a review other than most of my other reviews. Not gonna make a list of what I did to try and get into the """"funny"""" section, just gonna give an honest summary. I downloaded this game a few years ago and played it with my friend. It was very fun, other players were very friendly, and I got a toaster on a metal rod for a weapon (with toast inside the toaster, it actually did aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ton of damage for some reason). I don't know why, but I deleted it. Just a couple of weeks ago, I downloaded it again to see if I could relive some of those fun moments. It was horrible. The 12-year olds were more common than in Roblox, and they were really rude. They killed me every single time they saw me, and they did a lot of flaming, too. I was just amazed and horrified at what this game has become. It's pretty much a mix of just Roblox and Minecraft now, except with a ton more limits onto what you could do."",0"
"10637,Trove,2017.0,""A really great yet not so complex mmorpg game Trove is a unique game to the genre not only due to it's graphics which might remind you of other popular games like MC but also because it is a game both young and old audiences can enjoy and learn from , an example of this is my little brother who played this game as his 1st mmorpg and now can even try out games that i couldn't in his age due t a lack of knowledge . I recomend this game 100% for all audiences since it is family friendly and fun to play at any age"",1"
"10638,Trove,2015.0,""This is honestly a very good and addicting game, its fun and enjoyable. But there is some down sides sadly...-------------------------Pros:- Its not a minecraft clone, far from it.- The amount of weapons in the game is really nice :)- There is no """"p2w"""" Sure there are opitions of spending real world money but you don't need to.Cons:- They need more servers, the 1000+ Queues are insane.- They need more actions i guess? Instead of just three main attacks."",1"
"10639,Trove,2017.0,""Trove of adventures!As i'm sure everyone would say after playing this game, where should I begin?Graphics:If I had to say, I wouldn't say top notch. The graphics is okay, they can bug you. Minecraftish style but not as bad. There is alot more animation's, alot more detail. Do not take this the wrong way. The game hasn't done wrong, it feels right in a blocky sense of way.Gameplay:Fantastic, that's what I say. The gameplay makes up for alot within the game. You can find alot to do. The recent ingame changes are also very nice. New level caps also I noticed. I know Trove gets some nice updates and some odd ones. Either way you cut the cake, you might still get cherries ontop. What I mean is, the updates normally consists of cons n pros, depending on wether you like cherries or not, some cons to others are pros. I honestly can't say how much gameplay there is while describing each one. It is just too much. You'll have to read more about it if you don't already know much. Basic gameplay is both creative and adventure. You will want friends or a club world to help out. You can own your own worlds, house, pets. You can wear any decoration, infact, the loot collector and item hunting is very uniqe making you as a player want to find every piece. Each piece you collect is saved & can be overlayered on set equipment. Base game rewards, item shop, minor NPC support. Alot to keep you going. It is mostly PvE, PvP is a thing too.SoundFX:While being blocky in a block like world, you'd expect the characters of the world to sound different. They have nailed this. Music and sounds are pretty good. I'd have to say it wasn't expected but yes, the game sounds are good. The basic attack or hit sounds however is the same old sound, some soundFX are loopy.PTW or FTP?:This is one of the big concerns when entering a FTP game. Yes, it is FTP. 100%The great thing about trove is how much they actually have to offer FTP. They don't charge you for club worlds or properties, they don't charge you for alot that they could or other games had or do now. The PTW options are minor but continues to support the servers. As any game, PTW has the options to speed up you're progress towards the game or simply for cosmetic styles. It is simply a choice. Do you enjoy the game? Do you feel it is under valued? Do you feel like the devs did decent work? Questions you ask yourself may lead to you spending a few bucks. But by all means, it is only optional, the choices we're in control to make. The game I'd have to say is FTP.Personnal notes:This isn't survival, nor is it up to the standards of graphics these days. It is something I do enjoy playing so I must recommend it. Creativity lovers will really enjoy Trove as most already have. I do suggest playing Trove, espeacially if you don't mind low end graphics with high gameplay value. Be warned, it is a MMO, it is a RPG. put these two together, you got yourself a cracked egg. The game can be very addictive as any MMORPG.Graphics:5.0SoundFX:6.0Funfactor:7.5Overall:6.5Edited reasons:Added ratings belowFixed descriptions"",1"
"10640,Trove,2017.0,""At first when i played this game i wont lie, i got hooked,i couldnt stop playing at all.Trove is a really fun game but it is very time consuming.To me this game is kind of a love hate relationship.But from the ammount of hours that ive invested into this game i can tell you,i would definetly recommend this game to anyone.Here are some of the pro's and cons about the game(just in my opinion)Pros:-Very Addicting,Always something to do-lots of new content being uploaded into the game-Unique variety of classes, each one gives you a whole new experience -Promotes creativity-Fun with friends-Not p2w(more so pay to boost fast)-Pvp is fun(only when your power rank is over 4500 at least)-Easy character customization(same with weapon and gear customization)Cons:-Servers lag and throw you around the map/game(also may result in being forced out of game)-Gets repetative, might need to take breaks from it now and then.-Requires alot of farming and grinding, especially when you hit lv 20 in game( also for in game money, gear,mounts,etc)-Servers are down lots.Its a really great game, when you can actually play it from servers being derpy :P  "",1"

"10642,Trove,2016.0,""This is a really good game, but recently it has taken a VERY Wrong turn. Before it was an amazing MMO-Class based game. But, all good things come to an end.

It was an amazing and beautiful game. Me and my friends used to play it All the time. But now, well, i haven't played in a couple months. And I had almost 90 hrs on Record."",0"
10643,Trove,2016.0,My honest review of the game.1. If you don't plan on spending real money be prepared to grind doing the same things over and over like you have never done before. There is more grinding in this game than there is in a strip club.2. It is made by Trion so expect them to slowly make the game more and more pay to win just like they did ArchAge. I still cry every time.3. For example they have removed the ability to buy classes with cubits earned in game so now you either grind your @ss off for them or you spend real money for them (which most kids will just get their parent's card and buy the classes to feel cool and Trion knows this which is why they cost real money now).,0

"10645,Trove,2016.0,""I used to love Trove, it was such a fun game but the developers just turned completely greedy. Sure, you can still unlock classes for free but now everything is such a huge, boring grind and it's just not fun to play anymore. :( If you change Trove back to the way it was months ago, I would certainly consider coming back but currently, it is so bad!"",0"
"10646,Trove,2017.0,""This game is a 3D pixel game, but it's one of it's kind. It has many different classes for you to get, choose, or buy. The game has a very good trading system which many people can enjoy. The Shadow Tower, and other bosses can be challenging and fun, and will need a good setup with some friends to beat, but you can also just solo it for an even bigger challenge. In my opinion, this game is very good, but there is one downside: it isn't that optimized and has terrible ping, but I don't get that issue much because I have a good computer. So I do recomend anyone to try this game, it is free and won't cause any harm,  I do think that you should try it and see if the ping effects you. But all in all, I do enjoy it and recomend anyone to play it!"",1"
"10647,Trove,2018.0,""This game is honestly pretty fun, but it gets extremely grindy super quickly, which is a big reason why I stopped playing.  It's just constantly """"Go into dungeons and kill the same easy bosses in"""" over and over again.  The game is definitely a lot more fun with friends, so if youre gonna get this game, convince one of your friends to get it too, because otherwise it's just really repetitive and tedious after about level 20."",0"
"10648,Trove,2018.0,""This game, although being around a very cube-like style like other games... (Minecraft, Cube World, Etc.)is atleast 85% different and unique in it's own way. Here are some pros and cons.Pros*  There are many classes to chose from, ranging from a flying fairy-like woman, to a barbarian that wears and uses candy as a weapon. * There is an rpg aspect to the game, having to mainly break through dungeons and beat bosses to earn loot. You can also goto a city of neon lights and ask around for quests (From different creatures around the city) to earn points and things you can use in some shops to buy items.* Endless fun. This game has so many things to do in it that it's to the point of almost endless gameplay. There are so many classes to level up, there are mastery points which can be earned to get a mastery rank which can get you cool prizes. there are club worlds you can make to hang out with friends or build, there are hundreds of styles of clothing  and costumes for your character, and so much more. I can't even start to explain everything.* Not 100% pay to win. There are alot of things that you can buy easily, but can craft in game with just more difficulty.Cons* Some things are a little too pricy, and can't be crafted in the game. (Have to spend money on game if you want to get something fast, etc.)* Making progress starts off easy, and then becomes extremely hard. Making a learning curve that exponentially increases but sudden decreases at high rates, making you want to quit the game and not come back for awhile.* Options have no graphic settings, making it hard for slow-computered people to even play* Even while using a good PC or a good PS4, this game still lags a ton and can be quite annoying.* Cool things take EXTREMELY notice i said EXTREMELY long to get if you don't want to pay for it.

10649,Trove,2016.0,I loved this game back when it came out and it always ran smoothly on my desktop and laptop. I got it back when it was early access and I racked up 273hrs on my old account.

I would recommned it back when it was not so laggy and money based but i dot recommend it now that it is extreamly laggy and its staff dosent care about the game except for the scraps of money it pulls in off of players,0

"10652,Trove,2017.0,""This game was really fun when I started and I played it a lot, but it has become a P2W game. The gems are pure RNG. If you don't wanna pay to get a dragon you have to grind a LOT for them. The servers are really bad. This game had a lot of potential but they ruined it. I only recommend the game if you don't mind the grind and RNG. "",0"
"10653,Trove,2015.0,""Edit#6 5/8/2018After my stuff got into the game. I can uninstall it for good.This game itself has no sign for the performance issue getting fix.\The direction of the game just purely pushing the player to pay e.g. paid pack which contained the item that required a massive grinding and mostly involved RNG(luck)A good example is the Vanguardian class (pack and the class) being require a massive grind just for the class alone also its costumes which included in the paid pack. The costume can be acquired buy crafting but it cost just so expensive compared to other costume from the same theme. It's just a sign of pushing the player to buy a pack or just shut up and keep grinding. and these also applied to newer pack as well. The good part of the recent update can only be the Bomber Royale. Geode also a mess of rushing for those promotion of paid packs.Edit#5 20/7/2017 total playtime over 6k [glyph and steam combie] RNG being reduced but adding to of Time gated system. you wil take like almost year to reach maxed power and many RNG adding back to Mastery item also new log in system if you're going for mastery you need to pay alot to catching up in power as well , still want to recommed? no unless you have feeling of P2W and dominated everything for few weeks then get bored and uninstall.

"10654,Trove,2015.0,""Short version: Prepare to sink in a lot of hours to progress but at least you can dress really pretty and have dragons :DPROS:- Variety of activities (fishing, gardening, mining, etc)- Different classes each with their own combat style and you can build however you want to fit your play style- Cosmetics (endless amounts of different community created cosmetics always being added)- DRAGONS! You can craft dragons over time and when you get them to legendary status they can shoot fireballs. Collecting dragons grants you permanent stat bonuses that go across all your classes- The community for the most part is really friendly and helpful. Obviously you'll never fully get away from trolls but there isn't much that they can do. Clubs can be really helpful especially since they added in new perks- There's literally any chat for whatever you want like for finding dragons and for shadow towers- ALL THE LOOT IS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PLAYER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT OTHER PEOPLE FOR STUFF- A full functioning market - Trading system- Progression feels really good as there are a lot of milestones to reach that feel very satisfying whether it be reaching a pr (power rank) goal or finally getting stellar gear or rolling your first perfect gem - Map sizes are huge so there's plenty to explore- You don't have to pay to progress in the game (I'll mention later)- Very easily play with friends if you want but playing solo is perfectly fine- When you progress far enough fighting huge bosses in the shadow towers- The music changes with every biome that you visit - PVP forces everyone to have a standardized level so that everyone fights fairly- Every day has a different bonus which makes it much more efficient to farm that specifically on that day (ie grinding gems on gem day, fishing on harvest day, etc.)- People who love building massive structures and sculptures (think minecraft) will have a great time with the amount of different props you can build- There are always events to get free stuff or having extra bonuses (streams, seasonal, or random)- Overall the game isn't very difficult to learn and most of the time if you have a question multiple people will answer you very quickly.- FLYING! okay it's more of gliding but it's close enough- Sailing, comes with many different boats and sails. Some come with a fire-able cannon - Daily login loot (You don't even need to do anything you just login and get free stuff)- Everything in the world is destructible so if you know the structure of the dungeons you can easily break a wall or two and fight the boss and leave- Shadow towers have a giant titan to fight which is a nice change of pace to regular mobs - Getting class gems usually give a massive boost in to the specific class (Shadow hunter bow shoots like a machine gun, Pirate captain gets a parrot cannon, etc)Cons:- This game takes endless amount of grinding for items and gems- Flux (main currency) takes a while to accumulate- Late game when you're trying to max out a character it all comes down to getting perfect gems which are 100% RNG. You have to keep farming for more gems if you don't have the one you want. Class gems are no different- The servers are god awful some days and lag you out no matter what computer you are running which leads to super long server loading times, rubberbanding your character all over the place when casually exploring, and my favorite, when you fight a whole horde of enemies and no matter how you hit them, your attacks dont register, but luckily theirs do so you end up dying. - Takes a while to get up to speed where you actually do damage to things- No real story to Trove, it's just get stronger to kill the stronger versions of enemies- biomes (although randomly generated) have the same procedural buildings so eventually you grow tired of seeing the same dungeon over and over- Dragon coins are basically only attainable through dailies so it takes a long time to accumulate- Mining veins are randomly generated so sometimes you can hit the jackpot or fly around for an hour without seeing any of the things you need- Dragon fireballs are pretty weak and the ship cannons are just pathetic - Pay 2 Win, So a lot of people will argue that the game is very pay to win. While technically it can be viewed as a pay to win game I personally don't think it is. There's no real story and no extra content you can reach by paying. All areas are 100% completely free and even if you were to purchase gem boxes with real money you'd obviously have more chances to get better gems but in the end it's all down to RNG so someone can roll a perfect gem on their first try and someone can drop $100 to buy boxes and never get anything decent :/ which can be frustrating. I personally have only spent $20 on this game and that was cause I thought a cosmetic (MIGHT I ADD, IS ATTAINABLE THROUGH THE FLUX MARKET) that I was too lazy to farm flux for. You can purchase classes immediately with money and a lot of them come with packages that include cosmetics and various other things but they added a system where you can craft classes now. The old system you had to find class coins (which weren't too rare due to events) to unlock a class. Obviously, for new players, it takes some time to unlock all the classes but not too difficult in the grand scheme of things. But yeah paying just allows someone to buy their way through some progression (getting a lot of flux to buy gear from people, unlocking styles from the market)."",1"

"10656,Trove,2016.0,""Pretty decent game. I've only played the game for 12 hours and I could say that it's something worth to check out! Easpically since it's free to play. Sometimes it gets over reptitive, to get more power rank you need to complete dungeons or castles and open up the chests after you kill the boss/s. This is mainly what the game consists off. So sometimes it may become boring. Otherwise the game is perfect! I've played with friends and i've got to tell you that it's much more fun with friends. It's fun to grind the game, it's like a kids version of Neverwinter. The cornorstones spawn in great places and your cornorstone saves by itself! You can fight random mobs while free roaming, and once in a while a miniture boss spawns near you. So with my overall expierence, I would definitely rate this game a 8.5/10."",1"

"10661,Trove,2017.0,"" It's basically  """"Grind Some More""""  - THE GAME. No story, naration or plot. P2W elements are present. However, it does have some things going well for it. +Interesting and various Classes+Wide Variety of Dungeons+Tons upon tons of Collectibles: Mounts, """"Pets"""", Boats, Wings, Gear Appearances, Weapon Appearances +Crafting, Upgrades+And in case you're wondering, no, it has nothing to do with Minecraft Unfortunately, it's  repetative  . The only goal in this game is to grind up until you max everything out (if possible), so you can grind (even more) at a slightly faster pace. It's PvE. PvP is bad and unsatisfying.And as mentioned, it IS Pay-To-Win, even though you can earn everything through, guess what - grinding. Even the currency, purchased with real money, can be obtained through playing, it just takes a LOT of time.It takes some dedication to continue playing after a certain level, as there are difficulty spikes, quite possibly to make you buy upgrades on their store in order to move on, but everything is doeable, especially if you group up with a friend or two. The reason why I'd recommend Trove is because it's Free To Play, there is constant progression and tons of collectibles, plus it's appealing to gamers who fancy their grindy-looty games.  After a long day, I find myself logging on for a few dungeons and destroying some pixels. All in all, I've had a good time. "",1"

There are so many things to do, you can build, make decorations grind for exp and more. The graphics are also pretty good for games like this, simple and nice to see. It's very grindy but still fun, since you're not just farming monsters, but also go around mining and crafting, there is also minigame every 1 hour.ConsThere is almost no con in the gameplay itself for me, but the very sad thing is the performance of this game. I have a good connection and currently stable ping, but when i play i get thrown back here and there (teleported cause of lag). This is very annoying especially when playing the minigame where you have to collect a lot of coins within the time limit, and sometimes you just get confused where you're right now. Not just that, the world rendering is very slow too, especially if you go to places with no player, you have to wait for the world to render, and walk again and wait again, this is very annoying.I can't recommend this game cause the good gameplay just makes you want to play more but the bad performance makes you hate it more, leaving you with the feeling of wanting to play but can't."",0"

"10666,Trove,2018.0,""I enjoyed putting many of my hours into farming and gearing up my character. However, most of that enjoyment did not originate from the actual content of the game, but rather from playing and talking with all the great people i have met. Being an officer in my main club was a great experience and I even play other games now still with my friends found in trove. Once my club died, I saw that Trove had merely been a medium for me to play with those people. The gameplay is dull and monotone, developers hardly put any work into new content (atleast it feels like that to me) and the pay-to-win aspect of the cash shop has influenced the market so much that my once wealthy account's cash is now worth a few scraps. I stopped playing this game about half a year back (or more, dont remember) and everytime I log back in just to see what has changed, I am horrified by all the new """"content"""" that has been added (mostly just reskins and cash shop stuff)So yes, I think this game should'nt be as popular as it is, and yes, I am giving it a bad review, BUT...I actually do encourage you to pick up this game!

You can really explore beyond limits on this game!Least favourite feature: This may just be my friend's and my opinion, but... I think that some items are asking for too much materials to be crafted, or too rare materials. I suppose it will keep you searching and exploring.

"10670,Trove,2018.0,""Small review from a newbiePretty alright game, and I'll get to my little review on it - starting with the cons. Cons: (Optimization/Microtransactions)The main issue's the horrible optimization of the servers, including how it's pretty difficult to get through the early stages by playing freely.(Simply put, it's a game where they'll probably try to milk you for all you have, unless you get very lucky with the RNG)A couple bugs here and there - all being somewhat annoying, but not the worst thing out there. Pros: (Community/Map/Building)Helpful community, pretty funny at times.  Fun map to explore, but it can be tedious to travel around so much - not even being able to teleport back to your cornerstone.. (This one's a con, and a pro - depends on how you like to play)Freely building on/in your cornerstone is a nice feature, along with the items you can later get to upgrade the appearance of it. Lots of freedom to build whatever you'd like, in all honesty. Feel free to give it a try, I'd recommend it. "",1"

"10672,Trove,2016.0,""I may be a little biased here, but Trove wasn't a great experience for me.Now, I'm not saying don't get it (mostly because it's free ((for now.)) ) But when I played it for an idle two hours, I got bored fairly quickly. Sure, the worlds are pretty, and I like the 3D cube style along the likes of Minecraft. But the gameplay is repetitive. In my brief session, I rocketed up to the highest level rank, and it wasn't even that different. I felt no motiviation to upgrade my house or tools, or even try out other classes. Also, the building blocks are really uninspired. All they have are 'color' primal blocks and ores. At least, that's all I found naturally. Mining was tedious, dying was easy, and the combat wasn't polished.Hey, maybe it updated and got better since I played, and hey, maybe some people like this tedious adventure. But as for me, I don't think I'll pick it up again.4.5/10 would not dig again"",0"

"10685,Trove,2017.0,""I honestly really like this game, which makes me a bit sad to see most of the helpful reviews are the negative ones. I mean yes, the negative reviews are almost always correct with issues like optimization, constant crashes, and a hard difficulty curve and grind one has to do to overcome it. But I would still definitely give this game a recomendation, as this is possibly one of the most fun games I've played in a while.To put it simply, Trove is like if Minecraft and CubeWorld had a child. It has the amazing combat system that CubeWorld had (Albeit, far less unbalanced, as CubeWorld's balancing was borderline unforgiving,) and the creativity perks of Minecraft, with a portable home (Or Cornerstone, as it's called) that can be pretty much anything you set your mind to. And it works amazingly as a game, I've spent countless hours both creating bases and exploring the worlds, fighting monsters.The main gameplay mechanics are dungeon crawling and building your base. Dungeon crawling gives you loot, which can help you get both stronger and more stuff to customize with. There are numerous biomes, all very unique and fun to explore (My personal favorites being Candoria and the Fae Wilds,) and there's even a mining mechanic with different ores and even recipes you can find.There are also numerous classes to play as, with different playstyles and strategies to play around with. They're all very easy to get used to, and very creative in some regards as well. You're limited to picking a limited number as a starter, but as you go along, you'll be able to unlock the others, either by gathering the material, earning class tokens, or if you really want to, buying them with real money.The game also features a chat system you switch between. In fact, it has a chat where literally everyone can see, no matter what world they're on, which is extremely useful for both finding/selling gear, and asking for help or likewise giving help. However, it does have its share of spambots and elitists, but with every positive, there is a negative.And storywise, you won't experience anything in game as of writing that contains a story. The opening cinematic is as much story as I've been able to find, and it makes me sad, since it does have a premise of being interesting. The idea is that the worlds you explored are shattered remains of a once glorious realm, having been broken apart to save the people from the wrath of the Moon Goddess, seeking to destroy the world in envy for her sister, the Sun Goddess, and her creation.However, as much as I love the game, there are some pretty nasty issues to address. One is the extremely unstable nature of the servers. They crash EXTREMELY often, especially on the Dinosaur biomes. If they aren't crashing though, prepare for rubber-banding or delays with lag. The fact the servers are this unstable despite being a game with what I presume to be a steady playbase and income is very upsetting.Two, it is quite pay encouraging in the later game. While it is possible to go with the game without paying, it's VERY slow and grind-filled unless you dish out some cash. It does seem to have gone down a more player-friendly slope recently, especially with the ability to craft classes now, but it's a very long grind.And third, after a while, you may find it simply hard to continue. While the combat is fun and the dungeons are very creative, you'll eventually see it all and find no real encouragement to play. They have added some variant versions of the hourly challenges, and minigames seem to be on their way, so hopefully this may be resolved soon to encourge more people to play longer.Overall, yes, the game has a plethora of problems. But even with it, the game's creativity and addictive nature has left me with hours of enjoyment, and one I would recommend to at least try out."",1"

"",0"
"10691,Trove,2018.0,""I really can't recommend Trove. It's a massive grindfest and little else. There's a lot of variety in visuals, but the core gameplay is extremely basic and if you play for 10 minutes you've seen just about all the game has to offer in gameplay mechanics.There's an absolutely silly amount of cosmetics to be found, and I can appreciate that they are largely cosmetic, for example there are hundreds of different mounts, but there are only ten or so that are truly unique in some way, and those unique things only very rarely give a gameplay benefit. All the hats and faces and weapons are randomly generated, and you can wear any style you've obtained previously over your equipment, so an ugly hat with good stats is easily covered up.However, all these visuals don't solve the main problem with the game, that being the awful power creep and scaling issues. Progression has changed a lot since release, but basically at this point you are going to be opening RNG lootboxes hoping you get good gems that push your power level high enough to get to the next tier of content so you can get better gems to get to the next tier etc. until you get to the last tier and content ends. Not that there's new content at the last tier (or the three tiers before it), since the game recycles all the content it has through all tiers. Tier really only means how big your numbers are, the enemies and gameplay don't change. Many classes simply have the playstyle of """"Point at enemy, Hold M1, Tap M2 / 1 when you have energy, Tap 2 whenever it's available"""" with nothing more than that. It gets old fast, and having to pay cash or wait for extremely rare drops to unlock new classes is the pits.Plus, because the game has been running so long, the economy is set in such a way that buying endgame equipment from other players is far less expensive and strenuous than making it yourself. You can spend days trying to find and collect all the materials you need to level up your equipment, or you can just buy it from someone else. I spent weeks and several thousand flux trying to build up my gear myself, and I got to where the stuff I needed to make myself stronger was unobtainable because I wasn't strong enough yet. That's some bad design. When I finally caved and went to trade chat it blew me away how trivial it was to just buy what I needed rather than go through the designed methods to make them yourself. I mean, Trove is just Minecraft with less building and a MMO skin. You can mine and craft and build but nothing you build really has purpose. The cornerstone aspect is nice, being able to have your own personal chunk of land you can teleport into the world, and I've sunk many many hours into decoration, but it's all for cosmetic purposes. I enjoy seeing what other people have built, and there's so much that people have built. There are guild worlds that people have clearly spent significant amounts of time building, and there's so many people playing that you can always find something new that someone has built.I'd say Trove is a children's MMO. It's simple. It can be fun, but after a while the fun dries up and only the grind remains. It's more of fast paced and exciting than Minecraft is, but that's not too hard to accomplish. If you really like Minecraft and want something similar, Trove is a decent pick, but it's just so shallow. It's a good game if you don't want to think too hard."",0"

"10694,Trove,2018.0,""As an Australian player, I have played Trove since before Candy Barbarian came out. Everything was so smooth and great. I came back after a few years, a lot has changed. There is good changes mostly. Although I have the feeling that Trove turned luck into greed when it comes to upgrading/levelling your character classes. They could have handled the world system better but the atlas is a nice touch though but I miss having the random world generated spawning and all that (Haven't tested the worlds when I got back on because I disconnect a lot now). I disconnect a lot more than usual now. If Trove has an oceania server and I was connected to it, then this must be a poor server but if there wasn't, then they should probably have at least one. Just today I have tried going into the coin challenge and I always disconnect which is a downsider because I wanted to see what was the challenge was like.. I assume its similar to super mario and coins spawn to collect? I was in one of my clubs world, and I was building.. Minutes after.. Disconnection. Come on, Trion Worlds.. Do you want me to stay or go? Which one is it? So I believe at this time.. I cannot recommend this to anyone until a server upgrade is made for those who doesn't have fast internet like America or UK or whoever has better internet than Australia. A smooth game = A fun environment. Disconnecting game = Reason to let it go.  For those who can stay connected well and stable enough to play smoothly..

"10710,Trove,2016.0,""The game was of a mediocre kind of Dungeons and Dragons Skyrim sort of Minecraft knock-off, but it was fairly on the better side of knock-offs, but that's also one of many reasons why I'm giving it a bad review.  The game itself is fairly fun, minus the ungodly amount of lag, and all the in-app purchases keeping you from having too much fun.  Now I will talk about the controls.  If it were for IOS, or ANDROID, I would have let this go, but the """"controls"""" barely controlled anything, much less everything.  Personally, I'm not very biased against knock-off F2P games, but it was just too impossible to play without the egregious amount of IAPs, and without a solid controller option.All in all, I'd give this game a 2/10, and would recommend nearly any game over this virtually unplayable game without hackers(and there are plenty of those).1/10(with hackers)"",0"
"10711,Trove,2016.0,""""""It gets boring after about 300 hours"""" - meTrove is a F2P, semi-P2W sugar rush. I had a lot of fun with my 300 hours in the game. I played it all through the beta with a lot of my friends. The game is not deep, but it's not trying to be. It's meant to be a grindfest. It's meant to be casual fun with friends. The combat is pretty good. The building is not great, but it's decent. There's a lot to do in Trove, but it does all sort of feel empty because, at the end of the day, it is a sugar rush.I'm bored of it now, but I can't very well give it a thumbs down after enjoying it for a solid 300 hours. The game is not perfect, but I think it's a safe recommendation to anyone who is interested in a casual and grindy MMO with block building."",1"
"10712,Trove,2018.0,""330+ hours on here, but i think around 1k more on glyph, progressively makes yourself wanna neck the more time you put in, but once you get to what you think is the light at the end of the tunnel it's pretty chill. There's a quite a hefty lock that holds the P2W of the game, and you can force through it but the game does a really good job of making it seem worth it, which most of it isn't. I don't really know whether to say i recommend or don't recommend it, but i think for the miniscule size and F2P, you have nothing to lose, if you like it, that's good, if you don't, don't force yourself because it will be a horrible time."",1"
"10713,Trove,2017.0,""A decent game for the first few hours, then you realise that the later game is the first few hours over and over again. Dungeons are noticeably repeated, as is the world layout and enemies. The game becomes an infinite grind, and the grind isn't even fun because you will be grinding the same thing over and over. This is a shell of a game, not a finished project. Avoid."",0"

You used to be able to get classes without paying in"
"10716,Trove,2017.0,""Do you like adventure? Do you like to explore huge worlds? Like fighting monsters to gain loot? Like fighting other people around the world? Do you like clubs? Do you llike dragons? If so this may be the game for you to play.Pros: (1.) Great visuals/graphics in game. (2.)This game is great for those who like adventuring games and for those who like competition games. There are in-game modes, such as PvP or Shadow Towers.  (3.) Explore new worlds taking on new dungeons and as you level up your character level and gear you can go to higher and tougher difficulty worlds getting access to worlds with gems (to further upgrade your character's stats) and new items. (4.) Daily challenges to earn rewards and do dungeons to earn rewards and loot. (5.) Make your own club or join other in-game clubs, start gathering materials to make your own legendary dragon mount, or take on Shadow Towers to get lots of loot. (6.) The Trove devs have life streams on Twitch, if you have time watch them to gain knowledge on upcoming updates or changes to the game and if your lucky enough you may win really rare in-game items or mounts, such as the rare legendary bird Ganda. (7.) Team up with others to make your game easier. Only downside is how the devs keep changing the game mechanics, this would become a great game if they minimized making frequent changes (most of the changes in-game become beneficial to you) Cons:(1.) Many people who have played this game may agree that they have experienced this while playing this game. Which is known as lag. This has been a problem for awhile in Trove. Even after some patches and fixes some people still continue to experience lag. If you do not like lag this may not be the game for you.(2.) There are some toxic people in this game who may target you for being a person that has just started the game. Expect some people to say insults to put you down.(3.) There are also scammers and spammers in this game. They seem to offer you a good deal but once you hand over what they want, they will either not give you anything back or give you something you did not want.(4.) The game does have major updates once in a while and can impact your gameplay. Some people dislike this.(5.) The game over time has become more of a pay to win game. This had a negative influence and is drawing some people away from playing the game. (Ahh did you miss the free items we gave back awhile go? Guess what you can still get it by paying real money for it!) (Oh do you like this? Well you are going to need money for it). For example, characters previously were able to be bought with in game materials (it was very easy to get more characters), but now you have to pay real money to obtain classes you don't already have or you can make the classes but that requires many materials and that brings up the next con.(6.) Grinding/Farming. This has become a foundation for this game. This annoys many people and may be the reason why the person does not play this game. If you want to become at the top of the game you are going to have to go through this. Want to reach the max level? Guess what you are going to fight enemies for a few hours just to level up once. Want a mount that you like? You are going to have to spend some time getting the materials you need to get it.Information:(1.) Trove does not offer refunds for things bought with real money in game. You could possibly get in contact with them.Overall still a fun game to play despite the cons."",1"

"10718,Trove,2015.0,""This is my first time reviewing a game and the only reason i am doing this is because many mmo's on steam are very simular and most of the time, badly produced and executed but this game is an exception on that stereotype, here's why:The game is really fun and surprises you in some categories, the combat is surprisingly fun even though im just holding down a button and using my special moves from time to time.The building is super in depth but it may not look like it at the beggining, there are insane ammounts of decorative blocks and objects to place in your clubworld/cornerstoneThe levelling system is what you would expect, its quite slow but if you dont mind spending some time into the game to level.Here's where it gets complicated, at the start, the levelling is super fast and fun however, i found my self spending a few hours just clearing dungeons from time to time and started getting repetetive, but where i am now is the reason i had to write this review, i wont spoil it but you get some cool stuff and you no longer are clearing dungeons to level, you always have your own personal goal to do and have a normal goal too. this made it so i was distracted from the tideous parts of the game and now focused on the personal quests and goals and awesome parts of the game.

Trove is a really good game because of it's classes, story, armor and dyes, and monsters and all types of diffucult creatures that can be 18x the size of your charater.

"10732,Trove,2015.0,""Trove is a pretty fun game, until you get to the later levels, where it becomes a complete grind fest. There's very little actual gameplay content in the game. Basically, the game consists of farming dungeons, mining, and farming biomes for crafting resources. There's plenty ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥to unlock, but most of the things you unlock don't really feel all that special, for example, the mounts in this game all have the same stats, so there's no point to getting more of them.The endgame in this game is non-existent, consisting of """"Shadow Arenas"""" and the Sky Realm, both which are still just places to grind.It's fun for a couple hours, so that's why I reccommended it. People say it's addicting, and for the first 10-20 hours it's fun, but the constant grinding becomes repetitive and boring after a while. In short: If you like grinding, get this game.If you don't, try this game out anyways, it's free.Also, don't be fooled by the 200mb download. You still need to download about 600mb through """"Glyph"""", Trion Worlds own launcher. It's garbage, but it's not a deal-breaker."",1"

I liked being able to drop into a power level range and see all sorts of different types of biomes instead of just having the biomes correlate to certain power level ranges like they do now.

In response to the downtimes from player overloads, the Trion devs gave us one of the rarest chests in the game. 8 times!TLDR: This game is awesome, not P2W and the devs actually care.

All I can say is that Pay2Win business models are always a bad idea and it sucks that this game has gone this way. Once I would have said to buy some stuff because of how well they where handling the microtransaction system and give them a fair shake but now that they've gone full Ebenezer Scrooge I have to say that you shouldn't give them a single cent. If they where to fix their business model I would say it's worth going back but as it is now I cannot just let them trample all over the players that helped them get so far.,0

"10744,Trove,2015.0,"" My review Possibly one of the best free to play MMOs out there. This game can be REAL addictive if you have set yourself a goal that is long to acquire. Or just have fun. Judging from what I've heard about Cube World, this is what Cube World should've been.This game has so much loot, easy to find ore and other most noticable MMO elements. Credits which are premium currency are for boosts, mounts and other non pay to win stuff. If you want a good class, I suggest the Neon Ninja. The Neon Ninja is an easy class to master in my opinion. Slash the enemy a couple of times, stealth then throw shurikens. Please do know that you MUST use basic attacks on the enemy in order to generate shurikens. Shurikens deal good damage. The only con that I can think of is the queue-ing."",1"
10745,Trove,2017.0,The game used to be abosuletly amazing. Every day I would come on to collect my star bonus and over a few weeks I would have myself a new character to play and level up. Now the only way to get characters is to pay money. I (as like lots of other players) like to play games that are 100% free and i think that the game has been completely ruined. The game has so much potential if it just makes it possible to buy characters with coins again but keep the option to buy them with the premium currency. The potential is there and can easily be reached.,0

You used to be able to get them for playing. Just for playing every day, you would get a specific currency with which you could buy more classes. play for a couple weeks every day, and you would have a new class. WHich would be great, if it still existed. Every feature I liked about the  game has been removed, glazed over, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ or simply removed. The game is utter sh!t now.

10760,Trove,2016.0,its SO annoying to get to a part of this game to have fun all it is a pay to win to me.and its neet and all but the more changes they make the worse it gets to me.(would say some thing here but Trion worlds knows why i hate this game a lot more) so i dont think you should get this oh and its a pay to win so dont get it,0
10761,Trove,2015.0,Breaks country consumer laws. U get banned for saying something small as gtfo. And well more crap to say but at this point im just addicted to the grind of this game. While i can in no way recommend this game to anyone.,0
"10762,Trove,2015.0,""I love this game! It's just perfect. The items, the classes, the style... This is a game I dreamed of. You can't get bored, (SPOLIER kinda) but after a while when your challenges turn to mastery 20, mastery 30, it's not that exiting. Anyways, I recommend this game to everyone who likes these kind of games."",1"

"10764,Trove,2016.0,""So when you first start this game you think """"Woah so much content"""" but usually it only takes about a few months to get litrally everything in the game. This is why you only see new players, the people who have played this game for so long usually quit after a few weeks, because its easy to accomplish so much (kind of like skyrim if you play it alot without mods)But i like this game because, people who are new to MMORPG games can learn from this (even though the interface is different)By the time you see this review, im probably still working my way up too my goalMy goal you ask?Im trying to complete everything (like every portal, boss, dungeon, get every gear, highest level with all classes, every mount etc)I have faith in this game and i hope to reach my goal, and when i do............ i will vow to help every person ever.....also even though i only had 50 minutes into this game, i am on like portal 9.

"10765,Trove,2016.0,""Trove is an amazing MMO, the game is balanced, and interesting. There is even a mechanic that, if you don't like the look of an item, you can change it to the look of any  item you previously aqquired. Trove has a smooth learning curve, and creative world generation. Trove is NOT a pay-to-win game, nor is it a pay-to-play game like guild wars 2. The only thing i dont like about trovei s that 3D building is awkward in 3rd person."",1"
"10766,Trove,2017.0,""I regret wasting so much time on a game that if you don't pay for anything you'll need more than a lifetime to have everything you want + too much RNG on a grind game, meaning that even if you grind A LOT you may not get what you want."",0"
10767,Trove,2016.0,So I've had this game for quite some time now and as you can probably see it says I have 6 hours on record already. the actual fact of the matter is that I haven't even had a chance to play this game.I downloaded the game and then did the Glyph update and then the new patch and everything and when i finally got a chance to open the game the UI was huge. So big that I can't accept the terms and conditions to enter the game. I did a little research and found out it was a bug and to fix it i simply had to change my resolution.The problem with that is that I can't access any of the options until I've accepted the terms and conditions.so if anyone can help and I actually get a chance to play the game I might change my review but for now it seems like the developers dont care about fixing the problem and as a result I will not recommend it.,0
"10768,Trove,2015.0,""after reading through the negetave reviews i can see that none of them should be there. i â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing love this game. its got simple combat and simple gameplay, but its for some reason amazing. everyone who have this a negative review is complaining about the que times, but they dont understand that the devs had no idea that the game would be so popular on launch. some people dont understand launch is when there will be the most bugs and the most problems."",1"
"10769,Trove,2016.0,""Everyone saying the game sucks because its P2W. Everything is pretty expensive, such as getting to radiant for one equip is 30 USD. The game is really good, but the building system is lacking or could use improvement. The community never really talks in game, unless you're using world chat.  This game is best with some friends, as farming alone can get boring, plus with friends, you can stock all items together in one club chest.  The devs are constantly doing events, so you're never truly missing out on much, and gameplay is extremely easy, unless your hands are broken."",1"
10770,Trove,2015.0,boring....... go throught a world killing mobs to upgrade your gear. no gear crafting system.go to mine to build your house that is around 20-30 blocks in size and theirs only a handfull of resources some you just need to mine endlessly hundreads to build your things.,0
"10771,Trove,2015.0,""Fun game for the first while, but it lacks more abilities and over all variety. For the most part it's just clearing out dungeons forever until you're bored of doing so. In short, the game is good if you're looking for a small break from whatever game(s) you normally play. Since the game is free, I do suggest getting it and playing it for a while."",1"
"10772,Trove,2017.0,""This game is one of my favorites and for good reasons. The community of this game is nice and everyone is usually kind to each other besides the occasional scammers and spammers (like every other MMO). The game is not for everyone and I understand that, but if you enjoy murdering everything and going through dungeons with friends this game is for you. There is something of everyone in this game, for people who like to build you can join a club and creat whatever or simply design you cornerstone (base that moves throughout worlds). Or if you like murdering people in PVP and mounting the trophys of people you killed on your wall (literally) then you can do that to!   No this game is not a PTW (pay to win) game. It's optional to use money but if you don't you still can play the game fine. There are new things being added all the time and millions of weapons, hats, masks, costumes, ect. The art style for the game is called Voxel and easy to make new items and submit them and potentially have them added to the game! There are many different classes to choose from if your into games with diverse characters. And yes some are better than others. One of my favorite features in this game is the cornerstone. Within Different worlds you will find a cornerstone plot and pressing E on the sign will build your cornerstone, if you build/destroy anything on it those edits will be transferred throughout worlds (every world has cornerstone plots).    The controls for this game are simple (or many just because I'm used to them). Some controls are weird so just ask in global chat and people usually respond. Another great feature is if you have a weapon that looks bad but does good danger you are able to """"collect"""" the good looking weapon and change the appearance of the bad looking weapon but still keeping the better stats, same with hats and masks. Anyway this game is a lot of fun and you should stop reading this and go play it. Thanks :3"",1"

"10777,Trove,2018.0,""It's sad to have to give this game a thumbs down, but after years they still haven't fixed the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ servers. They'll sure keep on adding more things for you to buy though. I played in the very early days of beta (off Steam) and the servers have literally not improved once (despite some claims by Trion that they have), The company in general has just gone further downhill over the years. I refuse to give my time or money to a company that so blatantly doesn't give aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥about it's customers. Sadly there are always people with disposable incomes that will keep these games going.

"10779,Trove,2015.0,""WALL OF TEXT WARNINGThis is a huge wall of text for this review, Before people say """"OH DIS GAEM IS ONLEH GRINDIN EEEEFLBFLBFLFBFLBFLBFLBF"""" Everyone who plays this game knows that, We love the game because of it because it drives us to get better stuff. Now sit back and read this Wall of China esque text.This review goes in to depth of TroveBasic DetailsTrove is a Sandbox massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed and published by Trion Worlds. The game was released on Microsoft Windows on July 9, 2015.On Launch Day, the game was launched with issues of queue wait, in response the admins to restart the servers three times. Some players were also unable to join Club Worlds or login to the game, But eventually they fixed that issue and the game was much more enjoyable after that point.GameplayThe player assumes the role of a Trovian of multiple classes, There are 13 classes within Trove. Currently, these are The Lunar Lancer, Tomb Raiser, Boomeranger, Pirate Captain, Shadow Hunter, Ice Sage, Candy Barbarian, Neon Ninja, Dracolyte, Fae Trickster, Gunslinger, the Knight, and the Revenant. Each Character has their own strengths and weaknesses making the play style for each varied.Most classes are designed to resemble a particular Biome whilst others are said to be """"Roamer"""" classes which do not originate from any particular biome, according to in game lore.Each Character has a selection of unique abilities which unlock within the first few levels of play. Each Character has a main attack, secondary attack, unique passive ability, and 2 extra skills which can be triggered when desired and have in built cooldowns, limiting their use. The Unique passive ability allows the class to utilize their class mechanics, for example the Tomb Raiser class obtains charges called 'souls' either when a set period of time has passed or when an enemy is defeated. The Tomb Raiser can store up to 3 of these charges at any one time and can expend them using their secondary attack ability to summon NPC character minions to help him in combat. Each classes mechanic is unique and allows for a variety of play styles.CornerstoneThere are houses, They are very mobile via signs. These are called """"Cornerstones"""" they are homes of a Trovian where they do their basic things like crafting, forging and Loot Collecting and the other sorts. Other Trovians can walk in to your Conerstone and use your things, But not take your items. The Cornerstones are not like Safe Havens, Monsters of the world can walk in to your Cornerstones.Character CustomizationI know most of you people like having costumes and stuff on your characters, Your Trovian's can have that too! Any Weapon, Hat or mask that is placed in the craft station known as the Loot collector, will be destroyed but the style of that item will be added to the players library allowing the player to choose to use that items image as a vanity, instead of the item currently equipped. This applies to masks, hats and weapons only. The new image only affects the appearance of the character and provides an altered visual appearance only. Additionally any item which is destroyed in the loot collector also provides the player with resources, useful in upgrading other items or in crafting.Players can also alter their characters' face, skin and hair styles using The Barbershop without limit, penalty or cost, which can be crafted or found at the Hub zone.This allows for great variety as each player can customize their characters appearance to a high degree.Game EnvironmentThe Hub zone is the central Zone in Trove and acts as a meeting place for all players as well as a way of accessing the lower level worlds until players are able to craft their own world portals.The Hub also includes a selection of crafting stations and an NPC who sells items used for fishing, an in game semi-profession, and sailing.Each world zone contains various biomes that focuse on a specific theme. These include Neon City, a world with structures designed to resemble a fictionalised image of the insides of a computer, Highlands, designed to resemble fields and forests, The Fae Forest, a dark fairy tale like zone and many, many others.Each biome is connected seamlessly to each other and each world zone is open world in its construction allowing players to travel from biome to biome seamlessly within each world zone.The biomes themselves each have their own unique NPC enemies which will attack the player if they get too close, as well as their own unique flora. One of the main features of each biome is their themed dungeons. For example the Candoria biome, a theme based on sweets, chocolate and other such items can have dungeon's shaped like giant cakes, gumball machines or a myriad of other themed objects related to the biome.Each dungeon contains a single 'mini-boss' who upon defeat rewards the player with a large amount of experience, and causes the spawning of a reward chest. The chest contains 1-3 items which are usually the matching quality of the zone but have a small chance to be of higher quality as well as various other resources useful to the player.There are also large dungeons which appear less frequently than normal dungeons and can have 2 'mini-boss' encounters each with their own reward chest and one main boss encounter who is significantly harder but has significantly better rewards.Clubs!Clubs are like Guilds, But they have their own world! The Club world is a zone without dungeons or enemies and is meant to be a central meeting area for members of the club. The Club leader and any other member of sufficient rank can freely build within the zone and can place items normally only placeable within player built homes. Additionally there are some items which can only be placed in Club Worlds.Players can instantly travel from anywhere within the game straight to their club world.Club chats allow members within a club to chat to each other. The club chat is accessed through typing """"/c#"""" in chatInitially the Club world consists of a small island complete with grass and trees. The Island is surrounded on all sides by a unique biome called the Sea of Regret which, when entered, is harmful to the players. However, players can built and deploy devices which, when activated, can convert areas of the sea into additional land mass. This allows players to increase the size of the Club World as desired.Players may join up to a maximum of 5 clubs at any one time.CommunityThe Community is generally very nice and helpful to new players, But to those who spam the chat asking stuff like """"HOW DO I CRAFT!?!?!"""" will just get Ignored and Reported for Spam. So if you want to ask people stuff, Don't spam.How i rate the game?This game is honestly a 8.6/10 in my opinion, I love the game, The game is very fun and has a lot of replayability."",1"

10783,Trove,2015.0,This game is amazing i would most definatly get it if you like fighting and building the only bad thing about it is that you have to wait around 15 minutes to join a server if you dont mind a wait and like good games this is the game for you. :D,1

"10785,Trove,2015.0,""After 300+ Hrs in the game.(This review has been updated 3 times)Pros:Many Classes each with its own abilities. There are melee and ranged classes, tanky and dps specialized.This game is not pay to win and hopefully it will stay that way. Professions ( Gardening, Ringcrafting, Runecrafting ) each with its own bonus once you reach max lvl at the professionA lot of mounts, pets, wings, boats A lot of dungeons and castles - the hardest ones are called shadow arenas and are divided by uber 1/2/3/4/5/6 etc difficulties, each being harder than the previous one.FISHING! A lot of character customization abilities - helmet, face, weapon, ring. (ENDLESS) Great communityClubs ( Something like clans or guilds ) Everything you do in the game rewards you as you gain mastery points which unlock mastery levels and great rewards.Cons:You can pay for classes if you want to obtain them faster. (Doesn't have any impact on playing the game, just makes the classes more difficult to get.)GRINDING - this game is a grind fest at higher levels.Gets a bit boring after a long time playing one class. Although when you find a class which suits you, you're good for a long time. :)NO pvp. (At least for now)Steep learning curve for new players.----- Some comments and tips: -----Max level for a class is lvl 20. Although your level increases as you obtain shadow level gear.Currently I have 4 max level classes: Neon Ninja, Candy Barbarian (sounds silly but it's strong), Dracolyte and Knight. My mastery rank: 87----- If you need any help about the game feel free to add me ingame: Zarlath -----There is also a plenty of community guides which can help you with pretty much anything.The graphics might look silly and dumb for many people, but remember that it's the gameplay that matters the most. :) If you have spare time i'd recommend investing it in this game.10/10 for now."",1"
10786,Trove,2017.0,The servers are wank i teleport to places i havent been and also because the game has alot of vertical buildings whenever i try to climb them i usually get teleported back down like it is a glitch.

10788,Trove,2018.0,Used to grind the hell out of the game on xbox but i wasted around 1000 hours cause it was all for nothing. This game is too repetitive and i would reccommend not getting it if you are a person that is looking for a lot of action. Maybe in the future the game may be updated and  be a better game but right now im not feeling it. all the best for the developers though. 
"10789,Trove,2017.0,""So... For first, this game is mostly about grinding, experiencing and things like that. If You don't like to grind, this probably isn't game for You. I played this something about 1,300 hours. There are a lot of work, if You want to be good at this game You need to spend on this so much time and I think you should play everyday at least few hours, like in the other MMO-RPG games. Graphics... Graphics are kinda cool, funny and pleasing to the eye. They are mainly square and I think You don't need the greatest computer on the world to play on the optimal fps. In Trove you have 15 classes to play, so You have fun for a lot of time if You want to get them all on at least high level. The largest problem in this game, is I think, server working. Ping on server is sometimes horrible. Sometimes You can not even play, because at least enter the dungeon is Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥in' impossible because of this. Once, I had over 1500ms for something about hour.But except of this problem, the game is awesome. Community is usually nice and they don't Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥Ã¢â„¢Â¥ Your mother every night like in the other games. I recommend that game for all RPG type fans and of course other people because they also can have fun here."",1"
"10790,Trove,2017.0,""It is a non skill based game, needs alot of time to be able to help somebody, Half of it is nearly pay to win, or strong players from 2 years that can carry a raid, the should atleast place unique dragons that you can buy from the stores"",0"
"10791,Trove,2015.0,""Good praphics, runs easely and smoothlyUnderstanding the game mechanics doesnt take  long.

10793,Trove,2017.0,Trove is Mixed for me but i stilll love to plau it when i am bored. when u start off u are given 8 classes chosses i believe. It is very fun at the start when u got your first class but also pretty boring. for exmaple i know there are event days but levling up is pretty boring. i do recommend this game. even tho its boring to start off with it get much more fun when u are leveled up challange yourself and getting better items. Have fun with is gameP.S if u are looking for help and u want to play with me just send me a message on steam and yeah gl ,1
10794,Trove,2018.0,Great game but they need to add more quests. Griending gets way too boring yes they do have club worlds and conerstone to build but for some players like to have a idea of what they have to do and how they have to do it.P.S. I know there are new quest every month but most people finsh them really early and they run out of things to do.,1
"10795,Trove,2017.0,""Honestly, if you don't care about progressing within the defined flow of """"leveling"""" of the game, and just like the basic mechanics of the game, I recommend this game as it is very fun. That is until you start getting into the mid to end-game parts of it. At that point the value you get back from opening your wallet is the downward slope of an umbrella."",0"
"10796,Trove,2018.0,""I feel like this game is just a shell of its former self. I played this game back when it was closed beta, and it was super fun and original. Now with each new update it seems like they have to """"overhaul"""" everything. They broke the weapon upgrades then tried to fix it, they broke the exploration by locking off all the cool biomes to higher level areas. There are probably other things that they have broken, but I haven't played for a while. All my hours are on the non-Steam version. Not to even mention the network issues, I am connected to an NA server, while I am in NA, and my lag and rubber-banding is through the roof.I feel like this game won't last much longer in its current state, the more they continue to alienate the long-time players the less players there will be."",0"
"10797,Trove,2018.0,""To those saying every update has made this game worse, I'm right there behind you. This has been a problem FROM THE BEGINNING and the game has not stopped going downhill.

"10799,Trove,2016.0,""Trove was an extremely fun game once upon a time, but many recent updates have pushed it towards pay 2 win gameplay, it's a shame that Trion couldn't expand the game while still making it accessible to free players."",0"
"10800,Trove,2018.0,""I used to adore this game a year or two back, and if you included the number of hours I've put in outside of steam, that makes  at least 600 hours. But, in traditional Trion style, the game got progressively more p2w and you had to do even more grinding to even come close to the level of someone who put their wallet up. Although it introduced a new layer of depth to game, the gem system also added even more grind in addition to huge RNG. How did you get around this? Well, buying around it, of course!While I'm not sure how the game is in it's current state, knowing Trion the game's problems have likely only gotten worse. so I would not recommend this game to anyone. The grind is monotinous and the devs usually just end up spitting in your face. There are much better f2p games on steam alone."",0"

"10802,Trove,2018.0,""This review will be based on the current time I have with the game, 545.0 hours total. This game was a lot of fun way back when it just came out of beta and before all of the major updates, which in turn ruined the game in my opinion.      I truly love this game, from playing with friends to just farming by myself, this game is a blast. Although this game is very repetitive, the outcome to what you're grinding for eventually pays off and you feel a sense of satisfaction- but that feeling goes away as soon as you see that you have to farm and spend hours upon hours to get anywhere in the game. Most of the hours that I have logged were back before the update of the game where they introduced gems and they started to make items untradable, meaning you can't trade them with players and you had to get items yourself rather than trading for them, which was a core part of this game since the start of Trove. I still log into this game from time to time to see if anything is different, and to see if I can do anything in a timely manner. I do not suggest this game because of the time that it takes for the player to get anywhere in the game, and the extent that you have to grind for the items that you want."",0"
"10803,Trove,2018.0,""Wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you want to spend you life grinding for nothing and your money and random stuff, this game use to be fun ages ago where me and my friends would all defeat bosses together and we had a club island, it was so much fun but now its pay to win/play."",0"

"10806,Trove,2018.0,""Terrible servers making the game unplayable at non peak hours due to rubberbanding, every """"patch"""" breaks something else, real life cash loot boxes for everything in the game and even if you put in hundreds of hours you'll still be expected to put in hundreds more cause the game's RNG is totally crapThe base game itself is fun and addictive but you will hit a point where the developer's incompetence and greed is the biggest challenge you'll face and it really isn't worth it"",0"
10807,Trove,2017.0,I like the old school pixelly goodness.  The variety of classes and mounts is fun too.  I am not sure how much IRL $ I would commit.  There is much complaining in various forums.  I'd definitely check it out as F2P though.,1
"10808,Trove,2018.0,""This game was pretty good. I enjoyed going around and fighting the monsters and doing certain quests and learning about the mechanics of the game. I also like the fact thereâ€™s different classes you can be, and you can have multiple of them at the same time. The game does get a little repetitive though, at least in my experience. I will admit I donâ€™t play as much so I canâ€™t judge it completely, I am sure thereâ€™s more to the game then what I saw. This game overall was pretty good though."",1"
"10809,Trove,2016.0,""WARNING: PAY TO PLAY![/h1[That line explains it all.  Just look at how many hours I've played this game...  At first, when I joined the world of Trove, I saw all these people decked out in amazing gear and crazy mounts that I've never seen before.  To myself, I thought that one day I could get all of that.Well... I was wrong. So Wrong.Turns out, it was impossible for me to get all of these limited time mounts or all of that radiant gear.  The bottom line is, I have school to attend to, I have homework to do, I have chores to finish, and I have friends to hang out with.  In order to finish events, you have to either spend a bunch of money or spend countless hours grinding. I don't have time for that... and Glyph knows it.What pains me is that I've actually invested money into this game, almost $300.  That's not the sad part (well maybe it is).  Even with all this money invested into such a pointless game, I cannot compare to some people who have just started hours ago because the fact is, this game is pay to play as fâ¤â¤â¤.TL"
10810,Trove,2016.0,An amazing free game that has enormous maps to discover and has a satisfying feel of progression. There's an extensive range of classes to pick from so there's always a class and playstyle for you.,1
10811,Trove,2016.0,LET ME EXPLAIN! I adore trove i've been playing it before it was even on steam. Personaly I love the game... but... The game can sometimes be a little TOO grindy and once level max is hit the way you level up from then on can be a tad tedious sometimes. If you love endless grinding go ahead! For those that don't maybe this game is not the one for you.,0
"10812,Trove,2015.0,""This used to be a positive review, but now, it's pretty negative.  It used to be F2P and pay if you want, but the devs have totally changed their minds.  It's now a pay to win scheme.  Pile of bullcrap."",0"
"10813,Trove,2018.0,""I will start by saying that Trove IS a fun, fairly mindless dungeon crawling form of Minecraft that you can relax and take it easy with in the sea of games that takes themselves far too seriously.  The mods that you can get in the Steam workshop can be very handy as well.  These the only positive thing I can say about it.There are six words I have for people out there even curious about this game:  """"Free to play,""""  """"Pay to win.""""  The game's model is heavily based on using its cash shop for virtually everything in the game.  Sure you can """"collect the items naturally"""" in game, but the costs for many of these items are very heavy, to near Exhuberent amounts.  The game's balance in item drops is not cringy in the slightest, it's a nightmarish pit of dispair.  Oh, and for optimal looting perks, you *HAVE* to join their Patreon which they will graciously tease you with from rare one to three day """"free patreon coins"""" to show you how much better your life would be if you subscribe to them.The servers of this game can range in between playable and smooth all the way to you might as well pretend this game doesn't exist for a week or three.  Aside from usual Lag that is the bane of all persons in 90% of all MMO's, the game will spontaniously crash for no clear apparent reason.  From my own experiences, somethng as simple as walking through the map is enough for the game to crash and request and error report, and you aren't even allowed to put a message into the report to explain what you were doing when the crash happened.  Trion Worlds (as a company) """"try"""" to resolve the issue, but never seem to actually acknowledge it is a legitimate problem.Their character balance in the servers isn't too bad, *IF* you stick to player versus AI.  It still has problems as there is this wild swing in between viable characters and near unplayable trash, but the silver lining is they have recently started to adress some of the issues with some of the weaker classes.  If you dare attempt their PVP area, good luck in being half way viable between all the sickening imbalance there is with the Pirate Captain being one the largest problems in the scene.  And of course, as prementioned, if you experience any lag makes the PVP section even more unbalanced.As I said, the game can be fun, however it is a sickening display of promoting itself as """"free to play,"""" but its pay to win aspect makes the game unbearable.A note to make:  Around October, the original makers of this game is a defunct company absorbed by a new one.  While this could be good for the game if the new company pays 1/1000 of attention to it that it deserved that it didn't get from Trion Worlds, do *NOT* hold your breath."",0"
10814,Trove,2016.0,This is a very Awesome game i Recommend it when they add more stuff it does get boring after a while because all you do is build kill upgrade and go to dungeons. So game a 8/10 Great Game Keep it up,1
"10815,Trove,2016.0,""Such a great game but yet so much grinding...So I was one of the first to play trove a while back, SO this game gives me lots of memories. But I won't let that affect my reviewTrove is a Voxel based MMORPG. Its great in some areas but then others not so much. There is a lot of customization to the game which I like, And a great loot system (Everybody gets loot in a specific area). The overall thing I hate about this game is all the grinding. it took me 2 hours just to finish quests and to be honest, they weren't even fun. They made you go to a frost biome to kill 100 dark creature the after you finish that quest you have to kill 200 more of a different harder kind. Overall it is a great game but needs some type of story/mission based gameplay6/10"",1"
"10816,Trove,,""adventerous game, with exploring, cool items, cool mobs and lots more. (Even dragons!) My friend suggested this to me and I waited to get it. Finally, I got it, and I was happy.

"10817,Trove,2018.0,""I would not recommend this game to anyone, it was an okay game 1 year ago, but it has become way too pay to win and a random german company bought off the game, It has only been going downhill since."",0"
10818,Trove,2018.0,well i dont like this game ANYMORE bcs i have seen its changes...from good REASONABLE TIMES NEEdED TO PROGRESS (i miss closed beta) to now utter â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t NONESENSICAL TIMEGATES ALL OVER!you should be prepared you need things that are only obtainable once a week. you now MUST login everyday to get monthly rewards worth mastery. the one thing you need to upgrade everything is now worthless garbage and pretty much useless for new content unless you got multiple stacks of it to spare (9999 flux). forging was unneccessarily complicated in beta and since left greatly untouched.gear is way less important since gems were inroduced. 4 pieces of gear vs 9 possible gemsits actually easier to forge gems than it is to forge high tier gearall new dragons are brought by eggs instead of souls. they cost 300 dragon coins and you get up to 4 dragon coins per hour + 1 per day and random in dragon caches. also they made them untradablethe list can go on and oni dont think it will get any better in the next months or yearsbut if you found all this to be excusable then i have one more thingthey needed 3 years to implement the hydrakken and dreadnaught,0
"10819,Trove,2017.0,""Not bad, runs on low specs and pretty stable. Lacks bugs and not the biggest 'ptw'.

"10820,Trove,2017.0,""Don't bother. Laggy servers, P2W nature and lots of grinding. I'm not saying that grinding is bad, but with laggy servers, the experience is...enraging. I won't dwell into the P2W nature of the game, since I'm sure everyone knows what it means. Fortunately, there have been announcements stating that server lag will be fixed.

"10822,Trove,2018.0,""If you think this game is Pay-to-Win then you are most likely wrong, about almost everything in this game is craftable. There is no story at all, and this game is mostly about dungeon hunting but 3d and kinda like minecraft."",1"
"10823,Trove,2018.0,""Despite my hours i have played this game over a few years now and i have occasionally checked in on how its doing. Taking into consideration the devs and their actions also the track this game is heading down it could have been great at what it was designed to do but the devs failed the fans and the fans failed to push the devs. From the beginning there were numerous server issues. A few years ago there was a point when the game was basically unplayable. Also the devs love micro transactions so much they turned this game into the equivelent of a slot machine in las vegas. Micro Transactions can be ok if they come in small quantites but when the game is built on them its a bit exsessive. With the hours of all of me and my friends combined we have close to around 2300 hours. And its safe to say we are all displeased with how the game has turned out. The one shimmering light in the void that is this game is the great community it has. Over the years throughout its popularity and the decline recently the community has be a constant bright spot for the game and one of the best i have experienced, The people may be patient but the devs will be the death of this game."",0"
"10824,Trove,2016.0,""game has been turned to endless grind. i remember that day when full radiant set was the best, when for dragon u needed to complete events every hour where u need complete dungeon in some biome (for that time racings or collection challenges wasn't in game) and then u can get 2-3 chests where can be dropped or dragon coins which u can sell on market for 2k flux, or same dragon's soul, i think this system need some corrects, for exam. to do quests how's weekly events at this moment and for 1 quest completion u get some number of souls. WHY NOT?/?// why i must to farm every day â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing dragon coins and flux, materials. it's too boring. gems are separate story, 70 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing chests i need to full up karma bar for stellar gem and not 100% chance that this gem will be with 2-3 stars. So i wish u understand me. Why i want to play this game, i like this game, but cos of i dont want to play this game 24/7 i can't be good player which can go to ultra shadow tower with other good skilled players and complete this dotm. One more thing, 2 years ago i've believed that Shadow Hunter will be good character, cos for that time it was bad, i though that glyph will change stats, BUT they are sooooooooooooooooooooooo lazy and can't to invent something and they just do very high attack speed therefore m2 and 2 skills not using (skill on 1 key sometimes can be used). It's all. Sorry for my english (this text i writing with translate google, so...) 3 fae tricksters/10. For that time fae trickster and ice sage were the best."",0"

"10826,Trove,2016.0,""One of my favorite steam games to play as of right now. This game brings me back to when Lego Universe existed, and it has a very similar feeling to it. Lots of classes, fair play, some minor tweaking needed here and there, but overall, great game."",1"
10827,Trove,2018.0,Trove is an alright game for those who like to grind it takes about 300 hours for a F2P player to accually get anywhere near close to powerful. Servers can be a mess and break often but the community seems to be stable. Game is fairly well constructed with the expection of P2W factor that has let down the community. Overall its a Meh Game.,1
"10828,Trove,2016.0,""Another instance of Trion moneygrubbing the community. When this came to steam, I got as many friends as I could to play(Not because I tried it yet, but because the concept was enticing). We grinded up to max by doing as much as we could, got a few of the other classes, and all around was just having a good time. We stopped playing and a few months ago (when dragons came out), I gave the game a look and found that I could simply buy a dragon and not have to do the -extensive- grinding. I quit after wasting much time attempting to grind the mats.Then, recently, I looked over the game again"
"10829,Trove,2016.0,""Hi, I been playing this game for 3 year now. The game was created in 2013. So far they only add useless mount and no new account. The developer does not care about the game. Every patch the game get bugy and unplayable. Today mostly everything is untradeable. This game will become a singleplayer. The developer does not care about the game and does not listen to player. They only care about money and how to milk new player with dead content. If you like sandbox game play minecraft it better and consistent. Trove is not a MMO... it a useless game... TRION as a hole does not care about games."",0"
"10830,Trove,,""dont really know whether i should recommend this game or not cause it has big potential but the developer misstreated it, you need money to unlock certain stuff (not pay to win though) and its really hard to get in. Getting good equipment dropped (no matter if the stats are the ones you need) take longer than just buying what you want from better player. It also dont get many updates. Id love to love this game but i cant"",0"
"10831,Trove,2018.0,""This game is fairly fantastic. The world is big and put together very well for an MMO.  It's a dungeon crawler mixed with 3D graphics and sandbox.  The only things I have truly against it are that it has a section that is pretry strong pay to win, and the fact that many of the classes are built to be played in a group. So if you play this then be sure to invite a friend to play with so you can enjoy it a whole lot longer and better."",1"
"10832,Trove,2018.0,""With almost 300 hours on this game, and my first ever Steam review. I can firmly say that this game is absolutely fun to play, however, unless you're willing to put much of your free time into this game, you won't go far. It's not a game for people who just want to pick this game up and play it. You need to invest time ( or money : Will talk about this in a bit ). With almost 300 hours, although I have almost all the playable unlockables ( ever class unlocked excluding Vanguardian ) and many cosmetics ( Mastery 298 - you gain these mastery points from cosmetics and leveling up ) I am nowhere near """"end game"""" for an MMORPG - Although I have access to all the content, I just cannot deal enough damage to be invited to late game runs. A, because I don't have time to grind CONSTANTLY, and B, I don't spend enough money. You can get anything in this game over time, without spending money, however it's tedious because getting better is much on RNG without spending a ton of money.Gameplay wise, this game is really nice 6/10, however if you don't want to spend more than $50 on this game, it would bring you almost no fun without 300+ hours4/10 overall."",0"

"10835,Trove,2017.0,""I'm filled with nostalgia when I go back to my very first Trove club, to still see it remain standing strong. Even though it is virtually dead, atleast I can see where we first plotted our spawn point, the musical roads, a good quantity of mazes produced throughout the club's life time and numerous buildings that were once endevours. So many friends I stumbled upon during my activeness in the game. I love building with my Trove buddies more than that actual mining, leveling up, and slaining bosses. Happiness filled my soul because of this marvelous game."",1"
"10836,Trove,2016.0,""I have played this for 170 hours+ so take my word on this, i will cover the pros & cons of the gamePros. A friendly community. Giving a creative experience. Good Graphics. Pretty easy to get up especially when your getting carried i've helped some of my freinds up aswell. A pretty good duengeon runner. Gives you something to do. Atleast its not a fully pay to win. They have made most things payed for (Classes mainly), most other things in the shop like mounts and dragon coins are cubits (free shop currency). You will be able to use atleast 2 different characters Cons. Sometimes lag come around to you. Sometimes you will have to grind if you want something and it might take days or months, You need patience for this. Sometimes you might not have a clue on what you want to do. They have made most things payed for (Classes mainly), most other things in the shop like mounts and dragon coins are cubits (free shop currency).

"10837,Trove,2016.0,""I played this game during Beta, and recently got it on Steam, when it came out it was an insanely great game, fun dungeons, always something to do, something new to grind towards without being to hard. Now you can grind for hours, upon hours and not even get close to what you want. The new gem system was good in theory, but was executed poorly, classes now cost real money to get, really takes away from the excitement. Making everything untradable has made it hard for new players to get a grip on things that maybe they can't farm, or just dont want to spend hours farming. The lag has become almost unbearable, Beta had little lag, now I can't climb a dungeon without rubber banding back down, its frustrating. Overall If this game was its former self. and easy 10/10 but now its a 2/10."",0"
"10838,Trove,2015.0,""As an experimental gamer I found this game quite fun. However, there is one key issue with the game that everyone will experience. The current issue at hand is lag. I dont know where the server's are located but if you and a friend play this game expect it. There will be moments where you will get disconnected when entering a portal. Moments when you will stand there and wait a minute before actually accessing the portal. Seeing as how this is the only piece of uncertainty to not download this game. I would definatly reccomend the game because ive been playing it for a week straight non-stop. Those of you with any questions or concerns go ahead and drop a comment on my profile. If i find this question reasonable i will add you and discuss it."",1"
"10839,Trove,2016.0,""To be honest this game had potentional... but the damn cash shop is making this game soooo pay to win that it's not even fun.... sure you can get a couple of hours of fun, but at the end of it, the cash shop is """"Needed"""" to have fun close to end game. (according to many i talket to).the worst thing i have encountered is the classes, and how they cost payd currency to access most of them. you can unlock one for free from the tutroial missions which gives you this currency. but thats it, and if you want to create a new character because you runed the one you had, you can forget that, it has a one character per account policy, which is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stupid and utterly â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥, even for a free to play game."",0"
"10840,Trove,2015.0,""A lot of people might say its another """"minecraft"""" game,  but this one is an Action MMORPG, what you basically only build is your own homebase where other players can shelter from monsters and resupply on potions and dismantle their loot for materials to progress in the game, its completely open world and exploring is a great satisfaction to do, You pretty much explore the world, find dungeons, find ores, beat bosses, get loot, dismantle useless loot, get materials, complete quests, recieve wings, mounts, skins for your equipement, I've been playing this with my friends for a while and we're having so much fun while playing it, each time we go to a new world level, it gets more challenging and exploring gets more rewarding. It can get repetitive when you need to go to dungeons though, but everything else is fun. Also the game reminded me of Skyrim but blocky."",1"
10841,Trove,2018.0,This is a very serious confession and yes I regret every part of it.I spent over  $1000  on this game last year on console.I regret it every day.Don't get this.Not now.Not tomorrow.Not next week.Not after an update.Not when it dies.Never.For the love of Mara don't get this.,0
"10842,Trove,2017.0,""If you got a friend go for it.  Should only take up a few hours if you're bored.If you want to try more classes, make separate accounts. (Although crafting new classes isn't hard you just need to get a special item from a certain uncommon loot box.)Resources you pick up are shared with everyone else nearby so there's no fighting over loot.The progression kind of hits a massive bump in the road at about level 10-12.  Found myself searching endlessly and never receiving much needed upgrades to progress to the next zone, leveling up had to do it and once upon reaching the new zone, worse loot than previous was dropping, completely halting my progression.  The progression is what kept me into it for the few hours but it's just dead now.  Why is lv12 zone dropping level 8 loot, where lv7 worlds dropped lv10 loot?At the start, enemies die pretty quickly as usual and you're pretty much invincible.  A little ways in you might have some risk of death but otherwise enemies just takea bit longer to kill.  Then you'll be at the point where every enemy is just a pure damage-sponge that kills you in 1-3 hits and it's just rediculous.Quite a bit of the game is locked behind premium currency, of which is quite expensive.  And some of it behind a massive grind that would make warframe jealous.  Spending money gets you massive boosts that people yell P2W over.The game does a poor job of explaining things.  You get these tutorial quests that are pretty easy to do then it wants you to craft things using materials it never tought you to harvest so I had to check the wiki on how to progress.  Most of it was go here do this, complete dungeons on the map then move to next map.  And that's actually all the game is, doing random worthless dungeons for the slimmest chance that something decent might pop out.The server lag is among some of the worst I've seen.  Say you jump and glide but then you teleport to the ground because the server didn't register your inputs.  There's countless rubberbanding here and there which massively interferes with combat, causing hits to not register.  Even stuff you can collect sometimes doesn't work.   You'll miss maybe 1% overall because while it looks like you collected it, you didn't.  It's invisible, and once you leave and reload the area, you can now see all the plants and stuff you missed that apparently didn't register.  You and the server often see two completely different things before they try to sync up in the most horrible way possible.There's also a challenge you can take part of at the top of every hour but it's so poorly programmed that if you get in there just before the timer runs out you're just wasting your time you can't get the reward even if you ace the challenge.  Despite being eligible to enter at the time, you are no longer eligible for the rewards because you cannot re-enter the challenge.  It'd be like giving a 25 minute race on a 20 minute timer, they may complete the race but you won't give them the rewards.Essentially the more I play, the more I see horribly wrong with it with nothing good to say."",0"
"10843,Trove,2018.0,""Grind fest with no story, such a sad excuse for an MMO. I originally played this because some of my friends asked and it's really the only reason I have around 290 hours in it, got to the point where I got sick of playing it because of how bad the content was, haven't touched it since and i'm proud I haven't played it for a few years, if there's any game on steam I would want to take the hours off of my account, it would be this steaming pile of sh!t."",0"

Means it's more exploration-based+ Unique building (unlike Minecraft, in this you can also get rarer drops from mining)+ LOTS of cosmetics+ LOTS of hats (TF2 anyone?)+ LOTS of weapons+ LOTS of customization in general.+ Wide, open-world+ Difficulty of worlds are balanced, so you don't need to farm that much to survive the next world.+ Free+ Only paid things are cosmetic, although you have to pay for boosters (premium rank)+ Devs notify you when servers will go down (if they are)+ Bugs are addressed and action taken quickly+ Mounts + Wings (Awesome Face Ball anyone?)+ Variety of enemies and bosses, from giant furnace things to pirate parrots.+ A lot of other things+ No compulsory PVPCons:- Premium Rank costs a lot, which heavily unbalances the game- The default keys are annoying (Q is right above 1, which I use a lot, which can be /very/ annoying)- Long wait times (not always though, and it's an MMO so it's not entirely a con, just an annoyance)- Limited skillsTotal: 9.8/10 """"Not enough classes"""" - IGN (JK, there's quite a few)"",1"

"10848,Trove,2017.0,""This game is great. For anyone that loves to become more and more powerful by leveling up and playing with friends, this is the game for you. For anyone that loves to get endless loot and strive to become one of the most powerful players, this game is for you. But there's a small problem. This game is entirely a money run. I don't think I've ever seen a game that is more pay2win than this one. You can literally buy yourself to being some of the most powerful players in the game, despite all those players that choose not to spend any money. Most people who say this game isn't pay2win are people who have spent hundreds of dollars themselves, choosing to deny their own waste of money. For anyone that still thinks this game isn't controllable with money, look at the """"shop"""". You can buy all classes, infinite """"gem dust"""", and anything else you need to become maxed out. So unless you want to play this game for three years straight while grinding for what seems to be for a fraction of the power the pay2wins have, be my guest and waste your time.The keyword here, in case you didn't catch it, is: pay2win"",0"
"10849,Trove,2017.0,""Grindy, like, really grindy. P2W and has stale combat. Abilities to make it more interesting early game, but easy to get all of the abilities for a class (like 1hr no joke) extremely luck-based with constant 1 shots in serious late game content, even with really good gear. I have to say, getting a good drop feels gooood.But it's instantly scratched out because it's P2W... At least the game is free.. Somewhat.If you're able to look past that, then play it. But I wouldn't recommend it."",0"
"10850,Trove,2017.0,""!The hours displayed here are NOT representing my total game time! You can play the game through the """"Glyph""""-Launcher also, which i prefer.

The community was nice, everyone was helpful, and the ones in end-game were helpful in every way. Then, the game released on steam -.- cancer community, just like League of Legends. Salty kids everywhere, the end-gamers insult everyone. But thats not the worst...The game got a free add-on (expansion) named """"Mantle of Power"""", in which gems were introduced. This killed the game for me, and every of my friends. Since then, the game is brainless grinding for resources. Only the early game is fun, the leveling and the gearing to be exact. But when you enter the mid game, to improve your gear and wealth, your brain turns off and it is everyday, every session the same, over and over and over again. Grinding resources is the keyword of the game, and it becomes more and more pay-to-win.With tears in my eyes, i do NOT recommend this game. I used to love this game, i was addicted.

"10854,Trove,2015.0,""From the time I have spent on this game I have learned that this game is extrememly well made. The developers have made the game 99.9% NON PAY TO WIN, the game lets you start off with the choice of your class and the customization is similar to that of the Borderlands game series. You find objects you research them then you have that """"style"""" of clothing forever. The loot is very simple and mobs only drop loot based off your class and level. This game is a great introductory MMORPG for anyone of all ages. I've played games like World of Warcraft, TERA, Elder Scrolls online and many many more MMORPG's and I can say without a doubt this game is one of the best. Don't let the simplicity deture you from the game because the game is a great way to relieve stress and or just have a good time with friends. For those of you who think the game is too simple I reccomend playing until you get to at least UBER tier 1 and or 2 so that you can see how much more complex the game actually becomes."",1"
10855,Trove,2015.0,I don't like MMORPGs but this game is my favourite. It contains a lot of enemy and item types and you can build everything you want in the club world or at your house plot at random world. Get your friends and ready up for the adventure!,1
"10856,Trove,2015.0,""Now now, just because there is a thumbs up here doesn't mean my opinion can't be mixed, but i recommend this to anybody who wants to try this game.Also, i'm now just playing this on steam. I've played this game since Alpha. I've taken many breaks from it to, but this is how it currently is in my opinion.Pros:-It features a crafting system and professions, which can be done alongside adventuring.-Forums where devs and mods actively respond to the community.-Players can design items. They can also design dungeons and lairs.-The game gives you a cornerstone, basically your own little customizable house within a certain radius. The house saves, so everytime you """"activate"""" a cornerstone, it will create your house.-Difficulty increases as you level higher, which is a mix of your level from XP, and your level from your items. This allows you to go to harder worlds.-11 classes, all of which focus on doing something different. (Except damage of course. Everybody needs to do damage.)-A shop. Of course there are premium purchases but you can also buy classes and mounts and flask emblems with cubits, the currency you get for defeating dungeons and lairs. You can only get cubits daily, though. (Doing it during weekdays rewards you with 500 cubits, while doing it during the weekend, it rewards you with 1000.)-An endgame dungeon. You team up with players to take down a few waves of mobs, or you clear your way through a dungeon to the final boss. There are two variants. This endgame dungeon is called the """"Shadow Arena"""" (SA for short.)-Flux is available from mostly PVE content, and cannot be bought from the shop. (Excluding Azulian Dragon Caches and Chaos Chests. Its an RNG thing. Like TF2 or CS:GO.)-There are specific chats for specific things. For example, there is a trade chat for trading, and a Shadow Arena chat for people looking to group up for a Shadow Arena.Cons:-Challenges. Oh yes. Challenges. Repetitive as they require you to do dungeon or lair after dungeon or lair to recieve dragon caches. But, thing is, you aren't guaranteed to get the dragon. No no, you'll most likely get flux or eyes. Which means, you gotta do it over and over again until you do get what you want. At least challenges are  unlocked at mastery 30, which means many new players don't have to experience it for a bit.-The community. Lots of kids. And i mean lots. Global chat is basically Trade chat from WoW. Its a dumping ground. That's really it.-Flux. Flux is easy to get. Inflation. Flux inflation. Things cost lots now. Same thing happened to Glim, because of one feature. Fishing. (Glim was affected heavily by fishing. Flux, not so much. Just clarifying that.)-The partron membership. Enough said.-Mastery takes a while to level up for some, and is needed for quite a bit of things. Sadly, unless you're on a shopping spree in the ingame shop, there is no way to speed it up.-Ever since it came out of beta, long que times. Its like QueAge all over again.Thats about it for now. I'll edit things in when they come up, but if anybody wishes to try this game, go ahead, unless you don't want to."",1"
"10857,Trove,2015.0,""Well, the game is fun and everything, I actually recommend this. However, I have the feeling that the game was not ready to be released, It seens like BETA.Endgame content is kind repetitive, and building lacks lots of simple features, that I am intriged that game launcher without it, like doors, actually chests... and the chat, the chat is a real mess, specially if you open trade channel, they really need to work on a tab chat system.But yet the reason this review is positive, is because I liked the game, and have hope for it, I am just afraid of how long the game will take to lose the """"beta"""" feeling."",1"

"10860,Trove,2015.0,""Hello possible future Trovian. Do you remember playing any sandbox games in the past? When I thought of sandbox games done right I always felt like Terraria was the game i enjoyed the most and spent hours upon hours designing my home in my world or just my world in general. So to me the nostalgia and excitement around the game always struck me. Now picture this, Terraria in a voxel/3D based universe. Granted Trove is rather new, the blogs and updates from the creators make the game even more promising. I look forward to be able to do world bosses or the such in the future. This game allows you the freedom to switch your combat classes/loadout as well as the exploration of the world. In this game there are guild like groups called """"clubs."""" Some of these clubs will really blow your mind with music playing on actual tracks! I've been really enjoying this game so far and although the market/economy is really ambigous it's mostly enjoyable and i definitely recommend this to anyone considering it!"",1"

Soon I decided to quit.Then one day i found Trove on the steam store. After a couple of months afer its release i decided to try out trove again. Luckily i remembered the email that i used to login and decided to change my password since i forgot it. After downloading the launcher and the game itself i expected to see my candy barb and my pet cat but alas when it finished launching i saw the game asking me for an in game name. Being confused at first i decided to just ignore it thinking that it forgot my username bec of all the other updates. When i finished typing in my name i was suprised to see that it took me to a tutorial and told me to pick a new class. After picking the new class i discovered that all of my stuff was gone.

"10867,Trove,2015.0,""  I don't like writing reviews but i will say this is a great game for a little while, grinding gets boring. No new abilities, boring same old thing. The servers have been """"down for maintenance"""" so much lately that new comers to the game could be detered from playing. Its a good game and a nice time waster but even in their live stream they showed trove for a little while and had a lot of viewers. Sounds good right? Not exactly, they were only there because the servers were down and wanted to know when they'd return. I sat through this livestream and got no word of when the servers were coming back.

"10868,Trove,2016.0,""Trove is a good game, but it has it's draw backs. Many of which can be blamed on two things. 1. Some severe lag issues: For some people I hear the game doesn't even start. I haven't yet encountered that myself, and it runs fine for the most part for me, but there are moments where things just kinda break. Then again, try playing a game that doesn't have a glitch of some kind.2. Pay2Win: Now this I can understand. I have seen the market place, and it is very restrictive on what you can get without pouring dollars into this game. HOWEVER: Like Warframe,(I know, of all games, why draw comparisons to that one. Hang with me, pls.) you can do just fine without spending a dime. Of course, it will take a helluva lot more time to do, but maybe it's worth it.Despite that, I do reccomend this game, because of 3 things:1. Friendly: It is a very nice game. In every way it is warm. All nearby players get the loot that drops, and there is no fierce competition over that Shadow lvl 3 staff"

Half a year of two updates a week and then another half a year of one update a week - with CONTINUING weekly updates - this game started as an amazing concept and progressed into a fully involved Voxel MMO that is epic beyond words.  There's adventure, collection, combat, community-content, wings, boats, rollercoaster-rail-things called """"MagRiders"""", regular mounts, flying mounts, and all of these things come in immense variety.  Not to mention it's limitless openly-supported modding capacity.With procedurally generated worlds based on an increasing number of biomes, the adventure is practically limitless.  Seriously, try this amazing game.  Just to make a point...  My library shows over 200 games in my collection yet for over a year I've mostly just played Trove.  It's THAT good.  So play it.

"10884,Trove,2016.0,""Mindless fun-- appeals to the collector in me. It's a serious grind, and aggressively monetized. Unless you want to play for six months just to reach current """"endgame"""", you'll have to drop a decent amount of cash. Trove started off as a game where you essentially didn't have to pay a dime, and the devs were upfront about the fact that this initial business model made it very difficult for them to make money. So around February 2016, they started to monetize the game hardcore. The cheapest packs were $20-- and that was in addition to a $15 a month subscription. With the introduction of the Mantle of Power expansion, they added such an extreme element of RNG to the game via the gem system that it seemed impossible to advance without either crazy luck, or ridiculous amounts of cash. The outcry from the playerbase was severe, and over the past couple of months, Trion has dialed back the RNG and monetization. There's still plenty of it, don't get me wrong-- but a lot of concerns have been addressed, and now they've started to offer $5 packs. And with the upcoming push to consoles, I think the game is going to get a second wind of content.All in all, this game was rough for a while, but it's slowly getting back to a satisfying place. For those of us who love simple action combat, collecting, building, and mindless grinding, Trove is magic. But if you want progression in any reasonable amount of time, prepare to drop AT LEAST the $15 a month for a sub. Anything less and you'll be playing until the end of time without ever catching up. The packs aren't completely crucial, but being willing to buy one or two a month will definitely put you in a better place. If you don't want to spend a dime, ever, then this is not the game for you. But if you try it and love it enough to want to invest in it, the way you would a hobby, then Trove will be an immensely fulfilling experience."",1"
"10885,Trove,2015.0,""Avoid at all costs:If you can even get the registation to work, Trove requires you to register with and use a seperate launcher, which, at registration, asks for a bunch of details that no game on Steam should need.  Using the registration link from the launcher doesn't work - it opens a registration page in your default browser, which doesn't actually do anything, and will not allow you to register (if you use firefox, it won't even have the input boxes labeled correctly).  If you go to the effort of actually tracking down a registration page that will actually do something when you click the submit button, you will only be successful if you have given them enough information to sell your details for advertising, including giving them an unsecure email address that can be easily spammed.  If you try to use any kind of secure email forwarder, or even a more secure email provider (like gmx), they will not allow you to register at all.A free game is not free is I have to sell my soul to play it, and any game that demands I not use an email address because it has decent spam protection is not a game I want anything to do with.

Coming from such RPG's / MMORPG's  as the Kingdom Hearts collection, Runescape (Evolution of Combat, Old School) , World of Warcraft (Vanilla through Legion currently), Tera, Rift, and many other adventure based games, Trove sits highly aligned with little recognition for its presence and spectacle.

"10903,Trove,2016.0,""Due to all the negativity surounding this game, I want to say my point.My name is BabyFace and by my hours, you may guess that I love this game. The problem people have with this game is that they think it is another Pay to Play/ Win game. However, it is much like the situation with Call of Duty: Black Ops 3:  IT IS PAY TO ADD MORE PLAYABILITY OR FUN TO THE GAME.  With games witch give the option to pay, it is just their way of asking if you want to support their game. I have spent roughly Â£20 on this game and that was on a pack of cubits and the Chloromanser pack (sorry if spelt wrong). I do get the point that people have spent more money on the game on it than me, but don't go attacking the Devs of this game just because your account got wiped. If it was due to the bandwagon of account wiping, then you should have played on it more. If it was due to an attack on your account, then it is a cause of concern. The Devs cannot really do anything about that which I am sorry to hear about it, however if it is refunded in their currency, then there isn't a problem. On other games similar to this one, this has happened to me and the support didn't help. However, with really supportive devs I think that they will do anything they can do.My Overall Conclusion.Don't give the devsâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥if you lost your items and they couldn't retreave it. However, if you feel personally that they did """"jack"""" carry on complaining. This game is subjective, and you can like it one second and despise it the next. I love the game and I think more people should play it, however thatis just my opinion.

So this game is getting a lot of negative reviews because of it, but trust me its better now-Good Combat -Huge Wolrds.-Genuis Crafting-Good Level system- So much to do- Many classes and you can swtich anytime.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- You need a little more recent PC (Like from now to 3 or 5 years ago PC)-If you dont have a real good PC the frames won't be too high maybe from 10-26 sometimes 3-Needs a skill tree system so you can have more abliites and choose the abliites you want- Needs more in the Worlds- Needs a party system-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*UPDATE 4/11/16* So a ton of people are not recomending this game anymore calling it pay to win and trust me it is not a pay to win game. You can get anything the legit way without money. The only problem is that there has been a dry content drought so far because they have been working on this huge expansion called Mantle of power and it is big! This game is still amazing, ignore these negative reviews saying the game is ruined. It's just even better than it used to. It's different now in a good way."",1"
