"1,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""I'm scared and hearing creepy voices.  So I'll pause for a moment and write a review while I wait for my heart beat to return to atleast somewhat calmer times.  This game is adorable and creepy like my happy tree friends but with the graphics sceme of my childhood (but more bubble and 'clean').  Hello 1990's.What charactes there are (that isnot trying to kill me) were likable and a bit odd.  I did do a few noob things though, such as:Oh look a class room full of ghosts from dead children, lets shine my flashlight on them and stand there staring at them..Or, hmm creepy music, I'll turn around and see if I can see what's chasing me.Never before in a game have I been this afraid of finding a locked door."",1";;;;;;;
"2,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""Best game, more better than Sam Pepper's YouTube account. 10/10What you'll need to play:A computerSome extra pants.Pros:Scary as hell.Fun.Adventure.Spooky.Did I forgot to mention that its scary as hell?You'll get more pants/briefs in your wardrobe.Time consuming if you're bored.Cons:Buying pants/briefs. You haven't downloaded it yet."",1";;;;;;;
"3,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""A littly iffy on the controls, but once you know how to play, very easy to master. I've made it to floor 1000 before, but due to certain circumstances was unable to finish. Was not game related, don't worry, not a bug/glitch or antyhing.I highly recommend this for casual play, maybe with a friend or two watching. Hilarity ensues, especially once you hit floor 150. Have fun my fellow fleshlings!"",1";;;;;;;
"4,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Great game, fun and colorful and all that.A side note, though: When are we getting windowed mode? My computer hates fullscreen so.... yeah. The computer doesn't like to run this. Shame, because this is really enjoyable. But until then, I guess I'll settle for more Skyrim. Cheers!"",1";;;;;;;
"5,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Not many games have the cute tag right next to the horror tag on Steam.I first played this game in late 2014 and coming back to it for the first time since. This game is so good for it being free, take advantage and experience it. Try and get to  room 1000 or as close as you can. The further you progress the darker the game becomes."",1";;;;;;;
"6,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's pretty cute at first, but then later gets horrifying and it really does jumpscare! The specimen scared me more! Still enjoyable and worth playing, though. Great and well-made game!10/10"",1";;;;;;;
7,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,Great game. it's a cute little horror game that progressively gets darker and scarier. It has a sense of humor too! (I've played it a little but I have watched several people play it and I love it!),1;;;;;;;
"8,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion is a Free Retro maze game with jump scares and death.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  I took a wrong turn somehow and keep getting killed by a ghostly creature around room 61, i guess i need to restart and take a different route.  Has a retro look, sort of like Castle Wolfenstein or Doom.   Has creepy music and sounds.  It has 1,000 rooms to go through.  Try this game, you might like it.For more info:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mKsY6rVdDohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3olm3IprwQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZEJVpaRhkIhttp://www.polygon.com/2015/4/27/8502907/spookys-house-of-jump-scares-gameplay-overview-videohttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/01/14/spookys-house-of-jump-scares-free-game/#more-340713http://www.indiedb.com/games/spookys-house-of-jump-scares/reviewshttp://www.bagogames.com/spookier-meets-eye-spookys-house-jump-scares-review/ "",1";;;;;;;
"9,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Somewhere between light hearted, happy parody and being afraid of the dark lies Spooky's House of Jump Scares. You are tasked with the daunting duty of surviving one thousand rooms in this endless first person perspective runner. Each room is no more than a few seconds thanks to a sprint key and the fact that each door counts as a new room. Even then one thousand rooms is still a feat against tedium and needless repetition. There are still things every fifteen or so rooms to keep your interest and at the end of fifty rooms you'll find a save point, but nothing can save you from permanent death at the hands of the foul creatures that live within.On the surface the game has a clean, chipper almost cartoon low budget charm to it. Jump scares are rare and at first it comes in the form of adorable cardboard cutouts of pumpkins, ghosts and skeletons that pop out of the wall accompanied by a sound. Some of the sounds are silly and unfitting other times its screeches to drive chills down your spine. The game excels in the sound department and makes good use of music, ambient sounds and foot steps following you.As you delve deeper through the doors of this dank dungeon, you'll uncover more frightening things and points of intreege. There are plenty of written notes here and there. A few times you'll need to search for a key in a different room, but the other ninety-nine percent of the game is leaving rooms behind forever.The themes of the rooms begin to change from the mundane almost Wolfenstien 3D-esque corridors to metal asylum rooms that give you a flashlight to find your way through. There are purple dungeons, green sewers with glowing scum. Some rooms are coated with slime to slow you own while others have holes in the ceiling as if to give you a feeling of dread that something could pop out.There are a limited amount of rooms and I started to memorize them all. Even the game's crescendo encounters in a vacant room with walkways. There's no way to fall into the dark chasms, it acts as if they were walls, but with this open room you get to see a specific creature that might be following you. Sometimes they can float over the gaps, other times they're stuck trying to walk at you from across the gap so you can get a good look at them when they're harmless.If they touch you three or so times you're dead. You have health that does replenish over time and these big moments are rare and easy to avoid. Just keep running and hope there are no locked doors! They only happen in specific rooms and sometimes the rooms are empty, but it still gives that dreadful feeling.You can tear through these rooms pretty quick about 350 of them in a 45 minute. Your stamina will deplete to give a monster the chance to catch you, but going through a door restores your will to run. Other than that waiting a few seconds will replenish your stamina. Longer rooms hav1e limited visibility. The further out an area is the darker it gets.A few rooms have good diversions or tricks to them. Such as one that turns bright and you need to enter the correct combination of corridors signaled by chimes until you can see the door. Another room is endless darkness with a torch at the end, until its revealed that the torch is merely painted on a black wall. A few times you'll need to search an adjacent room for a key to the one you're in.Every fifty rooms, you take a moment to unwind in an elevator that reminds you to hang in there or have a coffee break. The game makes a good balance of calm moments for each of the few tense situations. Its what keeps you off kilter and never expecting anything. Every two hundred and fifty rooms offers a prize to you. What's in the box? Is it snakes? Is it a jack-in-the-box or is it a note?Truth be told I'm very goal oriented with video games and so Spooky missed its mark for me. The cardboard cutouts get in the way. Being chased by something means that it was no threat since it was already behind me. Perhaps in later rooms it gets more difficult, but this is just easy tedium.  Another room, another room, another room. Then knowing I have seven hundred more rooms and another two hour investment of endless running turns the game into a grind. There's no fear and its too long to endure even with save points. The game reuses its points of interest a few times since it recycles rooms.Another issue I have with the game is getting stuck on edges where I need to push away from a wall to get free and turn a corner. Its more than walls, its on the gaps too. I suppose this is acceptable for a scary game where you get chased, but I'm hung up on these hang ups.One interesting thing the game does have is a stabbing mini game where it looks like you're a ghost in a mall. Its a good diversion from the repetition. There's even a computer that shows you all the creatures in the house. Well most of them at least.The best selling point this game has is that its free. By no means does that make this a good game, but it makes it easier to accept. Its a game that brings you up with charm to tear you down with scares beyond the cheap cardboard cutouts that can litter a hallway every so often. Its just far too repetitive without that much dread or excitement."",0";;;;;;;
"10,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""This game with its cute little out of the wall pop-ups that scared the living light out of me I like it very much I haven't played it lately but this is a very good game, I like how its a funny jump scare game and it is very very fun but the story is pretty sad. so good luck and have fun in the rooms :D"",1";;;;;;;
11,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Early Access ReviewI thought this game would be fun and cute. Never have I been so wrong.There's a room with a computer with 'Cat-Dos' operating system making the experience 705949% more chilling than it originally was.Play this game - not a very romantic idea.,1;;;;;;;

"14,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game.  It always has you running paniced and confused, it makes the horror experience complete.  With jumpscares and a confusing but compelling story mystery you just can't pull away from this game."",1";;;;;;;
"15,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""The name says it all, but don't get fooled by the seemingly """"normal"""" title of the game. You'll know it when you play it.Any person who plays this game(including me) has the right to say that this free horror entertainment is """"2spooky4me"""". "",1";;;;;;;
16,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,Never would have thought something so adorably cute would make me dirty my clothing in such short time.Great simple game where the fear builds up just awaiting for the next screamer on the corner. Plus it's free! Can't go wrong with that.,1;;;;;;;
"17,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""First, get hugged by cardboard cut outs, then get chased by freaky as hell ghouls, after you finnaly escape, you will always be on your toes. Watch out, and beware.......                      YES/10"",1";;;;;;;
18,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,It's exactly what you think it is. Progress through 1000 rooms of horror in cute style with lots of references to popular creepypastas and games. Definitely worth checking out. And it's free! What else do you need for positive experience? :D,1;;;;;;;
"19,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""This game is awesome! It may seem cute and not scary but trust me its scary af! The first 50 rooms are just cute but from room 60 it will just get more and more scary! This is a really great horror game and also it is free! I really think you should give this game a shot if you like to be spooked, if you do not wish to get really >>>>>>> scared I suggest you do not play this game! The first specimen is cute but the rest are really scary and also they will try to kill you and hunt you! Like I said, awesome horror game! If you want a cute game this is not what you are looking for!"",1";;;;;;;
20,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Just played this game for about an hour and it has given me some pretty good scares... T_T Few silly jumps starting but as the game progresses it's harder to avoid the paranoia and tension XDIt's fun indeed :),1;;;;;;;
"21,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""This game may seem cute, adorble and innocent at first. With the cute scary pop's outs every now and again. I was glad to see a spooky scary skeleton.. But things got a little dark when there was notes laying around and a demon like ghost following you where ever you go until a certian point that is. Not to memtion that there are some dead-ends and tons of spooks. If you're into horror running away types. You might like this. Dispite it being looking like it was made for kids when it wasn't. I'd say 11/12 maybe?But all in all. I enjoy it. It's not alone in the dark or any other scary horror like that. It's as the title says: Spooky's House of Jump Scares. And oh boy, I'm pretty spooked. And I'm not joking. This game actually gave me goosebumps."",1";;;;;;;
"22,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""Those puppets, man! They freak me out! Can't get away from the evil puppets!!! Then again, I might just suck. Great freebie though. Don't let the childish appearance and graphics fool you. This is indeed a horror game. And not a bad one at that if I say so myself. Play it!"",1";;;;;;;
"23,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis Game is a bit simple but over all i like it, i've currently reached room 710 as its the farthest this game is currently developed to, as its still being built.its a survival horror game that involves roaming a house with many rooms, i think it merges cute, and scary very well as the cute aspects are not out of place nor are the scary aspects they fit supprisingly well and it's amazing how  under the right criteria the cute pop up scares can acctualy be a effective jump scare.i also quite enjoyed the easter eggs and nods to (alien), (alice in wonderland), (five nights at freddy's)  and who knows what other easter eggs will be added as the game progresses, all in all i give this game 7/10 stars."",1";;;;;;;
"24,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""One of the best horror games imo. It's free, it's cute and it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing horrible. At the beggining it's just cute jump scare here, cute jump scare there, open doors and it you start thinking, well, this isn't so bad, I guess. But after your first real horror encounter you began to feel chased everywhere you go. And the cute jump scares are not cute anymore. You know something is after you, and begin questioning wether to continue on or not, but you know that you must. I highly recommend it. It's free, so what are you waiting for? It will be a very pleaseant experience, trust me on that."",1";" even if you got used to them before, you are quite likely to get a startle when one springs up in front of you while you're distracted fleeing some lurking abomination."",1";;;;;;
"25,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Cute and Horror do not really mesh well in so many instances in gaming. This is one of those delightful exceptions, even if that's because the cuteness at first is then outshone by genuinly horrible things hunting you.  The 'Jumpscares' in the title comes from cheerful little carnival haunted house-style, wooden, pop up monsters that will appear starting early on.  The real horrors are more of the 'you can't fight it, just learn how it moves and strikes, and try to get away'.  This does not, however, in any way mean the funhouse pop up monsters stop showing up";;;;;;;
"26,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""great game for your kids!when your childerent play this game, they learn true important things! like how ghost shouldent be trustedand generator make things bright! but most importantly teaches them math from all those rooms!i highly sugest it for childeren 5-10"",1";" almost all the monsters can be avoided with little hassle, and it's entirely possible you'll miss several of them depending on how efficient you are at going through the rooms. However, the game leaves little room for error, as the enemies tend to deal high damage and some can even one-hit kill you if they manage to get in close enough. It all depends on how well you can manage to keep to your goal of sprinting and reaching the next door. In regards to atmosphere, it's a blend of humor/cuteness with horror, which can be verified by looking at a few screenshots. The humor consists mainly of cutesy characters and dialogue, which are peppered throughout the gameplay (but become increasingly rarer). The horror portion involves surprisingly disturbing imagery and sounds, most of them from the monsters that chase you, and I didn't find myself detracted from it by the occasional humor, so I believe the game was successful in its atmosphere. In my opinion, that is the highest point of this game - seeing what monsters, environments and dialogue will come next.All in all, if you're a fan of horror games, I'd say give this at least a try. It's different and has a charm to it that I believe adds to the overall experience and makes it quite unique."",1";;;;;;
"27,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewAn interesting and quirky experience for me. Almost the entire game involves going through one room to the next, of which there are 1000, some short and straighforward, some longer and more complex, but all being a few seconds long at most. Occasionally, you'll be chased by monsters which, despite coming in many variations, almost universally require you to simply go through rooms as fast as possible until they cease their pursuit. Very few moments require solving puzzles or obtaining keys to proceed, giving the player little reason to explore unless forced to. Because of these characteristics, the game feels like a very long chase sequence and, with 1000 rooms to be overcome before the game is over, it can get very repetitive despite being a very short game, clocking at around 3 hours for completion. Fortunately, there are save spots every 50 (later 100) rooms, which allows the player to take a break if necessary. Difficulty-wise, it's not hard";;;;;;;
"28,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Starts off rather harmless and cute, and very quickly takes a turn for dark and disturbing. It's not without it's faults, the ending is sort of a let down, and it doesn't really escalate as well as it could.That said, by all means check this game out, especially as its free.and watch out for the skeletonsthey'll get you"",1";;;;;;;
"29,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Good, but you need much more than the minimum to run above 20 FPS. I got to room 10 before I got tired of it glitching the loading system for the game it was so laggy and chopping up ALL of the sounds. Not for those without a pretty decent PC."",1";;;;;;;
"30,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""At first everything seems alright, just gotta make it through 1000 rooms with nothing but carboard cut outs right?WRONGWhen I first started, it was fine and dandy, screamed when a cute ghost popped out until I found a green puddle.I read a note, turned around, and then a green demon sent from the deepest pits of hell began chasing me and I stumble through the next fifty rooms in blind terror.The lesson we learned today isNEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE AGAIN"",1";;;;;;;
31,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,- Was disappointed with lack of options- Got bored while running empty hallways- Music started making me a bit uneasy- first cardboard ghost made me jump a little- oh crap! why are the walls turning into blood?- oh crap! shes got a knife!10/10 would crap my pants again,1;;;;;;;
"32,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""This game is incredible. Despite the title, the initial appearance of the game isn't that of a horror title, even the first scares that you come across are cutely designed cardboard cutouts that pop out from walls as you walk by. As you progress, the game truly comes into its own, changing the scenery, music and overall atmosphere to continually put you in a state of unease. With a whole host of """"specimens"""" trying to scare/kill you, an adorable antogonist, outstanding sound and an ability to deliver an unnerving experience (not to mention the fact that this game is free) should put ths game way up on the lists of anyone looking for a decent horror game."",1";;;;;;;
"33,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""When I first started, I was like is this a joke? Later on itgot creepy and then when i see thae happy mask salesman from majora's mask, I was like nope.avi. Toatly worth the game, but what I don't understand why the dlc is not free"",1";" going through the 1,000 rooms is not as tedious of a task as it seems, as each room can be ran through easily within 6 seconds, slightly more for """"special"""" rooms.Gameplay is rather simple: Get to the end of Spooky's maze, and survive whatever lies in the bowels of her home. New monsters are introduced every 75 rooms or so, and after the initial chase sequence, can begin chasing you again at any time through your perilious adventure, always keeping things tense. Special rooms and notes can be found throughout the mansion, hinting at a bigger picture behind Spooky and her house...There are two endings, giving you a reason to play through the story at least twice. If obtaining a high score is your cup of tea, you can try your luck in Endless Mode, which challenges you to go as far as possible into the mansion, with monsters, many new, many old, making an appearance.The DLC, Karamari Hospitial, adds even more horror, with a shorter campaign, five new monsters to avoid, and tons of little secrets to hunt down.I highly recommend this game. Also, check out the HD remaster if you like this game! It adds even more stuff to Spooky's twisted home."",1";;;;;;
"34,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Spooky's House of Jumpscares is a horror game, no sense beating around the bush. Although it pretends to be a mockery of games that rely on jumpscares for the first fifty or so rooms, things quickly take a turn for the sinister...The game is not long at all";;;;;;;
"35,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""This little gem is absolutely pants â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ly terrifying. How? I hear you cry. Surely because of the cutesy graphics it couldn't possibly be scary. Right? WRONG. DEAD WRONG. Ahem. The soft graphics are what the game uses to lull you into a false sense of security. After gaining your trust the game begins piling on the atmosphere like a dumptruck at a...dumptruck convention(?) After the first 50-100 rooms or so it becomes clear that the cutesy cardboard jumpscares aren't the only thing plagueing you as you journey through what quickly becomes a monstrous hellscape born out of your own nightmares. The game also nods and pays homage to most genres of horror and even references some popular horror games such as Five Nights at Freddy's and Resident Evil. The game isn't very long but if you're a coward like me then you'll only be able to play it in short, 200 room bursts.  If you're bored and looking for a sp00ky time then pick up Spooky's House of Jump Scares and prepare to spend a lot of money on new underwear because trust me, you'l need them."",1";;;;;;;
"36,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""I enjoy many types of games, but horror is my favorite genre, and as such I tend to be more critical of games that claim to be scary. If you had told me yesterday that a game could be scary, cute, clever and funny - and succeed on all 4 fronts - I may have guffawed at you. But I'm currently taking a breather in room 400/1000 and to date, I've had approximately 31 small heart attacks and twice as many chuckles. I'd certainly have paid $20 for this, since it's free you have no excuse not to try it."",1";;;;;;;
"37,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""Oh, a cute """"horror"""" game, perfect for a late night relaxing gaming...Oh #@&!... ok, it's just a cardboard.

"38,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""I have to say this is the scariest free game I've ever played. Jump scares are my weakness to be fair, but something seems just really creepy about this game, despite the cute and unrealistic canvas the gameplay is painted on. Sure, the graphics aren't great and the controls are a little off, but this game still has creeped me out to the point where I need a break every once in awhile. Maybe its the story being told or the atmosphere, either way, this game does a good job doing what a lot of PAID games fail to do. Actually SCARE the player. I thought the pop outs were cute and funny until I was running for my life and they decided to get me while I wasn't focused on them. Anyways, this game is extremely good for the low price of nothing so get it if you like horror genre or just want to try something different."",1";;;;;;;
"39,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Well I had tons of fun with this game! Right up until the end... v_v The game had a fantastic ending gameplay and some cool enemies and such. But...My audio crapped out! It was so horrible it was nothing but static, which totally took away all of the spookyness.In the case of Spooky's, without the audio, was boring. Didn't help that the audio turned into static also. However I went and watched Markiplier and other various Youtubers play the game. It was great! ^_^ a perfect ending to a perfect game. 10/10 would play again. (if audio is fixed)"",1";;;;;;;
"40,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""Saw this on a famous youtube gaming channel and thought to give it a shot.Believe me it is scarier than it sounds and definitely scarier than what it first seems.Concept is simple- you walk through rooms, trying to reach the end, bu things get more tense as you go on.Still haven't beat it. Keep dying at the same spot :(Anyways, if you like indie horror games, you might wanna check it out."",1";;;;;;;
"41,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""I think the dev did some research on objects that can scare humans. You may not like the style of the graphics but this game is the creepiest horror game I have ever played. All of the sound effects can scare you (especially the cardboard). In different level, different monsters will chase you which makes the game more and more creepy. Therefore, ignore the style of graphics and download the game. I am sure you won't regret trying it although you may regret trying it because it is VERY SCARY GAME. For all horror lovers, download it now!Tips: If you are too scared, turn off speaker and play."",1";;;;;;;

"43,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""This is a game that parodies various horror tropes, yet manages to be sacrier than most horror games on the market (I'm looking at you, Five Nights at Freddy's series).

"45,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""It's a very short game and definitely worth the time. Some of the bosses are really tedious and you're suddenly running and just trying to get to the next checkpoint before you die. The jump scares were really fun, because I played this with someone that jumped basically every time.

"48,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewSpooky's House of Jump Scares is worth your time. Being free (as of this review), this is the only benchmark the game has to pass. If it's worth your money, and worth your time, you should play it. While I have very little experience in the horror genre, Spooky's House of Jump Scares is pretty transparent with its premise. There's plenty of cute and lighthearted moments, some jump scares, and a thin thread of plot which goes deeper than the surface level. There are 1000 rooms, so you'll spend most of your time wandering from room to room, taking less than a second to move through one of the many repeated corridors. And, while the enemies are spaced out well enough to keep you interested, they can sometimes be a bit underwhelming. However, there are a couple of genuinely scary moments, and the game has enough charm that you may want to stick around to see it all.If you're looking for simple jump scares this game has you covered, and if you're interested in some horror game mechanics in a boiled-down scenario, check it out."",1";;;;;;;

"50,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,""This game is basically trying to tell us that jumpscares are really creepy, no matter if they are a creepy face like the one in the """"scary maze game"""", or a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cute pumpkin. You just walk around from room to room and then, suddenly, a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing cardboard with a cute slime appears in your face and BOOM, you need new pants. Well, it becomes really scary when some creepy dead ladies want to eat you and start following you forever. My advice in this situation is to never look back, just run for your life, and try not to stop and scream at some little cute ghost cardboards. Have fun :)"",1";;;;;;;

"55,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""This game has a lot of endearing charm to it. The game manages to be both adorable and threateing at the same time. Admittedly, most of my scares from this game have actually come from really unthreatening things like cups of coffee and pieces of toast, but it goes to show that atmosphere plays a key role in horror, and that you don't need to actually be scary when you have a person on edge."",1";;;;;;;

"58,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis free game contains more quality, originality, and fun then half the full priced horror games I've played.Yeah, it's a jumpscare parade, but they're presented in a well-paced, well structured maner.

"61,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""I wouldn't necesarily say I recomend this game fully. The gameplay is very basic, progression from going room to room gets old, and it's not the most terrifying game to hardened horror fanatics. But, if you got some time to kill, it's a fun distraction in short bursts.The game is very emersive. The ambience is very well done, the sound design alone really makes you feel like you're trapped miles below ground in a endless maze. The humor is very entertaining and quirky, which is probably the strongest point of the game. The """"jumpscares"""" in the name sake aren't the main point of horror. Instead, they're really kind of the joke of the game. When a real threat shows up, it actually doesn't resort to jumpscares. And the monsters are varried enough to keep it suspensful when you're locked in a chase.The only downside, once again, is that it can get old really fast. Basically you just walk room to room. Every now and then you'll read some notes that parody the ones in other cliche horror games. And the jumpscares get more and more sillier. But, sometimes it can feel like a real chore to play this game during long periods. And I have no real interest to go back and find out how to get the good ending, nor do I really want to spend any money for the DLC. But, all in all, it's kind of fun to switch on every now and then when I want something spooky, but not too spooky."",1";;;;;;;

"67,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI keep rushing thinking I'm going to be dead for staying in a room for so long. For one room, I was supposed to check out the slimy thing that slows you down.Then the green man came for me. I nearly died.Great game. The graphics is charming in its own way, and the jumpscares are numerous. From cardboard flaps to 2D man, they will give you a scare. Don't be fooled by how cute it looks at first. Surprisingly, it gives you the horror.I would definitely play this some more. Truth is though, I'm easily scared. So I keep rushing to the nearest door. When I got to the PC part (Cat-DOS was it?), I didn't read everything because I thought by the time I do and exit the program, I'll be dead.I wish I had balls of steel."",1";;;;;;;
"68,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""To start with, I would like to make two things perfectly clear. First, I hate jump scares. They live up to their name, and they scare me. Second, I don't really care for """"Lets Play"""" videos. With that said, something about all the positive feedback this game has received made me want to play it. Hey, as a certain multi-holiday musical once told us """"Life's no fun without a good scare"""". So I tried it, and was not disappointed. The jump scares were so good I Noped out after the second """"Specimen"""". I then promptly pulled a Lets Play video, because I desperately wanted to see the rest of the game. Now, I plan on going back and facing my fears, because I want to play through the rest.This game blends cutesy artwork and characters with horror in an amazing way. Not to mention the obvious references and homages to other Horror games (and a few other fun references as well). It might not be very long, the graphics might not be cutting edge, but it will definitely keep you entertained for a while."",1";;;;;;;

Although it may not look it, Spooky's House is an amazing game that actually shows that true horror is still alive (even though there are still quite a few jumpscares in it XD).

"76,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Note: If you don't want my long winded review and wish to see the pro's/con's of this game just scroll paste my wall of text. However if you want my personal experience feel free to read.Now I have little time with this game keep that noted however i've had enough time with it to do a proper review of first impressions. This game starts off as a fun joke with a few cute jump scares, however that mood quickly turns grim. This game does not succeed with it's graphical appearance however the audio and ambience that you overhear quickly makes up for that. This game looks like it's just something some company threw together however if you go into how the monster is announced or how they introduce the new concepts via different room layouts, it quickly makes up for it's lack of looks with well polished audio as well as design. My first impressions of the game within the first 10 rooms was """"This is a joke of a game and dull already."""" That was until the audio started tugging at the back of my mind and then I paused for the first time with the most creative surprise I had in a while, it was Spooky casually smiling at you through the static of the screen. The reason I mention this is that it was a well done concept that I can honestly say caught me off guard. So all these little things that stick to the back of your mind as you're going room by room pulled by curiosity leaves me to say that this game is definitely a great one. With it's design and use of just a few simple concepts it makes for a good experience. The last thing i'll mention that I liked that made it stand out from other """"horror"""" games is that it right out introduces you the """"player"""" as you dive into this house of horror. This makes for the fact that you directly are introduced, meaning there isn't some dull protagonist that you're hiding behind.Pros: 1:Audio/SFX is well polished and well used.2:Design is different than what i've encountered in the past as well as well thought.3:It slowly takes you deeper into the horror and leads to a climactic build up that was well done from my experience.4:Gives a nostalgic vibe with the room designs as well as environment.5:The game is Free to Play and a well done F2P game at that.Cons:1:Movement was quite odd and clunky at a few segments.2:Does not take kindly to players with a lower DPI 3:Textures were bland and reused makes for a dull expirience till the climax. However this minorly impacts the game.4:Lack of pull factors other than Spooky, and Curiosity and arguably the ambience.Mixed Factors:1:Voice acting was a double edged sword, on one hand it was cute and well presented on the other it wasn't executed properly. I personally enjoyed it, but other's could be turned away from the game with such a presentation.Overall Ratings:SFX/Audio 9/10Design 8/10Voice Acting 7/10Gameplay 6/10Character Introduction 8/10Graphic/Texture Rating 4/10Overal Rating 7.5/10(Keep in mind this is a F2P game)I know this rating doesn't make it seem like a must play game. However for it being Free and so well designed it is worth a try at the very least. I would recommend this game to anyone of my friends in a heartbeat. Keep in mind though that this game immerses you via it's audio cues as well as it's climactic build up. If these factors do not interest you or if you're looking for a fast paced action game this is most likely not going to be something you will enjoy."",1";;;;;;;
"77,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Pros-Anxiaty Inducing Gameplay (which is what a horror game should have)- interesting visual style- good comical moments-lots of jump scaresCons-walking simulatorI really with there was more to this game than moving from room to room running from misc badies. perhaps puzzles or obsticals that increase difficulty when the slower monsters are fallowing you. however for what it is, Spooky's house of jump scares is great. interesting enough to keep you captivated for long periods of time."",1";;;;;;;

"84,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""SUCH A GOOD GAME! I got an idea though, what about MULTPLAYER?

"85,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,""10/10 game. The way the game draws itself out to be an easy game with specimen 1 (cardboard cutouts) is something I personally appreciate. I personally am not a very brave person and was scared by everything and was even scared by specimen 1 since I was expecting something to attack me. The game uses atmosphere to its advantage in an excellent way and after playing the game alone, I have seen stuff move such as my own shadow and flinch (true story). Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion is a great game to play with friends too as my friends would freak out when something happened on the laggy screen I cast onto which would make me smile as I was already in the next room. The only issue I have with the game is the screen moving downwards and to the left occasionally but it was easy to get past. I wish I could take screenshots to share with friends but print screen works just as well as a substitute. Definitely give the game a chance if you have the time since it's free.

According to the game's wiki this game has several bugs which end up killing your character (which wouldn't be so bad if I could save my game whenever I wanted but unfortunately I can only save my game every 50 rooms at particular locations).

"109,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI'll throw the Fact the I haven't played many Games of this Genre in there right off the bat.According to that this Review might differs from the Point of View hold by a Person that has great Interest in the Indie-Horror Genre.Duo to the Fact that this is a Early Access Review I can't get much into Detail because we don't know yet what Changes this Title will see until its Release. Let's jump right to it then, shall we?In my Opinion is this Game quite enjoyable, at least if you don't try to not find it scary. Some Game Mechanics are pretty neat, as for example, the Fact that One can open Doors while walking backwards is something I'd like to see in more Games. I also appreciate CAT-DOS as Source of Background Information a great Deal.  But those are just small Details. I think what defines a Horror Game is the Atmosphere, and that is a very strong Point of this Title. Especially the Music is most of the Time on spot.The Enemy variety is okay for the Amount of Playtime and the the Graphics are pretty cute-ish when it comes to the Surroundings.I also might add that this Game has an pretty interesting Sense of Humor, which is normally not to be expected from a Horror Title. Which I personally can dig a great deal.As for my Part, I'll probably recommend 'Spooky's House of Jump Scares' to everybody who might have a Interest in Video Games of its kind."",1";;;;;;;

Every time you make it through 50 rooms you're greeted with a elavator which takes you down to the next floor below, where the whole â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing process starts all over again. its really boring. oh did i forget to mention the lame jumpscares that sound like my 2 year old sister being tickled?  Oh yeah, once every 100 floors has an enemy in which you just gotta run away from. That's most probably the only fun thing about this game. You see an enemy, run fast through about 8 rooms (which will repeat) untill the enemy randomly disapears. then you're back to walking though the same boring rooms again. Sounds Fantastic doesn't it?

"132,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""The game's premise is compelling, but you'll spend most of your time in this game running through empty rooms with nothing inside them, broken up by the occasional monster chase (all of which fail to excite past the initial encounter after you discover their gimmick) or environmental nudge nudge video game reference. The story is a disconnected mishmash of popular horror tropes that did not make any kind of lasting impression on me.I'm glad I tried it, but it was definitely NOT worth playing through to the end, where I was met with an unsatisfying conclusion to the story";;;;;;;
"133,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI have been playing this game since january and, looking at how the game has evolved I can really say that the effort put in this one was really well used and this game is really genuine. Its mixture of cute element, showing a game with stylish textures and  horror, with well conceived monsters and references from other games, like silent hill, resident evil and five night at freedy, has made me a fan of this game.As for the early access, I must say that the game plays just fine, but there still many bugs that I've noticed that annoyed considerably, especially those related with the music and sounds, with sometimes fails to play. Also, there is an error message that keep appearing when subject 4 is on the loose. But considering the early stage of this game, I believe it still worthy the try."",1";;;;;;;

"135,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""After seeing the positive response I thought """"OK, give it a try"""". Omg, what a disappointment. I don't get it at all. I never regreted wasting time on a free game THIS much. It has NOTHING else to offer then going through repetitive, boring, empty rooms over and over again. You will tell yourself, there has to be something behind the next door, but there isn't. There just isn't! Think about it... There may be a refund for money now on steam, but no refund for wasted time!"",0";;;;;;;
136,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Not that scary but still fun! Don't know what to say about it really. I know many will get scared by it and I guess it gets scarier later on but yeah. Try it out. You'll notice if you like it or not. :),1;;;;;;;
137,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,really the game was fun early on but after play it to room 300 you get this puppet that follows you and cant get away from he just hits you when ever and it makes it impossible to get past the small scares get boring this game is kinda a waste of time i do not recomend it. ,0;;;;;;;

"140,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,""One thing you need to know is: Perhaps in 800 of the 1000 rooms absolutely nothing is happening. Once you realize that, the game completely loses its horror.Thus, while in the beginning I was nervous, that faded away and the game became simply boring and tedious.While I can see how many people sincerely enjoy this game, unfortunately I have to say that I feel more like it wasted my time, with me waiting for something cool to happen."",0";;;;;;;

142,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,so a friend of mine already finished the game and i iam just to scared to play it but i still played a bit but anyways you when playing the game will face and endless repetitive room cycle whith no return.gameplay:actually not bad symple controls good spoopy atmosphere and it kinda as a SCP containment breach vibe to it.story (some spoilers): i havent got most of it but for what i got is that spooky (the ghost in the beginning) is trying to make an army of monsters aka specimens wich she created and ghosts which are the ppl that she killed with the monsters just so she can take over the world and make ppl stop calling her cute.overall: preety good game give it a try if you aren to spooked by eye bussines (i know i am) and try to get to the end (there are 2 btw). tip: if you want to understand the story read EVERYTHING.,1;;;;;;;
"143,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,""1000 rooms, only 10 or so that are unique. Finale is not only clunky, but makes no sense and leaves a lot to be desired.I've never seen a game with so much filler.This game has such a long buildup, it makes it seem like there's something at least interesting at the end.The best way I can describe this game is unsatisfying. The virtual epitome of blue balls.

Well, you'll get them, but you'll also get a lot more.Put simply, this game is a love letter to horror. At times it might be repetitive, but despite its cute graphical style, it also might genuinely freak you out too. The game really picks up after 50 or so rooms, so try to make it to around 100 before making a judgement.It's free, so it's definitely worth a go, despite what you might think.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KaXZw9q_sw "",1";;;;;;

156,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Great game its not to scary i feel its good for people who are not much into the constant jumpscares but defenetly always has you lookng around. the reason why i rated this so early was because i got to room 59 and the alien â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ came at me and i was like nope nope nope nope nope,1;;;;;;;

"158,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""This game is great. I give it a 7 out of 10.This game is new and fresh because it's different than most horror game. It enbraces stereotypes of horror games in a cute and funny way to trick you. But before you know it the real horror begins with enticing chases and heart racing music that will put you in your seat. Don't be scared of the 1000 room bulletin. Every room is short and quick and your sprint refreshes everytime you enter a new room.  spoiler alert:[/you die in both endings]There is a good ending and a bad ending. And the good ending is worse but I feel like the end would be better if [/you didn't die] but at the same time that would kind of be a cop out. This game gets my nomination for the """"I thought this game was cool before it won an award"""""",1";;;;;;;

Well it has and adorable ghost who is not only funny, is cool. there are jump scares, which make you want to hit yourself, ie cardboard cutouts- which is greatthe number of specimens or enemies makes adrenaline high, and makes for non repetitive interesting gameplay. all with non immersion breaking music. the narrative is amazing - more info at the end of the game! i highly recommend you challenge this game, its hard at fiirst but you get in the swing of it quickly - 5 stars"",1";;;;;;;
"161,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is REALLY well made. I love it! I just bought the game yesterday, but I've known about the game for months as i've seen Markiplier play it. Right now I'm at 100 room and that first monster that chaced me was scary!

"163,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,""This game really is a good one. Albeit it being cute, it still has the spookiest parts at all times. Sometimes, I refuse to keep going, because I freeze with fear every 56 rooms or so. So far, I'm still scared of the Merchant (basically specimen 6) every single time, because, that face is just screaming agony. So, yah. I would nominate this as the scariest game in my book. And, believe me, I don't get scared easily."",1";;;;;;;
"164,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""Want a Jump Scare game but don't have enough $$$ for Five Nights at Freddies?

165,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,At first Ä± thought this was just a small jump scare game that makes you feel like there is a catch in it and not cute at all. I played it and kept going Ä± saw the slime thing and the bug thing didnt scare me at all. but once Ä± entered the school room Ä± realised what a mistake Ä± have done. First it was the japanese girl after that there were the puppets and some other things Ä± was too afraid to look while running away even the cute jump scares were scary as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ but nothing was scary enough compared to him... The doll make with his syringe andâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tick tack noises coming after u if you dont look at him Ä± screamed like hell. After that Ä± realised this is a good game for group activity so Ä± offered to many groups that Ä±m part of 10/10 greaty scary game and halloween activity,1;;;;;;;
"166,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Creepy as hell but fun, keeps you on your feet, nice small rooms yet some are just brutal. Also there is bug issue of accesing steam while in gameplay, think you could fix that? overall, great game"",1";;;;;;;
"167,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,""This game puts great humor in horror. It gets dark in some areas and has the tendency to scare you with things you will be ashamed to admit have scared you. The progression of the rooms feels repetitive, but this is perfect to get the player off guard to hit them with, you guessed it, a jumpscare. Whether the scare be a puppet, a deer, a spider, or even a cup of tea, everything in this game does a good job at scaring someone their first playthrough or so. The style of it makes it one of the cutest and creepiest scary games you can play."",1";;;;;;;

"171,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewHoly Hell! Give this thing your full attention if you are at all interested in the horror genre. Despite the name, the game is only sparsely reliant on simple jump scares and instead paints a truly horrific atmosphere of dread, tension and tongue-and-cheek satire. It's a really good sign when you're on pins and needles at the mere prospect of opening a door. I found this one thoroughly difficult to put down for long. Seriously, This programmer deserves a friggin' medal!--Plus, the low res graphics make the visuals doubly creepy. Bonus!"",1";;;;;;;

"180,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""After seeing a negative review of this game,even though the majority like it,I wanted to make a review talking about what a GREAT horror game this is.First of all,it's free.I really see no reason why you shouldn't get it just to try it out.Karamari Hospital (The DLC) costs just under $6,but if you enjoyed the game I would recommend the dlc.Now,I'm gonna get into the main review.The game itself does have a lot of references,but that's what makes it great.The game doesn't feel like it """"stole"""" these concepts from anything,the closest it gets to other games/movies is slight references.1.If you find jump scares scary.GET THIS GAME.2.If you are unsure,try watching Markiplier or someone play it,that's how I found out about it.Just make sure you only watch a bit,so that the game still has some surprises.3.I found I rarely died from enemies,but that was because I was absolutely terrified of them,and wouldn't get near them.TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE ENEMIES!!(I won't say them all,just some stuff to know)(Possible Spoilers)Specimen 1.The main specimens take the form of cardboard cut outs,at first they aren't scary,but later into the game,I began to fear them more then the actual enemies.They jump scare you,but the do it ALL the time,and it's terrifying.Specimen 2 and 3 chase you around,they aren't the scariest.I skipped a bit of the game,(I'm gonna replay it all soon),so I missed the specimen 4 and 5 parts.They still look spooky though.Specimen 6 is well...The bane of my existence.Specimen 6 is probably one of the scariest monsters in the game,as he will stalk you down,and slaughter you.His death screen terrified me,and his area contains a lot of Zelda references,which I quite enjoyed.Just,when you play the game,BE READY FOR SPECIMEN 6.Specimen 7 isn't really scary.But it confuses you,and makes chase's with other monsters MUCH HARDER.Specimen 8 is the deer god.Things in his area start out fairly un-scary,but then 8 shows up,and the terror begins.Although not one of the scariest,he is probably on the most memorable.Specimen 9 randomly appears if you spend too long in a room.I have never encountered him before,[spoileri] He re-appears as the final boss of the game,whom you battle with an axe.It is fun,and similar to the Ganon battle from LOZ:OOC.[/spoileri] Specimen 10 is featured in a cool 'futuristic' area.I don't entirely remember him,but I remember he is VERY hard to run away from.Specimen 11,who I refer to as the 'beef god',is one of the scariest enemies in the game.I remember him from let's plays of the game,so maybe I was just nervous when I entered his area.The area he is in is a fast food restaurant area.There is a lot to do before meeting him,but it is very unnerving,especially since the music is terrifying.Specimen 12 the 'old man' or 'the mansion' is one massive room.It takes the place of a mansion,where you complete various tasks while running from the 'old man'.It was very fun,and scary.Specimen 13 who I call 'the siren' is a monster very similar to Kaernk from 'Amnesia:The Dark Descent'.You must frantically run to different crates floating in a flooded room in order to escape the siren.It was really fun,and the area before was very scary.That raps up the review of the monsters,but I have a few more things to say.1.The game doesn't have amazing graphics,but that kinda adds to the horror.2.The game has A LOT OF REFERENCES,which is one of the best parts of the game.3.THIS GAME IS TERRIFYING.(atleast if jumpscares scare you :3)I would definitely recommend this game.10/10  "",1";;;;;;;

"182,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,""The only scary thing about this game is that the developers thought that slowly walking around opening doors with interjections of comically-horrendous jump scares every 10 minutes would somehow be playable. It's not.I originally played this game at a friend's, which meant I had to install the game on my own machine and play for 5 minutes in order to be eligible to write a review. I imagine the feeling is similar to that of visiting an uncle that abused you as a child. My non-masochistic nature screamed at me to stop, but I felt I had an obligation to bridge some of the unprecedented gap between the game's reviews and its quality."",0";;;;;;;
"183,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""The game has fun and spooky moments but most of the time is spend walking through the same rooms over and over again which makes it extremely boring. Every 100 rooms (=1floor), there are generally 2 or 3 stuff happening, a big room (which is actually multiple rooms) with spooky stuff, a monster running after you in the regular rooms near the end of the floor, and some notes left by some dude for you to read. Otherwise you're just walking through the same rooms over and over. Sometimes you think a room is important but it's actually just a regular room with nothing special. Oh and jump scares.But when you're not walking through the randomly chosen clone rooms the game has some good ideas.Hopefully it's free but the sections where nothing happens are so long that you're wondering if you're not paying the game with your time."",0";;;;;;;

"188,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""Its a very slow burn of a game, but I'm not sure if there's actual payoff. After 300 rooms it just felt like this was a hallway simulator with a rare jump scare. You would think with a name like House of Jump Scares that it would have too many, but no, it doesn't really have too much of anything except hallways. Kudos on the horror pop culture references, but I'm not sure who this game is for. Its too cute to be spooky and too dark to be cute."",0";;;;;;;
"189,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI have completed the game and got the bad ending.I've also gotten the other ending.This game starts out really terrifying, with the music and graphics. But it only gets worse, Monsters will start chasing you and sounds will creep you out. At points you are tested on various tasks of survival. There are many wonderful things I could talk about Spooky's. Specimen 4 is one of my favorite enemies in the entire game, the red bloody claws and calm behavior make her awesome.Spoiler warning:The late game really tests your patience and observance, stalkers, water monsters, long halls and very awkward corridors make the monsters who get faster later on more challenging. You will make mistakes ultimately leading to your death if you're not careful. Seriously! This game can get fairly challenging at points. I like it when games add challenge which the game lacked when it wasn't finished. The game is still fair once you know what you're doing. I also enjoyed the bad ending.Overall I find players may appreciate this game for what it is."",1";;;;;;;

"192,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Short review for a cute but short """"Spooky"""" horror game. Spooky's House of Jump Scares is a indie 1st person walking simulator, you take on the role of an historian on an expedition to explore a strange castle. After this you're given little to no explanation other than the odd notes found through the game. The game basically boils down to open door, proceed through room open next door. It gets old really, really fast. To keep things interesting, the game throws some new enemy types (which I honestly couldn't tell apart from the others) and they spice things up with the rooms. The biggest problem with this game is repetition, I think somewhere around 70-80% of rooms are always empty and are basically the same. It's really boring to be honest, and even the ocasional jump-scare won't impress you after you realise you spent 3-4 hours pressing E to proceed in a """"horror"""" game. It had some interesting ideas to it, but it's just too boring to play. I guess if they made the rooms more random it would have been ok, but eh. It still feels boring and bland to play, it's ok for the first 15-20 minutes but don't expect much to change.The good:Good audioDecent atmosphereThe Bad:Lackluster gameplayRepetitive roomsLack of variety overallBoringA 4/10 at best"",0";;;;;;;
"193,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is a game that I would have spend $10 dollars to buy. First of all, it's a completely new concept for a horror game that completely blew my mind. Also, the variety of monsters in this game is superb, and all of them equally terrifying. I must say though, the puppet was the most terrifying since it reminded me of the weeping angels from Dr. Who (yes, I am a nerd, I know that.) Conclusion? Download the game! It's amazing, it's free, and an excellent horror experience!

"195,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt's a great game with plenty of things to scare you. The scariest for me are the violent deer and that Deer God thing. The game would be better if it had full controller support. Other than that, it's perfect! It's startling, scary, and spine tingling. Not for the average gamer. Oh, and if you though Five Nights at Freddy's was bad, try this. Have fun!"",1";;;;;;;
"196,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""Just finished the game and while it does have quite an atmosphere to go on as well as the music, the game do become rather repetetive with the rooms. From what I understand the rooms that are not scripted are randomized and yield different results.The specimens were unique in their own ways, but they weren't too much of an issue once you understand how each work and can deal with them with rather ease.The stories that you learn throughout the game have no lasting appeal in the game, they happen and once you get past one it's over and is forgotten suddenly.Playing through the game by making it past 1000 rooms is not worth it, you're not rewarded with the endeavours you go through, it's basically just a non-standard game over anyway where you accomplish nothing, i.e., just a bad ending.On another note, it is indeed for free so you could give the game a go and see for yourself whether you'd like the game or not. This game, however, just isn't my cup of tea."",0";;;;;;;

199,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Early Access ReviewAfter jumping a little bit from spider and pumpkin cutouts I decide to run down the hallways backwards. It seemed like a brilliant idea at the time. I walk into a room. See weird goo on ground. Realize this is when it gets â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing terrifying. Read emo love poem on table. Turn around. Scream irl. Quit game. Really fun 10/10. Scarier than amnesia.,1;;;;;;;
"200,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewSaw it on Pewdiepie's channel in youtube and then played it, best game 10/10 lol.No, seriously... It's spooky, even with those graphics. I think you're going in the right way guys, keep on going!"",1";;;;;;;
"201,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI did not think any of the reviews about actually getting a jump would be real.... then I was just gliding through some rooms, no care in the world... GAHHH. Ok, it's legit."",1";;;;;;;
202,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Early Access ReviewOne of the best indie horrors  out there atm~ Maaaybe for some of you it's not better then FnaF but hey you gotta admit it's a decent horror game. Play it! GET SPOOKED!rate 7.8/10 ghosts,1;;;;;;;
203,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,THIS IS A NOPE GAME FOR A NOPE SOMEBODY. I TELL YOU DOWNLOAD AT YOUR OWN RISK! THIS IS A HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE CAUSING GAME. IT ALSO BREAKS YOUR 3000$ DOLLAR COMPUTER IF YOUR NOT CARFUL ENOUGH (FROM SLAIMING IT IN FEAR). BUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPRESS YOUR FRIENDS SPEED RUN THIS YOU WONT NO BALLS,1;;;;;;;
"204,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI don't care what anyone says, Specimen 1 is the most dangerous.This is a pretty spooky game, especially once you start getting further into it. For the lovely price of FREE I'd have to recommend it to anyone who wants to be spooked a little. Maybe not too scary to the more hardcore types who laugh in the face of all danger, but for most people I'd think it's pretty good. Some dangers are easily beaten, however, and the terror starts to wane once you realize how to escape them easily. But hey, it's free and a small download, couldn't hurt to try unless you have a weak heart."",1";;;;;;;
"205,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,""I downloaded this game thinking it was going to be an easy-going, fun, and cutesie game.  It's not.  This was actually scary.  It was fun until room 26.  After that, HELL.  At least for me anyway, it may differ for everyone.  Anyways, I recommend this game to people branching out into the horror genre.8/10"",1";;;;;;;
206,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Early Access ReviewWell its freaking awesome. I almost punch my Laptop cause of the Jump scares.

"210,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""This is a great game in my opinion. I loved it just going through 1000 rooms from being cute to freakin terrifing it really is a great game, but thier is one thing about the game that I really hate and i hope you will change it in the future I mean it is still in early access and im sure thiers still things that you need to fix but what I dont like is the ending becuase throughout the game besides trying to survive Im always thinking of what heppen to this place or what was this place and who was Spooky really also what were they exactly doing here it was the mystery that also really kept me going through the game and I just couldent wait to see what happens at the end and dreams crushed Spooky was creating an army and all the shadow people were people before me to go in the mansion but I was confused becuase I still dont know what exactly this place was or what they were doing or how Spooky became well Spooky and you didnt even explained why she was creating an army what was the purpose of all of this is thier going to be a second game that explains all of ths (a prequal) or is that really it cause I really got into the game but then boom worst ending ever all of that all of what i was trying to figure out was for nothing. no offence but ending was worst then Outlast (person your playing dies after all that youve done in the game)."",1";;;;;;;

"213,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis is a very unique and great game. The reason I love it is it scares me so badly and yet I am determined to finish it. What this game does, is it sets you in a false sense of security, makes you feel like one room is safe and okay, and then when you go to the next room it rips you to pieces with its terrifying jumpscares. From the monsters (I HATE YOU WEEPING ANGEL PUPPET MASTER YOU SCARE ME TO BITS BUT ITS AWESOME) to the cute little jumpscares, this game has it all. If you enjoy horror and things that can really set you in the right mood to want to scream, then check this game out. I don't recommend it to people who are susceptible to heart attacks, because this game could cause one if you don't take a break every now and then, but other than that this game is awesome, and I love it. Can't wait for it to be finished fully! <3"",1";;;;;;;

"215,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""The best way for me to describe this game is as a much need satire of the horror genre. Experienced as if you're playing the history of the genre from the worst of the newest, to the best of the classics.Starts out with the very worst of the genre the modern cheap jumpscare tactics, and slowly brings in tropes from classic games making it better and better the more rooms you go through.The DLC while not neccesary, itself is a homage to PT/silent hills, even going so far as to have """"RIP Konami"""" in the credits.Everything good and wrong with this genre in one game. 10 out of 10"",1";;;;;;;

THIS WAS THAT GAME. Now I saw it in the store and thought """"Hmmm wtf is this kids game"""" But my curiosity of course led me to clicking on it. I was surprised by it's fantastic reviews. So I of course decided to give it a look. Upon entering this game you're thrown into door simulator 2015. At around room 30 I was hit with my first jump scare. A small cardboard cut out of a tree. Now, this doesnt seem like much until you understand I literally had to take a 30 second break, I was so panicked. Granted I'm not very good at dealing with horror but still. After finally completing the game, being chased by the most horrifying monsters with the most horrifying effects through changing terrain and a variety of different twists, I found myself nearly screaming with every new twist. This is not a kids game boys. Buckle up and prepare your body's because this game holds back nothing in it's efforts to make you jump out of your skin."",1";" I was really expecting something more as I progressed, but that expectation never materialized.I think this game could be something really good, but as of right now, it could absolutely stand to be pared down to 500 rooms of cute terror.

"238,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game made me want to run away from my computer and never turn it back on again. It's surprising how scary a game, that looks like it was made in 1995, can be. You end up sprinting through every room knowing that if you stay still for just a moment you're likely to get ripped to peices and some horrible annimation will come up on the screen that would be enough to give your children future mental issues and kill off your grandma. So you run and you run, even from the sounds coming from everywhere, and you run straight into a guy that wants to put a pin through your eyeball and turn you into one of his puppets. My advice would be: Assume everybody and everything wants to kill you, don't explore, just run as fast as you can... Into a cardboard cut-out of a pumpkin that will jump out at you, and that in any other situation wouldn't be all that bad, but here it makes you fall backwards off your chair.

I think it peaked out at 750 rooms, but I continued till about 1021 before deciding to quit. Don't judge this game by its silly appearance...

The graphics are definitely akin to those you probably saw in your childhood days when playing Doom, but the floating ghost, Spooky, and the randomly cute jump-scare plywood cut outs are really what make this game. It's positively adorable, with a perfect amount of terror thrown in, and has me ITCHING for the day that my PC is replaced so that I can play it. I can't wait to see how this game developes.- Graecyn K | PCGamerGirl.COM "",1";;;;;;;
"257,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access Review*note* Pay no attention to the time as i got this game when it was on indieDB and got pretty far before letting it collect dust while pursuing other games (and the fact i got as far as worth proceeding in version 1.2). Now for the review.I'm not really a person who could judge what is considered """"cute"""". i guess the cardboard cutouts are a bit amusing. that said those same cutouts are made me jump more than once when they appear after just barely escaping an enemy that doesn't need to follow the path to catch you. So in that regard i guess you could call them scary too. i also like that it seems that the devs stopped throwing a cutout at you every other room (like how they were in the indieDB version i played). But outside of those """"enemies"""", the actual enemies are terrifying and will definitely get your heart racing. on top of that if it's your first time playing they can catch you off guard as there's no rhyme or reason for some of their appearances. What i mean is that unlike other horror games (good ones that is) there is a build up to an enemies appearance and on some occasions the """"rules"""" to win against said enemies are laid out. take for example the first resident evil, the first zombie encounter is built up using sound effects to create an uneasy feeling of not knowing what's in the room with you. following up on that the rules for winning are laid out as if you try to fight the first zombie A) you'll notice you use up almost all your ammo and B) that you'll take damage whereas avoiding it you'll notice things like you are faster and more agile than the zombies (well agile while using tank controls) so evasion is a preferred option when you can.That's not to say that how the enemies appear in SPHJ is bad in fact the opposite. the fact you don't know when you'll encounter a type of enemy or how to beat it without trying a few times against a new enemy adds it's own eeriness as you don't know what the next room holds for you. You have to constantly think on the fly and adapt even quicker.However this brings up an issue i have with the game, there's way too much luck involved. i'll give a good example, the first enemy you meet is pretty easy to figure out, just run. but that strategy will bite you in the rear when you come to the first """"catwalk"""" room (that's what i call it at least, the room with the narrow walkways that split in multiple directions). If you just dead sprint you have a 50/50 chance of taking the wrong path and getting cornered and that enemy takes you out in 3 hits.There are other points like this as there's an enemy i saw in markipliers playthrough i've yet to encounter that seems to appear at random with no way to figure out what you did wrong (or right in my case as, again, i haven't encountered the red face enemy in any of my playthroughs). so like i said, this game takes alot of luck if you're going to get far (or just alot of patience till you get that lucky run).the other issue i have i'm not sure if it's an aesthetic choice to encourage players to keep calm or if it's just how the game happened to be made. the issue is that you have to press forward every time you enter a room. what i mean is that you can't just hold down the W key and keep moving as soon as you enter the next room. No, in each room you have to release the key and press it again to move. this is really annoying against the aforementioned first enemy as if you forget this you won't move (and take damage) till you remember to release the forward key and press it again. Like i said i'm not sure if it's intentional or not, if it's not then i hope the devs will work on this as it's basically a cheap beginner's trap. But other than those two issues i do really think this is a good horror game and can't wait to see what the full release is like."",1";" I for one have to say how terrified I was of what happened in room 60 and beyond.For now, this game gets a 6/10. Pros:~ Great Art Design that looks great and brings me back to 1995 and Doom related games.~ While there are a lot of rooms that seem the same, there are subtle nuances that make them a bit different each time.~ The Jump scare moments, especially with the cute cut-outs actually got me. Kudos.~ Easy to get hooked.Cons:~ Audio bug that sounded like a bowl of Rice Krispies in my ears.~ Game is prone to crashing on the warning screen especially but anytime after that as well.~ No options section in the main menu except to teleport to different sections of the game (Room 50, 100, 150, etc.)"",1";;;;;;
"258,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI want to preface my review by stating that I find this game to be fun even with the minimalist aspects of walking from one room or passage to another. The intrigue of what will be in the next room entertains me and leaves me with a sense of wonder. I keep feeling a voice in my head say, """"Just one more room..."""" and so on as my character explores the mansion.I love the art design, and the cell-shaded look to it along with the cute """"cutouts"""" that pop up in tight spaces here and there look very well done. I will have to say this though, there was a constant popping in the audio feed which made it a bit annoying to continue further in the game and it also took me at least ten tries before I could get past the warning screen and move ahead in the game without it crashing on me. I actually thought I was doing well, making it to the 75th room when I stopped to play a mockup of House of the Dead, and the game crashed on me yet again.I hope that they fix that bug as well as the audio bug that is still haunting this game because I think it has a lot of potential";;;;;;;
"259,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewGreat game, the horror aspects are great, also like the Kuybei reference. Can you have it where you can use a controller, and the steam overlay while in the game. That would make it much better:) Cheers Michael"",1";;;;;;;

A few complaints, but otherwise really great.Pros:-Great Pacing-Wonderfully offputting environments-Some great monstersCons:-That â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING puppet-Spooky was abysmally written.

"265,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewSo I'm playing this game thinking """"Oh I've been pretty well at horror games in the past. This shouldn't be too hard."""" WRONG. HOLY CRAP IS THIS GAME WELL MADE. Okay, so it rips off some other horror games, but it uses them all pretty well. When you get to a new checkpoint, and move to a new area, the door animation looks directly ripped from the first Resident Evil. That alone sent chills down my spine. And the fact that no two games are the same makes for an interesting playthrough. What might have been the way to get out of a room once might change completly the next time you find that room. Oh, and you will also find the same rooms all the time. The only differences are that some monster/ghost is in the next room. With the hidden layers of story like FNAF, the gameplay of Amnesia (wandering around aimlessly), and the erieness of Slender, this game is fantastic."",1";;;;;;;

It's a very simplistic idea but it's also done very well. Even the jump-scares are done right, showing that timing and sound is what matters.There is a story and it's rather cute. Cute enough to be out of place, and that's why it's good. Everything feels out of place just to screw with you. It's not a pretty game with high quality gore and HD blood. It's a simple game that throws you into the unknown and cute world of """"something is off but I can't put my finger on it"""".The only issue that I had with it is the framerate.

However, there is just too much laid back time. I find myself running through the rooms, just trying to make it to the next save point.  It would be nice if the monsters within the house appeared even just a little bit more often, or if the room designs varied much more. It was bland seeing the same rooms over and over again.The chases are nice. The music goes along well with the chases, as well, creating a good environment for when your running away from death. The designs of the things you see inside are very interesting and creepy indeed.All it really needs is more variety and less time spent walking through a load of empty rooms.

"276,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe things I dislike about Early Access title, is that indie developers never fulfilled their promises.  I know there's a lot of them that are still not complete to this day.  So hopefully this interesting horror game can final nail it.  Spooky's House of Jump Scares is very similar to one series that is part of the Creepypasta Universe: SCP Foundation.  Also know as Secure Contain Protect.  This game has the similar premises of the SCP Foundation, and its a decent one at best.  These specimen you encounter adds nice tension throughout each same rooms that you enter over and over again, even the game mentions about it, if you read the notes that is to get you more invested to the game lore.  The game sadly doesn't learn a thing or two from Bloodborne and Alien Isolation, which those game refines the horror genre completely.  Yes I am aware this came out at January before Bloodborne got released.  I would have expected the game break free from the cliches that horror games have been stuck with in the past.  I'm looking at you both Slender and Amnesia!The gameplay is all about running away from the Specimen and go to one room to the next.  You have a health bar and stamina system that it seems its trying to play like Dark Souls a bit in First-Person, the game has no boss battles at all, so the challenges is to run away and dig yourself into the game lore.  You take damage if your too close to the Specimens, however you can get instant killed by one of them if your not very careful in one room.  You do get an axe very late in the game but combat feels sloppy at times, maybe it'll be better integrated at full release?  Sadly the game is not complete right now.  There's still a few rooms to go in order to see more Specimen and finally know the truth behind this curses house and the company behind it.The optimization is bad, there's no way to change the resolution, or the game doesn't have settings to make the game perform better.  You can change the framerate but that about it.  Hopefully, the creator will make the game run a lot better than the state its currently in right now!  Visually its not a bad looking game, the Specimen looks nice, they have quite disturbing powers to mess with you, and the sound effects are average at best.  Not much to say about the score, its ok for now.  Maybe the final build will have a good credit theme when you reach the one room to get the answers we all want.  Who knows when this will be finished.  So I'm recommending this.  Because its free, and well despite its disappointing shortcomings the game has potential to be something worth playing from beginning to end.  Why not let your friends play it, or better let some young child play it and he or she will know what its like getting their guts spooked!  Hee hee hee..."",1";;;;;;;

"282,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewBy far the best horror game I have ever played! TOTALLY worth what ever they will make it. It starts with a really cutsy feel then BOOM blood and gore, it is amazing! 10/10!Only problems: You glitch in the walls when you run into them (bad for the puppeteer) and the mouse sensetivity is VERY low";;;;;;;
"283,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewWas genuinely spooped, will definetly continue playing when I have more time.However there are some annoying thing from a technical standpoint. Firstly it shouldn't reset inputs when going through doors, it's quite annoying and I ended up turning on sticky keys accidentally, secondly going through slime makes camera jittery and finally the bounding box for movement. It's 2015 please don't use those for movement at least not in a game that focuses on very small spaces like this. It's not exactly a huge change in a proper engine, or at least give some lean way/make it smaller alltogheher."",1";;;;;;;
"284,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game is incredibly deceptive, both by name and nature...For a start, despite bieng called a """"House of jumpscares"""", Spooky's them parky, housey thingy is actually very good at doing the precise opposite and builds an atmostphere. From the humble beginnings of kawaii cardboard cutouts (the first 2 or three will make you jump), the game slowly but surely builds into a more menacing beast, with a host of different creatures that include some great throwbacks to other great creepypastas/horror games. The games controls are simple, with you bieng able to move around Fps stylie and interact with objects such as keys and doors (and I think theres an axe later on) as well as some hilariously misgiving minigames that pretty much give you a summary of the game as a whole in the sense that they go from innocent to ultraviolent in mere miliseconds...Overall, for the deceptively cute art style, deceptively likeable main character, deceptively lively mu- no actually, the music doesn't lie to you at all, I would really recommend giving this game a shot. Never before have I ever considered checking my wardrobe for cardboard skeletons..."",1";;;;;;;
"285,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game starts slowly and lures you into a false sense of security, easing you in with its cute charm. Cardboard skeletons will startle you, but you're not scared. No sir. Hmm. What's that green puddle on the floor? What is that thing coming towards m- OH GOD IT'S STABBING ME RUN RUN RUN RUN. It gets good. Real good. But it's never so scary that you have to NOPENOPENOPE out of the game. I finished the 760 rooms currently available and greatly look forward to the remainder. 10/10 would jump at cardboard cutouts again."",1";;;;;;;
"286,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewAs the self-proclaimed most prone to jump scares I was wary going into this game. I was afraid it would be another 5 Nights at Freddy's or some other halfâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥horror game. But surprisingly this turned out to be really â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing good. Forgive my profane remarks, but I was under the impression that this would be a joke game, kind of silly. But I was wrong, oh was I so so dearly wrong. The first few jumpscares are cardboard cutouts that are so cute, they're terrifying. The sudden nature of their breaking out destroyed me. There are little boss monsters, but nothing too major. At least until that... little girl. Ugh. The main horrors are based off of a myriad of different horror games. There is a slime monster, that I just equate to Slimer from Ghostbusters. There is a spider that is from Resident Evil. There is a little ghost girl whom I can only assume is from F.E.A.R. And then the return of death incarnate for me. Silent Hill references. Which, unlike Silent Hill P.T actually exist. Pros:-Great Cartoon graphics-Note Gathering Mechanic that deepens Lore-Cute as â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ antagonist-Cute as heck jumpscares-Smooth gameplay-Mysteries abound Cons: -fukkin jumpscares meng"",1";;;;;;;
287,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,Early Access ReviewI've heard it's a great game. I only played it for like 5-10 min though cuz the sound wasn't working right. Might need some help on fixing that. If you now how to fix it tell me. ,1;;;;;;;
"288,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewAfter playing through all of the game that's finished so far, I must say I'm very impressed. Considering that the game is not only unfinished but also free, it's a very enjoyable experience I would reccommend to anyone else. I'm not usually a fan of horror games, but this one really pulled me in with its self parody and clever references. The game starts out very cute and innocent, the first """"enemies"""" in the game are cardboard cutouts of skeletons and slimes that pop out from the wall. As the game progresses and more serious and deadly monsters join in, you reach a point where you are so on edge that even the cutouts make you jump. I would absolutely encourage anyone else to pick this up for a few hours of scary/cute fun."",1";;;;;;;

As the flame raises, so does your hysteria. You can feel all the nutrients draining from your skin, and the leather soles of your shoes melting away.

Came across it, looked cute and didn't think it would be that scary, I actually downloaded it to troll. So I play, lovin' the graphic style, then things start popping out and I start getting terrified to the point I'd rather just play Amnesia.Since then, this game has muc bigger rooms, more objects, a weapon, many more sounds for the scares, windows, etc. I actually played it a bit too much to where it didn't really scare me but after this it got me because of these new sounds. There are also dark rooms in which a flashlight is needed, and the HUD has been improved. This game can really turn into something amazing. What I disliked is the stupid intro..

Such a cool game, with no expensive pre-order exclusives, dlcs or monetization... a full, free horror game...? Just Freaking Grab IT ALREADY!!Alright, fair enough this is my review after a first look at Spooky's House of Jumpscares. A really cool, interesting and original psychological horror game. With a cute and simplistic art style, the game does a really good job of immersing you into the atmosphere, with creeping looking corridors, scattered notes, and well timed music. The jumpscares are spaced enough to not be too common, but they do come up at just the right time to scare yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥off. The multiple kinds of enemies to doesn't allow you to get to comfortable, but the progression through them is very well made. And with a few minigames to add some subtle messages to it, this game is totally worth the grab... even more so since it's free. Totally recommend it... 10/10.If you're still not convinced, I played this game live on twitch, so if you're interested to see how it looks, here's the highlights: http://www.twitch.tv/caramida10/c/6602001I only managed to make it to room 300 before my heart gave out, but I'm really pumped to continue.

"305,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThe game is great for easing players into first person horror games as well as it's references to other famous horror games such as SCP and Silent Hill, I fairly enjoyed the game and was a little disappointed that there wasn't an option to adjust video settings but that's alright.Only found like 2 bugs within the game, one being that your stamina drains each time you press space even if you're standing still, the other bug is each time you enter a new room the game can't read which key is being pressed so you just stand still unless you press the key again. also as a side note I don't know if it's a bug or not but when being chased by Heather she tends to get stuck by the door entrance when running from her in the walless maze rooms."",1";;;;;;;

"308,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewSo this game is a good horror game that relies mostly on the """"It's going to get you"""" scares, and pop ups. You'll find notes scattered about that develop a story and pull you into the game to give you a reason to keep going. The rooms also do a good job at being interesting and giving enviormental clues. I wont say much else as experincing it first hand is really the only way to even understand what others might be saying. I wound up dying in a fashion that I didn't understand in room 312 due to an encounter, but I'll defintely pick it up again to see it through to the end. Worth the free price. 10/10 Would unwrap a dissapointing present again."",1";;;;;;;
"309,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,""Best free horror game on the market. Builds tension in all the right ways, then delivers with a sickening, gut-wrenching thud right to the brain.

"310,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewFun for a quick jump scare, Quite a long game for a completely free to play game. It starts off cutesy but soon gets darker (in lighting and tone).7/10Review:Spooky's House of Jump Scares is a fairly fun 'horror' game. It starts with a rather cute looking ghost 'spooky' telling you to traverse the rooms of the mansion, Along the way you'll see cute cardboard cutouts of octopi and ghosts. As you get further into the mansion you will meet other monsters that will chase in a less jump scary fashion such as a slime monster or a ghost girl.The only real downfalls this game has is that it is rather repetitive, as it is jump scares after a short while they lose their edge and scariness so you just end up speeding through each room and majority of the monsters are just slow chasers so you can just outrun them. It does have some different sections amidst the repetitive-ness such as a space-like section, a rusty school section, etc.It's mainly a shame that after room 760 there is nothing new (for now) as the developer has a message pop up stating that from then on it is incomplete."",1";;;;;;;
"311,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewThis game.... It's so charming and cute, atleast, for the first part of the game, it's a very satirical game, and it knows how to be satirical perfectly. And best of all it's absolutely FREEEEEE!!!!"",1";;;;;;;

It's a seemingly cute and cuddly parody of modern horror games, where you travel around a massive mansion full of terrifying monsters.

Leaving my thumbs up as-is but BEWARE.-----This free game """"Spooky's House of Jump Scares"""" is a wonderful diversion from your peace of mind and free time.You can see me play through a portion of the game on my YouTube channel here: https://youtu.be/hqRN22FSJxE Pros: -Free-Has jump scares as advertised-Has a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ton of rooms-Interesting graphical style compared to other horror games-Sound effects and music are just great-Keeps you on your toes-Wide variety of monsters stalking you-No crashing/bugs so far-When the game amps up it really starts to shine-When the game sets up a monster appropriately it gets chilling-Free!Cons:-1000 room gimmick is mostly filler, you wont find interesting things in each room-Rooms repeat to an unforgivable degree-The game flips from cute to spooking in  weird ways, like it doesn't know what direction it wants to take-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ the puppet monster right in the earOverall I am having a decent time playing this game and look forward to plowing through all the 1000 rooms (I'm up to 400 at the time of his review).  Still, it's a fun way to spend an evening if you like scary games";;;;;;;
"344,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""It got me with that japanese ghost girl.nah-- not gonna play it again.It's hard to move yourself around. I always stuck at those cute little cardboard guys and get hit by whatever that's following me. Once I went through a door(during the ink guy level), I stucked and got killed. The jumpscares are nothing if you don't have your headphone on."",0";;;;;;;
"345,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""Overall: Not very Interesting, repetitive.There are some levels that just skullâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you for no reason, offering no skillful way to counter it other than hitting escape and exiting the game. Lacking save points make the player more on edge, but in turn make gameplay experience suffer because if one level is failed, you have to repeat countless levels with no rewards. Although I do enjoy the cartoon jump scares somewhat, it seems as if they are just thrown in to make a boring game less boring, but end up being a mere annoyance once the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bosses start showing up. Randomly generated levels with minecraft's """"10 blocks"""" render distance setting on fails to even create the illusion of skillful navigation within long levels. The lack of variance in level design makes interest fade in the middle stages of the game. Minor issues such as having to re-press """"W"""" every time a level loads in order to keep moving forward adds a unending inconvenience that makes repeating levels that much more boring to navigate. OP Enemies with minimal deterrent methods (The """"Ben Drowned"""" Creepypasta enemy which you just have to keep looking at for the remainder of the level, which proves boring when you get slapped with a bunch of linear """"Maze Pit Levels"""") remove any psychological deterioration elements from the game, as they just become a minor annoyance, *with exception of the monster that turns the graphics into bone-shilling youtube666-era designs*.  Sound design is good, as music is intentionally screeching in order to install anxiety within the player, but some cartoon jump scare sounds drag on and unneededly ruins the """"Spooky"""" aesthetic. Good for the first while, but I don't think a lot of people could enjoyfully complete the full 1000 Levels. Not from being scared, but from boredom. "",0";;;;;;;

"351,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""This game was surprising, but not enough for me to finish it...+ Interesting graphic style: Feels like a modern version of old Doom/Wolfenstein with more colorful 2D sprites.+ Interesting premise: Run through a cute haunted mansion that gets less cute as you go.+ Mysterious plot: Intriguing plot that is unraveled as you progress through the rooms.- Not enough true horror: This game is cool for Youtube screamers that jump at the slightest pop. Not enough real horror to keep me hooked for the whole thing though.- Too boring and repetitive: Something big(ish) happens, like, every 50 rooms (give or take, depends). I got bored really fast, it really killed the game for me.Cool experimental idea, not enough to keep me interested, very repetitive. Too boring to finish... Good thing it's free.Simolius - November 2016"",0";;;;;;;

"353,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,""1000 doors to open, and 800+ of them are completely empty rooms. I have no idea how people managed to spend more than 30 minutes in this Walking Simulator.  1000 doors of endless, mindless, tedious, monotonous drudgery. The first 20 minutes of the """"game"""" feels like someone is playing a bad joke on you for having convinced you to spend any time on this."",0";;;;;;;
"354,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,""Ugh, I want to recommend this game I really do. It's so close and it's such an ineresting concept but the deaths are so cheap it really just sucks the fun out. It just needs some refinement is all, maybe more frequent saving so I don't have to go through 100 rooms all over again because I got stuck on a wall. I mean I recognize it's free and all but it could be better and I'd be willing to pay for it but as is it just feels like such a waste. It's sooo close though."",0";;;;;;;
355,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2017.0,Gonna be charitable and say you have an understanding of old 3D games and why they're inherently creepy. You even have a shoutout to Ocarina of Time which really doesn't get enough credit as the disguised horror game it was. But come on man. You know as well as I do that this game is 90% fluff.,0;;;;;;;

"357,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewI very highly recommend this game. Not only is it free to play but it also is really funny. One moment it has you laughing your a** of at the fact that something really dumb just scared the sh** out of you the next youre sh***ing bricks, and its no longer funny... Don't let the initial push stop you from playing it is NOT like that for the rest of the game. The games graphics really suit the game making it seem harmless... don't let it fool you..."",1";;;;;;;

361,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2016.0,Well this game is pretty cool no wonder its called spooky's jup scare mansion! I got really scared when a fake skelaton head jupmed out at me! lol. Its just creepy going through all those rooms though. And 1000 rooms?! I'm no where near that! But I will say this game is really good.,1;;;;;;;
"362,Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion,2015.0,""Early Access ReviewIt isn't the most scary game out there, but it's effective and interesting. The game starts to convince you to feel that it is a joke, and isn't supposed to be actually scary. Then, something silly catches you off guard and startles you. You laugh it off, embarressed. Then, there come Spooky's """"specimens,"""" which are startling and not cute, which the you might not expect. The game adds more depth with a few references and rooms with silly morbid mini-games, which emphasizes how much you should actually fear """"Spooky."""" Spooky is a very adorable character, too. I love her design and how she too seems like a joke at first, but then you start to realize she's pretty evil and crazy. (I have a playtime of only about 10 minutes because I'm having trouble getting the newest build to display properly, I've played this a while ago before it's steam release.)"",1";;;;;;;
