"2929,War Thunder,2018.0,""Oh joy, War Thunder. There's so much that can be said about this game and almost none of it good. Just gonna skip the pleasantries and wit for this one because honestly, it's not worth the effort.Let's start off with the matchmaking system. It's broken. Period. War Thunder's matchmaking system is based off of a vehicles' Battle Rating (BR), which is normally supposed to match you up with vehicles no higher or lower than 1 - 1.5 from your highest BR with preference to your specific BR, except it doesn't. I can't count how many matches I've been in where my max vehicle BR is 5.7 and I end up getting matched with 7.7's. It wouldn't be such a noteworthy issue if it was a new system, but it's been like this for years. How is a P-51 supposed to cope with 50's era jets and radar guided Anti-Aircraft vehicles? How is it fair for WWII tanks with primitive ammo to go up against Cold-War era tanks with advanceed fin stabilized or SABOT rounds that have zero trajectory drop?Thus brings me to key issue #2. There's no clear-cut line separating WWII aircraft from Cold-War aircraft. If your BR is sufficient enough, you risk the matchmaking system putting your Me-262 against F-86 Sabres, MiG-17's, Hunters, etc. and your Maus up agains T-64's, AMX-30's, and on the off chance M1 Abrams'. There's literally zero balance here, WWII armor has no chance against the advanced ammunition of late-game vehicles and WWII jet fighters will have circles danced around them by late-game jets. Most WWII vehicles end up getting sniped from across the map not long after the game has started and well before they get the enemy in weapons range. It's utterly abhorrant how long this has been allowed to go on,Speaking of getting sniped, issue #3 on my list has to do with ballistics. The German Tiger I has a body that is essentially a rectangle with no armor sloping to deflect incoming shots. The 1 foot tall plate (by my eyeballing it) protecting the front of the tank sits at a 100 degree angle from the bottom plate it's welded to with a thickness of 10.2cm. The American M4A3E2 (76) W has a  2 - 3 foot high frontal plate (again, eyeballing it) with a thickness of 3.81 cm but sits at a 137 degree angle. The APCR shell of the M4 can penetrate an armor plate of 12.4cm at 1000m distance. How is it that the M4 cannot penetrate that 10.2cm plate in a face-to-face confrontation at only a hundred meters away? How can that same Tiger I not penetrate the M4's armor at the same distance? How is it that the 10.5cm gun of a Tiger II 10.5 can't penetrate the armor of a T-54 with armor-piercing rounds?  How can a Ferdinand's shell explode on the ground yet still have the shrapnel penetrate an M4A3E2, ricochet off the motor and kill *all* the crew? Answer: Gaijin doesn't care. Almost every single patch they put out to """"balance"""" something breaks the entire system. One group of tanks always ends up incredibly hard to kill (as of this draft it's the Sherman Jumbo series) or destroys other tanks far too easy. The same goes for aircraft. Right now the Bf-109 series can out-turn an A6M Zero in Simulator Battles. Excuse me?! On what planet is a Bf-109 F-2 more manoeverable than an A6M2? It's a total mess, and it's a problem Gaijin simply doesn't seem to care enough to fix"
"2930,War Thunder,2018.0,""You can see a lot of effort behind the engine, graphics, vehicle models that make you feel like there are many talented developers behind this. But balant ignorance in terms of community management and the monetization politics destroy everything good about this game. Players are viewed as walking wallets and their satisfaction means nothing, because a lot of purchasable content exists just to make people avoid suffering. And premium subscription changes almost nothing, you must pay constantly and for every vehicle you are playing. Otherwise be ready that in 80% battles you participate in, you have a disadvantage."",0"
"2931,War Thunder,2018.0,""Devs more interested in money than the players enjoying the game, devs who actively mock players and ignore any feedback about a flawed ingame mechanic, devs who have the capacity to ruin a great game, thatâ€™s what you will get"",0"
"2932,War Thunder,2018.0,""As someone who has played this game for not very long it became easy to see that this game is a cash grab, they seek to lure you in but the grind is meant to frustrate you so you purchase things. If you want this game summed up think of it like this, THIS GAME IS NOT FREE, THE GAME IS A PAYED SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE FOR IT TO BE FUN."",0"
"2933,War Thunder,2018.0,""I wish there was a 'maybe' option for recommendation. War Thunder as a functional game has it's quirks, but is just fine and stands alone in what it delivers.However, it's management and documentation appear to have little to no thought put towards them at all. I feel sorry for the developers at Gaijin, because it's obvious they are working their fingers to the bone to add new items and fix multiple standing issues, but the part of the organization responsible for public interface usually boils all that work down to:Client stability has been improved.That is the message you get regardless of how many silent changes are made to major game mechanics, such as the flip-flopping of the (absolutely infuriating) ability to crash your bonus aircraft into ground vehicles in ground force arcade battle mode, and recieve a kill.Major issues"
"2934,War Thunder,2018.0,""The game is not bad, the grind is. But this is ok since the game is free, right?Well there are some things the Community would like to talk about. 1. Tanks lacking stock repair and FPE2. The grind on higher tiersAs others have said in their reviews you can still have fun with this game, especially at lower tiers.Napalmratte talks about some of this in his video: https://youtu.be/fze8l4fhn4c "",0"
"2935,War Thunder,2018.0,""360 Hours on steam, and thousands on the stand-alone client.  Back before there were tanks, the grind to unlock vehicles was reasonable.  The game felt progressive, like you could still manage to unlock later tiers such as III and IV without going premium, crew mattered, fleshing out different planes was engaging and fun.  One of these patches in the last year or two has brought the grind to an absolutely unbearable crawl.  This game has always been about grind, but there is a balance between grind and progress, which the devs have messed up.  When you strip away the progress/reward mechanic that people endeavor for in gaming, you're not creating an environment of entertainment anymore, you're wasting their time.  And this should be carefully considered"
"2936,War Thunder,2018.0,""Repair costs are way too expensive, for exemple, you win a game and earn 20 000 SL, but you died two times so there is around 12 000 in repair costs, so at the end, you only get 8 000 SL, and it's worst when you loose.Also the FPE and Parts that are essential need to be free. I play this game since 2014 and they are right now doing â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t not listening to the community. I hope they'll solve it soon, but right now, I'm really disapointed."",0"
"2937,War Thunder,2018.0,""I love this game to death. It's an amazing game. But Gaijin has pushed the limit on their playerbase. Just google the """"Free Abrams"""" debacle. Their forum mods are at times obnoxious, and they are using shady and flagrantly obvious means to squeeze money out of people. I understand it is free to play, and they need to make money off of that. I respect that. However, they also have done a terrible job of communicating with the playerbase, and it has gotten to the point where it's frankly insulting. The in game economy is not set up properly. You can lose money even after getting multiple kills and completing objectives if you die. Balance is a constant issue, particularly in air realistic battles. It has now become obvious in the extreme they are now intentionally releasing unbalanced, but shiny new content which nets them the largest amount of money while managing to ignore (and in some cases offend) the concerns of their dedicated players. The grind is insane and takes an unbelievable amount of time and effort to unlock and make the upper tier vehicles survivable at all in combat. It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have a life outside of this game. I want to be able to at least progress in a manner that doesn't take literal months. I have played this game for years, but with all the other aforementioned issues, it is starting to lose its appeal to me.It is at this point obvious to me that the management of the company has probably sat around a table discussing this issue and probably quite literally laughed with each other, because they know people will still keep giving them money."",0"
"2938,War Thunder,2018.0,""This game used to be fantastic, but sadly as time went and each patch was released it became more and more about money and pandering than much historical accuracy and player enjoyment. To put this perspective for any new or current players Gaijin have become even greeder than Wargaming creaters World of tanks, and that is saying alot as they have a certain reuptation. Every patch adds new vehicles and planes to play as however, most if not all are overpriced premiums, lets not even start on how the screw the player base with its almost pay to grind method, where without a premium in your line up or a premium account you will struggle to make any credits plus the pittiful amount of exp gained each battle compared to the requirements for modules and new vehicles.And sadly they recently have bitten off more than they can chew as they now have planes, tanks and ships as it now shows in the new content as alot of recent planes and equipment added are just easy rehashs of old planes or tanks already in the game.Honestly, give this game a miss all my 1.5k hours were played back during the golden age of the game, before the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Br system and questionable design choices."",0"
"2939,War Thunder,2016.0,""Really tried to like it but has technical issues, at least on my pc AMD/Win10.Is not a MMO, is an online multiplayer tank/airplane capture the flag war game. You have a limited number of respawns in the same match, some maps has air&tanks units. I didn't found a proper way to organize battles, for people who does not have teamspeak is a free for all.It runs smooth (when it does not freeze), nice models and sounds.For a free game is ok."",0"
"2940,War Thunder,2015.0,""Last patch put the last nail in the coffin.Quantitative Restrictions not working still all high tier Planes/Tanks downranked have fun in lalalandJets vs Props, 60s tanks vs 40s tanks if you are searching for any kind of simulation or a game to have fun this is not it."",0"
2941,War Thunder,2015.0,The game was great in the beginning with a new concept and all. Then they decided to change key aspects about the game. The game has lost its sparkle and is quickly going down hill. The Russian players dictate everything that happens with this game.The forums are a complete cesspool of terrible moderation. Gaijin might have the worst moderation team in the history of online games. It's absolutely amazing how they treat their customers.,0
"2942,War Thunder,2015.0,""Every patch seems to make this game worse, they still have broken matchmaking after 3 years and they almost never fix anything.Community interaction is horrible and the dev team seems to be entirely discontected and isolated from the playerbase.Don't get invested TBH, it's disappointing."",0"
"2943,War Thunder,2016.0,""I cannot reccomend this game.I originally wrote this review in a bit more of a positive light, and I honestly wish feedback was excepted on the official forums. But, unfortanutely, this game lacks any form of dev support or care whatsoever.For starters, just reading the update posts by Gaijin made me want to delete this game and send it back to the bomb-crater it came from. Literally every other sentence was praising Russian historical documentation and how Russian books were the source of most of the information. And, honestly, I didn't care about that.What kills this game for me isn't that it's a Pay-To-Win game, it's a Free game that's Pay-To-Play. I was just fine in Tier 1 on my very first day, and I really looked forward to a grind and working up to my next tier of tank. I now regret sticking around that long.Ontop of that, matchmaking is the definition of team-stacking, with high-tier vehicles being placed specifically in one team, especially with things like Churchills. While my team cowers in fear, the enemy rolls over us in tanks a tier or even two higher than ALL of us.I wish this game was more open, and better. But, the devs of this game have destroyed it entirely. The match-making is despicable, the Pay-To-Win mechanic is absolutely disgusting, and the overall game would have been better off without both."",0"
"2944,War Thunder,2016.0,""War Thunder has been going downhill at a very alarming rate for the last year or so. I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. More edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.EDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.-We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.-For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.-They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.Its nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess._________________________________________________________________Such a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has to one up everyone else. * Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage."",0"
"2945,War Thunder,2016.0,""This could be a great game for people who love ww2 simulators like me, but it isnt even the pay to win that gets me, it is the play Russia to win. It is impossible to get fair matches due to the bias towards Russia in balance. I highly reccomend NOT playing this biased pay to win game."",0"
"2946,War Thunder,2016.0,""Welcome to War Thunder, the game where B-17s can get shoot down by a Russian Biplane, let's get started.Things I like:- Realistic flying mechanic- Damage modules-Both planes and tanksAnd that's it.Now, let's get to the things I hate.- Balance -> This game is not balanced at all, there are 5 nations to join: USA, UK, Germany, Japan and Russia, now, the real problem (seen from a USA main) is that every nation exept for USA and maybe UK is overpowered, especially Russia.It might be me, but I think there's a problem with the fact that a russian tier 1 plane can completly obliterate a tier 4 US bomber.- Teammates -> Altough there are some good teammates who like to actually play as a team, the majority of the players wanna just get points, they won't communicate, they will """"""""steal"""""""" your """"""""kills"""""""" and they will bomb the objective you chose to bomb. Not to talk about the fact that most of the players will randomly write something in russian every 5 seconds ))))- Bombers -> As a US Bombers main, I realized that bombers go down very quickly, expecially B-17s and that's a shame, because it's very hard to shoot down most of the other bombers, but the B-17 is probably one of the weakest. And it's kinda strange, since in real life, the B-17 was one of the best bombers.- Russia -> Every russian plane\tank is overpowered, I litterally got bored of playing as US and constatly get shot down by Russia that I tried to play Russia and got bored of shooting down other planes.-Every tank that's not russian seems to have armor made of cardboard, you can literally shoot at least 10 times at a russian tank and you won't do anything to it, then you get destroyed by like 5 machine gun rounds from a russian tank.The usual joke about this game is that it is russian biased, well guess what? IT â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING IS!People ofter ask """"Is this game Pay to Win?"""" of course it isn't, it's play Russia to win.So, if you don't like to loose, Grab your Sekrit Dokumints, put on your tracksuit and your Ushanka, choose your Russian plane made of Stalinium and spam &quotâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥"""" everywhere you can and put on """"Kalinka"""" or The russian march of Red Alert 2, oh, don't forget to write  """"xaxaxaxaxaxa ))))))"""" after every kill. Now that you know how to play Russia in WT, you're ready to go Tovarish."",0"
"2947,War Thunder,2018.0,""#freePARTSandFPEEDIT: For those of you who don't know, the community asked for free parts and FPE and gaijin had not only declined but openly mocked the community saying it would be comparable to giving us a free abrams. We are tired of getting our engines being shot and having our vehicle remain useless the whole game."",0"
"2948,War Thunder,2014.0,""Used to be fun but since version 1.37 it's Pay to win, you fly like a paper airplane (easy to be shot down) and the Reasearch plane is just the WORST thing ever DON'T EVER PLAY THIS GAME ITS NOT WORTH THE TIME, AND EFFORT.

"2949,War Thunder,2016.0,""Well , i have few hours at that game  but at the first 2 min i realised that the game doesent  worth anything, it is a waste of time and space at the disck the graphics are horrible at medium and at the ultra are just livable 1. Not realistic gameplay 2. bad representation of the urban place 3. Pay TO Win 4. incomprehensible menu 5. Noob players 6. You need lot of time to unlock good tanks ( i am not speaking for the PzKw IV ) 7. medium tanks at this game are horrible 8. No realistic range of  the tank ( frome the one side of the map you can destroy a tank that is at the other side )  Thats all , i would not recommend that game  "",0"
"2950,War Thunder,2015.0,""Honestly, Gaijin's most recent change regarding battle rating is completely unnecessary and a waste of an update.  The fact that they don't listen to the community whatsoever has caused this game to become almost unplayable at higher tiers.  Would have continued to be fun if the battle rating stayed exactly where it should be.  What were you thinking Gaijin?"",0"
"2951,War Thunder,2015.0,""With the recent patches made to this game Tier 4 is being crushed due to tanks that they can do nothing against. That is no the worst part, anyone who says anything on it about the forums is having their thread locked. Do not play this game you are encouraging the developers to do crazy things like this, or if you do play it stay away from any battle rating in tank battles higher than 5.0, it is ruled by tanks you are nothing but cannon fodder to. As I said the devs are silencing anyone who voices a negative opinion on this topic. They also DO NOT listen to the community as planes have been asked to be taken out of tank battles ever since they were implemented and Gaijin have firmly stated they are staying.The censoring has gotten worse, they have been threatening youtubers who say negative things about their game and forcing them to say positive things or else their chanel gets deleted. this is a complete violation of youtubes copyright system. After the first time they did this and the backlash from it there was another youtuber who brought to light cheats people were using, not saying where to find them or how to install them and this time instead of doing what they did previously they held a poll on the forums that let players vote if the video should stay up or not so that they could be justified in taking it down. This is yet again more abuse of youtubes system and is also Gaijin using their own community for personal gain. DO NOT PLAY! Take a stand against the devs and show them that this will not be tolerated and cannot be forgiven."",0"
"2952,War Thunder,2015.0,""Until MM and BR is actually fixed, avoid playing. Gaijan is a horrible company that doesn't respond to its own playerbase whatsoever. Also if you see the mod Pacifica, TK him. Otherwise, great game and I hope it improves."",0"
2953,War Thunder,2015.0,This game is horribly un ballanced after the latest patch and it seems like the developers don't care about their players or feedback. Cold War tanks are put up against WWII tanks that have no chance of scoring kills. The game was already a massive grindfest and now anyone without a top tier tank has no real hope of getting one without putting up with 100s of games of being consistently 1 shot by enemys they have no hope of killing.,0
"2954,War Thunder,2016.0,""According to wikipedia """" Some Tiger units exceeded the 10:1 kill ratio """" in this game """" Some T-34 units exceed the 10:1 kill ratio"""" (against german tanks). 10/10 totally not russian bias."",0"

"2956,War Thunder,2016.0,""Product received for free***Honest review coming from about 800 hours in AB, slowly been transisitioning into RB.***The fact that I even have 1,000+ hours in a Free-to-Play game is astounding to me.I'll get straight to the point. This game in my opinion, has an acceptable balance of purchasing in-game currency vs. playing free. A lot of FTP games out there, again in my opinion, release overpowered items for purchase, and you got some guy running around like the Tazmanian devil and mopping up the place. This game does have premium purchases, ranging from planes, to tanks, to even buffing research on units and crew experience. However, it's entirely based on the individual's skill as a player, not some John Doe 5 mins in the game thinking he's a sexual tyrannasaurus aftering buying a shiny premium vehicle. Mr. John Doe can be dispatched simply by players who are more skilled and have more flight time. Moving on.I have made some great friends from all over the world in this game. Community can make or break a game. I'm not going to ramble on about comparisons to other games like DCS because you can go watch a youtube video somewhere for that. I'm just a history buff fascinated by the logistics of the WW2 era, and have a unique respect for the more experienced flight simulator pilots in this game."",1"
"2957,War Thunder,2016.0,""At first, the game plays great. After a while though, the wonder dwindles away along with the small """"Golden Eagles"""" incentive pack they give you and all you are left with is grinding nonstop. Also the matchmaking is wretched and Russian planes have an extreme bias. After a while of playing this, you just end up asking yourself, """"why bother?"""""",0"
"2958,War Thunder,2017.0,""In short, the games matchmaker is very unbalanced. To put it in perspective, most of the matches I have played I took my tank that was developed at the end of WW2 (1944-45) out in a match and was put up against cold war tanks...Also, getting new vehicles without premium, and in some cases WITH premium takes an ungodly amount of time. The only way to effectively grind out a new tank is to purchase a premium account and play a premium vehicle of the higher tier. If you don't spend money, you're 10 steps behind everyone that does."",0"
"2959,War Thunder,2016.0,""This review isn't for the game, as the game itself is fantastic.This review is for the customer service.I contacted customer service about a problem with a contest they were having.  The problem was that the objectives to """"win"""" a chest with a  slim chance at getting a premium plain/tank were completely luck based and had nothing to do with anything and I was venting my frustration with them that I had spent 40-50 hours in two weeks trying to get the premium tank/plain.  I told them that I could have just spent that time working overtime at my job and probably had enough money to buy every single premium item they had for sale.They pretty much told me I could F off, that the contest was working as intended.I told them that the high level of customer service I had recieved was leading me to uninstall the game and never play again.  All they had to say to that was """"We are sad to lose any customers"""" to which I replied, """"No, no you aren't"""" they closed my ticket in full before I could choose if I was satisfied with the result or wanted to keep the ticket open for further help."",0"

"2963,War Thunder,2017.0,""The game is very realistic and fun, but there are certain tanks/ aviation lines that are at an extreme disadvantage compared to other nations and need to be reworked/ balanced.

The American tank tree is outgunned and underpowered at tier 3 to 4 compared to other nations tanks and unless you play realistic battles and manage to flank a German heavy or medium tank like the Tiger II or the panthers or any of their tank destroyers you will find yourself getting blown up instantly while only plinking rounds of of the front of these tanks and other nations vehicles."",0"

However I think that people need to know what they are getting into before sinking any time into this as I did.  As a warning this is a long review but there is a lot to go over.First the pros:1.) The different physics models per mode (arcade, realistic, and sim)2.) The wide variety of vehicles3.) beautiful graphics4.) damage models that are not hitpoint bases, i.e. not World of Tanks style5.) intuitive controls.6.) can take multiple vehicles into one battleNow for the cons:1.) The developer does not accept any criticism from the players. Forum posts that are negitive get deleted by mods and you can get your account suspended.2.) the economy is screwed up. The only way to make any decent silver lions (free currency) is to finish in the top three on your team and be running a prem account and several prem vehicles.3.) The matchmaker. War Thunder works on a system they call battle ratings, BR for short. In essence it is a system to reduce the waiting time for a match. Each vehicle has its own battle rating and the different BRs in a given lineup create the combined BR used for matchmaking. Now this all sounds well and good but having even one vehicle of a higher BR in a lineup can put you in very high tier games. Here is an example. I am taking a german air lineup into a match. I have two Bf-109s, two Fw-190s, and a Me-410. Using this lineup will likely get me into a battle with F-82s, Bearcats, and late model Mig fighters. All of these fighters can easily beat my lineup if the enemy pilot is halfway competent, which is likely a given for such high a tier. The same problem comes up with ground forces. M4 Shermans are regularly put up against Tigers and IS series tanks.4.) the damage model. I did put this in the pro section but it also belongs in the cons. This is because it is extreemly easy to one shot vehicles, especially tanks. This is actually the aspect that drove me to stop playing the game. It is a regular occurence to get ammo racked from even the smallest hit to the ammo rack. In order to do well you really need to study all the vehicle models to know where to hit to do the most damage. 5.) the graphics. This is another thing I put in the pro section but also is a con. This is specifically the lowest graphics setting. Despite what the developers have said about fixing the exploit many players still play on the lowest setting to remove a lot of the foliage from the game. This is key in the realistic and simulatior modes because there are no enemy markers to aim at, only direct observation. many times I will be behind a fallen tree or tall hedge and get shot at from the other side of the map. Thanks to the kill cam feature I can see that the shot was not random but aimed correctly and hit the ammo directly. The person who killed me is clearly using the exploit because I was completly behind the concealment and without target markers it should have been impossible for him to see me.6.) the grind. Over the course of my time with WT, not just on steam but also on the direct client from the devs, I have still not unlocked any tier five machines. this is because it literally takes hundrest of thousands of xp to unlock a vehicle and higher than tier three. As I mentioned before the economy is also terrible and makes it hard to buy any vehicles you unlock. A silver lining is that once you buy a vehicle you keep it and do not have to have a individual garage slot to keep it in like in WOT. You also have to unlock other ammunition and the stock is often terrible. There are also no current vehicles that have multiple choices of main weapons, only extra mounts for aircraft. 7.) the playerbase. The community in WT is one of the most toxic ones I have ever encountered. Due to the damage model system almost every kill ends up with the receevign player calling hacks and reporting the other player. I made it a polocy to never enter team chat or general chat.8.) game engine. The game originated with the aircraft component. Therefore the game was developed on a flight sim engine. This made for a wonderful air combat game untill the massive changes to the aforementioned BR and economy. If you are a new player I would suggest you really only play air battles because the physics for ground forces are terrible. Collisions are extreemly common and can lead to huge glitches. For example tanks can get stuck inside each other or get pushed into the gound. Fast tanks can also easliy flip and many heavy tanks use it as a tactic against lighter tanks. Final thoughts. War Thunder started out as a great game but has now devolved into a money maker by the developers. It is possible to advance research on vehicles and even outright buy the upgrade with Golder Eagles, the prem currency. i personally have not spent a dime on this game and I am glad I didn't.My final rating is 2 out of five stars. If you can put up with the grind and want a good MMO flight sim then go right ahead but ignore ground forces and try not to spend money. The developers sometimes have specials for free prem vehicles but they are often extreemly hard to get. As the developer is based in Russia the event times can be sometimes weird and you have to keep watch for them. You will also need a decent comp and large monitor. I do not know if this issue still exists but the Mac client is filled with bugs. I have not used that client in a couple of years so that might be fixed but if trees are not rendering correct with it then it is not your computor but the game itself."",0"
"2965,War Thunder,2018.0,""I have played this game since beta. I have a pretty solid grasp of the game and itâ€™s history and development.So I say this from my love of this cherished game...DO NOT SUPPORT THESE DEVS!Hereâ€™s why:1:They continue to release unbalanced unfair premium pay-to-win vehicles 2:Every patch that goes by the grind becomes longer and longer. Donâ€™t bother looking at the teir V vehicles, you will never play them.3: You can no longer play the game for an in-game currency profit without paying real life money.4:Donâ€™t bother playing anything but Russia after teir 3. Russian tanks are matched with an unfair advantage.Sometimes it feels like Gaijin is trying to kill their fan base.Itâ€™s sad. It was a good game."",0"
2966,War Thunder,2018.0,War Thunder is a game i really want to like unfortunantley it just has far to many huge flaws compared to its positivesthe good A huge number of different tanks planes and bombers to play with Fairly detailed damage models Very satisfying game play when things go right....The Bad HORRIBLE matchmakeing Poor balance between vehicles in each tier Horribly grindy Ammo and repair costs actively punish you for playing matches you dont have much of a chance in Crew locks for leaveing matches with out using all your vehicles means the bad matchmaking will either lose you money or lock out your crews very odd interactions with lag I've been shot by planes main guns while they were at a 30 degree angle to me and in the death cam it shows them stutering about the skiesOver all this game has moments when every thing works well and the match you get into is balanced and you can have a blast.  Unfortunantley those moments are fleeting and in the minority of time spent in this game.  The majority of the time you will spend fighting people in better vehicles with more upgrades barely making any head way because of poor rewards coupled with matches that are stacked against you not to mention high repair costs and having to pay in game cash for any nonstandard ammos.,0
"2967,War Thunder,2018.0,""if you want any progress in the tech tree, forget it. Pay up real money to earn any silver lions at all. after i reached the IS2 (br 6,7) i'm LOSING silver lions even if i get more kills then deaths, Unable to progress, so not worth playing. "",0"
"2968,War Thunder,2018.0,""This game. It's a proper MMO, but I can't simply recommend it. It's fun as hell but it soon just becomes a chore to get new vehicles, spending countless hours playing boring matches to get a new plane only to do more boring matches. The controls are great, the 30 dollar campaign is great, the scenarios are really fun but it's just a pain to get anywhere passed Tier 3, with me, not being an avid player (wow, I want to play other games), taking a little less than a year to get my first jet. The rewards simply just don't satisfy the work for them."",0"

"2970,War Thunder,2015.0,""REVIEW FULLY REWRITTEN - JULY 14 2017(Speaking for ground forces only, I have limited experience with planes)There is no balance in this game.-PvP is painful because of the battlerating spread, your first game in a newly unlocked tank with no researched equipement will put you against people with fully upgraded tanks of a whole BR higher.-Shell types are broken, HEAT-FS ruins the role of armor, like ATGMs-Planes have nothing to do in tank battles. I know it's what WT wanted from the beggining, but dying because a rocket fell out of nowhere is the most infuriating thing in this game. We need a """"tank-only"""" option. Since there is no player-driven tanks in plane gamemodes, I don't see why there should be player-driven planes in tank gamemodes.-Playing tank-only without premium tanks and premium account is near impossible, grinds are too long, and money income is ridiculous.-PvE is probably the best thing they ever added in this game. Tank PvE is really rewarding, but so freaking hard. Russians and germans are near impossible with most teammates, and the game is allowing tanks of low tiers (BR 3.7) to fight in games where people have like BR 6.0 tanks. These players are a burden to their team, they do nothing, they bother everyone. This gamemode needs a minimum-requirement limitation, with smoke screens being forbidden and minimum BR being 5.0. If it wasnt for that, I'd play nothing but this gamemode. But spending 20mins carrying only to lose because an idiot did nothingthe whole game... Also I don't get how xp is calculated, sometimes a player who did half as much as you (1 plane kills, 15 kills, 7 assists vs 5 plane kills, 15 assists and 35 kills) will be better ranked than you.This gamemode is really promising. Now gaijin needs to fix all of these problems.I still play it a lot in hope that things get better. The gameplay is really enjoyable, and realism is here. However all of these negative things ruin the experience enough to make you ragequit rather often: why bother staying in a 15-20min game where you already know you've lost or won't do anything just by looking at the team(s)."",0"
"2971,War Thunder,2018.0,""It has turned so much worse over the last 2 years.I joined the game before 2014.The game was fun in the begining...At first i said to myself:""""'well, I'll wait until I figured out how to play properly"""" before eventually paying some bucks for a premium account.But soon I got it: Gaijin just wants user to pay for premium vehicles or quick-repairs (prem. account)... without any benefit from it. A prem. account just means you can place more badges to your vehicle and get slightly more silver lions after a match, (= in-game-money to pay your repairs if you get shot).That's what I'd call 'free to play - pay to win'. Special ammo or repairs will cost you silver lions so basically real money.If you really are mad enough to play this russian propaganda game be assured: you'll get affronted to the fact that russian vehicles (planes or tanks) are """"the greatest in the world"""". No1 one can defeat their armor or aigility. Is this true? I can't find any wiki article that confrims that russian technique was outstanding back in the days. It was unreliable and let's say: their planes were bad compared german planes.That's why I'd call the dev's: """"liars"""". But wait... there's even more:Gaijin is just announcing new stuff, which is incompletely developed and balanced.Old issues about bad balancing and bad realism aren't corrected. The only thing you'll feel in newer versions of the game is that Russian vehicles are getting stronger...To my mind, this game is basically a Russian propaganda machine.. And about the worst issue:Gaijin claims that there ain't no cheaters in the game """"it is not possible"""", they say that everything regarding balancing is calculated by the servers.Well... dozens of youtube videos prove that - yes it IS true, there are cheaters.So my conclusion: Gaijin is just another software company with the objective to gain money. But in this case, they lie to their community in every respect. They don't wanna care about fair -play (avoiding cheats) or realism.Don't waste your time."",0"

"2973,War Thunder,2018.0,""This used to be my one of my topthree games hands down, but the game stopped being fun, becauseinstead of a militaray aircraft and armor simulator it's become a economics simulator. The ingame economy is broken, prevents youform playing if close to top tier vehicles without pumping in boatloads of realworld currency, and in addition to this, instead of atttempting to alleviate the gameplay or in game economy issues, the developers simply continue to nerf rewards, and add higher and higher tier vehicles which aren't even feasible to obtain or maintain in game."",0"
"2974,War Thunder,2018.0,""Hello friend,      As a player who has put over 4600 hours into this game over the course of more than five years, and being among the most qualified players on the whole of the Steam platform to review this game, I can unequivocally tell you, do not involve yourself in War Thunder. Do not pay money into this game.      What follows, in no particular order, is a list of grievances:      The development of this game has been like a car crash in slow motion. WT includes pay to win elements, gambling mechanics aimed at children, russian nationalism, loot boxes, and one of the most degenerate and coercive free to play economies that has ever been implemented in a video game.      The game is fundamentally flawed in terms of vehicle balance and matchmaking is a disaster. Queue times for end game content go on for upwards of 50 minutes for matches that are essentially vacant"
"2975,War Thunder,2018.0,""I'll start with the good things: graphics and visuals are great, shell ballistics are too.Now to the bad things: close air support like P-47s, AD-2s and 4s are absolute â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing aids and are unreasonably overpowered. Matchmaking is not historic at all and nor is it balanced in any way shape or form, you either get steamrolled or you steamroll the enemy team with completely unbalanced and awful battle ratings. German late WW2 tanks also basically always fight cold war era tanks too. Premium tanks and planes are pretty much pay to win, and especially the american T28 which is invincible from the front to any gun at its BR. Event vehicles are extremely hard to get and even then you need to have no social life at all to get them, and since Gaijin market has been rolled out Gaijin basically forces you to buy whatever it is you need to get the event vehicle if it requires parts. Also Gaijin doesn't seem to listen to its community whatsoever and only prioretises whatever gets them paid and only fix bugs whenever they want and not when it's a massive issue.I could keep going with the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t that War Thunder has been doing for a very, very long time but i hope this is enough to turn off any potential player from this atrocious game, if this game ever gets fixed (which i doubt it will) i'll revise my review and maybe actually recommend it to people.3/10"",0"
"2976,War Thunder,2018.0,""Not worth your time. This is a broken game that, while at face value, is free to play, is a money grabbing pit. The online community is also pretty bad.

2977,War Thunder,2018.0,All the money spent and all that time spent on this game and yet Gaijin remained stubborn in its way in order to milk this game to its fullest.It is unfortunate that this game is so niche that there's no real alternatives. I do not recommend anyone new to start this game because you're only going to expect disappointment and anger.,0
2978,War Thunder,2018.0,The game was once playable at best but has devolved into an unplayable mess. Tanks are too broken to even comment on so lets stick to air game. In which unless you are in Russian or german planes you are nothing more then fodder because those sides will always get to start in the air and win based upon that. Game had great potential but the Devs have 0 interest in balanceing anything unless it benifits russians.,0
"2979,War Thunder,2018.0,""I may as well rewrite this review now that I'm in a better mood than I was when I wrote the original.If you're looking for a game that is something of a halfway point between World of Tanks and a more serious simulator style game, then War Thunder is very much for you. The damage models are quite in-depth, being the kind of thing I've only really seen outside of WT in proper simulator type games such as Arma 3 meaning it is important what kind of shell you use beyond the base stats on the card such as penetration.A word of warning though, this is a game I feel guilty recommending due to the devs being... Let's just say they have made some questionable choices when it comes to this game, but I still can't bring myself to stop playing it. Is it because I've put hundreds of dollars into this game in the time I've spent playing it? Probably, to a degree. But is the game fun? Absolutely, especially if you can play with friends and as a result raise your chances of winning by about 50%.If steam reviews had an option for 'There is some good balanced out with some bad' or some other kind of neutral review, I'd go for that, but for now I'm going with not recommending it due if for no other reason than because this game has become almost like quicksand for me, where the more I fight against it the harder it becomes to try and break free.Original Review: Don't get into this game, it's like trying crack.At first it's fun, seems fairly harmless and doesn't effect you otherwise.Then it gets expensive, both in time and money, especially if you want to upgrade anything in Tier V/VI.The game itself is gorgeous, and has a lot of potential, but the greedy devs behind it only want to add more vehicles to an already poorly balanced game on top of nickel and diming the playerbase only to be rewarded with god-awful events.I'll probably still play it, but for Christ's sake don't get into this game or you'll end up like me and any number of other poor saps who have sunk too much time into the game to drop it."",0"

"2989,War Thunder,2017.0,""Ah.. War Thunder Review time I guess.Let me go ahead and state, if your a fanboy, I dont care. Your opinion means nothing to me, simply because your opinion is tainted because it could be your """"favorite"""" or you really """"enjoy"""" this game, therefore keep it too yourself or do a review yourself.This game is not fun in the long run, compared to World of Tanks, the only thing this one has that World of Tanks doesnt, is it isnt a silly tank shooter. I dont care for the planes, simply because, I found it boring to fly around, press M1 over and over or hold it down, until finally your shots actually do something of use other then sparking on the person, or shooting the center gear leg or fuel tanks causing a fuel leak. I had tons of funs in Ground Forces though, Until you start playing every single faction there is, and start to see the reason why you see more of some factions and some of others. This game has no actual form of Balance, and in its attempt to try and keep things balance, and adding realistic stuff too it, they made some things completely unfun to play, while others are so brain dead you can just just toward people, bouncing shells off left and right as people try to pen you.Now, I enjoyed this game. I managed to get a good friend to play, he however left because the game was unfair for him, I ignored it and thought it was just him actting up. I regret not listening too him, after the whole """"cool factor"""" of the game wears off, you start to see the problems. Lets start off with Gameplay first.Gameplay: Though it is fun, has a ton of problems, the game doesnt prepare you for anything, because of how the game Progresses, at first you start off as Reserves vs Reserves, which is the starting tanks. This is completely pointless to talk about, because its the most basic of the game, point and shoot, you will most likely kill anything you just shot at, or badly damage them, BUT even at this Tier, yous tart to see the real problems, Because of how the game BR system works, even though you only have 2 tanks, their both 1.0 and require a bit of knowledge to beat higher BR tanks, the game is completely fine with putting you up against these tanks, Often. This is called Uptiered, and its the most annoying thing to happen too you, at any point in the game, because you are fighting against tanks who are actaully better then yours, in any way possible, this of course only if the tank driver can use the tank, but they still get a advantage wtih either, better gun, or better armor, or faster etc etc. Im not even going to talk about Downtiered, because its just basically swinging a club at baby seals at this point. The game shooting Machinics are simple, aim at a spot on a tank, and shoot, if it pens, it hits something, if it doesnt, well it doesnt, too kill a tank in this game, you either kill all their crew, or blow up thier ammo, which requires aimming (For some tanks, ill get too that later), and this is where you start killing the Major problems of this game. Four out of the now Five factions to play Ground Forces, are easy to play. each one giving you HE filler AP rounds, made to pen the tank then blow up and kill damn near anything in the tank, these tanks are what will kill you the most often, because their the easiest to play. Russians have slopped armor with fast moving tanks, allowing even their thin armored tanks to just put themselves into a Angle and bounce shells. Germans have """"Nuke-Rounds"""" even at lower tierss, alot of the German tanks, just instantly kill anything you can pentrate, Same with Americans. now Japanese and British is where alot of suffering of the game happens. British tanks Feature fast reloading gun, fast tanks, good moblity (not when backing up) and their guns are extramely good at pentrating, however since British tanks didnt field HE filler rounds in the world, they lack them in the game, actually they dont have anything (expect for the recently added Sherman 2, thats basically M4A1 Sherman put into British line), This makes British one of the most annoying factions to actually kill tanks in, Because Armor Piecing rounds, with no HE fillers is what the British used in real life, in the game.. none of the reason why the British used said rounds, are at all shown, Since you can repair your tank, This also makes it so you have to snipe every single crew or 2 crew in the tank, or try to cause a their ammo to blow up, meanwhile most of the british tanks, cant take a single shot, and will mostly die in a single hit. Japanese have very little armor on their tanks, very small pentration with their guns, and very little HE filler starting out, later on they get up too the same ground as, Americans, Germans, Russians.Now Progression in this game, is low, its a grind while playing matches to unlock a new tank... however once you unlock the tank, you have too use the tank, in order to unlock mods, IE different ammo, REPAIR KIT, or ability to put out fires, all of which shouldnt be a thing, without the repair kit, if your cannon barrel or cannon breach is broke, you cant repair it unless you go too a cap point, Fires will kill you without the ability to put them out, and its a slow and annoying death and will happen alot since you only get 2 charges of it anyway. Luckly the game is nice enough to let you repair your tracks without the repair kit.Im not even going to touch the """"Pay to get"""" tanks, because the fact you can buy them and get all the mod for them, already says why their there, its just a massive money grab too get a tank, you cant unlock.All and All, No I wouldnt recommend anyone to get this game, and if you do, too never spent money on it, I have, and I regretted it."",0"
"2990,War Thunder,2017.0,""This game could be 10 times better than Witcher 3 or whatever 'game of the generation' epic caliber, but only for the fact that Gaijin installs an app essentially behaving like a malware on your PC, I cannot recommend this or any such piece of software. It does not make sense and is unacceptable from both user experience and technical perspectives. The only reasons I can imagine are some shady business / user data collecting techniques.The game installs a Gaijin.net agent without asking that starts everytime with Windows, unable to change it through any menu. I guess it can seed data to other users downloading through torrent, taking up your internet capacity, without you knowing. To uninstall completely, you have to uninstall everything in your Steam game folder (17GB was left there!), User/AppData and all Gaijin and War Thunder registry entries manually! This is just disrespectful. Shame on you Gaijin.Lesson learned: stay away from all that Gaijin does, at least until they fix this War Thunder malware and explain themselves completely and in a transparent way.26/6/2017 EDIT:People in the comments mention that the agent can be disabled in the launcher settings. I admit I probably did not try or missed this option before uninstalling the game and this might be a solution for some. I can't be arsed to install the game again and try on my own.However, any of this does not change my opinion or what I want to explain in the review, for the following reasons:- All the other games I played that have a launcher can auto-update without the need to have a suspicious background agent running- After you uninstall the game through Steam, there is no way to uninstall the agent which still keeps running! There is no launcher settings anymore to go and disable that, the game is uninstalled. You have to manually delete all files in folders and all associated reg. entries. I don't have to do this with other games or software I use...- As mentioned in my review, after uninstalling the game, there was still 17GB of data left in the Steam game library folder. that I had to delete manually again...- My 0.6 hrs played or PC skills have nothing to do with the reasons mentioned above as some complain in the comments.I do not recommend this software for the reasons mentioned above and obviously I did not play the game enough to be able to review the actual content (even though I played it a lot on ps4 before). Anyway, I believe my reasons are strong enough to write a review only about this aspect. If you have a different opinion, don't care about this and just want to play the game, fine."",0"
"2991,War Thunder,2018.0,""The game was great when it first appeared. The only improvements have been the graphics , which are great.  Unfortunately they sacrificed gameplay to attract weaker players to spend money.

I have over 65000 kills using tanks with about 27000 deaths and usually rate high in the team. But when massive rounds do no damage to weak armor and tiny guns penetrate my thick armor i say enough.

"2995,War Thunder,2018.0,""It's quite clear that the only branch given any love whatsoever is the Soviet branch.The Battle Rating system, which is used to balance the matchmaking, is heavily biased towards Soviet medium tank drivers. This system also completely breaks Heavy Tanks, where they are placed in battles full of weapons that can easily penetrate their heavy armor (thus defeating the purpose of a heavy tank).If you are looking for an historically accurate WW2 vehicle warfare simulator, this is NOT it. Tanks and aircraft, particularly heavy tanks, will NEVER face in an online battle what they actually faced during the era in which they were used."",0"
2996,War Thunder,2017.0,I do enjoy this game alot and while it does have alot of microtransactions I have been able to master some of my planes and tanks with the grind. My only issue with the game is that when its unistalled the launcher is always on my computer hidden and tries to redownload the game. It gets annoying when in another game and the launcher just pops up and takes all of my bandwidth. While it is a good game the company is doing some shady tactics to get people to keep the game,0
"2997,War Thunder,2015.0,""While this is a good game, it is rediculously biased. When I first got this game it was a blast and I had a good time. So based on gameplay I would have given it a positive recommendation. I am an older gamer, from the mid 80's and as a rule I dont like making ingame purchases. But I am also an American and lack common sense. Ask any Canadian about us. Anyways, I made a purchase of ingame currency and it was all """"lost"""" when I bought some upgrades. By no means did these upgrades use all of it. I submitted a ticket and to make a long story short I was told I would not be refunded the ingame currency and that I must have spent it all. What makes this all ludicrous is I never recieved the upgrades I supposedly spent everything on. I never played it again. In hindsight I dont feel I really lost too much after reading up on this companies behavior, practices and outright dismissal of historical facts. So I hope my review will temper the """"very positive"""" rating they have right now since I dont believe they are on the right road to keeping it. I will just go back to Wot where I haven't been ripped off and they dont treat you like your IQ is 3 points above â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.

"3000,War Thunder,2016.0,""First question you have to ask yourself: Is this game fun? Can I recommend it for new players? And both questions painfully have to be answered with a big NO!Cancerous piece ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Treating paying customers with disrespect.

"3001,War Thunder,2016.0,""First off, I used to love this game until the reccent patches made it borderline unplayable unless you play japs or russians. The american planes are always killed because .50 cal is like throwing pebbles at steel and they fly like bricks. The american tanks are armored like they're made of butter. The german tanks cant pin anything (Especially the Tiger H1). The russian tanks are â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ and the grind takes years when the RP gain from matches is 1-3K a match with premium. The Brit planes use cannons to rip the wings off of anything they face. And lastly, all the devs want is your money at this point. The game has become Pay to Win in so many ways, the premium planes out pace all other planes, the premium tanks are bulletproof and the RP gain is impossible to grind without premium accounts T4 and up. In short, dont play this game for the sake of your sanity and bank account."",0"
"3002,War Thunder,2015.0,""The company who made this game is Russian, and there is huge Russian bias in game. Russian tanks and planes are way stronger than other nations' tanks and planes. What is worse is developers dont care about this. Russian tanks have op ammunition, their armor is very sloped, they have cold war tanks, their fuel tanks and ammo racks rarely explode, their ammo has double chance to cause fire etc.Bomber planes are extremely weak only one bullet is enough to cut the wings. Bombers are almost unplayable on upper tiers.Game has pay to win elements. Premium vehicles, premium account, accelerated crew training all give many advantages in game. There are also annoying bugs in game ( like disconnecting from chat and squad after every battle, no research points after battle bugs) .Game is only recommended if :1- You only play with Russian tanks and planes2- You dont use bombers 3- You dont mind pay to win game system."",0"
3003,War Thunder,2018.0,Pros:+ Nice graphics (only fire isnt that good)+ Superb sound (especially the sound of the Jetengines sounds pretty realistic)+ Realisitc Gameplay (yeah its not THE reality but its more realistic than for example WoT)+ Diffrent Gamemodes+ All-in-One Game (no extrodownload to play ships for example)Cons:- Sometimes the Balance (happens when new Vehicles are introduced but will be worked on)- Long Grind- Effects doesnt look good (the mentioned above Fire) ,1
"3004,War Thunder,2014.0,""Could be the most fantastic historical aviation combat game, if it wasnt developed and maintained by the most obnoxious, stubborn and biased russian programmers of the whole software industry. Sometimes you will love this game, but soon you'll find the developers prepared somehting to make you fell frustrated, bullied, and scammed (if you spend some money in their premium stuff). Their official forum is a glimpse of soviet era stalinism: They delete and block threads when theres is too much complaints about the ilogic decisions they made, or they simply ignore any community feedback about the negative effects of those ilogic decisions. Its impossible to reason with them. You will be banned, blocked or ignored. The new ground combat mode is absolutely unplayable with german tanks, as russian tanks are way beyond you can call overpowered and undertiered. My advice: Play only for free. This company does not deserve your money."",0"
"3005,War Thunder,2016.0,""Simply put: I don't have such love/hate relationship with any other game than I have with War Thunder. Also no other game has made me more salty than War Thunder.That said I'll list some pros and cons.Pros:-Different levels of realism from shooty-tooty arcade to much slower paced simulator battles-Lots of tanks and airplanes to unlock and new ones are constantly added-Very nice graphics-Free to play but not win to pay-Does actually require some skill, especially later in gameCons:-Realism is sometimes more like """"realism"""", tanks ricocheting rounds in very weird way OR taking damage when they really shouldn't etc-There are lots of stuff to unlock but sometimes you'll notice that vehicles are very similiar. For example when unlocking american tanks you'll spend ages grinding through three different Shermans that aren't actually that different from each other after all. (Slight changes to armour thickness etc, don't really mean anything) And that's just one example.-Technically it's still pay to win, War Thunder has this premium system that gives you different kind of boosters to use and also provides you with a selection of premium vehicles. Not all of them are that special but some of them are seriously unbalanced and overpowered.-Does require skill but still most of the time it seems that it's not enough. Game suffers from serious balancing problems and therefore some matches end in minutes no matter how good of an player you are.Some other things that need to be noted:Game has this Battle rating system or BR in short. This means that every vehicle has a rating, for example 3.7. Game then searches for players with same BR. Thing is that usually you have more than just one vehicle. Lets say you have three tanks with BR of 3.7. Things are good and you're having pretty evenly balanced games. Then you get a tank with BR of 4.3 Suddenly you're facing tanks that have BR of 5 or even higher. This leads to greatly unbalanced game.Also because of this game doesn't always feel rewarding. For example I grinded for some time to get legendary Tiger and Panther tanks but after I got them I really didn't feel like playing with them because I was fighting more advanced (prototype or post-WW2 era tanks) most of the time. That also takes away some realism.Spawncamping. Yes, I do it sometimes myself too but still. Too often I see games where one team steamrolls to other teams spawn and kills everyone. Some maps even make it very easy by having the spawn points on open ground and easily seen from across the map. Already unbalnaced games become even more unbalnced because of this.Lack of teamwork. It's extremely rare to see some real teamwork in WT unless you're playing with friends or are part of some clan. There are lots of russian players even on EU servers and they don't usually speak english and even less usually they give a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ about other players. Not saying that they all are like that, just like 80% of them...Game modes don't really force you to be a team player. Okay maybe it's bit wrong to rant about this but I still want to point it out. With tanks game modes usually require player to capture and hold some point on the map. Even though you do get a reward for capturing a point and you do get more points and currency if you win a match it doesn't force you to play the objective or be a team player. WT would be a lot more fun with new game modes etc, maybe there will be some in the future.All in all, War Thunder is somewhat hooking even though sometimes it makes you really salty. You might like it or not or perhaps you'll be like me and feel both ways. I chose not to recommend this game because right now it feels unbalanced and broken, maybe I'll change my mind after a while. Or maybe not.  "",0"
"3006,War Thunder,2017.0,""Every once in a while Gaijin will cave in to the Russia-only crybabies who swear up and down that not a single T-54, IS series, or T-55 was ever lost in combat.  So then, in order to please people who do nothing but impulse buy all of their Russian premiums (this is likely where a fair chunk of their change comes from), they do crap like this.  They glitch out the turret armor on all their high tier Soviet tanks (grinding to face off against these death machines is a fun time in and of itself) so that anything less than a top tier Sabot round from a Chieftan's Turbolaser of a main gun won't pen, they fool around with the spalling mechanics, and goof off with the crew durability.  I have seen Soviet crew members make the Ultimate Sacrificeâ„¢ by stopping a Sabot round from my Japanese M41A1 and preventing it from killing the rest of the crew.  It's absurd.Yes, the game is beautiful and yes the models are high quality (not many moving parts but I'll take what I can get) but this means nothing if you are only going to be seeing the same Gopnik death devices speeding around the map at breakneck speeds, like the thirty-something mile an hour IS-6 that every goober and his grandma has shilled out for.  Meanwhile tanks like the Ru-251 and the Bulldog putter around at a speed that is so 'meh' that you're just glad you aren't in anything else.  Because 'anything else' is, garaunteed to be slow as dog doo, and not a match for the Eastern Bloc Armored Battalion/Soviet Border Guards Circa 1961 that you ARE going to be facing off against.The economy is, once again, in shambles.  Tens of the exact same plane but with bigger guns/wacky engines/a different paint job (See P-51D series, Focke Wulfe series, Yakelov, Meteors, Spitfires (except for the Griffon-powered God Flying Christ machines), Zeroes) force you to shell out big money just to progress (there used to be folders that the aircraft would fit into), and the research mechanic is just an excercise in """"how much punishment am I willing to endure today"""", because if you don't have premium, then congratulations, you're gonna die.The balancing is non-existant.  The Russiaboos and actual Slavniks who are absolutely, and I mean TRULY terrible at the game will complain about everything.  """"Uhhh, HESH doesn't cause t-t-t-t-THHHAAAATTTT much spalling, its only, like, a single piece of metal that I can catch with my hand cause I'm super cool"""", """"Uhhhhh, sloped armor can block absolutely everything, so the IS-6 should be completely unkillable from all angles, uhuhuhuhuh"""", """"uhhhh, the 122mm main gun is, like, uh, the most powerful gun ever, b-but I don't really wanna face off against Jagdtigers and M47 Pattons and FV4005's, I kinda just wanna club Tiger 1's and 2's"""", and they listen to these demands and then they give into them. And guess what? Russia mains STILL suck.  They STILL get crapped on by the likes of Bulldogs, Tiger 1's, Baby Centurians, hell I've even taken several out with my trusty M42 Duster (shoot the lowest part of the hull from the side.  It has no armor.)!!! And the complaining and screaming that comes with every kill is just mind numbing.  Did the IS-6 get killed? Expect a torrent of vulgar statements ending with a paragraph.  Did the IS-6 GET a kill? Expect a smartassed response in the chat about you should get good, because the IS-6 is such a hard tank to use.And all this gripe is about one tank that, like I said, any goober can shell out money for.  This is to say nothing of the IS-3 and 4 """"Impenetrable Superfortress"""", the Tu-4 """"Meat on the Table"""" (approach them from the front.  Works every time.), and the T-54 """"This Thing Totally Saw Extensive Service in WW2"""".But what about the super high tier T-64A? Its poo poo! Because such ridiculous superweapons such as the MBT-70 and Kpz-70 exist!  I don't know how they managed it!  Why buy a slow, 3-man T-64A when you can end the match as soon as it begins in a Kpz-70!The aircraft are a joy to fly but I feel as though another kick to the huevos is incoming so who knows.It needs work, and for now, Imma have to give is a """"No"""" for this recommendation.  And I have several thousand hours put into this game, I only recently linked up my Gaijin account with my Steam one, for streaming purposes.P.S.!  By the way, the community is supportive and is willing to listen to advice and help out a friend, but the few mods that actively post in-game are just gigantic trolls who start arguments, spam chat, and ban people for asking them to stop.  So just don't talk to anybody in the General chat.  Period.  Not like anybody does anyway, they've all been banned (seriously)."",0"

And many planes and tanks are unbalanced. Instead of fixing this, they attempt to bring in more players by adding moreâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ which just makes the grind longer, and pushes ol players like me away.

"3009,War Thunder,2016.0,""This game starts out fun but as you get into the high ranks, it starts taking 50 to 75 games to unlock a single tank or plane. Very often two or even three of these tanks or planes are indentical in every way, save the name, meaning you spent 200+/- games trying to advance past them to something new. At the same time you start seeing players who paid real money for tanks that are practically invincible. Suprise, they kill you at will.

I gave it a while, figuring the devs were somehow busy trying to get it through Steam's aggressive quality control, but after having come back to it nearly three years down the line, it has devolved extremely far. I write this review, both as a warning to new incoming players, and as an attempt to get through to those who for some reason still love this game. This game has extreme potential, but until the devs stop kidding themselves that the USSR was a technological power house that can make any machine perform better just by adoring itself with a Russian paint scheme, we will never se this game in any sort of actually historically accurate or balanced light."",0"
"3011,War Thunder,2015.0,""nice graphics for a free simulation. that's all that there is to it.now the negative points in short: â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gameplay, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balance, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ mods/supprters/developers, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ premium (as in op and expensive as hell) and buggy as hell. it gets worse with every update and gaijin seems to care less and less.details:-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ community: friendly fire is the war thunder way to say hello. also you have to pay for the repairs yourself. also you can't disable friendly fire. also, reporting friendly firing teammates will make your team a lot weaker than it already is after all the quitters left. also there is no way of joining a normal game later. so you're pretty much â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed if you have an â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ on your team. i usually have 2.-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ gameplay: wow, cool, as if camping and sniping for hours without end in other games wasn't boring enough, you can now do it in a tank that takes 5-60 seconds to reload after every shot depending on how â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed you are. motherâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing yay.yay king of the hill mode, like i haven't seen that one before. yay domination, something new. yay, there is literally nothing interesting in this game, except if you like to drive 10 mins with a tank at 15mph to try to flank the enemy just to get one-shot.also: one shots. you'll get one-shot all over the place, doesn't matter if the enemy is right in front of you or a mile away. you'll get one-shot through buildings, the floor, debris, dead tanks, and even ricochet from a friendly unit.-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ balance: t34 best tank in the world. world war winning tank with stalinium armor and cryptonite ammo. nuff said. the russian bias is real - who would've thought it, it's a russian game after all.interestingly gaijin writes about tanks at level 1.0 (""""battke ranking"""") that are able to deal with tanks at level 3 (which is true). but they dont change the level of that tank. nope. seems about right.also tank levels seem to change with every day passing and depending even of game type you're playing, but you cannot look up the real facts, when that very tank has what level, so that after you made a decent team and joined a game, you see that the levels are all over the place and your once balanced team suddenly has one very high level member and you now have to fight other players that have way stronger units, not as if one-shotting wasn't a huge issue anyway, now you cant even retaliate.-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ supporters/mods/developers: there is actually a forum where you can post all your bug reports just to have them ignored. yay. each update comes with new bugs. yay. old ones rarely get fixed. nay.-â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ premium: how about you pay a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on of money to get great units to fight realâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ones? great, isn't it? you're invincible and can one-shot everybody for some cash. also, you can buy the whole game for millions of dollers. awesome. some people actually grind all the stuff for years on end. yeah, â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ them, amirite gaijinalso who the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ came up with these ideas:spawning points are not possible to get artillerized, but can very well can get bombed.airplanes should start out being built out of wood, so that you catch on fire the first 100 times you fly it until you have researched the last def-upgrade. same applies for tanks, except there you can't upgrade you def normally, but fire extinguishers aren't available from the start either. also you cant repair your tank from the start either, everything has to be researchedyou can help your squadmate repair, but not your other teammates. it's also not possible to repair a tank if you havent made that specific upgrade, even if your squad mate has the same tank as you do and is around to help but you cant start repairing.fires cant be put out under wateryour crew drowns literally in 3 secondsmaps usually look like each team just came from their respective base to the battle, still you start out with tanks all over the place, srsly, noone drives a tank backwards to battle, not even the ai, not even 90Â° tilted. also you spawn on/in eachother which gaijin only could solve by making your tank impervious to damage for some time at spawn - great, but useless against all spawnkillers and """"traffic jams"""" at game start.if your tank's tires/chain is damaged your crew immediately refurse any orders for a second and stop driving to start repairing it asap. nice feature, right? nope, you cant hide like this from enemy fire, you cant put your tank in a more favourable angle to the enemy fire. you'll have to wait 4 seconds to be able to do anything. also, crew doesn't give a damn if literally everything else is destroyed, but hell brakes loose if the chain is loose.killing ai will not give you any points whatsoever for researching your already very weakly starting new units, so that it's even more of a pain to try and use new units. also, most matches have like 50% ai, which makes for very boring , since not very intelligent, play.the greatest pros have to face the greatest noobs. fact, how else are they going to sustain their high rating?""""this game aint a game, it's a simulation"""" - gaijin. the only thing that differentiates it from other games like world of tanks, (except everything mentioned) are (the very unrealistic battles (jk, but it's true)) sim battles that noone â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing plays for many reasons that i'm not going to get into. there is a lot else i dont want to get into, too, but i think i'm exceeding the character count.would i recommend this game?have you read my review?

This most experianced in the mode Realistic Battle where it's nation Vs. nation and the Russian nation has a win rate over 80% at ranks 2 and 3 over 90%! The RNG for Russian tanks ai just a joke becouse they'll pen other tanks at absurd angles and kill them with 1 shot becouse off OP ammo (some WW2 tanks have post war ammo)!You really dont have anything else to play than random battles if you're not in a clan and the MM is one of the worst i've ever seen! It doesn't even ballance the team by vehicle types... so you get into matches (planes) where 1/2 of your team are bombers and the enemy are only fighters... that's an auto loose!Grinding to top rank vehicles is also useless becouse there is nothing to do with them, they have no other purpose that any lower rank vehicle and you have to wait in the quene for a very long time becouse very few players play them.    Don't get me wrong the game was good at patch 1.35 (more than a year ago maybe 2) but after that it just got worse! A lot can be credited to heavy forum moderation between updates 1.37 and 1.43 where every critique and realistic player opinion was deleted and the player got banned from posting or could post only with moderators approval of the message!"",0"

"3015,War Thunder,2018.0,""The morderation team has a massive negative rep. The balance team has a heavy RU bias. The top brass of Gaijin Entertainment is exactly like every other top Russian game devs we see. Money first, Community last. The War Thunder community has balanced tech trees, included modes and vehicles, and other various contributions that if they were patched into the real game, they'd be doing the game a solid favor. This game is a joke and deserves to lay in the ditch that Gaijin has buried it into. As it stands, its only a matter of time. Shame on you Gaijin, shame on you."",0"

You will always and I mean always being one shoot from any possible angle and from your thickest armor.Someone hits your track kills you,someone hits your barrel it kills you,someones shell ricochet of you still kills you, even when someone hits your antenna it kills you.I tried to play more carefull,pay more attention how am i positioning,tried using terrain and building to protect me and still no use.The enemy simply shiiits on my future.When game is about to begin of course is not going to put all players in the same time and you are going to love the invisible ghosts that are hitting and blocking you from blitzing to the capture point.Lets not forget the glorius badass players who took bombers and drop bombs on your respawn point right after you return in game.You could do nothing,you returned simply to be killed and add that repair price who is devouring your silver lions.I dont think I'm going to play this game that much as i used before,simply it reached point where I'm frustrated too much.Not to talk abuot players who never communicate and i mean never.

"3017,War Thunder,2016.0,""Before I start, I just want to say I have WAY more than just 400 hours played in this game. I originially didn't link it to my steam account.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great game, I love flying around, dogfighting and ground pounding but there's just so much wrong with it right now. Namely, the battle rating system and Gaijins reliance on """"their data"""" for it's balancing (the battle rating system (or BR system) is basically the match maker for those new to the game).First off, I'll start with my largest gripe, the BR system. This just doesn't work well enough for it to be in game, simply because the devs only adjust the BRs of planes/tanks off of player data, which is a huge problem. This makes tier 5 (highest tier in game) near unplayable. For example, the Me-262 C variants, 1945 jets with rocket boosters on them, fight F-86 F-2s and Hawker Hunters, Korean/1953 era jets. While the Me-262 Cs are good enough planes in game, they just can't catch up with, nor dogfight top tier jets (they struggle to take off their engines are that bad). Yet Gaijins """"data"""" says they do """"perfectly fine"""" where they are. That's only because in these battles, there are similar jets thrown into the slaughter they can actually kill outside of head ons. Vampires, Meteors (all of them), F-80s, MiG-9s, F9Fs. None of those should be in the place they are.I could rant for hours on this and all the individual adjustments they should make (lower tier planes have this issue as well to a lesser extent) but there's really no point. Gaijin refuses to listen to the community about this and just constantly refer to this invisible """"data"""" when they make decisions like that. It's compressed tier 5 into oblivion, and as such, people leave out of frustration. Then it gets further compressed to increase queue times, loop, loop, etc. Eventually, if this keeps up, the game will die.As for tanks, it just feels endlessly frustrating to play. Get one shot, forced to leave the match. Get shot from somewhere you couldnt see from because someone turned their graphics to the lowest settings to see you while you want to enjoy the grass/trees/smoke/etc and be immersed. Tanks are also subject to compression as well, but since I never played them much, I don't know much about that situation.How about game modes? Well, you have arcade (AB), realistic (RB) and simulator modes (SB). AB is simple, just chaos, respawns and lots of angry children. RB is more strategic, one life and the planes/tanks behave in a more realistic fashion. It's safe to say that RB is the middle ground of this game, the one I've played most and probably the mode that suffers most from the BR compression. SB is total trash compered to other simulator games like IL-2 bos or DCS world. Oddly enough though, SB tanks is good and probably what RB should be for tanks right now imo.Oh, and to finish it off, Bombers/attack aircraft are mostly useless. Bombers/attackers don't contribute to a victory outside of tier 4 (and or spam) and are just exp pinatas. In tank battles though, they're just an annoyance, since SPAA can easily one shot them. Oh and SPAA are pretty damn good at killing tanks. WAY too good in fact. One tier 1 SPAA in fact can drive 80kph and seal clubs everything it faces.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tl"
"3018,War Thunder,2016.0,""I've been playing War Thunder since some of the earliest closed testing phases, though I only recently moved my install over to Steam. In the begining War Thunder showed so much promise and seemed like it could be genuinely fun without absurd grind or pay to win nonsense, and for a while it really was. But as the years have gone by systems changed to make the grind worse, more and more pay to win BS was added and the devs have made it more and more readily apparent that they don't care about their consumers, only making as much money as possible off of us. Pile on the recent friction between the developers and the community and it is apparent to me that War Thunder is no longer worth supporting in any way, not with my money and not with my time as a player, so it is with a heavy heart that I have to say good bye to War Thunder for good."",0"

A 12mm machine gun can kill tiger by random hit that kills entire crew. Not really fun for anyone who isn't into camping tacticsLarge bias in performance of armor toward russian tanks. Strange, that soft german targets (flak,  new TDs)  as well as russian AA guns that meant to have paper armor, can surwive literally dozen penetrating hits and bounce some.Preium content: doesn't worth it.

"3020,War Thunder,2016.0,""If you love outstanding physics, intense tank battles, realistic mechanics and incredible gameplay....Then you came to the wrong game. Welcome to War Thunder, please insert money to continue. For some reason the developers seem to think Russia and Germany won WWII as the bias in this game would suggest we should all have pencil mustaches and be slapping each other with lederhosen. I've done my best to enjoy this game, but through the constant aneurisms of unfair matches and special education teammates who enjoy driving into you and team killing, it's somewhat impossible to do so. I've seen plenty of reviews of angry players who resemble 12 year old Xbox Live children angry they can't get a kill, however don't take this review as such. The game REQUIRES some sort of payment to make the game enjoyable. If you enjoy watching paint dry, then boy will you enjoy waiting for your tanks to finally research! But have no fear, the waiting does NOT end there, as you need to pay in game currency to train a crew to operate that tank you spent your entire adult life researching.But if that doesn't tickle your belly button, then don't worry, I have more good news! Those tanks you spend eternity researching will still never stand a chance against the players you're matched against who seem to be far ABOVE your level, so the excitement of researching a bad*** tank is short lived as you're eiffel towered by tanks 3 ranks above you (or by players who stole their parents credit card to purchase the Pay 2 Win tanks!) This includes having to take 50 shots at a single tank to get a penetration, but if you drive over a rock, prepare to spend 50+ seconds to repair!But the GREATEST part about war thunder is their servers. Plenty of PING to go around! The developers must run the game from a shack somewhere on the forest moon of Endor, as you'll find yourself huffing tank fumes from players who killed you before you even loaded the map. HOWEVER! """"If you do pay for premium,"""" your tanks seem to become empowered with the magic of capitalism as you breeze through research....oh crap I ran out of premium already...as their system charges you by DAY instead of the typical monthly payment. Be prepared to install an arcade coin slot to your PC to keep your benefits coming, because the moment they run out, the game progresses slower than an African Sloth trying to climb Mount Everest.So grab your friends! (but not more than 3 because they limit your squad to 4 people.) and huff some glue, because the amount of braincells you'll sacrifice lose from doing THAT is MINISCULE to the amount you'll lose to broken physics, monkey run match making and confusing deaths (walls don't wall properly in this game).

But when I sit back after a match and think about what I did wrong after being completelyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on, nine times out of ten it was my fault. Not angling my armor properly, being impatient and pushing so far up I get surrounded, etc. Thats what I love about this game.

"3027,War Thunder,2015.0,""Ignore the 0.5 hours, thats just the steam version. I'm in tier 5 America and have a positive kill death ratio in the P-51 Mustang. To anyone who has ever played this game long enough, you will praise me as your new lord or repel me in the name of Christ. For anyone else, let me tell you why. This game has so much potential to be good, but it squanders it in the silliest of ways. So let me just get this out of the way, it is Russian biased. Not even gonna lie, don't have to because I'm in the safe Steam forums where KGB...I mean Gaijin developers can't execute my posts. Imagine this.It's a terrible day to be a tanker, the Germans have a tiger and you have 1 T-34, in real life you win by number advantage. In WarThunder, you win because the Tiger decided to replace it's armor with paper and lined it's hull with High Explosive ammunition. I can not believe how many times I have been """"Ammo Racked"""" in a Tiger. You can be shot in the tracks, and your tank could randomly explode. How does Gaijin explain? The game is still in developement. That's why when tanks first came out, lets just reduce the listed capabilities of ALL German cannons by about 20% or if you wanna be technical, model it at 15 degree before even regarding what you're hitting, so technically you could hit something dead on, and still be penalized 15 degrees and just be glancing off.Is this just one case example? Definietly not. Everytime they put new stuff in the game (while completely ignoring existing issues), if it's Russian they just say screw it, raise all of its values from the previous plane, times that by 2, and make it a UFO. If it's anything else, case example the twin mustang, which is litterally a p51 times 2, is actually now 1/2 in value. Instead of making sure that the planes and tanks in the game work well and historically, they add in more planes and with the twin mustang, were too lazy to even code the second engine. WTF logic is that?Look I'm not going to recommend this game. This game feels like an abusive relationship in which many like me, were given false feelings of love. Frankly the kick that I can get out of this game is winning in a Tiger or P-51 because the odds are stacked so poorly in your favor that its the feeling of satisfaction that I like. If you play for that I applaud you. But for everyone else flying UFO planes and ww2 T-90's, you are so blind to how bad this game really is.Btw I can agree with many of the other negative reviews, but the positive reviews seem like they are from easily impressed people. The funnier ones are from people who recognize the blatant issues, but still think this game is worth it. I don't, as a WW2 history enthisiast, I have been pushed to World of Tanks. That's how bad this game has become. At least War gaming has a method to their madness. Here, make sure you pray to RNGesus."",0"
"3028,War Thunder,2015.0,""The game has amazing potential, but the developers are completely disconnected from the community and most of the users have lost all hope. One of the absolute worst community management teams. Gaijin never fails to disappoint with each and every patch."",0"
"3029,War Thunder,2016.0,""I started playing this back in 1.33 I think. Back then it was fairly well balanced though did have its issues. However, as of now, 1.55, the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The main focus of this review is aimed at the ground forces, but has some relevance with the planes as well.When tanks were first released, they were balanced quite well. You could go into a game knowing you could do well, regardless of which nation or tank you picked. Nowadays though, Russian tanks will one shot you, regardless of where they shoot at you, and they will bounce most shots you fire at them. Those shots that do penetrate rarely hit anything vital. For a long time I've defended against the whole Russian bias, but as of 1.55 I can no longer ignore it. A prime example is HE rounds. Russian HE rounds (designed for soft targets e.g. infantry) are about 4 times as powerful as any other country, this means even well armoured tanks will get killed by them.With the release of Brit tanks, we finally had something that could actually kill T-34s, but of course, they have since been nerfed, through either reducing armour, or by making rounds less effective. Fair enough on some of the """"updates"""" they cited sources, however, they have not shown us where they get their data on Russian tanks.Until this balancing is address, I find it very hard to reccommend this game, which is a shame as the potential is there for perhaps the best game of its kind."",0"
"3030,War Thunder,2015.0,""The game has such an up-down style of competence, so I would rate somewhere in the middle, but as there are only two options, I'm going to choose no.It can be immensely fun, and if made by ANY company rather than Gaijin it could be a VERY good game, but with the direction they're heading I'm not getting a fuzzy, warm feeling.On the good side, it can be amazing fun, with three different game styles with varying realism, and tons of different WW2 aircraft to choose from.After a few hundred hours, however, the downsides of the game really show.-The balancing in WT is usually questionable to downright bad, ESPECIALLY at higer tiers, where German and Japanese WW2 props see postwar American jets.-Russian bias? No. But definitely some extensive support for the russians from devs, where we get another Yak to add to the pile of 20~-No options to opt out of gamemodes, like the new and awful """"Air domination"""" which is one big clusterâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ you don't want to be a part of.

"3031,War Thunder,2016.0,""â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥- the game. If you wanna see how the Russians like to feed propaganda to their population about how 'amazing' their tanks and aircraft were, this the game. Pretty game but its just so biased.Accept it Gaijin. Your game is awful just like Russian tanks and planes. Trying to gloss over their war crimes by making their tanks and aircraft looks good."",0"
"3032,War Thunder,2016.0,""This post is mainly for the most recent event where players were told they could win an E-100 premium German tank. Here's a few reasons on how Gaijin royally screwed up, as they have done so many times before. You have to play Russia to win. I payed $10.00 for a dog tag to gain access into the thunder league to play the event. I was excited at first, in fact my first few games were goign well. We won more than we lost and even the losses weren't that bad because you could hop back in right after the game was over and try again. So thus day one ended and I placed 587, (you have to be in the top 150 to get the tank). So not bad, I'm thinking that I have all day Sunday to improve my ranking. This is where Gaijin, once again, screwed over its players and community. I logged back into War thunder to participate in the event. I like the American line and had been using my M46 Tiger and M26 Pershing the day before. I get into the event and my tanks aren't there. What? Instead, there is the M4A3 series of tanks such as the E2 Jumbo and the premium Calliope. So I go out in the Jumbo and We are paying against 2 IS2's and a T34-85. I get one-shotted 3 times and our team loses. No one on the enemy team loses a life. And it's not just this way for America, no no no. All countries are set to certain tanks to make the game more """"fair"""" So in other words, one has to play the Russian line to even have a shot at gettign kills because everyone who plays war thunder knows, Russian Tanks are OP.So needless to say I had gone 24 wins and 8 losses the day before to 10 straight losses in a row with the same team the next because we could not kill the Russians unless we played as the Russians. And since I don't prefer to play the Russian line, and enjoy my Americans, this really blew. So thank you Gaijin for once again trying to balance a game and making it worse. This hasn't only happened this one time but many others, I guess this was the final straw."",0"
"3033,War Thunder,2016.0,""The game is broken on multiple levels and Gaijin have no inclenation to fix it. The balancing has probably given me a tumour.The best way to decribe it would be to imagine Putin made a game and then someone else coded it poorly. Play it sure, but please don't give them money."",0"

"3035,War Thunder,2016.0,""2000 Gold Eagles to ducktape shrubs to my tank? Thats the last straw for me and it should be for you guys too! Don't support these money sucking Rusian biases anymore until they change thier ways. Gajin can take my credit card and shove it up thier @$$es.Cation, huge wall of text, but contains the truth. also, I apologise for any spelling errors. Thankyou for your time.My Professional Review:   To make this more professional, I have been playing War Thunder for over 3 years. I have ssen they game grow up and add lots of awsome features like ground forces and lots of game engine additions. They also added a lot of additions that are either poor or money grabbing scemes like the vehicle research and xp conversion system. And they battle rating which is and has been one of the biggest problems with the game. you might not think its a problem at low tiers but wait till you get to tier 4 or 5, then you will be ripping your hair out every match epecially if you are a bomber player. If they would just sit down and fix the BR, the game would be 3x more enjoyable and might even help fix some of the Russain and German bias you probably heard so much about. Last, is the Gajin staff and forum moderators. While I give them credit for some of the great work they have done, they completely disregard the community and thier oppinions which is another reason why this game isn't reaching its full potential. The staff always says that if you have any opinions or ideas to make the game better, to go talk about it on the forums. Most of the time they dont read any of the suggestions most of the time unless a post is attracting a lot of attention. If they don't like what the post has to say, they will take it down and ban the author from the forums because I guess they still don't have freedom of speech in Russia. What really irritates me is thier recent actions to the community like thier """" Russian Bias Party"""" joke which while I agree it was kind of funny, was also unproffesional. What really upset me though was thier cash grab with the new tank customization features. After recieving community backlash about charging 500 Golden Eagles for tank customizations and bush camo, which I disagree with at least paying for the bushes. They then stated 2 days later that that was only a special and raised some of the bushes up to 2000 GE. I found this vulgar and unproffesional, Gajin has plenty of money not to do this yet they just keep trying to milk thier money maker of a game. If Gajin wants to keep thier community happy, they need to get thier act together anf if you are still here, welcome to the madhouse and don't pay Gajin a cent until they fix themselfs and the game."",0"
"3036,War Thunder,2016.0,""The russian bias in this game for ground forces is so over the top its almost comedy. I dare you to play for a while, and watch what happens.1. The team with russian tanks drives to your spawn. your team kills a couple, but they invariably manage to get there as 1 shotting a russian tank isnt as common, but them one shotting everything else is.2. they camp your spawn and proceed toâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥the map.3. the russian side wins.This game is about as far from a simulation as you can get if you go by WW2 statistics for russian losses."",0"

""""Well c'mon the dev's can change it if you present historical evidence"""", well it has been done, and you know what? The devs said it was just anti-russian propoganda. It seems like Gaijin is stuck with this whole nationalism thing even into a game. Now lets talk about the Community, it seems like Gaijin doesnt even F*****ING KNOW IT EXISTS. I mean c'mon, if you promise something, at least make something. For example, Gaijin promised bomber interiors for a long time, pass a couple years later, we have new airplanes, new tanks, new maps, and everything but F*****CKING what they promised. I have long stopped playing this game for myself, I only sometimes boot it up to play with my friend, but other than that, I am really done with this game. I would not recommend this game to anybody that wants historical accurracy, or fair matchmaking, or anybody who like to communicate with the devs."",0"

"3040,War Thunder,2016.0,""I guess I am going to be joining the ranks of folks with 1000+ hours down voting this game. Gaijin has refused to listen to it's own player base regardless of their time or investment in the title. Continually and casually making horrible buisness decisions that purely insult the player base. When the community speaks out over the issues with the title, Administrators hold a gun to their head and tell them to admit there is no problems, or be banned. It sounds broad because it is broad.

"3041,War Thunder,2016.0,""Product received for free***Review based on aircraft game modes***I've been playing this game for years, even before it came out on steam, and all I can say is do not download this game.The unbalance of each team for ever match is unbearable.  The OP russain aircraft are so painful to play against, it almost literally gives me cancer, if it hasn't already.The constant patches and updates with un-notified changes to aircraft models within the patch notes is incredibly misleading - one day you could be flying along fine, then after the patch your aircraft could just fall out of the sky, it's wings could shear off just because you made a 2G roll, your aircraft could blow up just for looking at a russian aircraft.I would say play the game, just to understand what I mean by all of this nonsense, but I would also say do not even bother with it.  It'll be a waste of time.The jets too - well, don't fly any jets that are British or American, because they apparently suck - by the time you get off the ground, the entire russian team of MiG-17s will be on top of you, blowing your team to pieces.  Believe it or not, a Gloster Meteor from 1942 would fly against a MiG-17 from 1952 (for those of you who are not aware, huge technological advances were made in jet engines and aircraft aerodynamics within those 10 years).In fact, if you're reading this and you still want to play the game, fly as russians.

"3044,War Thunder,2014.0,""The Devs continue to ruin this game with their consistent, poorly-executed 'Patches'.They've turned what used to be a fast-paced, action-packed flight game into a tortuous grind to get new planes, and then more grind to max-out the features each plane has (engine power, guns, ammo/ordinance, etc.)The Mods are far too heavy-handed with their chat bans.  If you say a word they don't agree with, or talk about anything 'Other than' planes/the game itself, you stand a good chance of being muzzled for variable durations (at their whim and mood).Too many of the other players are either forced to be self-centered, greedy little psychopaths, or for whatever reason are just maladjusted human flotsam that choose to play against the 'Team', the objectives, or just cause grief and mayhem at every opportunity.The 'Game' itself, is really amazing. If you have all the time in the world and the patience of a Saint, you'll probably enjoy the hell out of it.For awhile.Good luck!"",0"
"3045,War Thunder,2014.0,""I have been playing this game for quite some time.  I had purchased the Sherman tank package in order to get access to early beta (which was only 2 nights a week and a time that I could not play).  I logged in recently to find I had a negative 2000 golden eagle balance and was notified that it was due to a bug on Gaijin's end.  I had not received the extra golden eagles but the system thought I did and removed it.  Gaijin's solution was to zero my balance and thus remove the 2000+ golden eagles that I had bought via steam.  I am not happy with the customer service on this and thus I cannot recommend this game for fear this could be a common situation in the future.Also in ground forces. There is a serious bias towards Russian equipment. It was good but not that good. BR system needs a complete overhaul.  The economy for ground forces is atrocious and an embarassment for the design team.  Very difficult to make a decent profit in a win let alone a loss.  The lockout for leaving a battle is a joke.  It makes sense in Arcade mode but in realistic or simulator you get one vehicle maybe two before the match is done.  Once gone (god forbid you down't spawn in a rock and have to bail) you have to wait a stupid amount of time for something you have no control over, or very little.  I had hopes but frankly the game has a long ways to go."",0"

Back then it was only planes and was fairly good. Had its bugs pros and cons but was good. All went to hell with the patch 1.24... and from that on it went only down.. Then came the ground forces. Man it was good. Again alot of bugs but it was good.. you would kill and get killed but it did not bother me. And after every patch it got worse in groundforces. And you could feel the bias towards russian forces. And now it just RussianThunder. Why? becouse russians dominate tier 5, dominate tier 4 ,dominate tier 3.

To sell them, Gaijin not only break the cannon of this game alone with the balance, but also make grinding new vehicles extremely hard for anyone that does not own one such P2W item as well as premium account. i.e. making this game impossibly unfriendly to new players(let alone the already cliff learning curve).Therefore, i do not recommend this game for new comers. You may heard its better historically or graphically than world of tanks, well, its now at best, as bad as wowt.I stand corrected, the devs are not over patriot, they justâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥at coding and unable to deliver a smooth game."",0"

(2000's BF1942 is better than this game in that sense)- Unrewarding and terribly long tank grinds, which also get interrupted each time a new vehicle is released- Non skill based gamplay, theres simply too many meta variables to consider this game a reliable competitive platform- Unashamed P2W bussiness model (standard tanks are no match for premium tanks and planes in the same tier and premium tanks and planes form the bulk of pvp battles)- Poor Match Making makes posible for people in Asia play in the same US server as people from South Africa with the predictable results...- Its almost impossible to get a balanced game, 75% of the battles get resolved in the very first three or four minutes, a single plane can wreck 3 or for 4 tanks and send those players straight to the garage forcing what lefts of the team in a painfully long defeat, you also get spawn camped very regulary there are no real mechanichs to prevent this, and the game forces you to spawn even if you are the last player and your spawn is populated by literaly every single player in the oposite team.tl"
"3050,War Thunder,2018.0,""To be fair: This game has great investment in the vehicles, sounds and models. The game looks great. However, Gaijin could care less when it comes to making good maps, balanced matchmaking, good events, hiring competent/friendly PR staff... the list goes on. I'm adding my opinion to the rest of them currently in order to show Gaijin they messed up by reintroducing Chronicles, such a unfun, unbalanced mess that it was removed from future events. The current event achievements are damn near impossible for anyone who wishes to grind them out and have a life, and thats coming from someone who is on disability currently and has no life. Many things in this game steer players towards just saying """"screw it"""" and opening up the wallet to be effective, right from the get go they introduce the atrocious grind, I watched a player stream his first week on this game and he barely unlocked 3 tanks playing 4 hours a day without premium and I hear it only gets worse in the later tiers.---{Graphics}---â˜‘ Beautiful---{Gameplay}--- â˜‘ Good---{Audio}--- â˜‘ Very good---{Audience}--- â˜‘ Everyone---{PC Requirements}--- â˜‘ Decent(I get 100+ FPS on High with GTX960)---{Difficulity}--- â˜‘ Easy to learn / Hard to master(Controls are easy to pick up, but there are some advanced controls that you must look up or bind yourself, and controlling each vehicle and learning its pros and cons will take a LONG time, considering that you must unlock upgraded engines/transmission/rounds/etc to be fully competitive, you start off at a disadvantage. Also, matchmaking is based on the perceived effectiveness of the vehicle according to the dev, called battle rating, and not based on player skill or level, so after you get out of Tier 1 bot matches, you will be placed with veteran players that can snipe your tank at all the chokepoints because they've memorized the map and distances to the targets)---{Grind}--- â˜‘ Average grind levelâ˜ Too much grindâ˜‘ Insanity(I've marked two because there are two different levels. The grind level will be insanity if you don't pay for a premium account to boost your research points. If you do so, the grind becomes about average. You will still not likely unlock things very quickly even with a premium, and even though it negates the unlocking grind for vehicle trees, Gaijin will introduce event vehicles, decals and tournaments that are insanely grindy and time based, giving players usually only a day or weekend to complete, which is hard for people with lives to manage)---{Story}--- â˜‘ Doesn't have any(Literally no story unless you count the """"historical"""" """"campaigns"""" thrown in last minute.

There are some dumb things i absolutley hate. it should be a game i really like but Just infuriating overall.1) I am never at the top battle rating for the tanks i face. I always keep 2 of my vehicles as reserve. so 3 are battle tanks i actually use. 1 of those is an aa vehicle which is a couple tiers back, m16(BR1.3). every new tank i get i move up. i was fighting Dicker MAX(BR4.7) with an m10(3.7) so i work my way up to a m18BR (4.7) same BR as Dicker Max only now Tigers start appearing (BR 5.7), so i work my way up to m4a1.76(BR 5.0) and now Panther A (BR 6.0) starts showing up so i work my way to a jackson BR 5.7 and Tiger 2 BR(6.3) shows up. When the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ do i get to be at the top of the BR?!?!  I cant even Pen most of the tanks i face 2) I make a real effort to learn what kills me and how to avoid it the next time and to replicate what others do. I read how to use every tank and try to apply it. Other players seem to be able to do things with the same tank that are simply not feasible for me. Case and point As US i have m4A3E2(BR4.7) facing another M4A3E2 both with our frontal armor facing eachother. I cant find a single place to pen with the T45 shot, which has the highest armor piercing value, I am shotting at this guy every where. Try hitting the same spot 3 times, no pen. this whole time he is shooting at other tanks behind me. I cant move forward due to tanks that would be at my flank. the guy finally shoots at me. 1 shots me just under the turret, a spot i know i targeted a few times. we have the same tank, I should have the same ability as him but i dontAnd it isnt like this is a one time thing. repeatedley i get killed by actions i try to repllicate and just cannot feasibly do because the game mechanics will not allow it.

"3058,War Thunder,2015.0,""I only played it because it's the only game that has tanks that's even remotely realistic that I've found.I discourage playing this game because of the developer, Gaijin.German late (1944-45) Second World War tanks fight post-war (1946-53) Soviet and American tanks. You can see how that turns out. (There's also aircraft. Same deal.)Tiger Is and Panther ausf Ds face IS-3s on a regular basis.Oh, and the Russians get prototype aircraft which never saw service because the guns broke the aircraft. (I'm looking at you, Yak-9K.)"",0"
"3059,War Thunder,2015.0,""Two years ago I would have recommended this game. Now I can't.I don't have experience with other flight simulators (if you can call War Thunder a simulator), so I can't say whether the game is realistic and uses accurate flight models or not.But I can tell you that the game at it's current state is mostly not fun to play, and the developers seem to try to make the game more unfun with each update.There are two main reasons for this: the grind and the (un)balance.In order to research a new plane you have to invest a certain amount of research points towards it, which you earn by playing matches. When you finish researching the plane, you can buy it with ingame currency (buying the plane is not actually an issue, as you always have enough money).Doesn't sound too bad, until you see the numbers. At the start of the game it isn't too bad. A low tier plane costs around 9000 rp (research points) or less and you can earn at least 1000 per match if you do well. That's 9 games, fair enough.The problem is that rp requirements for planes get exponentially bigger and bigger, while the game only lets you earn about the same amount each game. To get a tier 4 plane (the game has 5 tiers), the Fw 190-D9 for example, you will need 89,000 rp, while you are only able to earn 1200 rp on average. That's about 75 games for one plane, and each game takes about 20 minutes.That means you need to grind for 25 hours for 1 plane. Want to get a jet? Play 500 matches.The game doesn't reward you for playing well either. Even if you eliminate several players every match, and even if you are the MVP, the game will only give you a pitiful 2000-3000 rp at most. It's a little better, but the difference is almost not noticeable. On top of that, Gaijin (the devs) keep adding more filler planes to the game that no one asks for. Those planes are virtually identical versions of planes already ingame, and I can think of no reason to add them other than as a way to slow the grind even further. They could have at least made researching them optional, but in order to advance in the tech tree, you have to research said planes. This means that you will find yourself finally researching a plane after many hours only to find it is the same as and maybe even a worse version of the previous plane. So to get to the plane you want, double (at least) the amount of time I mentioned earlier because you have to chew through a bunch of useless planes first.Gaijin couldn't care less about this issue, and has in fact reduced the amount of rp earned significantly over the years. RP gain has been reduced over time by approximately 99% (not even kidding) since I started playing. This is also why I have such a large number of hours played on this game, because had it been this way since the beginning I would have quit very quickly.This makes progressing the game a painful experience, and it is why I quit playing it.Now the second issue - balance. This one is a lesser issue to me because I didn't play game for historical matchups.The game uses a system called """"Battle Rating"""" to match different planes together in a battle. A plane's battle rating is supposed to reflect its ability over its opposition (a combination of the plane's armament, speed and such things). Planes with a similar battle rating will be matched together. The problem is that the Battle Rating system makes no sense, and simply doesn't work.You will see planes from 1943 face planes from 1941, and planes from 1941 facing planes from even 1937.Planes that were rarely flown in real life are used en masse in the game against planes that never saw them in combat, and were perhaps obsolete by that time.Keep in mind that World War 2 lasted 6 years, and so a 2 year difference is huge. Also keep in mind, that most of the planes that fight aircraft older than them in the game actually matched their opposition well enough in real life.The result is that a large majority of the planes ingame are borderline useless, because at the same battle ratings there are more effective planes, and they are outperformed by their opposition (which probably never fought them in real life). Some planes are mediocre, and some are blatantly overpowered at their battle rating.If I feel like seal clubbing I can just take out my He 112-A0, F2A Buffalo, or almost any spitfire of choice (there are more options) and easily get up to 10 kills per match (in realistic battles) because my opposition simply stands no chance in their planes (of course I'd get next to no reward for this, but I sure would make a lot of people frustrated).In the case of the He 112-A0, the game thinks this plane should be match against biplanes, which simply stand no chance against a pilot who knows what he's doing.On the other hand, the entire heavy fighter and bomber lines in all nations are nearly completely useless. Bombers and heavy fighters are free kills to any pilot who knows his stuff in Realistic Battles (a tiny amount of exceptions does exist). Some fighters are completely helpless against their enemies, while some even a monkey can use and be an ace.Similar problems occur throughout the entire tech trees of all 5 nations.So why do these matchups exist? That you can ask only Gaijin, which if asked would delete your post and tell you there are no such things as balance issues in War Thunder.This brings me to the final part of this review, the developers.Any of the above will likely never be fixed. The developers' only feedback about the game comes through the forums. They don't read the English forums, and it's up to the community management team to take care of the user input.The way the forums are managed by those moderators honestly gives off a cold war communist regime vibe. Anything that may be percieved as disagreement with the way Gaijin does certain things, or as a complaint about a major issue in the game, is dealt with in a similar way. The post deleted, the poster maybe banned, and if enough people complain about the issue that Gaijin has to address it, they will claim it simply does not exist. There are many more problems with the game that I haven't mentioned because I haven't experienced them personally (simulator bomber abuse - no such thing according to Gaijin despite plenty of video evidence, the balance of jet era fighters, the ground forces aspect of the game in general).I'm not sure if the developers themselves don't care about the quality of the game, or if the community managers simply do not pass over the feedback.Either way, the developers think the game is fine as it is, and keep releasing more filler planes, more ridiculous battle rating changes that make no sense, almost as if their goal is to take what fun is left away from the game.Everything works perfectly well in Gaijin-land, comrade! (Except it doesn't).TL"

"3066,War Thunder,2017.0,""I want to love this game, I really do. Tank sims are my jam, and this one is a lot of fun from that perspective.However, it is extremely unbalanced in favor of the Allies, particularly from battle-rating 4.7 to about 7.0 (a very significant proportion of the German tree). Mid-war German tanks will frequently be facing late and even post-war vehicles from the Allies, thus negating any of the perks that German tanks historically had. Matches are often frustrating because you will be facing enemies that you can't possibly hope to defeat given the limitations of the game itself and the fact that most players are utterly clueless about teamwork (though that doesn't come as a surprise in today's online gaming environment).Another huge problem is spawn camping. There's basically nothing that stops players from sitting near their enemy's respawn area and shooting people as soon as they spawn in.Hopefully Gaijin will seek to balance the game more in the future, but somehow I doubt it. I recommend this game if you enjoy tank/flight simulators in the World War 2/Early Cold War era, but prepare to be extremely frustrated by the Battle-Rating system and spawncamping."",0"

The game is essentially a ploy to get you to pay them money. """"Free"""" research points cannot be used unless you have eagles to convert them into usable research points... and of course eagles cost money. You can happily play through the first tier of planes for each region relatively easily, however as the tiers progress, the goals and upgrades become harder and harder to obtain, especially on free-to-play and thus push you towards getting a premium account or paying for game currency. When I first started playing the game, it certainly didn't have such an obvious push for cash but as the updates have rolled on, it's shown it's money grabbing side.Money aside, the game is relatively good. The arcade mode is most people's favourite, with realism lowered and more emphasis on action. There are however two other online modes: Real Battles and Simulation. The game also offers a single player mode and campaign. The gameplay itself has been simplified and allows for control almost entirely through a mouse. There is a vast array of aircraft for several different regions, all of which can be upgraded and to a limited extent, customised overtime. There are also a multitude of maps, most containing land/sea units which have to be eliminated along with airfields and bases. For more information read a better review than this one..."",0"

Also there's the grinding aspect. There's more grind here than at a Napalm Death concert. Everytime you upgraded your spaceship of choice (don't tell me they handle like airplanes) to gain a slight advance you continue to squash your frontal lobe into some kind of gooey mush while trying to repeatedly break the grind wall. So, what do you have gain from this practice? Well, you get slightly better equipment which you use to grind to get better planes which you use to grind to get better equipment for that plane and so forth. It's tedious but absorbing, I completely understand how people can rack up hundreds and thousands of hours in this game. The monotony is strangely addicting, it's like getting a drug habit and like with any serious addiction you're gonna take it as far as you can go. I cannot even judge the fans and addicts, I completely understand it, but for me in the end the tedium won. The progression is so slow and meaningless I cannot take it anymore. I also take issue with the flight model in war thunder.

"3083,War Thunder,2017.0,""I know I have not played War Thunder for too long, but I am experienced in gaming. War Thunder is honestly great at the surface, there is so very many little details to the vehicles and environment, and the dogfights can be absolutely gorgeous. The tanks and aircraft are so incredibly well modeled, and personally I find the shell penetration camera to be quite amazing. Watching tiny fragments explode and bounce around inside the tank's interior. As a simulator, it fares quite well, as tanks do not just explode into full speed, and turning requires skill in order to not lose speed. However, there is a but to all of this.I understand that this is a """"free to play"""" title, and as such they plant micro transactions to hell like usual. One thing I do like (i play world of tanks a lot as well) is that decals and customization, while limited, is permanent and you don't have to keep rebuying as you do in wot. The grind is not good in War Thunder. Actually, it is just terrible. Games such as War Thunder and World Of Tanks make getting to the next level of vehicles feel like a job, and the reward after hours and hours of gameplay is just not worth it.The matchmaking is poor, as you will often be fighting enemies you have no hope to defeat, and the ai comrades are not exactly the best.If I were Gaijin, I would scrap the whole free to play idea, because it makes this game and many others like it just a crappy and greedy cash grab. It is just my opinion, but I think that War Thunder would make for a great full price title, but more focused on a singleplayer than multiplayer, because as we all know online multiplayer is sometimes just the worst. A true PVE mode would be great, as well.I know these ideas are just that, and that Gaijin is just one of those companies that is more interested in the payment and income rather than making a genuinely deep and amazing video game.And because of that, I cannot reccomend War Thunder in the form that it exists right now.It is an amazing concept of land, sea, air direct control warfare buried beneath a freemium pay to win mess like so many other games."",0"

"3094,War Thunder,2016.0,""This game is pure for the company to get money from the players.I am a tanker in realistic simulator and arcade, and i don't fly anymore because stalium on planes.And since you're not getting much research points i get about 800 rp in realistic and 1200 rp in arcade.Simulator is a timed event so you cannot go in your favourite tank at any time in simulator (also counts for planes)They also got a bad system for  ranking tanks and planes with a 0.7 br difference possibility.So when you have a tiger 1 you face of with t-44's.The team is not realible because they all want kills to get rp and get the new vehicle, the tow hook for example is in game already a long time yet nobody knows about it, and the spawnrape is real expecially in realistic and simulator.A bad system for teamkillers how do i know i was about to shoot a enemy and clicked to shoot, bam teammates shows up behind a rock and i get kicked for that aciidental teamkill and all i get is a loss in lions and go to the main page where i just can go directly to a new battle.The post warâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥is real m8 you got vehicles that dident even existed in ww2 and mixing ww2 vehicles with post war ones doesent make it accurate at all.Not only that they also wanted to make a REALISTIC game with not REALISTIC armor on tanks and planes.and planes that never flew or left the designer table.Prices go always up and so do reserch points needed, and now im talking more about rp it takes me atleast a week or 2 to get  a new vehice with many hours spent.Alot of people will get frustated with all the above so they would pay to get to the high tiers for a free to play game.Dus people are leaving the game more and more making it emptyer and so they increase the br difference for fast games making unbalanced gamesThe only good thing is the lion gain and the graphics and the models and thats it."",0"

3096,War Thunder,2017.0,it a ok game if you have a team to play with mors of the youtub and strem {not patd and not be told what to say} hahahah if you just what to kill stud log in and go strat for the russia ( not op and need little  to no skill ) and dont for get to drop $40 on the  IS6. But look at the adds and History is a big part in that but what do i know IS6 only two was maed but not the one in game and dont get me start on the yak 9s they well cut a b29 to bits with one shot there a lot of bugs in the game that need to be sord if you are comeing from WoT cos that bad just go play COD cos game are not what there say there are today,0
"3097,War Thunder,2017.0,""I remember enjoying this game more, a couple years ago.  I don't know whether it's the rust, or if the game has really changed that much.  But, the game is fun, if you enjoy a more realistic tank experience.  This means that you don't have health, and that you can either be 1 shot (which, you will be.  Far more times than not) or you 1 shot other players.  The heavy tanks are slow to maneuver, while the lighter variants are more maneuverable and faster.  If you're more into an arcady style of gameplayer, with hp, then this game is not for you.  Don't think I'll be re-installing this game again."",0"
3098,War Thunder,2018.0,The game is fun for about 10 hours when you are messing around in low level tanks but then the balance and enjoyment goes out the window when you get to the next rank. The game starts matching you against opponents that you cannot damage and they disable or knock you out in one hit. So it is fun for a bit then it becomes not fun. Good thing it is free?,0
"3099,War Thunder,2018.0,""I played a lot off steam started back around when planes were in beta as the game has moved forward and new things pop up there is one thing that remains the same and that is a complete disregard for the community and balance, and in some cases Gaijin even in a subtle manner taunt the player base acknowledging the fact that the grind is unbearable as some countries and the entirety of the ground forces favor pay to not waste your time and it can be many hours (or days) for late game matches having no solution for players being killed in one shot because they donâ€™t have any way to repair or stop their tank form burning down while more upgraded tanks can resulting in you beating your head against a wall unless you are going to cheese the game mechanics or get good at sniping and waiting for half an hour for stuff to kill being soft capped even if you carry the team to victory although the invisible tanks problem still exists but is very hard to catch when it happens it does happen when fighting around rubble and there is a lot of it. planes has been neglected as they work on new stuff however it is more balanced than ground forces but you can cheese the game more and the devs encourage it often drawing out battles for little gain and donâ€™t even consider the naval battles they are a joke, aircraft are pointless and the game tries to mimic WOWS cqc battles with smaller ships but done worse killing same size ships is a hassle for little gain killing smaller ships is fun but for little gain and killing bigger ships require being sneaky but you are soft capped and will not get any further than you would have fighting same or similar sized ships for less fun and drags the team down and is unlikely to succeed. Just a quick thought on the game hoping this saves people time as getting in early means almost nothing unless you solely play this game spending all your free time as newer players get more boosts to get past the early pains that you will go through and collectable vehicles get brought back for sale or near impossible event tasks or you can spend 5-50-100 usd on something that may not be worth buying as you probably leave the game before getting that money back in play time however they are good at not revoking things you earned or bought so if the game becomes worth playing at some point it should still all be there assuming someone didnâ€™t hack your account then there is nothing you can do as their support is nonexistent/extremely useless.

"3102,War Thunder,2016.0,""Soooo.... I very rarely write reviews down to my raging dysleixia and the fact steam doesnt have spell check. I've been playing this game on and off since 2013 with mixed feelings. Is it pay to win? yes and no. I've bought a couple of premium planes to er...pay to win. Still get shot down as much. You dont need to spend money to play and enjoy they game, alltho if you want to play at top level and keep up with the metas etc etc, then you'll need to spend some money on premium or its an excessive grind. The one thing i would say that i like about the flawed premium system is that you can buy a day pass if your in the mood for a warthunder day/night.I've not played the game enuff to really give a full review and i cant be bothered either, sure some one has gone into detail far better then me. I would say its worth a try and you will enjoy it. Just be prepered if you get proper into it your ganna spend some money. Or grind it out like the rest of us.i play on a few differant set ups, from low graphics to movie. enjoyable in both settings. If any thing its easyier to see on low settings.One last thing for the most part the community at least in arcade isnt that toxic, not really a typing game so apart from the odd insult its pretty clean. "",1"
3103,War Thunder,2018.0,This is a heads up for returning players that are having problems with the 2 stage google authentication system this developer has set up.    What a nightmare I have had trying to get my account verified so i can bypass this system that is not working for me.  If you are an aged user of the game pre 2014 you will find it very interesting interacting with their support centre and the hoops they ask you to jump through.  It is a great game but unfortunately their support  is very ordinary and not user friendly at all.,0
3104,War Thunder,,was a good game at one point. it is mostly now a cash grab by the moneyhungry devs. if you want to play the game as a free to play it will take a very long time to unlock anything past tier 2 and 3-4-5 are imposible to unlock in a reasonable amount of time withought dropping money into it. now lets not forget the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ damage models of these planes. If you so much as breath on the wings they will break off. The control of the aircraft in arcade and realalistic areâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥poor infuriating at times. groundforrces are beond broken. Ships dont seem that badf but it feels to little and to late in my oppinion. So if you are looking for a realalistic and well developed combat flight go to Il-2. if you wanna goof of and â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ around for a couple hours and dont care much about progresion. its probably for you.,0
"3105,War Thunder,2017.0,""The amount of grinding that you need to do to unlock planes/tanks exponentially increases the more you play, to the point where it's impossible to unlock new vehicles without either pouring a huge amount of time or (as the devs clearly intend) money into the game. While fun to begin with, this grind really takes the enjoyment out of the game, so much so that I would strongly advise anyone reading this review to simply not bother and find a different game.The flight models are highly inaccurate, the matchmaking and tier system are appalling, and the devs appear to be highly incompetent and childish (to the point where they quit interacting with a popular website due to """"the users being mean in pointing out too many mistakes"""").I would not advise playing this unbalanced grind-fest. Hopefully a competent dev team creates a competing game in the future."",0"
"3106,War Thunder,2018.0,""The game as it is is pretty good. I would recommend it but unfortunately the publisher / dev is doing so much to prevent this game from being decent. Events are just tedious, mind numbing grinding. A recent event required you to do over 100 Games within 3 days to get a tank OR plane. or you could go ahead and buy it from their new market for 40 bucks. Ground Forces (tanks) is even more grinding than air forces. it will take you weeks until you have a solid line up in a nation. or you could just go ahead and buy exp with real money. The Ground Forces grind is even worse for modifications for each tank. For example: you have to research fire extinguishers. That can take a decent amount of games. especially not having fire extinguishers means that one hit can lit you up and it will burn down your tank. while you watch. being unable to do anything. or well, you could just go ahead and research mods like these for real money You have to train your crew. Not so bad for planes since you have only one crewmember for most fighters but in tanks you have up to 6 (?) crew members in tanks. You have to train every single one of them individually. or you spend some bucks on them. Air RB battles are unchanged since the game came out. They are unbalanced not fun and grinding sucks. You often come out with just as much SL (in game currency to buy stuff) as before since some planes have extremely high repair costs Their balancing methods are just bad. Instead of incrementally nerfing or buffing a tank every other week, they will completly nerf a tank down after months and will do nothing about said tank (or plane for that matter) for months again.  Naval forces have been in closed access (meaning you have to pay to play them) for over a year now In the steam screenshots you can see u-boats. There are no u-boats in the game. They only have been in the game for one day (april fools)The list goes on. That's just what I have in my mind right now. You can take a look at more posts like these:/r/warthunder General Rant/r/warthunder about Repair Costs/r/warthunder about their horrible PR/r/warthunder about Repair Costs II  "",0"
"3107,War Thunder,2018.0,""There is a lot to love in this game. It's been an outstanding time-waster for me over the last couple of years. Gaijin certainly has put forward one of the most comprehensive collections of military vehicles found on Land, Sea, or Air in modern gaming. Unless you're the most avid of archive diggers, there's bound to be a surprise in every tech tree and plenty of unique offerings. This is the game's greatest strength â€“ its diversity. I currently recommend against playing this game due to how that diversity is balanced. Gaijin has run that diversity out of existence at most Battle Ratings (BRs) by leaving vehicles at every bracket that dominate the applicable meta (air, ground, or sea). This has lead to death squads in virtually every matchmaker that can boast abnormally high WR/etc. While it is certainly possible to best these people in game, I don't feel that this is conducive to long term player engagement and it wholly undermines the game's greatest strengths.If you're looking at the game for the richness of vehicles and combat options it could offer you, I suggest passing on this one. You probably won't find what you're looking for."",0"
"3108,War Thunder,2018.0,""I have over 1k hours and I can very easily say this is not a game worth your time, it used to be quite fun but over the years Gaijin has killed it in favour of milking as much money as possible through making it Pay2Progress and it some BR ranges hilariously Pay2Win.If you want a fun air combat game just bite the bullet and spend 60$ for IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad."",0"
"3109,War Thunder,2018.0,""The good: game is marvelpiece from technical standpoint - beautiful graphics, good sound and all is well optimised. Tank and aircraft models are very detailed, there is considerable customisation as well. Plethora of vehicles, real and paper projects to toy with.The bad: balance isn't the best, with worst offender being top tiers, particularly jets. Aircraft gameplay resolves around destroying ground targets, so if you're up for fighter to fighter combat, you won't win many games. Tank gameplay is """"one shot"""" in nature, as often single penetrating shell is enough to kill crew and/or detonate ammo racks, which leads to rather campy gameplay. Arcade mode with its respawn is both boon and curse - if one team collapses, it inevitably leads to spawnkilling. Realistic is aquired taste, unfortunately driving/flying for few minutes only to die in boom isn't exactly my flavor.The ugly: grind. On positive, you can research entire tech tree using only one vehicle. In theory, in practice its unlikely to happen before heat death of universe. Player progress is deliberately slowed down by need to research and buy at least 6 vehicles of current tier before progressing, which doesn't stop less competent players from playing more advanced toys. Obtaining your oh so expected new toy, be it tank or plane is only the beginning - after all you've bought junk of a vehicle and you need to upgrade it and with tanks (and upcoming warships) its especially bad. You can't repair your tank and you can't extinguish fires without researched Spare Parts and Fire Ex. While on low level vehicles its matter of few battles to get these, on top tiers it can take well over 50 battles to get anything, with hundreds of battles needed to unlock all upgrades.P2W - while there are no premium vehicles that are straight up overpowered (at least I'm not aware of them), there are plenty of options to gain advantage with open wallet. First - instantly buying upgrades for vehicles, its not so much P2W as its sanity saviour, especially on high tier vehicles. Second - crew. For gold eagles you can level up crew considerably, especially in """"sensitive"""" aspects like vitality or reload speed. Third - increasing vehicle rooster. Free player can bring up to 5 vehicles into battle, paying player can bring 10. So should Arcade Air prove so hectic, paying player can in theory outlast non paying ones. Arcade Tanks are limited to 3 vehicles, so no issue there if one can prepare his/her lineups correctly.TL"
"3110,War Thunder,2018.0,""1 af all my eng its not the best in the world so forgive my grammar mistakes.to the game now.if you are starter you will see it all good in there grafics gameplay sounds and most of the players are very coaporate with you.the problems start when you reach level 8 and higher then you start battle with all the payers in the world force you to do the same if you want to survire in there.let me make my self clearest.if you are level 8 or 10 or after 500 hours level 20 and more.you will face players with level 60 80 or 100 and then the party start.there is nooooooooo with no way you can blow up some player in that rank no matter the nation or what kind of tank are you have or they have.i found my self shot plenty of times,boys with level 60 and up like i say i fired at them at least 30 shells.all kind of shells at every possible weak point the enemy tank have.and still no damage.in i matter of fact what damage????????? no damage at all.and if the enemy shout back on me!!!god help me if i find my pieces out there.one enemy shot is more than enough to blow you out.i ask about that some others players in there and out there.and most of them have some cheaps exsuses.that i am not use the right shell i dont shout at the right point and staff like that.i try to explain to them that i shout more than 30 times at every possible point.and i am not playing alone out there i have witness some friends of mine .and all the others try not to see it or undestand it.finish in this.my complains is huge.and no good gameplay or the thousants of payers in there cant hold me for reject this game for good.if you have money and want to be the best then that game is for you.if you want to try to play with your balls then avoid it like i plague.so black for me and i am not suffer to be i puppet out there.i want to play equal and fair with everybody else"",0"
"3111,War Thunder,2016.0,""I wrote a review of this game earlier, and I'm going to change it to Not Recommended because I'm finally fed up with the developers.WT has its good sides. It can be big fun. I can't recommend it, however, even though it's free, because, well, I'll just list the most glaring issues.â€¢ There is next to no teamwork, partly because the maps are so open and do little to """"herd"""" the players together. There also aren't really any out-of-bounds zones like in Battlefield. Also, you can't place orders, contact reports, etc. on the map like you can in Battlefield 2, or form your own squads to coordinate your other players. There is also next to no communication. There's not even VOIP.â€¢ Pacing is terrible. You can spend litterally minutes driving to the battlefield from across the map only to be sniped when you finally get there. Rinse and repeat. No forward spawn points like in Battlefield or Wargame.â€¢ Hackers. Server security is poor.â€¢ Devs release DLC after DLC, even temporary content for 1st of April, without fixing bugs and typos that have been there from the beginning. I cringe every time I see glaring mistakes like """"Player suffers damages of elevator"""".The glaring bugs are ridiculous, too. I've never played a game where you can spawn in before your map has finished loading, leading to crashing into invisible friendly tanks because their graphics haven't loaded yet. Or most of your friendly vehicles disappearing from the map while you're dead, making it harder to judge the situation and deciding where to respawn. I could go on.â€¢ DLCs are way too expensive. I get that free-to-play games have to make money somehow, but charging the price of a whole game for a single vehicle is just ridiculous.â€¢ DLC is pay-to-win.â€¢ Tech tree goes from pre-WWII tech to modern tech, which is awesome"
"3112,War Thunder,2018.0,""Do not play this game unless you like broken physics engines, money-hungry and lazy developers, horribly unbalanced matchmaking, delusions of superiority from the vocal minority about how it's """"realistic"""" and """"better than le WoT"""", being useless with a new vehicle unless you spend a lot of time grinding its modifications (or just paying to bypass this), and countless years-old bugs and inaccuracies that get ignored in favour of new (broken and unbalanced) vehicles that the wallet warriors crave."",0"
"3113,War Thunder,2017.0,""this game has fun gameplay and has awesome graphics, it may be unbalanced sometimes but when your the one that is overpowered its so much fun, its simple and easy to progress, tanks and planes can fight together, it can be a little frustrating sometimes but thats because of the expert players or you are having bad luck, i love this game and ill never get tired of it"",1"
"3114,War Thunder,2017.0,""A fun game on the whole but there are a number of issues with it--Server sinc issues-Payed tanks are over powered for their ranks-Map fatigue-Not all key functions are bound by default, meaning that some of the important keys that you will need are not bound from the start and you will have to explore to find them-Cramped UI-Random rewards are lack luster or outright uselessWith all of the negatives of the game it is actually really well supported by the developers with frequent updates, ever changing vehicles, and the ammount available only ever expands. The vehicles and mechanics are generally realistic, though some liberties have obviously been taken to make it more appealing but you will learn alot about mechanized warfare in the 21st century just by playing the game, and learning is always a good thing. For all of its faults, it really isnt a bad game.Final sumation: If you are looking for a game to mindlessly dump hours into, yell at and scream when you get knocked out in the first three minutes of a match, and grind XP late into the night because you want a new tank, then this is a game you would probaly enjoy.UPDATE: Since the recent update to Warthunder there is an issue with aircraft balance. Certain tank designs have either open tops, sides or are much less of a tank and more of an armored truck, are now overly suceptable to attacks by aircraft. There have been a great many times I have 'burned down' without taking any damage or having been in a fight. Yet, a player who was flying an aircraft was credited for the kill. In non simulator modes of the game this is an unfortunate development as it seems to effect the game in a negative way. It is not glorifying to have an aircraft slam into you for a kill, nor is it rewarding to kamakazi your aircraft as soon as you get it. The purpous of flying aircraft is now redundant since you inevitably resort to dive bombing the enemy in a half hearted attempt to get a kill, but on the whole are attempting to return to the fight."",1"
3115,War Thunder,2013.0,The best WW2 vehicle combat game you can get. Easy to play and understand and open to anyone. Wide variety of Historical aircraft to choose from and fly offering unparalleled flight combat and soon ground forces combat.

"3118,War Thunder,2018.0,""Please do not get me wrong, this game can be a lot of fun to play. I have problems with this game, the devs specifically. They do not listen to feedback or criticism, they try to milk every last dollar they can from players, and they have made bias a very prevelant part of this game. I am not going to say there is any form of """"Russian bias"""" because in reality there isn't any, but there is some major anti US bias in ground forces. The examples of this are scattered all throughout the gameplay but I will highlight a few of them like incorrectly modeled armor, removing spall shields (m60), incorrectly modeling ammunition used by Allied tanks, severly nerfing accuracy of stock US guns (historically inaccurate), terrible allied ammo spalling, inaccurate penetration values for US ammunition, not giving certain tanks the proper ammunition (t26e1 aphe), making commander cupola shots 1 hit tanks, sometimes penetration with US guns do no damage to crew even with direct hits, certain shells one hit US tanks if you shoot them in the engine without killing any crew or ammo, extinguishers do not always put out fires, random deaths for no reason, shots bouncing even with green indicators and protection analysis showing garuanteed penetration, ammunition severely underperforming when shooting armor sloped @60deg (russian armor), nerfing the only decent ammunition types that are availible for US guns or making them unaffordable, massively inflating any possible weakspot of US tanks in general, putting incorrect guns on tanks (L7 on abrams, this did happen with the m1 but at the same time they had models with 120mm that was not included to make the abrams yet again underperform against the way overpowered t64b), outrageous repair costs for tanks, insane amounts of rp to research new parts and tanks at high tiers, terrible stock ammunition with the only good rounds being availible at the end of the tech tree, and the list goes on. certain Russian Tanks are very overpowered ex: t-64, t-62, is-6, object 120, etc.. These all combine to make the US ground forces experience be a very expensive, severly underperforming, and extremely time consuming grind. To top that off devs won't fix any issues with US tanks, they add things like reactive armor to the already overpowered t-64, they also will ban you for speaking out against them and showcasing all the bias against the US tree with proof. Me and some friends have also had accounts just banned for no reason and were told tough luck by gajin. I really want to like this game, but I see how wrong gajin is doing players and I have decided not to play anymore, hopefully it will be better in the future. Until next time war thunder."",0"
"3119,War Thunder,2018.0,""The game itself can certainly be enjoyable at times, but 90% of your time will be taken up by the long and boring grind for vehicles and their modules, which most require to even function properly. This is only made worse by a Dev team that continues to completely ignore and then openly mock the playerbase whenever they raise legitimate concerns. Italian tanks were teased months ago and still we have nothing, World War Mode is probably never coming, development on Naval Forces is at a minimum and Air Battles have seen no meaningful development in years. On top of all this, almost all new content is top-tier tanks for the already crowded German, Soviet and American trees whilst the smaller British, French and Japanese trees get nothing. The Devs don't care about the players or the game, they just want to squeeze as much money out of you as they can before the game dies.EDIT: Thanks to the recent controversies Gaijin have finally started to implement 1 or 2 positive changes, so there is a dim light at the end of the tunnel."",0"
"3120,War Thunder,2018.0,""I've been playing this game since early 2013. I love this game, but I do not like the predatory business model Gaijin is continually shifting towards. Gaijin has always done â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ things, but the ammount of money squeezing has ramped up more and more lately. A company openly mocking it's customers for complaining about such things isn't something that should be tolerated. I think I'm done with this game until some major changes come through with the monetization/progression system as well as Gaijin's attitude towards the community."",0"
"3121,War Thunder,2018.0,""The base gameplay is very fun, if maybe a bit monotonous. Great shooting mechanics and the fact you need to think about where and when you hit somebody adds a lot in my opinionExample: You're in a weaker light tank facing a heavy armoured tank who just spotted you, You could go for the body shot, that will likely bounce / deal insignificant damage. On the other hand, you could try to take out his turret by killing the gunner. He won't die, but he will not be able to return fire for a while.Now this works great on some tanks and not at all at others.There's also amazing detail in the different tanks (stats, visuals and general feel)Now... the the reason I will never recommend this game in it's current state is:after around tier 4-5 you'll hit a brick wall in terms of progression, it'll easiely take you 40 hours to unlock the next tank and you'll need several tanks in the same tier to continue progressing.The premium is one option, even then it's a long long grind.You'll also feel another limitation in terms of """"Silver Lions"""" (ingame currency) not only will you need 40 hours for exp unlock, you'll also need to grind as many if not more, to unlock a tank / it's upgrades.And if you think that's fair okay then, just hope you don't get damaged and have to repair, that'll set you back a few thousand Silver Lions. (you can actually lose currency from a match, if you repair enough)And last nail in the coffin: Lot of the premium tanks (real money) are often WAY stronger than the free equivalent, leaving you with a sour taste in your mouth when getting repeatedly killed by them, even when you get the first hit.Terms of balance: It's really bad mid-tear... but supposedly it gets better at end-game (Never got there)"",0"

"3125,War Thunder,2018.0,""First few tiers are fun, but the game has so many balance issues it's not even funny. On top of that there are so many horrible design decisions that despite playing to many hours I can only recommend you stay away. It's a bit of a drug, but I still wouldn't recommend you do cocaine..."",0"
"3126,War Thunder,2018.0,""Indeed, even though I've got almost a 1000 hours logged (not even including the many hours playing this outside steam before it officially launched), I can't recommend War Thunder. Reason: the grind. It's horrible. It takes hundreds of hours to unlock higher tier tanks and planes, forcing you to grind or pull your wallet. The graphics are great, the gameplay is great (except for terrible balance issues) and it will hook you, but it would be better to avoid being hooked. A terrible waste of time. If the grind in the higher tiers was comparable to tiers 1/2 it would be a great game. But of course, that would mean many players will reach endgame, unlocking everything there is to unlock and potentially losing interest. Great for players, bad for Gaijin as every customer is a potential virtual opium addict, milkable of cash.It takes 1000s of dollars to unlock everything. A premium account only helps on lower tiers, you still have to grind xx-xxx hours on the highest tiers and that's the problem. Freemium isn't free. I'm all for forcing 'free to play users' to grind, but those that spend money on a premium account should notice a huge difference and that's clearly not the case. Spending 60 USD on a premium account + 1 vehicle unclock is but the tip of the tip of the iceberg. So even if you pay, it won't make a difference on higher tiers. The reaility is that it takes months, or weeks at 40+ hours a week using a premium account. That's just ridicilous. Got millions of convertable xp? Use it to progress faster! But pay 50 USD on top of that to be allowed to actually use it.There simply shouldn't be such a grind for paying users. Spending around 60 USD should give you a lot more bang for bucks. Paying 100 USD for a tank takes the fun away. Gaijin can do whatever they want, it's free, but the implementation is offensive to loyal, paying users. I'd happily spent my money on premium, but the difference is so small that I don't do so anymore.Every game, even those that hold a pricetag, should have a certain amount of grinding. The difference between free and premium progression is just too small to justify the price it takes to progress."",0"
"3127,War Thunder,2018.0,""This game is pretty decent, until you reach the """"cool"""" and fun high-tier vehicles.If you love grinding and wasting money, this is the game for you. It takes a really long time unlocking new vehicles at the top tiers, and don't be surprised if you're losing Silver Lions (in-game currency, SL for short) while doing so. The research and money rewards are just way too low. Add to that the fact that you have to upgrade modules of each vehicle, and some of those modules are essential for even playing the game, and not having the upgrades is known as the stock syndrome. There's been a lot controversy lately regarding those module upgrades, since the Spare Parts and Fire Protection Equipment (FPE) modules have to be researched, and researching them on top tier tanks may take 30 games each, while also losing SL. Tanks are virtually useless without these upgrades, if you're hit, you're out. Not having other modules such as ammo types and engine upgrades can be compensated by having skill (aiming for weakspots, driving more cautiously), the lack of Spare Parts and FPE cannot. (The introducation of huge maps make it so that it's hard to know where the enemies are so you can get shot from anywhere.) Thus many players spend real money on Golden Eagles (GE, in-game currency) to get these modules and to regain the lost SL, or they simply quit the game out of frustation.Until they fix the research and SL gains/requirements and remove/change the Parts and FPE system, don't get into this game.Here are some videos and forum threads if you want to know more about the controversy:https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/9jdrog/rwarthunder_fpeparts_megathread/https://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/427247-the-great-fpeparts-discussion-thread/&https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4yr59jm2WQhttps://youtu.be/Z_YZ8An-A5ohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EQlvd-RANI (Controversial video from the devs)"",0"

"3132,War Thunder,2014.0,""I have a love/hate relationship with this game. Although, it is free! ... -ish.Being an old Starfox veteran, I got on well with the arcadey action in the early game, out-manoeuvring enemies and chopping their wings off with the target-leading system. Each nation has a different set of planes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, although these don't matter too much at this early stage. Needless to say, the bi-plane stage was great fun.Then, gradually, I progressed into the mid-war era of aircraft. This was fun, too, for a while. But then I started to notice a change in the play style of my team mates and my opponents. Instead of rolling away from each other to engage in a dogfight, my opponents would just fly straight towards my plane guns-blazing, then plough straight through me like a battering ram, killing both of us with no points scored either side. Get used to these head-on collisions. They happen a lot. And not just with enemies. Sometimes, you'll be chasing a plane, only to find that a cloud of friendly players has formed around you, fixated on the same target, trying to nab the kill before you do. Because of this tunnel-vision, eventually a team-mate will collide with you, then call you a 'F**KING RAMMER N00B' for your trouble. Lovely.My main problem with this outcome is that there is very little penalty to prevent it on either side. So the conflict just develops into a war of attrition - to see which side has bought the most planes to aimlessly throw into the meat-grinder.Alternatively, you'll get locked in a dogfight with a superior plane (usually a spitfire, with its better turning circle) and no friends will be around to get it off your tail, because 10 of them will be chasing 1 bomber ... and crashing into each other ... and yelling expletives in the chat box.I get the impression that the game wants me to spend money to buy super upgrades for my planes to make them pointlessly unbeatable, like in World of Tanks, or create a squadron of other people who enjoy getting rammed by their team mates. However, my reviewing system is based off the capacity enjoy a game even if you're a friendless hobo. So, if you're looking for some quick arcade dogfighting action, this game is one for you. However, if you're a fan of aviation looking for a dedicated team-based stress buster, you'll find this game utterly infuriating.They will eventually add tanks and ships into the mix, but until then, I'm not convinced.Sorry, Warthunder. You only get 4/10 golden badger eggs. :("",0"

Oh boy the grind. It's awful at higher tiers and Gaijin will make you research a vehicle that should be a variant and in the same research node, meaning you don't have to research it. But instead you get stuck with having to research 75,000 extra skill points or worse depending on vehicle. And if a vehicle gets added before one you have already started researching? Then you have to research the new vehicle too. Which is very annoying. This would be much more bearable though if the game was balanced.EDIT 2: The removal of the RP cap and changes to Parts, FPE, and repairs in battle has certainly helped, but it's still not good enough.PS: Most of my time is in Arcade Battles.

The deeper you get into this game the more and more biased it gets.Some really biased and game ruining hard facts:- Fire on Russian planes extinguishes like 95% of the time, it burns a while keeps flying and then viola fire is out magically *Russian magik fire extinguisher*. All other nations just burn down 95% of the time...- Hit russian tanks into ammo rack or fuel often nothing happens... nothing! hit other nations on same place, instakill!!- Kill the commander on a german tank, even if gunner still lives the tank will not be able to shoot at you anymore. Kill a russian commander.... nothing tank can fire normally.- Kill German gunner while reloading, gunner is replaced and reloading starts from anew. Kill Russian gunner during reload, reloading continues from the point where it was before the gunner died :)- Russian IT1 missile has an obvious bug and can fly trough solid buildings and walls wich you can't penetrate with tank shells or any other missile carriers. It's been reported months ago, still no fix and I don't think it ever will be...- Gunners on Bombers lol, British, German and Jap gunners on full level are fairly useless. They hardly hit planes chasing you on 300m.Russian gunners are of course all pro snipers, hitting planes on 1km and taking them down rather easily. Not sure how many kills I made on Russian Bombers, but it's an ridiculous amount. I'd be really curious to see stats about that...US Bombers are soso, due to immense turret numbers they may hit sometimes too and take chsing planes down. But just sometimes.- General game mechanic problem, the better you play (currently 87% avg position here) the more you get uptiered.

"3148,War Thunder,2014.0,""This is my 1.37 review.http://i.gyazo.com/cc8c867e167736659a21271ae1160e5f.pngThis is the 1.39 review.http://i.gyazo.com/5b835eaacc8e4ac4d9a5eebd0429d5d9.pngThis is the patch 1.41 review. I've spent enough time to get an idea of the new additions and new mechanics that were introduced with this patch and I'll highlight them below. First thing to note is that Patch 1.41 is not as big of a patch as 1.37 and 1.39 were. In fact it was released under a month that 1.39 was out. I'll highlight the changes below.The biggest addition of patch 1.41 was the introduction of Ground Forces into the open beta phase for everybody. While this had a lot of hype built up and player numbers rose even breaking 100k the beta only introduced two countries, Germany and Russia. These countries don't even have fully fleshed out trees which I can understand but it makes me wonder when the other nations will get their Tank trees AND have them fully fleshed out. The gameplay of Tanks is rather interesting. You have a tank, you play on different sections of familar maps given the task of eliminating other tanks, capturing objectives or defending points. Tanks is excellent with the detail that Gaijin have placed into the game. Like planes every part of a tank reacts differently to how it will perform when hit. Your ammo can cook off or your tracks can get off. You do get the option to repair mid battle which is risky but useful. Something that is annoying however is the constant artillrry spam that all players do. Some realism aspects like armor thickness and certain shells not being able to penetrate is a great addition but doesn't bode well in the term of balance. Some reserve tanks are not competitive against even Tier 2 tanks as their shells can not pierce the armour. This is ignoring some tanks which are just unspeakably broken (KV-1).For the planes we had a few additions. Germany received two new Me-262 Jets, one placed on the way to the German Sabre, and other with a 50mm cannon placed in a separate destroyer line (the Me410 with the 50mm cannons). The British received more Spitfires bringing their total in the entire tech tree to 13. The Americans received two B25 variants, one with a 75mm cannon and the other with an impressive 12 .50 cal mg's. The Russians get a Mig with cannons with a BR that guarantees low tier clubbing and the crazy brother of the I-185. The M71 Etalon.The Japanese received a cockpit for the Ki45 line. (yes, just cockpits).These aren't the only changes, there were a massive amount of BR changes and these truly go to show how much Gaijin don't pay attention. Russian and American BR's went down while Germany and Japan skyrocketed. The high tier Japanese props have a higher BR than the Yak 15 and Yak 17 Jet. Granted those Jets are awful but that doesn't fare well for the fractured Japanese community. The Me-163 jumped back up into Mig and Sabre games after the amount of crying on the forums may have deafened Gaijin while the Mig 15 and Bis for Russia went down, the cannon Sabre went down whilst the German variants remain at 8.7. The msot controversial change was the P63 going from a 5.3 to a 4.0 Seal clubbing has never been so obvious. It leads to games all over the place. There is no balance, just pilot skill used to base the BR's which is a terrible decision as countries with large player bases have lots of data whilst countries with smaller playerbases have less data. It is why Japan are soaring high. Tier 2 A6M2 against Tier 4 La7 and P51? Clearly working as intended.It's hard to give an honest opinion about what I think about this patch. Some areas could really do with a fix. Japan could do with more content. The BR system needs to be on PLANE PERFORMANCE and not player performance to ensure more balance and the Tank mechanics really give more tuning. I'll recommend the game for the addition of Ground Forces but I will not recommend Patch 1.41."",1"
3149,War Thunder,2018.0,After my play time on this game i cant recommend it unless you are ready for big grind i stoped playing because a few thing first was the not so working APDS (Armored piercing discarting sabot) this is basically nedle shot at hight velocity created to penetrate sloped armor after penetration the pressure killed everything inside in war thunder you need to be precise as surgeon and hope in RNG that the enemy ammo that you hit directly explodes (90% of time that does not happen) and if that happens you die in one hit to ammo for explosive ammo. Second Gajins buffing / nerfing ammo where some tanks (mainly russian) get its penetration boosted other tank (mainly alied) get their nerfed (Challengers 2 ammo L23 in war thunder has 10m/415mm and 2000m/385 in real life it shoud have been 10m/480mm and 2000m/435mm). Thirth: the prices for repair of some vehicles are crazy i pay 20k for propeller plane and for jet only 7k. Forth is the crazy grind where you need to play crazy amout of battles to unlock later tier vehicles for some even about 4000 battles unlock single vehicle (counting that you win most of the battles) after the year i have played this game it coud be seen the progress becoming slower and slower.Edit: Remember the most people play tanks battle on ultra low find on google: war thunder low graphics exploit.,0

I could do that, and I was going to, but then I thought why should I? It is not as though any of that is going to somehow prove my opinion that the game is """"no longer fun"""" more or less valid."",0"

"3153,War Thunder,2013.0,""I Love this game but they have screwed it up so much it aint funny. DO NOT spend a dime on it untill it comes out of beata. Changed the whole tiering system so now Me262 fight MIG 15 all the time, no German 109 does not over heat, Russian plaes that were made in 1948 are in the same tier as USA, BRIT, JAPAN, 1943 year of ranking and I could go on. Game had all the hope you could possibly want. Finally a game that can burry that horrible thing called World Of Tanks. But, nahh, they went from a good company to ripping off the customer. Planes you buy get nerfed ( w/real money ) they nerfed the whole pay out system and made it almost impossible to play. ANd yes I have premium. A year of it to be honest. I never end up with more deaths then kills every match. Yet I make Jack crap in RP. You make less in which was once called historical battle because you use to fight nation VS natnion but now they call it real battles or some BS. Play it but don't spend a dime on it, Their Russians, and act like it. Bias to the hilt. Stalin was GOD, USA and all EU players are treated like garbage. So bad, that if you buy gold, its the same. No conversion between Dollars, pounds, and the Euro. But if your in mother Russia they do the conversion on that pathetic money of theires. The Rubble."",0"

Gaijin (based on my view) has no intention of making a game for the gamers, of making a game that someone wouldnt hate after 10 minutes. 1.53 officially killed it, once i saw how much was behind a paywall i knew that the game had reached the point of no return."",0"
"3156,War Thunder,2015.0,""My favorite free to play game! I currently have 220 hours in and I havenâ€™t spent a cent on it! Yes it does take some time to get more advanced planes but if you can be patient about it you can still unlock them without purchasing anything. The graphics are amazing, and the gameplay is intense! You could get into firefights that could last up many minutes. Thereâ€™s no reason for you not to try this game out! It is also extremely optimized so you can play this game on a less-powerful rig."",1"

This may as well be an MMO, where you go off and get 15 bear arses to level up for quests where you get to go and get 15 duck bills. Its such a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing grind quest, so unstimulating to the point where you just give up because the amount of time burned doesnt nearly stack up to the amount of goods gotten (this usually happens 3/4 of the way through tier 2). Its now just a Pay to Win, in its simplest form. You either pay up and get yo goods or you go out and play 345 games to get a new aircraft -.-."",0"

Greed ruins everything.So when I last played this game, it was a fun as heck F2P WWII dogfighter game with an excellent matchmaking system, was not p2w, and was well optimized with great graphics! But then I heard what they did to the game, and died a little. They """"REVAMPED"""" the matchmaking by decreasing the amount of teirs that are sorted by your level, skill, and plane that helps to keep the powerful planes with people of their strength. This lead to said powerful planes (witch consits of paid planes too) to leak into the less powerful planes matches, and causing the less powerful planes to not have a plesent experiance. After hearing that and reading a few of the other reviews which gives a much better and more recent review, I am not happy. This game used to be great, but then they ruined it.TL"
"3161,War Thunder,2014.0,""The game was fun to play, now its horrible.Constant one hits in both aircraft and tanks, tanks especially make this game so keyboard smashingly frustrating I have decided to quit playing.  The balance of nearly every game you play is WAY off.  In aircraft arcade mode nearly every fight is dominated by jets and other aircraft with seemingly impossible aircraft physics.   In tanks you are cruising out looking for prey then suddenly you explode from and exploding ammo load or your crew is rendered unconscious!  So you spend money to get extra crew training points and to upgrade to ace crew and it makes little difference.There is nothing in the game to encourage team play, I play this with a few friends and its impossible to actually play with them.  Another player here refered to it as a complete free for all, he/she is 100% right.Hit aim indicators are pretty much useless, especially in tanks.  You get a green armor penetration marker, you fire a shot knowing that the round should land on a vulnerable location then all you get is """"no damage"""" or a complete miss.  Drving a bigâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥tank through the woods you clip a tree then your tank track breaks -.-  are they made from used condoms and tissue paper?  Vehicle models for ground forces are absolutly nuts.  Russian vehicles are OP, game developer is russian, nuff said.Historically the game is way off, if you spend the time and do your research on vehicles you will see what I am talking about.  Now look at both positive and negative reviews!  Positive reviews are for the vast majority from people with very little playtime and only a few sentences long.  Negative reviews from players with HUGE play time and the majority of them are quit long and descript.  I have spent a long time reading the negative reviews, I agree with them all.  1.37 destroyed the game in favor of capitalism.  1.39 did little to rectify anything.Moderators and support in general is TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE, I actually got chastised by support staff in my last two tickets even though they where acurrate, polite and somewhat complimentary!  The support staff for this game need public execution and mature experienced support persons to take the reigns.Short of it is:  The game is terrible, when you have a problem expect little in the way of help, once you get into a teir 3 vehicle you will just getâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥over and over making progression nearly impossible.

The models in the game are amazing looking as is the customization. The game is massively frustrating as many people (not just I) go round after round of being killed to never achieve anything. I once played 10 rounds in a row of just being slaughtered, no kills, no captures. Being sniped from accrosed the map in Tier 2-3 games before I could even do anything. I want so hard to like and enjoy this game and it instead makes me want to throw my monitor acrossed the room. To counter point, I have had rounds with many kills and capturess, they're just few and far between. Having played most FPS' since the early 90's, I'm experienced enough to know when a game just isn't worth playing. Sorry War Thunder, I'm done with you."",0"

The game itself is rather fun, maybe a 7/10 game with room for improvement on the few games that all players are doing the usual dogfights and bombing runs, but every now and then you will run into a clan who has the exact spawn locations marked, and they will B line straight to it, and for the next 5 minutes your team will absolutely not be able to get a plane out. The spawn camping in this game is entirely game has completely destroyed it.

"3165,War Thunder,2014.0,""=Old Review, 2014=  Great primarily WWII era military game. with Aviation, ground units, and eventually naval units as well. Overall fun to play.=New Review, 2016=  All I play at this game's current state is Jets.  Not because jets are better, or more balanced.  That's a total joke.  I can't really think of any plane or tank that has its real life performance accurately portrayed in the game.  Then again, I only play jets.   Jets as in a general term.  I own pretty much the entire US and German air tree, some Russian, and British jets as well.  So I fly F-86/CL-13 Sabres.  Which, are underperforming in regards to their flight models.  Germany also has a GDR MiG-15bis, that does not perform as well as its Russian tree counterpart, the MiG-15bis.  Some could argue that it's Russian bias in a way, as nearly every game I play, Allied pilots scream about MiGs being a 'point and click adventure' and being overpowered.  This is also not true.  Recently the N-37, the 37mm cannon that the MiGs carry ingame, recieved a nerf.  They 'spark' on almost every shot, and fire at a lower velocity compared to its, still relatively slow, previous version.  Getting kills with MiGs actually takes some skill to use, and if the children that only fly F-86 played with MiGs, they'd cry that Sabres are overpowered.   Nothing in this game is truly balanced, and there's doubt that it ever will be.  I have been around since 2013, and logged about a total of 4000 hours ingame (played it before it was on steam), and every plane and tank has seen changes over the years. And will continue seeing changes.  Yes, there is a real Russian bias.  You can see this on the forums if you dare to go there, or just ask any player.  But even Russian vehicles aren't IMMEDIATELY overpowered, just because they are Russian.(well, maybe in tanks. Russians club anything atm that isnt British, but that's just because as of this post, British tanks are still in CBT, so the only people playing them PAYED to play them, including myself)I still recommend this game, because it can still be enjoyable, if you overlook all the broken aspects.  But flying props is cancer, and jets are completely broken.Here's to hoping 2016 will help fix many aspects of this once glorious game"",1"

The best part is when you get the vehicle, have fun trying to break even when you get one or maybe two kills per game. It gets worst when you get into games 6.7 and up.Yet, for real-world money, you can get a premium account (For XX amount of time) and golden eagles! With premium, you can join a game, die, and still make loins with RP. Donâ€™t want to put the time or work in, just buy golden eagles then.

"3184,War Thunder,2017.0,""I started to play War Thunder around october 2016 amd it has several problems wich are not addressed at allSpawnkilling is a huge problem. In the beginning there was no protection at all, you could find enemies beside you or even behind you when you spawned and you have just 20s of invincibility (unless you move forward, then your invincibility is gone).Later the devs tried to fix the issue putting a red stripe along the spawns, when you go inside this red zone you have 30s to exit or otherwise you blew up.But after a few minor patch reduced these red zones to a little circle around the spawn, so you can get spawnkilled again from BEHIND. Maps design doesn't protect you from spawnkill, because in most of the maps your spawn is a in basin.In every match you will find players trying to go to spawnkill instead of trying to capture the objectives. Spawnkill is ongoing since i started playing and Gaijin has failed to address this issue.The community will defend this pratice claiming that it's fair and you should avoid playing when spawnkilling happens and will try to derail thread about people complaining about this problem.Ground battles have a problem with planes spam, you'll get constantly bombed and strafed by low skill players. I'm saying low skill because these are the kind of people who will try to strafe SPAA (self propelled anti aircraft) and there's no skill in dropping a 500/1000 kg bomb on a ground target moving at 20km/h or standing still.You play this so called """"ground battle"""" to see 6 or 7 planes blasting your team with no way to fight back. SPAA are difficult to use especially in RB. In AB is even worse because you can spawn a plane just by making points, then crash on a open tank killing it, without paying repair cost.Bugs in the physic: Shells bouncing on flat surfaces even at close distance or simply not penetrating when they should, buggy hitboxes of the scenery.Sloppy behavior from developers and their community staff, it took them 6 weeks to fix a broken tank and when i complained about it, i was told that it was just a """"minor graphic bug"""" from a steam moderator.Pay to play: every vehicle has a repair cost, plus you'll pay the non-stock ammo. In the beginning the repair cost are low so you won't notice but after you pass BR 5.7 you'll find that the rewards from the battles are the same you get at 3.3 while the repair cost and the ammo cost skyrocket.Without a premium account you simply can't play from 6.3 onward, otherwise you'll get in negative even if you win the match. Just check the repair cost of 6.7/7.0 UK tanks, unless you play a perfect match you'll go in negative, but if you are lucky you can get some reward like 3000 SL.Pay to win: just buy certain premium tanks and your win rate will skyrocket (you can check the win rate of every vehicle here[www.thunderskill.com]). For example, the german t34 have a win rate of 72% while all the other t34 with the 76mm have a win rate less than 50%. Same with the german kv1, kv2 and chuchill.There are several unbalanced premium vehicles at the wrong BR, like the t44-122 at 6.3, while the t44-100 (non premium) is 7.0. Certain premium tanks are somehow invulnerable like the KV220 at 5.7.Now they added a marketplace where you can buy premium camouflage made by other users, so you can hide better just by paying more.Unbalanced matchmaking: no separation between ww2 and cold war in ground forces. It's not acceptable that you have to fight cold war tanks with your ww2 tanks. There's the possibility to have a mixed fight with jets and non-jets, it happened during ww2, but this is a game and it's unbalanced.Too much paper vehicles (projects that were never built) and prototypes, how can you balance a vehicle that never existed or existed in the form of a prototype?Modern tanks like the abrams, the challenger and the 64 wich are still classified, how can you balance a tank with a classified armour?Maps design is terrible, why would someone think that it's a good idea being killed when you just get out from the spawn?Spawns are often in a basin or simply without covers, so enemies have the upper ground while they spawnkill.Maps rotations is broken too, you get to repeat always the same few maps, it's so boring repeating abandoned factory, eastern europe or poland 4 times in a row. Why is so hard to fix?The new graphic engine allows a wide range of weather effects, but you'll only play sunny day with maybe some mist. Night map are even rarerNo change in battle modesTanks have always the same three battle modes: domination, conquest and battle. For the 1.71 they added a new mode called break, it wasn't so good, but it could be developed in something better. Now insted with the 1.77 they simply remove this mode.Planes have seen no change at all in the battle mode, especially in RB where the only mode you play is a semi-deatmatch with always the same 4/5 maps repeating, infact air RB is dying in favor of the plane spam in ground RB, because air RB is simply boring.Too much grind without a premium account: you can see the trailers with modern tanks and jets, but to reach them you need to start from interwar tanks and planes. Without a premium account it will take 2 or 3 years of costantly playing everyday.Do you want to gain enough money to buy your 9.0 tank? You need to play for weeks at 3.3.You need to research and buy even the most basic components for your tank. A stock tank doesn't have repair kits and extinguishers, so don't get hit until your research that repair kits and FPE.Poor comunication from Gaijin: most of the changelog are """"Client stability has been improved."""", sometimes they add some bugfix. Nerf and buff are written only in major release and not every of them. Poor explanations of new features, people still keep asking, after months of its launch, how the """"new"""" warbond shop works because it isn't properly explained anywhere. Now they launched the marketplace without even announcing it!Poor integration with steam, what's the point of the steam login if you can't log in the forum, marketplace, shop and other relaed service?Reminder that you cannot change your email to avoid the sale of the accounts (like it's difficult to create an email and sell the email account along the war thunder account), but you can create as many fake accounts with temporary email to farm GE (wich is against the rules, but Gaijin doesn't enforce that rule).Marketplace is a new way to milk the players. It adds microtransactions, lootboxes and a new currency called gaijin coins (GJN). Basically is a rip off of the steam market. It allows players to sell skins, decals they made, they get the 30% of the price in GJN, wich naturally can only be spent in the marketplace.You can even buy a p2w tank like the kv220 (btw it's already sold out).No explainations on if and how you can convert GJN in GE or viceversa. 1GJN = 1$, so have fun if the currency of your country is worthless compared to american dollars and euros.Worse than everything, the game allows cheating, you can lower your graphic settings to the infamous ultra low quality, so you can see better through vegetations without being bothered by sunlight, lens flare and other fancy things. You can remove the grass from your aim sight regardless your graphic settings and you can disable the sound of the engine of your tanks so you can hear the enemy better.I would'nt mind if this kind of things are allowed in AB, because you can see the enemy regardless, but in RB and SB ruin everything. If you have to play like this RB/SB are not for you, or simply choose a game that your hardware support.Night map? No problem just change the night in day from postFX settings!Too much smoke? Just lower the particle density!There isn't even a proper anti-cheat, you can only report the suspected cheater."",0"
"3185,War Thunder,2015.0,""This game is fun.  I didn't play it for a long time due to all of the negative reviews.  I popped on one Saturday when I was bored and got instantly hooked.  I love WWII era aircraft and this game has alot to offer in that area.  You earn research and in game currency by completing missions  against other players on fairly large game maps.  As you progress you unlock better planes and harder maps.  Each aircraft has modifications and such that you can unlock using research and in game currency as well.I haven't had any problems with any of the admins yet (although I admit that I don't speak in game much),  Unlocking planes can be tedious in the higher tiers but I am still having fun.  If there was nothing to unlock I would probably not play the game as much as I do.  Each plane must be flown for a while to figure out what it is capable of.  If you are impatient I can see how you would lose it with some of the planes that are harder to master.  They can seem useless until you use them the way they were intended to be used and in the right level of play.Getting people to actually pay attention to the objectives can be difficult at times and can lead to frustration.  However, when you get in a match with even just a couple of team players on your side it can be a wonderful heroic type experience. The scoring in the game definitely DOES NOT reflect the effort put into actually pulling off a win.  For instance I can do a bombing run that is successfull and destroy all of the enemy bases as well as several ground targets and end up next to last place.  When the ranked scoring comes up at the end of a match the guy who gets the most points is the guy who has the most air kills most of the time.  This often leads to people ignoring the objectives and racking up a huge score buzzing around in the middle of the map dogfighting.  Meanwhile the people actually defendiing assets and destroying the enemy objectives are left to do the work and getting a much lesser score.  I admit, sometimes when I need just a bit more research I will ignore the objectives and use my best planes to get a huge sick score downing planes in the middle with the rest of the monkeys, so I really can't complain too much.  The folks doing that are probably just doing the same thing.If you are going to invest in Gold Eagles (real money currency) then i recommend that you buy the packs and such when they are on sale.  I also highly suggest that you use them to buy more crews.  I run seven crews for each country.  That is about the max you will ever need.The tanks are fun too but I play almost exclusively airplanes.  When I get more involved in the tanks I will update this review.  The little bit I have played tanks was really fun.Lastly, if you are not comfortable with death around every corner and players that are better than you than I wouldn't bother to install this game.  There are alot of people that are really good at this game and you will die alot.*************I bought a pack that I already owned just for the golden eagles since it was cheap.  When I redeemed it it gave me nothing.  I opened a TICKET and after an hour or so I got a response.  The CSR was very nice and understood English.  I asked if I could have the code back so I could give to a friend.  He said sure and sent me the code back as unredeemed.  I gave to my buddy and all was well.  Only reason I am posting this is that I see some folks complaining about how the customer service stinks.  I didn't have a problem with my TICKET.*************A long time has passed and I still love this game.   I still exclusively fly airplanes."",1"

"3189,War Thunder,2014.0,""War Thunder is by far the leader in flight simulators out there. Despite being free to play, War Thunder has perfected graphical detail with painstakingly modelled aircraft (and now tanks) to create the ultimate world war two aerial and ground battle experience. The user interface is intuitive allowing for the use of just mouse and keys to control an aircraft or tank however the option of a joystick is there for more experienced players. As well as the focus on multiplayer battles, Gaiijin have also credited the game with a series of single player missions that help earn credits in game. Whilst the War Thunder economy has seen rapid change over the last 5-6 patches, it has finally been levelled out to create a gradual but still progressive and entertaining progression system that allows for a long but rewarding levelling system. One area that lacks the polish that is seen in other areas of the game is the cooperative multiplayer as this aspect of the game sees a confusing 'friending' and 'squad' system that not only is clunky to use but also reduces frame rate substantially and this is a game killer for players that use less powerful pcs or laptops. Conclusively, War Thunder presents itself as a highly successful game with superb graphics, gameplay, rewards and a growing player base. As well as the addition of constantly updated features do to its open beta status. I highly recommend this game 9/10."",1"

"3194,War Thunder,2013.0,""DO NOT BUY, DO NOT TRY.  I spent almost $300 on this game thus far and the developers have cynically and deliberately ruined the experience for paying customers and made it even worse for non-paying ones.After a fair experience in previous patches, which while they had their ups and downs, the pricing system was equitable and a player would get a fair reward for his time (if free-to-play) or his money, the latest patch has completely ruined the experience.First and foremost is the greed of the developers, evident in the pricing structure.  The latest patch promised easier research of individual lines of aircraft, as opposed to unlocking whole tiers at a time.  That's out the window.  Starting halfway through tier 3, any individual aircraft takes longer to unlock than one of the old tiers would.  The developers think to disguise this by changing the tier system from 20 levels to 5.  Moreover, the rewards for having a premium account or for spending in-game money have been severely reduced, as well.  Given my $270 investment into the game thus far, I am not amused by this blatant attempt at ripping people off.I came into War Thunder hoping that the developers would learn from World of Tanks and not drive their fanbase away with increasingly absurd timesinks and financial costs.  Patch 1.35 was a great experience and patch 1.37 is worse than anything I went through in World of Tanks.As far as gameplay, the gameplay developments in 1.37 are also generally decidedly negative.  Whether it's the selective application of flight model realism, like overheating and compression, to some aircraft but not others (essentially nerfing most German and many British aircraft), or ridiculous changes like increasing the starting altitude of all aircraft in the Arcade Battles difficulty (where you get to respawn). which basically permits people who just died to come in with a significant speed or altitude advantage... the developers clearly don't know what they're doing.  Worse, they often hide behind the """"working as intended"""" line for weeks, until they suddenly fix an issue and pretend it never happened."",0"

"3197,War Thunder,2015.0,""War Thunder is considered to be one of the most realistic flight and tank game in the history of gaming. This game inrtoduces a variety of play styles ranging from tank warfare in a fight to gain more land or taking flight in a bomber to destory enemy bases and win the game. Warthunder also includes tactical advatages you would have in real life, historically accurate planes and tanks, specifically tanks because each shot fired will do a ton of different things like knock out crew memebers or damage engines, explode fuel tanks and ammunition, it's very realistic and absolutely fun to play.The graphics of War Thunder are a very high quality esp. since it's FREE! A high quality game like this for free, is absolutely insane, yet I love it. Tanks and planes are given lots of history in their information, and tons just from the designs and handling of each one.Over all, War Thunder is a stunning game, it can be very hard for beginners, but I've made it far enough to get a good feel of what to expect with the rest of this game and in higher tier planes and tanks.9.8/10, would knock out pilot again.

"3203,War Thunder,2015.0,""TL:DR The balance issues in this game are nothing short of atrocious. The developers are iconoclasts with no respect for half-decent free-to-play models or competent community management. With that out of the way, let's get down to the more in-depth description of what's wrong with this game:- Every subsequent patch seems to be based on strong-arming people to buy overpriced premium content rather than allowing them to do it themselves. Progress through tech trees is incredibly slow to the point of frustrating and fun-crushing. It is difficult to grind out new machines (especially at higher tiers) even by the standards of tiered F2P games.- Balance issues are present from Tier II upwards, most notable at Tier IV and Tier V (especially with Ground Forces). The game is prohibitively difficult to enjoy when the vast majority of battles involve facing off against tanks that cannot be penetrated or aircraft which effortlessly gain energy advantages. Many planes and tanks that see each other in this game simply aren't comparable.- High tier bombers are Satan's children. Honestly, though, I can see why bomber spam exists. So much horrible behaviour comes about from the War Thunder community because the devs have made it painfully difficult to actually enjoy the game, and people playing it to grind out higher-tier vehicles are obviously going to do unpleasant things in order to make it happen.- Community management is nothing short of terrible. The CMs who are present on the game's forums are unpleasant and incredibly heavily biased, acting defensively and with standoffish behaviour regardless of topic or criticism. No issues from the playerbase are getting through to the devs because these community managers act as indiscriminate gatekeepers. One of the best things that Gaijin could do at this point would be to overhaul their entire community management team.- It's not fun. That last one hurts me a lot because I used to find it fun, before patch 1.29 where they took it upon themselves to wreck the economy and slow the grind down to a crawl. Progression became so horrible that it's hard to pin down quite when it stopped being fun, but before long I realised that I was playing for the grind rather than anything else.So I can't recommend this game. It's a technical masterpiece, really well optimised, beautifully rendered and gorgeous to look at. If you're after a nice visual experience, give this a go. If you like good devs and fun gameplay, give it a miss."",0"
"3204,War Thunder,2016.0,""I've been playing War Thunder on and off for roughly 2 or 3 years now. Everytime I leave it, it's due to 2 reasons and 2 reasons alone. The grind, and just BS that happens. The grind for one is, well, big even for an """"MMO"""". It's only worse for tanks and I'm going to go ahead and assume ships will be just as bad. Just for an example, you need about 50-55k rp for the Tiger H1. You're lucky to get more than 2k rp a game in Realistic Battles without premium. I've literally had 10+ kill games with battle activity of 90%+ and only got 2.3k rp in ground forces rb.As for the random BS that happens, just google images of the il-2 ground attacker. I've been in a turn fight against them with a zero, and have been out turned. IN. A. ZERO.

It's SUPER grindy to progress, like it's more grindy to get top tier with 1 faction than to max a character in world of warcraft level of grindy. So if you have fun in the mean time it's great, but if you're after higher tiers either pull out that wallet or just skip it.Also though I came in later, many reviewers say the planes haven't seen any major updating in years which is a shame.

3210,War Thunder,2018.0,After more than 800 hours of War Thunder i can only say that the devs must be complete blockheads.The f***ing matchmaking kills all the fun of this once great game together with the damn â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tanks.In every match between the BR ranking of 4.3 +/- 1.0 you get the M4A3E2 or the KV-1 Zis-5 as enemies (or worst case: both) and evertime you get to see one of them - you are dead (with 2 exceptions: you got one of those â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tanks yourself or your reverse gear is fast enough).These tanks are the main reason for me to quit playing War Thunder because they break the whole game everytime they appear on the battlefield.Of course you could play beyond 5.3 or lower as 3.3 but tier 2 and 3 are the most fun to me and seem to be the most balanced in the game except above mentioned â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ tanks.,0

As time went by, the economy became more and more centered on lotery and bonus random pack in game and this did not suit my taste.Also there was a lot of weird decision by the developer made to try and help the match making system compensate for the diminution of the player base.  I will not go in the details around those.I have also lot of time invested in this game and I only have a tier 5 in my list because I dumped close to a 100$ in one night to unlock it.  If you are a casual player looking for a free game you can but you will never get passed tier 3 unless you spend every nights playing and each and every weekend of the rest of your life.

"3220,War Thunder,2016.0,""I have played the game mainly outside of steam, so my real time count would probably be about 600 hours and not 6,5. I can safely say that the games is only a long and boring grind. the soviet is MUCH more powerfull and get a lot more options when it comes to arsenal than all other nations. ill let you guess why... (gaijin is russian.) 90% of all your sessions will be ended purely because youre too frustrated to continue. For example: Youre grinding that annoying aircraft that you already have used in more than 400 games and it struggles to even scratch anything and out of nowhere you get instakilled by a fkcen yak or any other russian (soviet) aircraft in generall. And btw, I have friends that have just out of nowhere lost all of their GE (kinda like gold money that you buy from real life cash)EDIT: After a 2 years long break i thought that maybe they fixed the ammount of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t in this game, but nah. bombers are still made of paper, and russians are still super biased... the thing about the russians being biased is extra frustrating because they always say this game is realistic, but in reality, the soviet was really poor and couldnt afford any good aircraft. they were so poor that they even used the """"5 man line"""" tactic, the first guy in the line had a rifle, and when he died, the second guy took his rifle, and when he died, the third guy took his rifle and so on...Moral of the story: 3/10.

"3221,War Thunder,2016.0,""I do not recommend starting this game.Gaijin does not respect their players whatsoever, and make changes that undermine the quality of the game.Do not play this game.Almost everything else about it is frustrating, borderline infuriating atleast half the time. Its perversion of the MMO model, with ludicrous amounts of grinding, handpers most of its gameplay goals. The sunk value falacy will hit you very hard, Especially because it will take several hours before you can play anything beyond a pre-war biplane with a lawnmower engine or a tank that isn't just a sardine can. The damage model mechanics are a definite plus, But seriously I do not recommend starting this game. The balance of the game is extremely annoying, their system of intense uptiering and downtiering shoots shemselves in the foot in terms of actually acheiving consistent balance. High tier tank combat is FUBAR, the balance is ridiculous, and makes it not fun to play.Dont bother with this game unless you want to spend large amounts of time and money, but if you want to spend invest in a game just to feel sunk value, go ahead.Yes this review used to be a lot more scathing, because about a year ago the game felt like it deserved it.

"3223,War Thunder,2017.0,""After 70 hours in the clock I can say that I do not like this game. Mostly played arcade battles but also tried a few realistic battles here and there. Air battles are pretty fun, especially at low tiers where there is almost non-stop action all the time. But when climbing the ranks grinds between new aircraft become obviously longer and longer still. I can't even imagine what it's like at top tiers. Additionally most of the stock planes are pretty horrible so the game kinda suggests you to spend some real money to fasten up the process of advancing. The addicting sense of progression slowly dissipates and I can't see myself grinding any higher in the tech trees deliberately.Still, I have even more gripes with the tank battles and that's what's driving me away from this product. Of course the same grinding-related and stock vehicle issues are present in tank battles too but in my opinnion the battle mechanics are also a bit flawed. Problem is that War Thunder is pretty much vehicle oriented game almost like some of the simulators. Evidently developers have spent most of their time making vehicles feel and play realistically but forgot about fun factor. For example some of the maps are not very well desingned and some vehicles are pretty horribly balanced. A a result gameplay does not feel that good or fun at all. Needless to say, most of the game modes are very unimaginative too. Spawn camping and unevenly matched teams are pretty common. Sadly, well-modeled vehicles alone don't equate to fun and engaging gameplay.Effects of the origin of the game's developers cannot be overlooked either since vehicles of certain nation are pretty much overpovered or at least somehow better than the competing nations' vehicles across the board both in air and ground battles.Overall game looks and runs nice on my rig and there have been very few teâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥al issues. I'm sure that the game is well made and all of that but it just feels a bit boring and bland after a while. It's just not my cup of tea and I'm not going to recommend it to anyone either."",0"
"3224,War Thunder,2016.0,""War Thunder is frustrating. I long gave up on fighter combat, because I'mâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥at air-to-air in anything and the balancing was stupid as all hell anyway, so I instead spend most of my playtime now in the mud. It sucks, because as it stands warthunder is the only non-simulator tank game that makes a tank feel like a tank (rather than the gliding-across-the-ground tanks you get in WoT and Armored Warfare), but the game is just SO so bad. The balance is terrible (How do you like facing Panzer IIIs in your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ cavalry tank that's not even up-armored enough to defeat .50s?), the grind is terrible (~500RP is a decent match, and it'll be costing you tens of thousands of RP to get most vehicles), the playerbase is terrible (have fun being the only â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ moving from beyond some useless camping positions!)Just don't bother. The playercount has been steadily shrinking for a while now, too, meaning the wait times between battles grow longer and longer (and Gaijin continues to do dumber and dumber things to """"fix"""" that), and the quality of players grows lower and lower."",0"
"3225,War Thunder,2016.0,""Used to be so much fan, a birlliant game I sunk hour after hour into, on both PC and Playstation 4.

People always bang on about Russian bias however, and let me tell you something, those people are speaking complete and utter..... sense. The Russian aircraft often take you down in a small burst whilst you watch your German aircraft pump 300 mg rounds plus 100 cannon rounds into a lower """"battle ranked"""" aircraft.The graphics still hold up well but the question on reviews is would I recommend the game.

"3230,War Thunder,2018.0,""On top of everything, I found out today that Warthunder installs malware that can't be disabled and remains even after uninstalling WT.

Then even more money grinding for that.Of course you could just dish out your wallet and spend a couple hundred to pass all that. Micro transaction galore.Not to mention the game matching system is horribly broken. You get people with Spitfires fighting agaisnt biplanes just because all their other planes are biplanes.And then there are the crashes, and the """"some game files are not downloaded"""" bug that requires you to reinstall the game (which takes over an hour).Every update that rolls out just breaks the game even more. Horribly unbalanced. And don't even get me started on the Hurricanes. In WW2 Hurricanes shot down a bunch of planes being launched from ships to protect agaisnt bombing. In this game if you were to take off at sea level you would be half way through the game by the time you got anywhere near the bombers because the climb rate on the Hurricanes SUCK BALLZ.I would continue my rant, except by now (if you even got this far) you are probably bored at this ubsurdly long post, so I'll stop here."",0"

"3233,War Thunder,2018.0,""Over the last year (since Gaikin added the italian tree) the quality of the game is been deteriorating. Personally I think the devs are just trying to milk the game as much as possible before it dies. Don't play this for the plane mode since the developers only care about the tank mode. The plane mode is stale and unbalanced. Even though the Tank mode gets ~98% of the developers attenion it too is unbalanced with a large percentage of ammo types being infinitely inferior to others. (Plane mode has the same issue but way worse)Any vehicle with a rating of 3.3 are not worth grinding for and playing. In the current state of the game American planes are the only ones worth playing.In the current state of the game tanks with H.E.A.T. are the only ones worth playing.In the current state of the game you will always become poor in the free currency. This is because it is very hard to be profitable when playing against people who have been playing since the start of the game. These players have memorised every vehicles weakness and as a casual player you will constantly get memed on.If you still wish to play the game here are some tips. For flying planes in realistic modeClimb: at the start of the match, climb. Climb to 500m to 1.5k higher than your optimal altitude. (Check stat card). Learn: learn what you nation does best. For example America goes fast. Japan turns. Russia isngreat at low altitude. Play to those strengths.Switch you info to metric. Everyone else uses it.For Tank combat. Turn on the lowest graphics seytings possible. It makes it easier to spot the enemy. Upgrade the range finder skill and bind it to a key."",0"
"3234,War Thunder,2018.0,""I used to love this game. The first 2 tiers for the vehicles were fun and enjoyable. But by the end of the secont tier, I began noticing something weird. I was being mached against Tier 3 tanks and planes as tier 2.Its like a drag race between a Camaro and your Mom's Shitwagon.You think you have a chance, but you know you really don't. You always get killed the secont you leave spawn, and then the grind becomes real. After about 100 hours of solid grind, i finaly got my first Tier 3 plane. Things got easy, and I started to progress at a resonable rate again. Until I got to the end of Tier 3, I was facing Tier 4 Planes.At that point, its like a drag race between a Camaro and a F1 car.Your GOING to lose. Then I finaly realized something: Its pay to win. You can buy Golden Eagles to progress about 100 times faster, and with the new DLCs you can BUY new and better vehicles. Those youtubers who love and play thegame alot, I would bet $500 dollars that they have spent at least $500 on the game. That is not okay.

"3236,War Thunder,2018.0,""To start, I should say that war thunder has been a positive influence on my life overall. When the community is good, it's great! I've formed many lasting friendships, and I'm currently in a relationship of almost a year with someone I met through the game.But war thunder has a problem with women. Not all players are like that--not even the majority. But enough â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s are loud enough to ruin the experience for so many girls I know, and we as a community can do better.I'm a woman. I like to play comp, and I get on voice to make call-outs and provide encouragement. For the most part, it's fine and we all have a good time (except when the enemy J1 somehow gets me every push.) But there are times when teammates get toxic in a way that doesn't get applied to male players. And sometimes the very presence of a female voice in the chat is enough to set people off--it's not funny when you ask me if I'll send nudes, or if I'll perform an obscene act for you. (Even if you're """"joking,"""" it's really not funny, I promise.) It's grating to be continually asked if I'm a bomber main since I'm a girl, or for you to demand that I pocket you. (I don't play bomber. Sorry. How about naval planes?)It's especially not funny to be harassed, to have people make videos of them """"trolling"""" me (and to receive dozens of hateful messages after), to be told to kill myself, to be called a bimbo and aâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥and much, much worse. I've blocked people who then make multiple accounts to continually harass me. When playing with my girlfriend, we've been called all kinds of sexist epithets, plus an extra helping of homophobia when they find out we're dating.And despite all this, I still get on mic and speak. Partly because I'm not about to let a few sweaty manchildren ruin my gaming experience, but partly because it's more than just me. Time and time again, I've had other girls timidly get on mic when they hear my voice and express their relief at hearing another girl. They say they don't usually talk out of fear, but that it's nice to hear a friendly voice. People say that there aren't any girl gamers, but that couldn't be further from the truth--you've just create a climate where they're too scared to talk, because many of them have experienced the same things as me.I know most of you are decent people. I'm lucky to have a close circle of players who are talented, kind people. But we as a community need to do a better job of standing up against this kind of poor behavior. More than just reporting it when you see it (although I wholly recommend doing that): make it known that you don't tolerate sexist conduct. Even a simple """"hey man, that's not cool"""" can both (1) let the harasser know that their behavior isn't condoned and (2) let the harassee know that decent people do exist. The silence of complicity and the silence of dissent sound the same--speak up to make your true colors shine.So please: be mindful, foster an environment that welcomes female players, and don't forget to bomb the airfield!ETA: Thanks for the (mostly) supportive response, I appreciate it! It means a lot to me that the average person still knows how to be polite. Like I said, it's the good eggs who make this community what it is.A couple people have said things akin to """"this is the internet, grow a thicker skin, etc."""" I'm well aware of how the internet can be, and I do have a tremendously thicc skin as a result.

I reccomend this game if you're planning on playing this game every once in a while, as with this games terrible grind system you won't be getting too far down the tech trees. I play both Tanks and Aircraft and it seems the balance goes down the drain the further you get and the matches get less and less enjoyable. Planes are great, although the Russian aircraft get really annoying as a bit less than half the players i it seems bring them into battle. I love American tech and Vehicles so I primary them, and then the Germans for both game modes and it from what I experience everything in the American lineup isn't as good as the others it's put up against - this is mostly directed for ground forces. A massive chunk of the earlier tree is made up of the M4 Sherman type tanks and its great at first but when you use the same gun for 5 tanks down the same tree facing tigers and panthers and broken T34 it becomes incredibly stale. Now that I have 2 6.0 tanks going into battle is now a complete waste of time, I usually when I play ground forces get 4-5 kills per match but now i'm getting less than 300 RP and barely a single assist. My advice is to either 1: pay for premium/golden eagles to boost your way out of the terrible 5.7+ mess of a matchmaking or quit and play another of the factions until you hit that point. It, after hundreds of hours of work is incredibly dissappointing."",0"
"3239,War Thunder,2017.0,""If your new to war thunder  here's a key tip, the aim reticle you see on an aircraft, if your behind them aim a bit above it to actually hit themAir battles are alot more relaxing depending on the situation your compared to ground battles where it can be stressful and frustrating while rewarding on how well your match can go, i would recommend starting off in air battles at first then transitioning towards ground later on to ease you in.On ground battles however its a different level of game entirely with the possibility of having your entire line up of tanks getting wiped out within minutes to not loosing a single tank, i would recommend starting off with either russia or the recently added japan ground forces, russia as their tanks have some good sloping and armor early on in their line upm while japan for some highly mobile (in my opinion) tanks with an equivalent tank to the KV-2 on tier 1 called the ho-ro with a hefty but lethal 20's reload, 150mm mortar canon, which will one shot kill most tanks should you use the high explosive rounds being viable until tiger tanks or is's start appearing.The game is fun and doesen't become a paywall until you start unlocking some of the more iconic tanks to each faction, the closest thing i can relate it to is the heavy tank no.6 and all the tanks to its left."",1"

"3249,War Thunder,,""thunder, where to start.  (please read fully, as there are somethings I think need to change)This game used to be REALLY fun back when it first came out, way before tanks were introduced.  I used to love playing this game as it was basically World of Warplanes but not autistic.  The grind was almost no existant as you would get your next aircraft almost immedeatley if you did well enough.  I used to love playing with friends as realistic battles were super fun an not old a drawn out as time went on.  However, now, this game is just... sad.  The grind fest is real and if you dont have premium time, preimum tanks/planes, or some advantage, its almost impossable to get any XP.  I know that Gaijin want to make money but I mean come-on.  After tanks came out I was actually thinking the game was going to be so much better, but in recent years the tank gameplay is the exact same:  load in, dowtiered, kill 1 tank, get 15xp, die, rinse and repeat.  The plane gameplay is just about the same, load in, kill 1 plane, die and do it all over again.  Now unless you play only arcade, its somewhat breable, but realstic is God awfully broken.  There is no teamwork, everyone is out for themselves to get the new """"amazing"""" super sonic planes, or the new cold war tanks.  I mean, who actually plays online games in hopes your team knows teamwork as a word, but its really bad in this game.  Other problems include aircraft ammo.  I mean the .50's are decent, the 20mms are lackluster, and you just want to forget about the German 30mm cannons.  I am not by far a wheraboo, but the German guns tend to suck... HARD.  Sometimes you can literally dump all of your ammo into a plane and it never dies, or 2 rounds of ammo blow the plane up, literally.I hoped Gaijin would actually listen to the player base about fixing issues with the game in terms of battle modes, ammo, and tanks, but all they seem to do, is come out with """"new"""" maps or planes/ tanks/ helicopters.  The battle modes are.... well.... special.  Its only one of two or three modes.  Assault, moded assult, or horrid assult. WHat I mean by this is, plane modes are all the same, destory bases, destory the airfield and you win, or kill all the other team.  Tank battle only consist of attack 1, 2 or 3 points.   If you dont get atleast 2 points and hold them, you are DONE.  ANother problem in the tank mode is the SPAWN CAMPING and when I mean its bad, ITS BAD.  Gaijin tried to remedy the issue by putting in a zone around the spawn for the enemies to not enter, and if they do, they die.  But its 30 seconds, REALLY?  30 seconds?  It should be instant death, not only that but make it to where when you spawn in, your tank is protected until your LEAVE the zone.  I know it says I don't have a whole lot of hours on here, at least on steam, but overall I have around 6k-10k hours on this game.  Not saying I know all about this game, but I think I have a good sense of what I am talking about. What I would change are as follows: - I would balance out the ability to make money/ exp, you make more per battle as it used to be.  - STOP putting in new planes and tanks every patch, so those that are """"possibly"""" op can be investigated and """"repaired"""".  - Balance out ammo, and make it to where all the ammo preforms close to historical abilities.- Ammo for tanks will be ablanced out to historical battle field capabilities as well.  Armor valuse would be recorrected into their historical abilities.  I know this is a lot, but this game has SOME REAL potential, but they (Gaijin)  isn't willing to fix the game.

"3251,War Thunder,2018.0,""Pay to win, pay to win, pay to win and nothing more. Vehicles repair costs are terrible. 50% battles are lost. Even if you win, you earn only little ingame cash. Effect = you have to buy premium vehicle or play lowest tier games because you don't have money for anything else.Matches are also unbalanced as hell. 1 team is killing the other in 5 minutes. You either die in first 2 minutes or watching your team killing enemy in 5 minutes (and you end with 0 kills). Game is focused on Russia nation. Buffing russian vehicles, nerfing every other nation. So 80% of players are using only russian tanks/planes and you wait 2 - 5 minutes for game. Of course, physics and RNG is focused on russian vehicles as well. Everything to make them stronger.Small advice for any new players. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME! Or uninstall as fast as you can. Let Gaijin starve!"",0"

3253,War Thunder,2018.0,If you want to play this game pay up because its not free. The progression is painfully slow and the matchmaking is very bad.

The fun is killed in this game and i have no interest paying for a company that uses these disgusting metods.,0
"3254,War Thunder,2018.0,""I recommened and don't recommend War Thunder for several reasons. 1. The grind.I have invested a decent amount of hours, I haven't gotten to the jet tier. I had just started the tier right before. Inorder for me to research a new attacker, fighter, bomber, etc. I need to invest several games worth. My average RP (research points) ranges from 100-200 in losses and 600+ depending on kills, majortiy of matches i complete are rewarding me with 1000 RP. A bomber that I'd like to research requires 75,000 RP...that's 75 matches in order to complete one plane, thats just the avg. rp gain of 1000, so not every match will give me 1000. A fighter is 30,000. 30 matches or more or less. Now the grind at first was fun, the first 3 tiers were very enjoyable for tanks and planes, but I can't stand playing long matches and getting barely enough RP to get a new plane. By this rate I'll get the jets in a few months if i play to my own leisure. 2. The urge to pay for GEGE (golden eagles) are premium currancy. You can instantly research and purchase planes, tanks, and modifications with them. I have spent roughly $10 on War Thunder, that isn't too bad considering that $6 gives (I'm assuming around) 1,000 GE. Well as you go down the plane or tank branchs you notice the RP gets higher, the more RP the more GE it takes to instantly research or aid the research. Not only is does GE just finish or aid research, you can use your GE to activate a premium account for 'x' amount of days according to your GE amount. When you have a premium account your awards are nearly doubled/you get more rewards then the usual. I personally feel like there is a large urge to purchase these GE in late game progress"
"3255,War Thunder,2018.0,""So, I've put 1,586 hours in to this game and I have a story for you. I kill this one plane going down then I get shot at by someone else.

This game was so nice back at 2013 or so I saw on videos of Long5hot, but now it's so broken that game it's getting more and more worse by the day.So don't try to tell me that this is a good game, because it's not at the moment.

For playing almost 3 yrs grinding with the Germans, Americans, British and the Japanese but not the Russians because i don't have the time and interest.Whether is tanks or aircrafts each faction has its own ups and downs. However every battle i jump into, the Russian will win often whether is alone or joint with other factions. Maybe it could be map design or people complaining about broken MM(Match-making),FM(flight model) and many things in the game if you read the forums in the communitiy. For the most important part is that i refuse to believe """"Russian Bias"""". You can win by communicating to team, best played with a friend through Skype or Teamspeak. It takes skills and observation in the battlefield and knowing the weakspots of your enemy. But now due to recent updates and horrible fixes of the game it became somewhat unbalanced mostly Match making and the graphical glitches where you see your enemies behind a wall or bushes when you are not aiming your gun sight. Sometimes the hit detection doesn't inform you whether you make a confirm hit of the target or not. Not to mention the amour physics can be a bit whackky.

"3266,War Thunder,2016.0,""Unfortunately even after playing this for over a year in realistic mode, grinding my way trough the German ground forces line, hoping that somehow in the future all this grinding will pay off, and I might stumble upon a tank that is at least a fair match against my Russian & American counterparts... alas twas not to be.- Don't play the German line in ground forces you will loose 90% of the time, only the first 2 tiers are a little bit more balanced.- Don't believe the bull**** that German tanks have better guns. Your Russian & American counterparts have the same + better armor, better bouncing, and much faster speed.- Maps are most of the time just a race to the capture points. Since your German tank is as slow as a snail, you will loose again and again to the faster Russian & American tanks.- For the love of god, don't use a panther tank, your turret will be disabled 99% of the time by a wisp of wind. Shooting your counterparts in the turret will just bounce it off, and even if you somehow manage to do damage, they will probably still be able to shoot.- Your German gun needs to time to get in position after a hard stop, it will slowely crawl it's way to the center of your crosshair.

I used to love this game, but then one patch just ruined all the fun not only for me, but apparently for many people. All the frustration that it brought was overwhelming, the whole unlock system literally turned this game into a grind fest, a hard grind fest, forcing you to play what you would not enjoy playing at all.

"3270,War Thunder,2014.0,""Throughout the course of this game, my opinion has largely changed. I used to recall on the game as a pioneer of the aircraft simulator franchise as it embarked into the realms of World War II and its epic course, now I can only review this game as a mediocre displacement from that former realization of it being a """"wonder"""". To begin, the company, Gaijin Entertainment, is ridiculous at best. I used to be a strong advocate of another title of the company - Star Conflict - until they nearly dedicated all resources to War Thunder alone. The company is infamous for dropping titles and other assets in pursuit of other monetary ventures. I still rather miss playing Star Conflict as it felt like a new take on space combat (Mind you, this was before Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, and several other acclaimed space simulators to be). Though my regards on Star Conflict do not reflect War Thunder, it reflects my opinion of the company that seems like it desires to be the next EA of Russia. Oh that reminds me, in its conveying of the depressing updates of Star Conflict, and other titles, they apparently have no English representive (Or that person needs to be fired) as it seems like the company uses Google Translate to loosely translate press releases to the customer. Personally, I like to hold onto Star Conflict and War Thunder simply so that I can read statements with grammatical errors so blatantly obivious, it is a pain to the eye while a laughter to the brain. To the matters of War Thunder, I used to play this game on a daily basis - to this day I maintain 175.5 hours - I would most likely have 1,000+ if I did not stop playing this game however. With the release of patch 1.37, to """"decrease"""" waiting times for flight battles, Gaijin decided to remove several tiers and merge them into a few. Now, what does that mean? It means instead of matching against a player with a similar aircraft tier, it means going against individuals that can either be incredibly above you in level or incredibly low. To me, this seems like an attack against those who are just picking up War Thunder. How is it that a company can maintain a player basis when it invites new ones into battles that are significantly outmatched? I suppose the developers are able to achieve this, but I suppose the fame will outrun its course.As a reflection though of the current update, Ground Combat, I was elated beyond scale. I stayed up overnight to download the update and to finally get into my tank to discover how fun it was. While the ground forces update is exceptional, it is amazingly generic. I would dare to say it seems like Gaijin dissected World of Tanks to mirror the tanks and battles to the very   controls and combat. Personally, I almost laugh simply because I have wondered if Gaijin Entertainment and WarGaming (Developers of World of Tanks, Wartanks, and Warships) are brothers - family in ownership.Though my opinion and reflection of War Thunder is based primarily upon patch 1.37 and the company's background, I cannot sadly recommend this game. I still take fun in participating in air battles and tank battles on the occasion. Knowing the company's background, I cannot but wonder when they devise a new title that maintains such high success if not higher than War Thunder, when they will suddenly drop frequent updates to pursue the next monetary venture. If you're interested, look up Star Conflict on Steam and review updates and other news for the game. Everytime that I do that now, I simply get depressed. I wonder if people even know that this company has maintained other somewhat successful titles before this one, considering it seems like Gaijin throws old titles and other former successes off a cliff into a void of neglect. In my opinion, if a company releases a title, that company must maintain fixes for bugs and glitches while releasing new content to increase the player basis - in a professional manner. Considering Gaijin most likely uses Google Translate rather than an English interpreter, translations of the updates and other press notices are astounding. My yet born nephew would probably understand and convey English better than Gaijin. NOTE: This review reflects mainly upon the ethics of the company. If you are looking for a game to play occasionally that reflects your desires to defeat the Axis or Allied Powers of World War II in a simulated fashion, I would recommend this game. Though, I would stay WarGaming's titles would be a better choice. As a very frequent gamer, please take into account the ethics of  Gaijin - the next EA of Russia.  "",0"

And the grind is terrible, making me stop playing for two months until the latest update whick piked my intrest. Grinding for new parts and vehicles at the low tiers is easy and relatively fun (Even though for some strange reason ,ie microtransactions, essential parts like fire supression are not stock. Making tank battles impossible to come out alive) at later levels it slow's down to a crawl. Making it a huge headache to keep moving up.But there is a way around this, microtransactions! Making the game almost laughably easy if you're wallet is deep enough. Those who don't fork over the cash either spend hours grinding a single vehicles to not die in seconds, or get stomped by everyone else. It's irritating and demoralising to see people who have invested less than twenty hours be at tier four with everything fully upgraded.

The so called """"fleet"""" is nothing but destroyers and patrol boats--for how long that was in development and how little was produced is an absolute disgrace.

But you know one this game has always had at its core, the microtransactions are surreal and as much money as people get conned into buying because of the horrible grind in the game makes it such that they should have plenty of cash to make a whole game of World of Worships inside War Thunder.From the beginning this game looked great, the more its matured its lost the vision it started with.

"3277,War Thunder,2018.0,""I have played this game for five years, and i must say to never ever download this game. Ever since more premium vehicles have been added gaijin seems to only care about money. Not only is the community of this game actually garbage, but they seem to only focus on certain tech trees and pertain to buffing them at all costs. Recently in update 1.79 gaijin seemed to have added more prmium vehicles and interesting armor features. The intelligent members of the community saw this as a money grab and a distraction for the lemmings in the community. Rather than fix in game issues gaijin added a shiny new vehicle and some """"cool"""" features deriving from the much needed balencing issues and the other numerous issues this game is plagued with.

I had been grinding on the tech tree up until today 6/13/18 when I discovered something horrid. The object 906 had been moved to 8.0. Incase who ever is reading this does not know, The object 906 is a modification to the pt-76 made by the soviet union in 1963 in order to modernize it. In game it has an Armor Piercing Capped Balistic Capped shell that has decent if not good performance and a good High Explosive Anti Tank shell. The only issue is the battle rating. At the battle rating of 8.0 the 906 goes against vehicles such as the leopard 1, the leopard a1a1 (with apds), the cheiftan mk3, the STB 1, and the american tanks which are of no issue. With all of these excellente vehicles combined it equals a bad time for the 906 which can barely pen all of these vehicles and has a 12k repair cost in in game currency and a heaty heat shell expense. The icing on all of this is the fact that the Battle rating before (7.3) was perfect for the tank. Not only was it the only playable tank at that battle rating but it fought tanks that were in the same class at the same time. The only issue was the fact that a down tier would cause a massive problem as it out classed everything at 6.7. 7.7 was if not the perfect battle rating had the leopard not had the ability to instantly kill the 906 with heat because of hull break (yet another issue this game has).

I find myself wondering why I'm playing half the time since most of the battles are getting into range of one of either the german's or russian's weapons and dying.

For people new to this game it is a brillaint second world war arcady flight sim with different styles of play and many different aircraft, later on the game requires a lot of money to actually progress anywhere if you even manage to reach tier 4 out of 5 you will understand what I mean by this, If your not prepered to put money on this game i wouldn't suggest getting your hopes up for it.For people with 400+ hours or those who have played it prior to patch 1.37 we all feel your frustration, the company switched from the all knowing all loved, to the more """"give us your money"""". What 1.37 added was different way of proggression from the much more simple 1-20 tier system with 20 being top and 1 being the start it was compressed into only 5 tiers, what was expected was rough boundries eg Tier 4 vs Tier 4 well nope... If you play tier four your more than likely to experiance the wrath of a MiG-15 pilot booming and zooming your spawn throughout the whole game, still not the worst part thought, both Arcade and realistic are now flooded with bomber pilots flying to the enemy base blowing it up and letting the AI gunners act as laser guided heat seeking laser beams that track and destroy all life, this is still not to mention the horrible progression system that in a whole translates to """"Give me all your money if you want to be good"""" the game requires countless grinds through horrible and buggy (Not to mention unbalanced) aircraft and then it makes you pay for it as it takes months to progress to a higher tier without a premiuim account or buy paying to progress. All this to unlock a slightly less broken aircraft just infront of it (Which comes stock so it's probably worse) The game went downhill from 1.37 flight models are now copies and objects not fully registered meaning you can fly through houses or you'll slam into an invisible 50ft tree. The games Devs weren't bad people and still aren't they're running a compnay and it seems they need a way to make more money from it, unforunaely this is one of the ways they chose. They used to listen and fix almost all bugs and issues now I think money has taken over a once great game that used to be a brilliant, now instead it is the biggest example of pay to progress."",0"
3281,War Thunder,2013.0,Gameplay is still a joke. Constant losing even with good kill ratio.Everthing offer then heavy tank is suicide in ABLoading is feeling endlessThey could at least remove aim help and give tanks more survivability,0
"3282,War Thunder,2013.0,""A truly fun and addictive F2P game with stunning graphics and tight controls. Don't need to pay to have fun. Even if you don't enjoy or have played flying games, I would highly reccomend this."",1"
"3283,War Thunder,2018.0,""I've played this game off and on for years, and am still having fun. There are a number of legitimate concerns that have been brought up with other reviews, but in the end it's a fun, free to play game. If you like flying, driving tanks and blowing stuff up, give War Thunder a try - you've nothing to loose. The player base is a mixed bag, ranging from frothing insanity to helpful and commited team players and everything in between. If you're looking for a recommendation, I'd suggest trying out the gameplay for a few weeks. If you like the game, even a little, head over to the forums and find yourself a Squadron to play with. There are a number of dedicated training squadrons that exist to even out the rather steep learning curve. Having teammates with VOIP makes all the difference here! I would not say to ignore negative feedback, since there ARE problems with the game - I would say to try it out right now and see if the issues are deal breakers for YOU."",1"

"3286,War Thunder,2015.0,""This game is f*cking insane! I love it so much! I've played it for about 5 years (I played 4 before I found it on steam) and I never got around to stop playing this magnificent game. I have had some slight breaks from it though, due to *Cough* Rage *Cough* but I am addicted again. The community? Well some people are nice, and some people just go: """"Wow, f*cking idiot noob piece of sh*t."""" instantly. I am not that kind of person, I try to be nice to people, if they are my teammates that is.I currently have 4 german jets, and about 5 tier 5 tanks aswell, The Me 262 A-1, Me 262 C-1, Me 163 and the Horten 229. Tanks: Tiger II 10.5, Maus, Leopard, Gepard and Raketenjagdpanzer. It is so fun when you can just pick whatever you wanna play, but I always have goals for what I want. Currently my focus is CL-13a Sabre mk.5 because, come on... it's the CL! I played it on my friends account once and loved it. Anyway, enough talking about me... let's talk about the developers. As far as I have seen, they are pretty nice. But I have been told some of them are complete dickwads... cancelling other's accounts. Taking their GE and even taking their vehicles! (The last one I doubt) but they are pretty help some if you need help. Their home screen system (Where you pick vehicles and what not) is... well okay, but it could be worked on. Some things, I absolutely HATE about this game is the hit or not to hit system... thing. Like, bullets who fly 4 meters high can still hit me, and sometimes I just get one shot without ANYTHING getting damaged. (No, the pilot was not killed either). And the Lost control thing, absolutely DISPICE IT, like why do you have it in there?! It will just f*ck your day up even more! I think, that is all I have? Yeah I guess so. See ya! And stay safe lol."",1"
"3287,War Thunder,2016.0,""i have sunk over at least a hundred hours on the steam and non steam one, if you come in expecting an easy life with smooth grinding , your name painted on the scoreboards as the MVP then you might as well go back to ace combat. ill narrow it down for you, you will die and not typically die as in a heroic last man standing death, no you WILL and i mean WILL be one shot. Pros -The game is very well optimised so even with my bad ping of 400 as long as the Packet Loss is low you can frag -War Thunder did a good job at keeping realism to a point where it is realistic but not overly till the point you cant have fun-it isnt pay to win as you think, the premium currency can buy you vehicles but usually they are the same as the ones you can grind and unlock with the in game currency, the difference is they give you more Exprience or currency gain -every tank has a weakness , if you think the big tiger was a threat wait till you see it get one shot by an M18 then you will change your mind. -New Vehicles added in presents a challenge for new players expecially in learning on the basics, i really only used my rudder, flaps and etc like a few months into the game and once you do learn you can surpass thousand hour players-nothing is overpowered as i said before, every tank, plane and soon ships will have a heel to step on lets say the russians, in the most common Tier 3 league we have the medium T34 , pretty strong from the front , good armour and a strong gun andddd its gone why? The ammo is located around the middle of the tank literally surrounding the crewmen next up is the Sherman, strong frontal armor the best in its medium tank class , but its side armor is relatively thin and oddly enough the armor plate surrounding the armor bulges out and is weaker than the hull itself huh so yes Every tank has an exploit for you to find , memorise where they are and you will be one of the strongest players in the game -over the years it had begun so much , ive been around before the Ground forces and i havent sunk a single dollar into this game (im poor shut up) and im still actively grinding so yes the replayability is high with this game -This game will look good even on low unless you are one of the """"PC MASTER RACE"""" that owns an i3 -F2P , for a constantly updating game Cons - One shots (you and the enemy can do that to eachother you arent op ) - Anti Social community , on servers i have been there is little to no talking in text mostly just people complaning about they got 1 hit or they died from a weird angle - teleporting back to where you were to receive a shell -Team Members may or may not assist you and maybe push you off a cliff either by accident or on purpose ill never know - THE GRIND , its a grinding game which is easy for the first few tiers then you slowly think about buying golden eagles to fund your research because you have been playing the same tank for a few weeks already and you are still so far from getting the next tank in line and then probably when you do you have no cash for it so you grind for cash and the button to purchase it is tempting you -its file space is large so if you are going to need a lot of space for this baby Notes Play with a friend and get a discord going or something , playing with friends is good as you can watch your backs and increase the survival chance of you and allies, the community is funny sometimes so it will cause a laugh or two sometimes during an serious confrontation, there will be badass moments when you are alone and you can score 10 one shots in a row , or clutch the round with a lucky bomb drop from your aircraft either way, this game requires skill and a little bit of luck on your side Recommend Yes , this is probably the best Free To Play to get not many other can compare so i nominate it for the test of time award and 9/10  "",1"
"3288,War Thunder,2013.0,""Well, this game used to be very fun and very interesting.  However, the recent changes to the economy, including the tier/research revamp, have caused the people I play with and myself to stagnate horribly.  Now, I feel like I am not getting any closer to a high-tier fighter.  That is because I am not.  On average, I have received about 500 points towards a new plane, which costs about 120,000.  That's about half a percentage.  Granted, before the XP system was flawed similarly, but you unlocked every plane for a level once you leveled up, and there were times when I got 10,000-20,000 XP, so now I have to play approximately 4 times as many games to unlock just ONE PLANE.  Not to mention, I then have to pay for it with lions, the game's currency.  So, while the early tiers seem to be pretty much the same, more or less, after about tier 3 the game becomes an unbearable grind.  So, if you feel like grinding for hundreds of hours, feel free, and obviously there are casual options.  However, I would suggest purchasing premium/eagles or waiting until they fix the economy."",0"
"3289,War Thunder,2016.0,""A fun game to get into for the air combat. However the ground combat leaves somthing to be desired as you will be constantly 1 shoted. I know that the game is ment to be realistic, however the rendering range for the ground is terable. Air combat is good overall however I would advise you look away from arcade battles and more into realistic. In arcade the person with the most/bigger guns is usually the winner.only other grib with the game is microtansactions and a pay to win modle"",0"
3290,War Thunder,2016.0,well the game is the best tank game out right now..... but you cant go any higher then tier 1-2 becuase the balancing is horrible... instead of facing tanks in your tier... you will be facing more tanks that are higher then your tier.  also some tanks you will face that will be of higher tier....you will literally be helpless to kill them or do anything. so if you dont mind grinding extremely hard to get to only the third tier and then have either really easy gmaes or extremely hard ones then get this game.... you will never fight a close game.,0
"3291,War Thunder,2016.0,""The grind is real bad now, it use to be fun and i have spend alot of money on it, i played more then the 15hours stated, offical launcher without steam.i use to love this game, I quit world of tanks because of it, i put alot of hours into this game but progressed very slowly after tier 4, spend atlease 250$ or more, and at that price why not just unlock all the goddam tanks for me really?"",0"
"3292,War Thunder,2016.0,""Bugs, balance, broken vehicles. Don't bother wasting your time on this game, once you get to the higher tiers balance is completely gone and the bugs(disappearing/invisible tanks, sparking, lots of desync and hit detection issues). Gaijin's strategy to get you to pay for premium or premium vehicles is to make you want to pull your hair out while you are driving a stock tank. Unfortunately money will not fix the aforementioned problems, it'll just make your wallet lighter and stress levels higher. Skip this one until somebody makes a decent competitor, right now they have no competitor so there is no real incentive for them to fix the game."",0"
"3293,War Thunder,2017.0,""Not going to lie this game is pretty fun. Why a negative review you ask? Because of how unbalanced this game is. I am following someone for so long putting thosands of shots into them. Some plane comes out of no where and puts two 20 round bursts into him and he dies. Guess who should get the kill after 3 criticals? The guy that comes out of no where and puts 2 bursts into him. For some reason im fighting people in tier 2 with p-51s and yak-7s and i have 2 planes that are the last one in tier one. Also this game has a major russian bias. I play realistic and everytime my squad gets instantly one shot by yak-7s and there is nothing we can do about it. Eventually I got tired of the bias and said """"If we cant beat em join em"""" so i got the first yak you can get and im amazed. Most countries dont get cannons till the middle of tier 2 but hey the first russian plane you can research has a 20 mm cannon. I took it into an arcade match and i could shoot 3 bursts and the plane would litterally tear into peices. Do not play this game."",0"
"3294,War Thunder,2014.0,""Devs are money hungry and would rather have people buy better premium vehicles than balance the game or fix issues that have been around since day 1. there are still many broken vehicle models that will probably never get fixed and it requires insane dedication to get any higher than rank 3 in a country. ive tried to give this game another chance too many times. it may be fun for the first few hundred hours but unless you want to waste your money on a game that doesn't care about you, dont play any farther."",0"
"3295,War Thunder,2015.0,""Free to play its a cool WW2 fighting simulater. Its not hard to play and will quickly downlaod with a good PC or laptop.

"3296,War Thunder,2016.0,""Got mixed opinions about this game and I play tanks mostly at the moment.  On steam I only got 602hrs since typing this but that doesnt include playing this game not through steam for over a year when I was the most active playing.  My current opinion though is I have been slowly moving away from this game because its a struggle to play anything that uses solid AP rounds as spalling is very lacking making tanks with APHE more effective.  Then theres the screwed up BR system as where tanks face others that will struggle alot against which will cause trouble especially for players that havent gotten the stronger tanks where as I have rank 5 tanks in every nation except brit.  I sometimes go back to play lower tier tanks for fun and always seem to get upranked all the time which makes it extremely hard but can handle it since I know almost all of the tanks weaknesses and such.  But this for new players will cause people to stop playing much sooner.  Currently the game needs alot of work especially in BR, DM, spalling, and much more before the game is perfect.  Personnaly I say they should stop adding new tanks for now tell they fix alot of the small issues then add more once the problems are fixed as everytime they add a new tank more problems form then ones that are fixed causing a bigger hole dragging this game down.Currently I dont know if I can recommend this game due to all the problems but its still a blast to play here and there but I no longer put 7+hrs a day anymore in this game because of the issues it has.  Ill be putting no for recommendation for now but dont let that distract you as the game is worth a try but I just cant recommend it at the moment with the way the game is right now."",0"

The game is very firmly """"Pay 2 Win"""" now with hours and days of grinding required to get a single vehicle to a point where it is viable against any other opponents, your only option is to pay significant amounts of money for in-game currency to bypass the grind and be able to win or get any kills with your vehicle.

"3301,War Thunder,2018.0,""This is the worst good game I've ever played.The level fo detail on tanks and aircraft is incredible. The fact that you can fire a round at a tank that explodes against the barrel and kills the driver with shrapnel through the roof, the fact that you can use machineguns as airbrakes, the fact that control surfaces on aircraft are modelled and are desctructible, and the fact that the mouse and keyboard control scheme for aircraft actually works are all great points in favour.The fact is, however, that literally everything about the game that isn't the act of flying a plane or driving a tank is made in the worst way imaginable.* Everything above BR 5-ish takes millions of years to unlock. Even when playing with a premium account, you're looking at weeks of playing a couple of hours per day to even unlock spare parts for a semi-modern tank. If you don't have parts and you get tracked, you won't be able to move for the rest of the game.* Whether you get to respawn or not is decided by how many spawn points you've earned. You earn spawn points for killing the enemy. So whatever side wins the initial engagement, always wins the rest of the game.* If you plane gets damaged or runs out of ammo, you need to land on an air field and repair and refit. I can count on one hand the amount of times I've had time to get back to the map after RTBing, because the matches are incredibly short.* If your team gets stomped and you miraculously have the spawn points needed to respawn, you can't choose to not respawn because you'll be unable to join a new game for ten minutes if you exit without dying with all your vehicles or running out of spawn points.* Why don't you just spawn and die, then? Because vehicles require repairs and repairs cost money. At mid-BR, repairs get insanely expensive. It is perfectly possible to get a couple of kills, capture a point or two and still end up with net negative money.* There hasn't been any changes to the above for the 2+ years I've been playing."",0"
"3302,War Thunder,2018.0,""This is a great game, it is quite fun in both Air, Ground, and soon Naval.

It currently has the community up in arms, and while I would still say the game iw worth playing, its not worth paying into unless the devs start treating the players as players, and not as some side show attraction."",0"

The graphics in this game are unbelieveable with its texture and detail of just the ground its amazing.But after all the need of the Golden Eagle(In-Game Currency)is pretty much very high,im using the British planes who made it to the tier 4 who is always struggling with In-Game Credits. im ending up bankcrupt ,this is what i fear in high tier gaming the need of a higher currency of something premium just play without any loss.      The In-Game matchmaking is one the worst that i would review,The new tier system making a lot of pro players in tier 3 and the new players who just made it to the tier 3 are very unbalanced.Considering myself using Russian tier 3 planes i see this often sometimes i get too good because of the new players that i dont like it because its not challenging enough and a whole of pro players that pretty much dominates every one but some of those pro players are positive hacker because i once  saw a low tier plane(A6MN) just ripped a wing of a well armored bomber(B-25 Mitchell) in seconds of firing it.So the match making system one of worst in War Thunder    Overall:this game is perfect for the players bored with the ordinary First Person Shooter game,a high graphic picture,its more a pay to win game    "",1"

The game run's well on pretty low end systems, and looks absolutely stunning on more powerful gaming rigs, and can be played with mouse and keyboard or joystick well (in fact, mouse and keyboard is actually easier than stick for arcade mode)An RPG style progression system means that you are always able to work towards either improving the planes and crews you have, or unlocking new ones, whilst having a very active developer means that there is always something fresh to try, and some new event or map, etc to try out, plus there's various in game achievements and decal/skin unlocks to work towards to give you a sense of direction when you want it.Freemium unlocks are well balanced, and typically provide a better range of options to a player, than any kind of """"pay to win"""" scenario you can find with some other titles.If you like flight combat sims, you need to give this a try.

It's free!The game is in itself a very well put-together masterpiece of graphics, sounds, gameplay and constant updates.It's not a perfect product by any means, as of any game. But for a completely free to play game, it is absolutely fantastic.The game evolves constantly, the vehicles that you play (including Aircraft, Tanks and soon Ships) get more modern every update. You have a massive array of vehicles to choose from, from quite a few nations, for example USSR, USA, GB, Germany etc..You start with pre WW2 vehicles and progress all the way till 1980's vehicles. If you sincerely love a certain vehicle from these war events, you can be sure to find them from the game too.The best thing about the game is the fact that your and your team's performance will be the deciding factor of the outcome of the battle. And when you play a certain vehicle you like, you start liking the look of it, the power of it and want to play more and more of that single vehicle out of hundreds of different vehicles.War Thunder battles last on average about 15 to 20 minutes. They aren't too hardcore even tho very realistic.Gaijin as a company is (most of time) a good, player caring company. The game isn't 100% balanced since some vehicles just simply perform better than others (as they did in real life). But still, the game is fun, interesting and the replayability is in it's current state"
"3316,War Thunder,2016.0,""Do not let the """"free to play"""" aspect fool you. What you don't pay with your money you pay with your health.Used to be a great game, now it's a pro-fascist propaganda tool.- Toxic community (mostly US servers)- Untolerable disbalance in favor of fascist factions in tank battles so you're stuck grinding for silver even tho grinding is already bad in the game.- Excessive grinding in rank 5 and up EVEN with premium (paid).- Overpriced content.- Biased in-game admins who block users for no other reason than to just responding into chat unless they are pro-fascist/us in which case even cursing is allowed and goes unpunished, I've seen it happen a lot.- Content milking, ie you activate a booster only to be mismatched against much higher opponents just so you can waste your boosters without profit even if you pay real money for it.- Once realistic balanced environment now makes legendary tanks look like cardboard boxes with turrets.- Limited coop which is at times severely restricted to paid content and forces players to play arcade game mode to even participate while supressing realistic gaming in the game (SB) with limited cycled events.- Installs an agent client that starts as a service. While it is only understandable that gaijin may want to grow someday and have own store like origin and uplay this agent is at times aggressive and cannot be stopped, it also conflicts with security tools.- Much more wrong with this game I won't even bother, just stay away from it.The only thing that is somewhat fun is simulator flight battles and that in particular if you play with friends, everything else has turned into toxic pool of competitive wasteland alike of cod and siege. Spare yourself and your wallet, do not make the same mistake and play something more meaningful, if this game continues on this path it will die as War Thunder within next 6-8 months."",0"
"3317,War Thunder,2018.0,""Product received for freeSpent like 50$ on this game. Unrewarding, farther you go the worst your experience gets. Dont play unless you love to getâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on from someone 2000m out. The german and russian bias is massively showing. The American tank equivilant of the German will have no penetration what so ever except the sides and back while the American tank is penetrable from any angle, from any armor plate, from any distance. Its completely unbalanced, not fun, and fuc****. If you invested time in america like me you will not enjoy casually playing. The pay to win is attrocious with tons of ways to buy your way into a high place or just completely buy an OP premium tank. DO NOT PLAY if you do not want to spend money or do not have time. It's too conveluted to even think about. The only thing this game is awesome at is the damage models and hit boxes but at the same time it fu**s over because like i said earlier before, a rank 6.7 American tank will get absolutely â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed on by a 6.7 German or Russian tank.

If you have money, you will get some op tanks or planes easilyand also russian bias everywhere.

"3321,War Thunder,2016.0,""I can't really recommend this game as long as they keep the shell bounce mechanic in.  Basically it doesn't matter if the target is paper, at certain angles you have a flat percentage to bounce a shot regardless of your penetration or the armor of the target.  Might as well be playing a dice game instead of what has been marketed as one dedicated to realism."",0"
"3322,War Thunder,2018.0,""Game really unbalanced. Mathmaking sucks with a lot of issues. Gaijin does not respond to community suggestions, complaints and requests. Also, the game is a MONEY GRABBER.

"3323,War Thunder,2017.0,""As I reached the 1,000 hour club, I think I know enough to review this game. Pros: Looks fantastic, feels realistic, great engine, tons of vehicles. Cons: TERRIBLE balance (mainly in tanks), Pay to win bush camo, massive grind fest (tanks), smallish player base (mainly planes), questionable balance and design decisions (such as crew lock). Overwall the game is great, but there are so many flaws under the surface the really hold it back. Its not really worth getting invlovled in, unless you are a hard core plane and tank person."",0"
"3324,War Thunder,2014.0,""This game, despite being a """"MMO"""" type free to play with microtransactions, blew me away. The graphics are stunning, the physics are very realistic, the planes are beautiful, and the combat envrionment is well balanced. Bravo to Ganjin here. This is a truly beautifull game. In my opinion, the  best part is that it if one wishes not to participate in the microtransactions, it is possible to obtain just about all of the game's content and actually compete by simply playing long enough, which is better than many other free to play's out there. Keeping in mind that this game is still in development, and balancing is constantly being reworked, it is one of the best combat flight simulator games I've played. With the planned additions of playable ground and naval units, it promises to be one of the best WW2 combat games out there. Hey, what've you got to loose anyway, it's free! Go try it out, It's got a 5/5 from me."",1"
3325,War Thunder,2018.0,The grind is even worse than before... I love this game and 99% of the time I just play custom lobbies (that systematically break and that should be reworked) because grinding a rank VI tanks is just not fun nor competitive. Listen to your players and fix your game...Honestly it would be cheaper to just buy a war thunder account with the high tier tanks you want,0
"3326,War Thunder,2018.0,""Don`t let fancy graphics fool you. You won`t gain any joy from it, and will only get irritaded by occasionally broken tank damage models, messed match making balance and flipped up vehicle research system that has severe grinding as a necessity.

VERY HEAVILY. * also with no regrets* $17,219 USD to date with almost $4K gifted threw squadrons...I have experienced the WHOLE scene from casual to highly competitive... solo, to squadrons... new member, to """"guy in charge""""....Unfortunately they are loosing me, seriously... (i'm only a very casual player now) *maybe it is life, or maybe it is GAIJIN...* (I'm inclined to think it is GAIJIN's fault as I'd rather play other games after trying to enjoy this one..)The Issues?Well they have quite seriously have gotten WORSE over time..Bugs, Vehicle matching issues, map layouts and gameplay dynamics, broken promises with naval, steep price gouging reaching out of control levels, toxic moderator and developer community, events that are unrealistic in both time and scope, forcing of a marketplace, implementation of a """"pay to play"""" model where they increasingly make it harder for people to progress in an significant way, pay to win mentality... THE LIST GOES ON...Overall the game developers have lost sight of what they set out to do, and greed and control became what they were about. It was a great expeince, but in the end simply a disppointing direction. Keep in mind that if you do get into this game, or start to become invested in it in some way... the developer and moderating community has progressed backwards... Be prepared to be very disppointed if you actually have to deal with them in anyway or want to encourage discussions or suggest ideas.My rating?4/10.... Not worth the effort needed given the direction... "",0"

Nowadays it does not do the same for me, if you want to be frustrated, angry and feel that it does not matter what you do, play this game... the bought tanks and planes are better than the regular tanks. This is the game for you if you want an elevated bloodpressure, while shooting at a tanks weakspot with ammo that go through way thicker armour than the tank has it will still go on and knock your crew out. Then you wait to be able to shoot and the other tank that should be dead kills you just before you can shoot.. it gets a bit too much when it is like that game after game after game.

"3344,War Thunder,2016.0,""Note: I have never flown, I have only played War Thunder for Ground Forces.This game has turned toâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Much like World of Tanks, if you are driving a German tank, you are not allowed to hit anything. Regardless if you have the most accurate gun in World War II, you will miss and an ISU-152 or KV-2 will just kill you while it's on the move from over 500 yards away. Despite this obvious innaccuracy, Gaijen still REFUSE to add an anti-spawnkill system for when the hordes of Russian hackers steamroll you and your team. Thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥should be illegal, it is the only product in the world that people can't stop using and paying for because it sucks.I used to like this game - World of Tanks too. Until the statistics of the tanks made no sense when compared to the actual performance of the tanks in battle. I don't care how strong the HE in the 152mm gun is, those guns were horridly innacurrate and should NOT be able to outshoot a Panther at ranges in excess of 1km. I get it, the German tanks can't be invincible and the game needs to remain competitive. But if the way of balancing the game out is to breakdown historical accuracy, then you're just admitting that you are being bias. Russian tanks were inferior to German engineering, that's why a Tiger takes up all of your spawn points in a realistic battle. If Gaijen is all about historical accuracy, why don't they fix this? I wouldn't get so frustrated if my gun - let me stress the MOST ACCURATE guns of World War II - would actually hit their target.InsteadI shootMissEnemy tank turns their turret towards meI shootHitDo no damage to a Sherman with an 88mm gunSherman shoots at me with 76mm gunHits and kills my gunner and driverCan't shoot backSit and wait for crew to switch outSherman shoots againKills me by penetrating the most heavily armored part of the tankThis is infuriating and is the overall reason why I uninstalled this game and World of Tanks. I hope both of these companies eventually go out of business."",0"
"3345,War Thunder,2017.0,""Came back after a year hiatus because there was a long list of issues I had with the game, everyone knows about the extraordinary long grinding time, which, fine its free to play, what more do you want? Wargaming's own research model isn't NEARLY as punitive for free to play players from how it feels. I don't play world of tanks, just warships, so I could be wrong on that factor 100%. Enough beating the horse. War Thunder's new matchmaking method still sucks. In fact I would go as far as to say it had gotten worse. It only seems to serve as a way to stack lower tiered players against higher tiered players (on both sides gotta get that two way action of frustration going) in order toâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥off the lower tier players into coughing up cash to tier up only to find they get matched with vehicles of a still higher tier and the cycle only ends if you cough up that dosh to tier 5 where all you have to do is worry about players like myself that suffered up to the tier 5 grind. This seems to be more of a problem for armor than it does aviation where a bit more skill appears to be involved if you are outmatched against a better performing fighter. Unless you are prepared for the level of frustration that comes before you, its best to pick a game you will actually enjoy instead of grinding frustration simulator designed to try and coerce money out of your wallet. If you don't take this seriously, the Encyclopedia Dramatica article concerning it will in fact point you in the direct of a more humerous and shockingly true overview. Don't believe me still? Play the game then re-read the article and you will smack yourself on the forehead.4/7/2018The game kept starting the launcher for something I thought I uninstalled, turns out if you use steam, it will delete the files used to install via steam, but everything that the launcher installed stays in a folder that was 17 GB and continued to keep launching the launcher whenver I logged into my computer, unchecked the """"auto-start"""" option, which didn't work, deleted the registry for startup via CCleaner which didnt work and would reassign itself to launch at the start of logging in, so I deleted the whole folder which solves the problem. As it would turn out, this is a result of lazy developers producing rootkit tier programming. I still dont reccomend the game, this sore spot aside, due to apperent imbalances with maps that they know have problems."",0"
"3346,War Thunder,2017.0,""Do not play Ground Forces unless you plan to play the Russians or Allies.The state of sim and realistic tank battles is awful, I haven't won a game as the Axis in months because the tanks you face at around 6-8 battle rating as the Germans is ridiculous. You will be facing T-44's and OBJ 120's in your Panther and KT, you will get shredded. Russian bias isn't a meme in this game."",0"
"3347,War Thunder,2016.0,""Used to play this game every day despite the frustration of trying to tier up non Russian tanks. As has been said many times in these reviews, the dev is russian and their bias towards Russian tanks in the game is obvious. You can also fight in the sky in this game, but i never bothered much with that part of the game because the tank sim side was so well done. I enjoyed running circles around enemy tanks in my T-50 and blowing them all to bits (lower tier russian tank that was still op in that Tier)However the latest patch just broke any will i had to play the game anymore, actually in my opinion it broke the (tank sim) game completely and turned off a lot of long time players from wanting to play it anymore. (me included) Forcing lower tier tanks to fight the highest Tier removed any fun factor from the game. Essentially, if your not a top tier Russian tank, but from the lower tier you will be forced into this match making system where you are as good as cannon fodder (does not matter how skilled you are, your shells will simply deflect off the higher tier tanks and do 0 damage. ww2 tanks vs. cold war tanks. Only play the ground game in war thunder if you plan on only ranking up Russian tanks, since devs seem to want to hinder the growth of their own game by creating over powered russian tanks and the recent update of the matchmaking system completely broke the later stages of the game. Otherwise graphics are great, sound effects and being able to fighter bomber missions against opposing tanks during the round makes war thunder a unique ww2 tank sim that is worth the try, just beware of the broken match making system in higher tiers."",0"
"3348,War Thunder,2017.0,""the reasone i dont like wt is the Gaijin.net agent. its litterally a seed in a system since if you delete the game, the so called """"agent"""" keeps updating it, wich will take away your system storage. its basiccly malware, ofcourse the game isnt bad, but if you dont want not intentional malware... wich is still intentional btw, dont install it."",0"
3349,War Thunder,2017.0,It's planes or tanks.  The plane sim is pretty poor.  For the price of a premium plane you can buy IL-2 1946 or cliffs of Dover.  Both are much much better.  So it's a no unless you have no money at all and want to get one shotted by fully upgraded fighters while your in a biplane.EditWARNINGThis game installs a hidden launcher on your computer.  You cannot view i9t through windows control panel and you can only get rid of it by manually deleting the registry.  Do not Download.  This game is basically a virus.,0
"3350,War Thunder,2017.0,""This game has serious balance issues. If you're playing mid battle ranked german ground forces, get ready to be horribly disappointed. Late WW2 german armor is forced to face cold war era vehicles, in all ground forces game modes. Map position of cap zones don't factor at all the fact that almost all allied vehicles are far faster than axis vehicles, and will almost always capture points first. There's also a heavy pay to win with premium camoflague options that almost guarantee you the drop in every encounter. For both air and ground, since i've begun playing i've noticed a bias for russian vehicles. it's even been noted in previous patches that unfair and unrealistic buffs have been given to team russia. this game fills a niche for me that no other game can, but unless all nations can get a fighting chance at the win, it becomes less and less enjoyable.Presently, recommending this game to a friend is like telling them to get cancer so you're not the only one who has it."",0"
3351,War Thunder,2018.0,Alot of people who review this do so in the sense of did i enjoy the game?

(where is my t-34 breaking down because of their shoddy mass production) So 5.5/10 for me. Too much pay too win and not enough motivation for me to keep it going.,0
3352,War Thunder,2018.0,Product received for freeDo not pay for anything in this game.

"3353,War Thunder,2017.0,""Good game but now it's really starting to get bad, i mean really bad. In the """"Tank Realistic Battles"""" you can choose PLANES in a TANK game mode, same with Arcade and Simulator, so people will just take out planes in a TANK game and use rockets/bombs on the vehicles. Before too long the WHOLE enemy team is planes and they rocket/bomb you so much to the point you cant respawn.... Sure people say """"that defeats the purpose of AA"""" well, im okay with one enemy plane of their choice, maybe two if it's a full game. But all 8-10 of the enemies just bombing you and you can't do too much because they all target AA first. Then they go for everyone else...

Gaijin's entire monetary gain is based on your own frustration and bottlenecking you to put money down. You can play, sure, without spending any money, that's what I do, but the amount of time and effort you're going to expend: it's going to be at least 2x that of a premium player, and god forbid you want to try any vehicle that is premium based. Entire sections of the game (such as Italian tanks, most lend-lease/captured vehicles, certain camouflages, etc) are totally locked from players unless they drop real world cash on it or spends INSANE amounts of time on wagers which are extremely unreliable in themselves.Unlike most other games that these days encourage more """"sportsmanlike"""" fighting, Gaijin is the exact opposite: punishing victims of teamkillers and rammers, encouraging spawn camping (both ways) and moreover empowering wallet warriors. From throwing coupons at you, to pointing out every game """"Here's what you would get if you were premium"""", to parts/FPS/re-crewing grinding, and more... Gaijen has largely by far created a game that doesn't extract money by tricking you into lootboxes, or loud showy sounds or other psychological trick: it's often """"Pay with your wallet or patience.""""I won't tell you to not play it, because it can be fun, I find it fun, I really do: but frankly, if you want a dev that actually cares about player feedback, don't play this game. If you want a game that is fully free to play, don't play this game. I could go on but... this became a dead horse beating.The fact of the matter is:For the love of god don't give Gaijin your money. They do not need any more encouragement. They really don't. Seriously. It's to such a point that you can find statements from Gaijjn employees that basically conflate player frustration / """"grind"""" with profits. And if you're rich and you think this game is for you: don't be fooled. Even for the """"whales"""", you'll feel the sting of things because notice how I haven't said, it's """"pay to win"""". Because it's not: moreover, it's """"pay to avoid spending excess time"""". You can buy the most expensive things in the game, you could buy every last bit of content in the game with real world cash, and ultimately, it won't give you any increase in skill or anything. You'll still find yourself sucker punched in spawn by a guided rocket, you'll still find yourself being dove on by a Chalka, you'll still get that single bullet hitting you that splits your aircraft in two.So just... play it, don't play it... just don't give Gaijin more of your cash until they stop abusing the player base.Because really, for those who actually shell out cash to this game, it's always an abusive cycle of...Legitimate Complaints -> Introduce Shiny New Vehicles -> Add More Microtransactions -> Legitimate Complaints.It's an abusive cycle, and frankly: it's only going to sour Gaijin and the player base more as it repeats."",0"
"3355,War Thunder,2016.0,""Product received for freeOKAY AFTER 570 HOURS IN THE GAME I RECOMMEND THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ OUT OF THIS GAME. If that didnt get you to install war thunder, then INSTALL WAR THUNDER YOU FOOL. It's a free game so why not ? Well One reason not to is because you will get so addicted to it you will litterally forget the name """"World of Tanks"""". It COMPLETELY overshadows Wargaming in every way, and now with the 1.77 patch i can safely say it is ONE OF not THE BEST games i have ever played. Okay i mentioned Why you should get the game, now time for the juicy inside scoop of what comes after. WELL MY FREIND, you have much more than a Random number generator with Health bars. that it's competitor provides.... This game uses a full indepth x-ray modular system where every shot counts. Shoot the driver and that tank can't go anywhere until he is replaced, but be carefull he can still shoot back. WAY better than a health bar. Now take that idea and expand it to the whole tank, then add in differant shells like High Explosive that Don't penetrate the tank but give the enemy crew a bad headache, and worse if the crew aren't hidden behind armour. High Explosive Anti Tank that the germens use, litterally oneshots everything and good at range but expensive.So if the gameplay's good, Graphics ? Well it's not Next gen, but u don't need next gen in a competative environment, u need framerate, and trust me the options always allow you to have a great framerate with great graphics. Although it won't look that great like modern titles if you don't have a monster PC, your in the heat of battle and won't look at the small details when ur panicing that, that guy over there just set you on fire.WELL, DID I MENTION THIS GAME IS TANKS, PLANES AAAND SHIPS ? Well now i did ... Think of it as a Mega Wargaming â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ u as a World of Tanks / Warplanes and / Warships. It completes the 3 battle princaple of Air, ground and sea and it comes together perfectly. As in Applejacks words, think of a WW2 simulator game as a apple pie, you can have amazing apples, and a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together can you have a perfect apple pie.So It's got WW2 Ships planes and tanks. That all ? NOPE. There are Pre war tanks that you start with, and cold war behemoths. This game spans are large time period and when you think you've got a amazing tank, it get's better.But be warned, this game Isn't balanced, NO not in the slightest. Despite Gaijin's best attempts, at the moment, certain machines stand out at their ranks. But just like real life some may say. Well i agree a little, there's a way arround these players with a unfair advantage. Outsmart them. But you can't most of the time so that annoys me too. I can't play with freinds on this game for long periods of time because they get SO angry and just ragequit."",1"

I've spent money and I don't regret it, because it did bring me fun times, but it's gone too far now. Instead of fixing the obvious issues the game has, they keep adding stupid things. Italian tanks and French planes? While the IS6 is still overpowered? Tier 6 tanks? Really? While the top tier of Italian planes gets better versions of American planes than the Americans have THEMSELVES?!?! The game used to be good, but this is too far.

This game literally says â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ You to players with non-russian vehicle.Also Gaijin seems to release new contents A LOT, but misses out on fixing current balance and bugs currently ingame. Things that exist years ago are not fixed. Not to mention their horrible server. In Battle.net I get 50 pings playing in American server from Asia. In War Thunder I get 100 ping playing in Asain server.I can keep ranting for a lot longer, but this is enough."",0"
"3364,War Thunder,2016.0,""Very fun game.. At first. The first few planes and tanks you play are quite fun. And then you start to unlock more planes and tanks and this is were the fun ends. You see there arent enough players to fill a battle in a timely manner so they squash tiers together to make things move along faster. In theory this may sound like a good idea. Until you get repeatedly 1 shot killed by the higher tier over and over again. And at the higher tiers there arent enough players to fill a battle so the highest ranked players go to the lower tiers and smash the new players with their fully upgraded planes and tanks with fully upgraded crews. Basically this means the newer players get frustrated and quit so there are no new players making it to the higher tiers. Its a vicious circle I guess. You cant get a game in a reasonable time at the higher tiers so they play lower tier games crushing and frustrating the new players so they dont make it to the higher tiers so there arent enough players to play in the higher tiers. The solution the moderators give in help chat, spend real money to upgrade your stuff, lol. So yeah thats pretty much War Thunder in a nutshell."",0"

"3369,War Thunder,,""few years back (2012) when I started playing this game it had a great promise, it looked great and it was better experience than World of Tanks (i.e. less grindy, reasonably monetized) Now this game has no good features in it that it had back then. It is extremely grindy and addition of more and more vehicles/planes/ships into it only makes it worse. It has no balance. It has 1.5 game modes which are """"capture and hold the objective"""" and for the planes there is also """"destroy/bomb enemy vehicles/objectves"""". The lack of modes makes this game extremly repetitive.In monetization Gaijin can compete with Bethesda or EA. They ask 80 Euro for Premium Account for one year. 80 Euro for a game that is filled with grind and repetitiveness.Promised at the wery beginning of the developement of this game """"World War mode"""" is nowhere to be seen or heard about. And I'm mentioning it because this mode could've brought some much needed action into this stagnating game.I can continue describing all the issues of this game but it will take much-much more of my time and letters to type in and I think that what I have written should be enough for whoever reads this to make up their minds.Final verdict: This game, and developers behind these game are not worth your time/money."",0"

Nearly a whole year has passed and no mention has been made regarding this problem by the company.BY no means do the issues end with this particular vehicle, they extend to Battle Ratings of the vehicles (something as levels when it comes to which vehicles you face), wrong shells, wrong payload when it comes to bombers, wrong armor values, etc. And the best of it? well, the answer to this problems is simply add new content to try to attract a newer player base into the game, and simply ignore the most experienced and veteran player base, who fed up with the issues, will end up leaving.To be clarified: I do NOT have 23.1 hours into this game, I simply reinstalled the game not long ago and gave it another try, I have been around since 2013.I still play the game, but only in custom battles, as I have been fed up with the other aspects of the game.

So no i cant recomend this game not untill a massive reduction in grind time.Its a chame tho becasue the game is sound and fun and all the developers would have to do is too make an effort to reduce tyhe grind in a big way which could be as simple as the removal of silver lions or a massive and i mean massive reduction in research and lions costs. I know the entire community agrees with me on this so i dont see why the devs arent smart enough too see that their game will die without it. I mean just reed the recent reviews FFS.

The game is beautiful, the number of planes that are playable is unparalleled, and this is one of the only games of this type with a big enough community to support unique competitive play.That being said, I can no longer support Gaijin or War Thunder with my time or my money. The developers of this game have made abundantly clear that the community has no place in making decisions about the game. The game has on going issues that have been asked time and time again to be fixed to no reply of gaijins. The game has huges issues of balance and BR compression forcing terribly unmatched vehicles against each other. Entire classes of aircraft, namely bombers and attackers, are completely useless in popular Air RB mode again with no solution in sight. Hit boxes on ground targets are broken, bombs have been nerfed into the ground.... the list of flaws with the game goes on many of them having been brought to the developer's attention YEARS ago. YEARS. That is how long we have been waiting on some fixes. The air to air gameplay was engaging enough that much of this was tolerable. However the straw that broke the camel's back is the outright greed of the developers that was put on display on their twitch prime stream. It is abundantly clear the developers only want to milk us for all the cash we're worth with no intention of giving us a fun balanced game that is healthy in the long run.

Overall this game has been good to me and i have been getting 6 kills per game, but i only gain 1,000 research from that. The tank aspect of this game is... decent.

VERY OPTIMIZED if you ask me!4, Great system for purchases and research, yes you can buy the Golden Eagles, but play and you'll get enough RP and Silver lions, just not the premium tanks.(They're pay for items, but they gotta make money somehow!)Overall I have enjoyed this so far, okay, sometimes you get hit and that's it for that tank, but smile, watch the kill cam, and start afresh in your 'super tank'!!Go on, give it a go, you maybe surpised!!"",1"
"3395,War Thunder,2016.0,""Airplanes Side Review:      The Game has 3 modes to play with the airplanes in a big vereity of maps and modes. You can play Arcade mode, Realistic mode, and Simulator mode. I strongly recomend this game for any level of dogfighters because the Arcade is to easy for everyone to learn and the Realistic/Simulator mode is so good fitting for Veteran Players of dogfighting simulators.Tankdriving Side Review:     Again There are 3 modes to play the only difference is the simulator of the Tanks has a limmited amount of different tanks as its to be a Historical mode so to say you wont see a Mouse Tank on a simulator or any cold war tanks. Except if you play on a special event that happens every few weeks/monthsIn a nutshell this game is all about realistic fights (you might die in a 1 hit but you might get hit like a thousent times). For all those players looking for a better game then WoT That there are no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥t ammo that some tanks didnt even carried, an Engine that will block shots if you lay your tank correct in the battlefield.

"3397,War Thunder,2018.0,""Beautiful game with a much more interesting gameplay than WoT, but two big problems take the fun out of it.It's as grindy as a single game can get. You need weeks of continuous play if you want to get anywhere without investing money. I understand that there needs to be some form of grind in order to make the game interesting but this is just too much. I can't even begin to understand the amount of work you need to get to the higher tier tanks or planes of more than one country. Also, if you plan on taking the shortcut and pay money to research and buy vehicles, be ready to pay hundreds of euros for that. You can't streamline it since you need to research a certain number of vehicles before you're allowed to even start research on the next tiers stuff. That means you will be spending money on things you don't really want which is especially infuriating because the high requirements of research points mean you will sink A LOT of money into this. Additionally, since you're taking a shortcut and don't get the ingame currency from playing, after researching you probably have to pay even more so that you can actually use what you researched.You will be quick to reach tier 2 with the first somewhat cool vehicles, but from there on your progress will slow down and the really cool stuff is locked behind millions of research points and ingame currency.As if that wasn't enough there are severe problems with the matchmaking, especially when playing tanks. The game has no problems with adding tanks to a game that are one tier above your vehicle. In fact it seems as if that is the standard matchmaking because it happens almost everytime. One tier doesn't sound like much, but trust me, it is. You can't get through the armor of these tanks while their weapons can one-shot you. Yes, you probably have some higher tier tanks in your team as well, but since these are most likely somewhere else cutting through the enemy team since nothing but a lucky hit can stop them, you're now facing an opponent with better armor and better weapons on your own. For the most part these tanks will cut through your team since nothing but a lucky hit can stop them.I like the idea of a more realistic approach to tank warfare, I really do. The game does a great job of immersing you in exciting battles and offers different gamemodes so that a casual game AND a true tank simulation are possible depending on what you like better. The matchmaking, however, is game breaking in my oppinion. Once in a while you will be the lucky person that is in a higher tier than most your enemies, but since you will then have the means to steamroll the enemies if you play it smart, that's not terribly fun, too. In between these matches will be many moments when you're unlucky, meet one of the higher tier enemy tanks and get destroyed in one shot without even doing damage to the enemy.The rage quit potential is high with this one!"",0"
"3398,War Thunder,,""game used to be fun but has turned into an endless grind with a heavy focus on microtransactions to speed it up. Also the game has literally no attempt at balance OR realism, with 20mm machineguns out-damaging 100mm+ shells in the naval battles, and some ships being stuck at 10mph (while everyone else is at 40+, meaning you never even SEE an opponent half the time)."",0"
"3399,War Thunder,2018.0,""War Thunder was a game I enjoyed for many years, I made many friends playing this game and had great times. But these past couple years the game has been deteriorating rapidly, Gaijin has been neglecting what the community wants and needs. They have been implementing more and more premium vehicles into the game (which I am not necessarily against) but by doing so they have been letting new players get to the higher tiers, they have gone against their old saying of not letting people buy in to tier 5 instead of earning it. Worst of all, Gaijin has recently mocked their own community with the FPE & Parts debacle. Gaijin has consistently failed to mend damage with the community, and instead are seeking profits rather than a healthy game. While I do understand that the whole business is to make money, it is sad to see a game that the company once seemed they loved and had passion for is now another money making sham. If you want to play this game, go ahead, I imagine you will enjoy tier 1 and 2 but it is not worth putting your money in to, it is not worth putting a lot of energy and love in to."",0"

"3402,War Thunder,2018.0,""Despite having a good engine with beautiful graphics and huge potential, the game's success is squandered by developer greed. Vehicles require the research and purchase of modules in order to get up to their historical strength (otherwise you're playing a run-down version of the vehicle) and the amount of time spent to try and even reach a competitive level without paying lots of money is huge - in some cases, hundreds of battles (A battle can last between 5-60 minutes, generally).The game is built this way so you're encouraged to spend money to progress, especially towards the end of the tech trees - and this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's so ridiculously difficult to even break even at top tier that's it's unfair. A lot of players with premium will very likely never unlock half the vehicles in the game without playing for years.And the maps are totalâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥in some cases - Often you can be killed just after leaving your spawn, and their are excellent places for other teams to wait around your spawn location and kill you the second you spawn."",0"

I'm loosing intrest to play this game because of that and can't recommend anyone to play this AFK simulator.One other issue I found out is the massive flaw in matchmaking, game puts up teams that are heavily underpowered against a much higher tier setup, in this scenario enemy tanks are basically invincible and everyone just sits back in spawn and wait for the game to end."",0"

Sadly the monetization model is in the vein of most egregious mobile games, with grind being just tedious enough to make you want buy coins at lower levels, and so absurd at higher tiers that coins become necessary.  I'd keep clear of the game if you don't feel like spending multiples of $60 on just one game to get to unlock new vehicles and upgrades."",0"
"3406,War Thunder,2018.0,""The game has a lot of potential to one of, if not the best of its kind, but its all wasted because the unbelievable amount of greed and neglect by the Developers. Time and time again they have showed that they do not care about their player base one bit. And the way Gaijin liesm misstreat their players on their official forums and cencor feedback if its not positive and praising their game is simply unacceptable and so there is no way i could ever recommend this game to anyone unless a lot of things change, and considering the way Gaijin operates, that is beyond unlikely currently."",0"

"3408,War Thunder,,""IÂ´ve played this game for quite some time now, as you can see. And while I proceeded in the game, I started to notice some very bad things. Firstly, the grinding: I understand that it takes some time to unlock a new vehicle, but without multipliers it took me almost two months to unlock the Tiger, in the German tech tree, but its only in the middle of it! The grind also is very frustrating, if you research a vehicle but you dont have enough money to actually BUY it. I once spent a big amount of ingame money to level up my crew until I was pretty much broke. I thought I could regain that money with playing some matches, but the exact opposite happened. Since that time I ve been in a constant state of poverty or extreme grinding.Secondly, the matchmaking and battlerating-system. Both dont work an are complete nonsense. Example: My Tiger H1 has the battlerating 5.7. There are many vehicles with this battlerating or just some that the Tiger actually fought in WW2. Do I get to fight these? No, of course not! It could be to easy for me! I got uptiered to 6.7 EVERY time! And which tanks are on this battlerating, you may ask. The Tiger 2 for example, but also Tanks like the Pershing. The second of these was desinged to kill Tigers in one shot and withstand their 88mm gun. So, could I as a Tiger kill a Perhing? From the side at a 5m distance maybe, but never in a head on fight. In addition to that I have to say, that there is a russian bias in the game, because the grind for russian vehicles is much shorter and you can just go in like: RUSH Bâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Thirdly the historical accuracy: This also has an impact on point 2. Many vehicles, that never or rarely fought each other, have the same battlerating! So youre going to fight them. This is very frustrating, cuz sometimes you fight a 50s MBT like the Centurion MK 1 in an early 1942 Panzer 4. I dont think I have to elaborate this point any further. I just want to say that my Panzer 4 is at 4.5 and the Centurion MK1 at 5.7 (the same BR as the Tiger, which he also never fought, but was desinged to defeat it).Fourth point: Air combat. In one sentence. Boring and empty, also with massive uptiers and ahistorical fights.Conclusion: It is no bad game, in fact I like it very much, but it needs some big fixes and balancing. Also the realistic combat system is also extremely cool, but sometimes it just doesnt work. And also the tech trees are full of different variants of the same vehicle which just arent different from eachother. Id say: Give it a try, but dont expect a lot from it."",0"

Just Scroll below for the German version.English :First of all i have to say i like the details, graphics and the atmosphere which you can experience in Warthunder.But this game has failed at one point : Matchmaking. The only tier you can have fun with is the highest Tier because then you know that the enemy has simliar equipment  like you and the fight is won by skill. If you want to play any other (lower) tier and enjoy the older models you always get destroyd by superior armory which you cant even scratch. This takes all the fun and seriously this problem does not exist since yesterday and i dont think its a big deal to change this so i have to make this negative review.German :Ich bewundere bei War Thunder die Grafik, die Liebe zum detail und vorallem die AtmosphÃ¤re!Aber dieses Spielt hat ein groÃŸes Problem: Das Matchmaking.

Genau das passiert nÃ¤mlich in den ganzen Tiers darunter was dem ganzen Spiel den SpaÃŸ nimmt. Ich wÃ¼rde so gern mit den Ã¤lteren Modellen fahren und spielen. Aber wenn man dann gnadenlos zerstÃ¶rt wird von einem Panzer der 3 Tiers Ã¼ber einem selbst ist macht es keinen SpaÃŸ mehr.

"3416,War Thunder,2018.0,""Graphics are great but if you want to see the enemy Tanks you can just use low settings and all the foliage is removed. This game is so free they incorporated a setting that would get you perma banned in other Tank or FPS games. The Tank maps are some of the worst I have seen in a game, with so many years they have not a single good map and the Assault maps are the worst by far. Also on the Assault map the enemy Bot Tanks seem to have little problem pulling of shots while driving from almost a kilometer away with rank 1-2 Tanks.Low Rank/Non upgraded Tanks also have this unrealistic thing that they can't turn unless going forward or reversing, which creates frustrating situations.The grind is there, for what ever reason I need to grind out 6 Tanks before I can buy a next rankTank, its the law? No matter that there isn't a single Tank I want from the current rank, still got to grind out 6 to move on. They are not all in the same line, so you got to research at least one line more from Rank 1 so that you have enough lines open to research 6 Tanks.Go figure how many players will do that and not move on to the next game where epics are free to pick up.TL"

I purchased a premium membership and nothing changed. Everytime I get shot down it's by a guy 2-3 tiers above me in a vastly superior plane. Matchmaking needs to be better (I.E tier 2 fly against other tier 2's) but it appears that's not of concern for Gaijin. Since I work and have some semblence of a life then apparently this is not the game for me since I require another three months of watching youtube video's and playing to even begin having success. There are dozens upon dozens of bad reviews regarding this game and all are centered around the 1.37 update which made me realize that it wasn't all my fault as to why I wasn't having success at this game. The comparisons to a """"hedge fund"""" and """"ponzi scheme"""" are accurate and I'm officially boycotting this game until these issues are fixed.The concept is great concerning the vintage WWII planes. Soundtrack and graphics are also appealing.

I don't know what sick joke people play by telling people mouse mode is good, but it's awful. You don't have a direct feel for how much you're banking at any given moment and it's very difficult to get the reticle to line up for a lead shot. Most games you'll just spend your time circling an enemy, or if you try for a head on engagement you'll likely be rammed as death by plane collision is extremely common and some try to do it on purpose (Take out a bomber which is hard to shoot down by ramming it). The playerbase is not very helpful, and no one really helps out. You're most likely to be greeted with """"lol l2plane"""" verbatim if you ask questions.The Realistic and Simulator modes resolve some of these issues, but the game controls still feel bad in mouse mode. My joystick hasn't arrived yet, but based on comments from many in the community mouse mode is easier than joystick mode so I doubt honestly it will get much better with a joystick. There are far less players in the realistic and simulator modes as well.Balancing is also an issue. There are some entire nations which perform far below others. Most players would say to play Russian and British planes and avoid Axis planes because they're not too good. At the starter tier, the Chaika a soviet plane is the most decried overpowered plane in the game. A high turn rate, biplane which fires 4 deadly cannons at a very rapid rate which can quickly take out the other planes at the tier and even many that are higher than it. Matchmaking will suddenly ramp the difficulty up for you significantly and start introducing you to many bombers and fighters as well as many strong ground targets which need large bombs to take out. At this point, you have nothing but light guns to shoot at ground targets and light bombs. This means you'll be forced to slug it out with the stronger planes, which you will likely lose to since they have superior guns. The overall process of getting to your next plane is very painful and doesn't feel well implemented. There are many things you can research, but the game presents them in a haphazard way that doesn't make much sense. Some tier 1 planes can't be researched, but then others can and after a random other plane is researched then a new one can be researched that is in no way related. The game's research tree is confusing, as much of the rest of the game is even to someone who knows what to look for.I spent a fair amount of time trying to give this game a chance, and it's just the most frustrating game experience I've had. Wouldn't recommend at all. If you're looking at this compared to Wargaming's games, this is way more pay to win model as you don't get any free XP (RP in this game) and with the premium currency you could easily skip up to a higher tier plane. I have played maybe 50-75 matches and I have 50k free RP that if I spent premium currency on I could unlock probably a tier 3 plane (The game has 5 tiers with multiple planes within the same tier). This game strongly rewards those who spend money, far more than a Wargaming game and it will likely prove frustrating for a player that's not hardcore into air combat and is honestly not that satisfying for someone who is interested in air combat given realistic and simulator modes are the modes you would want to always choose. A sidenote about those modes too, the matches are very long. The timer for realistic matches (More realistic than arcade but not as hardcore as simulator) is 60 minutes, to the generally 15-25 minute timer for arcade matches. The arcade mode to me just feels very off, and the difficulty curve into the realistic mode is much higher which makes it more difficult to grind for your next plane.UPDATESo I've heard about the ground combat. I decided to try it out and see if that was any better, of course World of Tanks is the first thing to compare it to. You start out in a lowly tank with a weak gun, but you face similar tanks and all is fairly fun. Arcade mode numbs down the difficulty a bit too much since you can immediately see where the enemy tanks are even if they're in heavy cover. Realistic mode is a bit too punishing though. Unfortunately if you're moderately decent at all, you get up-tiered because of your skill level very quickly and then you'll be facing off against tanks you can't hurt. So you'll find yourself cornered on maps, with no teammates (team work in this game is somehow even more non-existant than World of Tanks, likely due to the large maps and spread out goals). Often times flanking the enemy tank and shooting the rear doesn't even work. After a dozen matches of losing and being wiped out, with minimal XP gains, I just gave up again. You also get to worry about planes bombing you at any moment, as if the overpowered tanks you can't hurt aren't enough.Gaijin is never going to improve this game, clearly they've decided they want their game to be this """"realistic"""" game that they won't back down from. Once again, realistic mode is far more sparsely populated than arcade though - and I think this is a huge mistake. Arcade mode is basically what World of Tanks is, though it has more enjoyable gameplay. War Thunder's ground combat is sloppy and feels like a mess. This game is a pretty big download and an even bigger disappointment for all the hype it receives. If you want ground combat, stick to World of Tanks (though I can't honestly recommend that anymore, teamplay is so awful there that matches are rarely fun anymore). We're sorely lacking a good game in this space now, but the choices are to make do with Gaijin and Wargaming's very mediocre games or do without. Frankly, I'd rather do without - these are just exercises in frustration and time wasting.5/4/18 Update:So the plane combat is still awful. Tank combat felt a little better than before, but the entire way this game plays is awful. I stopped playing World of Tanks a few years ago due to decline in its quality but looks like War Thunder is dying off and is doing much worse. Don't waste your time on this game, there is just nothing of value gained from it. I feel ripped off of the time I wasted on this even for free."",0"
"3426,War Thunder,2015.0,""This was a lot better than i expected. i HATE these type of games but this was perfectly put together. very cool battles, nicely balanced, easy to learn controls. im not a fan of the very non-user friendly menu! but for a free game? YOU MUST TRY IT!"",1"
"3427,War Thunder,2015.0,""Currently the game is no longer fun. Gaijin is just â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over the entire community (unless your russian) and only see's us for the money in our wallet. We have been bring up, pointing out, and suggesting things to fix and make the game better but the game has only goten worse. The only thing that gaijin has done to make it seem like they 'might' pay any attention to what we say is the creation of the player counsel. However this counsel has as about as much power as a middle school student counsel. Oh, by the way, they are under a NDA which makes them completely worthless to begin with. An obvious and clear bias for russian players and vehicles has been present for years now with no desire of changing that from Gaijins part. The T-34-85 for example very rarely catches fire, explodes after getting its ammo racks hit repeatedly, and seems to have some kind of internal explosion dampener to lower the effects of any round that makes it inside the tank. There was recently a poll on their fourms started by players to change the battle ratting from a 1.0 spread between vehicles to .7. so for example tiger II's dont have to fight tanks from the korean war. Last i checked the poll was at about 3,100 for yes and ~30 for no. Gaijin has offically stated they will not change the BR system and that it is perfectly fine. Despiste this poll showing that we the players strongly disagree.If you insist on playing this game the only way you will have fun after about tier 3 is playing russian vehicles. Also on a observasional note, the amount of premium vehicles for russia is massively dispraportional to the other nations. Just saying, they seem to be paying more attention to (a) certain nation than others.As the game is i simply cannot reccomend you join and waste you'r money on a company that clearly has a negative bias to anything not russian. The only reason i have not stoped playing thisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥completely is because there is no other alternative game that can reasonably compete with it."",0"
"3428,War Thunder,2016.0,""I've played this game for years and I used to really enjoy it, but the times have changed. Gaijin openly censores any critique of this game on the forums. Gaijin constantly adds things to the game that players dont want. Gaijin never listens to the community. Gaijin doesn't ever fix broken flight models or test their aircraft before they patch them into the game. Gaijin pits first era jets against Sabers, Mig 15's, Hunters, etc and refuses to rebalance or address issues that the community points out. Gaijin rarely adds any new game modes or changes anything about the game. Gaijin likes to take your money and give you nothing in return. Gaijin wants to ruin the game they worked so hard on creating.

The crew who operates the tanks are another seperate entity requiring leveling to make the tank work better as well.

"3432,War Thunder,2016.0,""Yes, the game is really fun and addictive.  At 918+ hours I can say it is a true pay to win game.  I do not recommend this game unless you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or more on upgrades so you can at least have a fair chance against the other players who have  crews and or gear that can only be purchased with real money.  There is nothing wrong with using real money to buy stuff in a game but, when it comes to paying for XP so that you can lvl up your crews for the needed bonuses it adds up to a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ ton of nickel and dimes.  You will earn those same XP during each match, but at the rate of around 10 to 20 xp.  It takes several hundred if not thousands of xp to train one of around 25 skills (in Tank battles).  Good luck earning XP by just playing.  Long story short, this game sucks for PVP because of pay to win.  But is the best I have seen in a while for what I call eye candy (realistic looking models and FX)  and in single player mode, you can really take the time to enjoy what the game has to offer.PS.

"3434,War Thunder,2017.0,""I have no clue why people say war thunder is bad, in my opinion it's the best free game out there. People are really stupid to stay that the grind """"is long"""". Let's say you want to get soviet jets, and your saying it's too long, your best is about tier 2 aircraft. The thing is, just use a premium aircraft or premium account, yes you can get premium for free. Unlike world of tanks where premium vehicles cost really money or """"gold"""" to convert xp for vehicles, in war thunder it's not like that. If you have a premium vehicle, you get 2x of lions and xp, just research the aircraft you want/tanks and it will be 2x faster. Have premium and it's 3x faster. Sure you can spend a little to get your grind fast, but there is also boosters that you get all the time. My point is people who say the grind is long they are pure idiots. And people who keep saying they get overtired and they always lose, it's because they don't know how to use their vehicle properly. In war thunder, you need practice and use everything you have(boosters, premium account) to their full advantage. And you will surely get that vehicle you always wanted."",1"
"3435,War Thunder,2018.0,""Absolutely not worth your time, I promise you. The game is made so that you will be outgunned 9/10 games and you roam from match to match losing all your tanks immediately.THE SHELL HASNT DONE ANY DAMAGE voice line will be burned into your â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing brain.From my experience I feel as if the game is purposefully gimping you (with the already â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ dice rolls, this game HEAVILY relies on luck).The game is based around a BR system x.0 x.3 x.7 (1.0 1.3 1.7) and you can be match with tanks based off your highest tank up or down 1 point of BR which is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing broken most of the time. I'd like to see tanks around my level or one above/below mine. Instead the game will actively match you with entire teams that are 1 whole br above you, meaning your best tank is worthless. If your best tank is worthless, all the ones below it are useless. The SECOND I researched a tank past 3.0 (3.7) I immediately saw an insane rise in my BR (Battle rating) versus everyone else. Once in a blue moon I can penetrate the tanks I find, otherwise I am either getting â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ed by enemy armor or my own team not defending a point. I went from getting 5-10 kills a match to getting maybe 1 or 2. Sometimes 0.This is not a matter of skill because I can outflank the enemy team like a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing mythical Norse god and still be useless because I put two shells into the perfect spots and still cant kill a tank, while this guys brigade of super heavy 4.7 tanks turn around andâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥all over me. I cant count the number of times I've seen a tank destroyer pop into view and immediately delete me with a god shot from across the map, mostly relying on luck because he just shot me through 40 â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing trees.Arcade is â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing useless, it takes the luck based combat system and multiplies it by 500. If there is a direct drawable line between you and an enemy tank, you both are immediately spotted and your name shows up to everyone in the game. The second your name pops up 15 tanks turn their guns and start trying to lob a god damn HEAT shell with the accuracy Gungnir. If you even attempt realistic without 3000 hours invested expect to be outmatched heavily in any tier. If you even manage to kill a tank this dude with every â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing aircraft in the game will just come back and bomb you, robbing you any chance of having fun.So they almost have a good game here. But they wont fix the dice rolling, they wont fix theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥matchmaking range, they wont fixâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥to make a good game. I dont mind the grind at all (Which becomes apparently exponentially higher in the later tiers). They wont because it heavily insentivizes people to get premium and buy their way through the grind, in a hope to match the tank that just killed them with a flick and swish of their 105mm wand. It is such an incredibly fustrating and unrewarding experience once they've roped you in long enough that the stress at attempting that 1/10 game is not worth it. I rarely got matched with high BR until I really got into the game. Dont even get me started on the even more unfair air battles and having your pilot get shot out of the cockpit with a single â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing stray bullet.I would support this game heavily if they could just fix the matchmaking rigging they've got going on.Edit: Tanks (and aircraft) are ALSO seperated in ranks. These ranks hardly indicate much except you are climbing by about 1.7-2.7 in BR"

"3452,War Thunder,2018.0,""This game is absolute trash, and a truly disgraceful showing from the creators of one of the most prolific WWII flight sims of all time (IL-2 Sturmovik).Being roughly cut from the same cloth as other flight sims, it's hard to explain to those not accustomed to the genre just why this game is a freemium disaster. Let's put it this way: if War Thunder were a tactical FPS with a realism bent, this is what you'd get.SKILL - PERCEPTION: Research upgrades to increase your character's ability to spot targets in the field. Starting level: one eye. Level two: 8/20 vision in your single eye. Level three: basic visual acuity in your one eye. Level four: SECOND EYE ACQUIRED! Level five: You're no longer legally blind! Level six: You no longer need glasses (technically). Level seven: You can read!SKILL - STAMINA: Research upgrades to improve your ability to walk more than five steps without collapsing in a pool of your own vomit.SKILL - WEAPON HANDLING: Research upgrades so your character eventually starts pointing his weapon in the right direction.SKILL - AMMO LOADING: Research upgrades to increase your bullets' muzzle energy. Level one is equivalent to the speed of a muscle-propelled rock.SKILL - GUNSMITHING: Research upgrades to increase weapon reliability! Level one: handmade in a Columbian sweatshop out of string cheese, gorilla glue, and old socks.Imagine playing a typical FPS where everything you do is made to be as outrageously sucky as possible unless you grind hard to fix it. Yes, you are terribly gimped (to a completely and insanely unrealstic extent) unless you dig around this game's grind-sink """"research"""" tree, meaning no matter how good you are at flight simming, your """"character"""" is crippled by nonsense like this.Your plane will handle like a brick with wings, in kind, unless you LEVEL UP. And this is a free-to-""""play"""" game, so you know what that means! Yep, the game is an absolute, insufferable grind designed to bleed you dry. The carrot dangling from a stick is the prospect of playing an actually decent flight sim with real, live human players. The reality? Your ability to compete is objectively crippled unless you pay to get your artificial stats to some degree of parity with other players.War Thunder tries to conceal its miserable grind sinks under a veneer of """"realism."""" You see, your character needs to build up his tolerance to G-forces. That's why if you make the slightest attempt to turn, you lose all control of your ship! Of course it makes sense. And of COURSE you need a *level whatever* *blank,* otherwise your plane will overheat, stall out, and generally fall apart the instant you engage in combat above cruise speed.I'm sure in WWII they made planes out of rusty scrap and threw 400-pound diabetics in the cockpit. That's why this game is so true to life!It's free, so you've got nothing to lose by trying it. All I'm trying to do is keep you from wasting your time. However, if you do find the game to be an obnoxious mess of a cash grab, like I have, I implore you not to judge the Sturmovik series too harshly. The *real* games in that series are nowhere near as terrible as this is."",0"
"3453,War Thunder,2017.0,""Let's see. Warthunder.When I've started to play with this game there were only planes. It was a while ago. Now everything is shiny and amazing... Except a few things.It's a pain in the ... knee to get enough money to be able to buy a new / better tank. I understand that it's important to see the differences between the vehicle but seriously. When I started to grind the money for the Tiger2 I had about 100.000. Tried to use the E Tigers as it was better with a higher rank tank because of the higher rewards. BUT. I was losing money constantly because somehow my tanks are like papertanks. 1 shot. ALL of them or any of them. Yes, i know with the correct location any tanks can be destroyed. Yes. But not from like 1km away. Seriously.The other problem is the players. If someone is a bit... how to say nicely, mentally challenged he can kill you. Yes even in arcade. A small push on the riverside, a small push to the line of fire. You can't do anything. And the report system. Choose teamkill, then: Explain what happened. TEAMKILL FFS!!!!On the other hand. The game is amazing looking, sounds amazing. I really like it but if you plan to get any Higher tier tanks... Be prepared. It's a russian game - there is no problem with it - but the russian tanks / planes (in the same tier) always better. Yes. ALWAYS. When I was playing in the last few months I just played for fun. T2 is the best. You can have real fun there. The higher ranks... No. It's just painful.They've told that there will be ships... Aham. We wait for ships for years now... I have time. Maybe then I'll start to play again. Until then. T1 planes? Italians - as there were a big Italian event -. Tanks? Russians, obviously. Not perfectly balanced, but if you like tanks.. It's a good game.Additional info (16/11/17) Removed this annoying piece ofâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ It's a joke. Grinding money to get better tanks but while you waste your time in this, basically you just lose the money you have already. How? As your tanks getting more and more expensive and your GERMAN / american / british / japanese tanks (in a russian game) is obviously â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ier than the russians, just taking your hard earned coins for repairs.Solution? Play russian tanks. No I hate russians, the russian tanks so I wont play putin. Sorry. I expected some balancing but seems history is not the Gaijin's strenght. Game removed and accounted more than 550 hours lost. Waste your time if you want. I'm done with this."",0"

"3455,War Thunder,2018.0,""One of the best free to play games ever but its developers are absolute scum. They're rude, greedy and just don't really give a damn about their community. Getting new vehicles takes wayyy too long, the core gameplay hasnt been changed in YEARS and for some reason WW2 era tanks will be up up against tanks built 20 years later. For a game that claims realism it sure is historically innacurate. I mean, im no history expert but im pretty sure bombers didnt fly off on their own without formation. Despite the community's pleas for change in gameplay the developers simply continue adding more vehicles to the game and charging you $60 for them. Go play another game and don't waste your time."",0"
"3456,War Thunder,2014.0,""If you are looking for a WW2 flight simulator, this definitely it's not your game. Of course, have good graphics and some physics, but it's all. Seems more a Call of Duty, with plane skin. And you'll see, planes with doubtful flight model, weapons not working realistically because of hit detection problems and other issues, multiplayer missions and map designs forcing players and planes to act weird, different than an aerial combat of WW2: High altitude bombers flying low, strafing ground targets"
"3457,War Thunder,2015.0,""War Thunder is arguably one of the best games on Steam. It's like CS:GO, but with planes and tanks. Features spectacular battles, beautiful graphics, a plethora of customization options and exceptional performance. A must-play."",1"
"3458,War Thunder,2015.0,""After putting in a metric ton of hours into this game and around Â£140 into it ive come to the conclusion that its just not worth it.This game is really great at times, there is however a weird parity, its regarding planes, they are great because you can use a tier 2 plane to completely destroy a tier 4, it gives options. Sadly this gets you limited research points not sure why and that becomes a problem, it forces you to use planes you probably dont want to use. for example spitfire vlc has quad 20mm but the game wants me to use a spitfire xvi which has dual 20mm and dual 7.62mm which is worse at everything apart from top speed. Make making is odd because its rarely on point, you either slaughter the enemy or get slaughtered, it could be due to the number of people that are playing it though. By the time you get to tier 4 you have to put in around 20-30 hours to research a plane which is halfed if you waste money on premium. At tier 5 you will need to push an insane 50-75hours for a plane and that extends by 10hours the deeper you go into tier 5 its a massive grind. Tanks however are worse, firstly you get less kills, this means less research which in turn means it takes a lot more time to get a new tank, you are at a disadvantage if you dont have premium there. Afterthat the balance for the tanks is shameful, it comes down to pretty much having your tanks go from epic to paperweights with a minor change to the battle rating system, you arent given that choice and that bugs me big time. I used to be fine with this because i didnt have anything else to play but once i realised war thunder was turning into a monthly subscription to me i had to draw the line somewhere."",0"
"3459,War Thunder,2016.0,""This game looks good and the gameplay is good too.You can play with your friends in the same squad in game up to 4 players.I loved tanks and planes both but loved tanks more. They are fun to play.But the problem is..The owners of this game hates germans.They are buffing and making every other country stronger but nerfing germans. They dont even have 90mm weapon. When a german tank shoots someone the bullet is just getting destroyed against the targets armor. But when anyone else shoots germans they are piercing and getting most of the crew out of the game. And that is not fair, unbalanced. Especially RUSSIAN TANKS FOR F#$Â£ SAKE!"",0"
3460,War Thunder,2018.0,Grinding is extreme in War Thunder and a huge chore for f2p players. This forces you to go for premium but even then it takes way too long to unlock something new. Unfortunately the matchmaking is broken too. You are fighting against enemys with planes/tanks one tier higher than yours making the grind even more frustrating.Don't be fooled by Gaijin.,0
"3461,War Thunder,2018.0,""I have been playing this game since 2013, before it was on Steam, so Steam probably shows no time played. First off, the game is decent. It can be fun at times and there are plenty of vehicles to use. I will acknowledge it does have SOME good aspects. But sadly, the bad outweighs the good.First off, the mods are people who are being paid by Gaijin to ensure nothing bad is ever said about the game. If you even mention something about the game in either the chat or the forums, you will get banned. The mods do not warn and do not give any reasons for it. They just claim you verbally abused them while they just do nothing about people actually throwing out racial slurs and other actual verbal abuse. So do not play this game if you want to be able to talk openly about it.The other major problem is that Gaijin NEVER fixes anything. There have been issues with the game people have been asking to be fixed since 2013 and they have still never even been looked at. But then again, with how the mods always ban everyone for mentioning there is a problem with the game, that may be why. They also continually change aspects of the game that are for no other purpose than potentially getting more money from people."",0"
"3462,War Thunder,2018.0,""Nice idea, but the fun is ruined when the game is locked down so much, it takes like 50 games lasting 20 minutes each just to unlock a level 2 plane variant, i don't wanna spend the next 5 years completing this game."",0"

"3464,War Thunder,2018.0,""At it current state(1.81) is to expensive to play the game, if you don't have premium account you can't progress at all because of the repair cost and even if you do have you can't make mistakes if you want to have enough Silver Lions to buy another vehicle, stock vehicle are the worst, planes isn't that much but you still can feel a difference, the big problem here are mainly tanks were if you don't have repairs and FPE(extinguisher) you are useless if they get any of the parts of the tank unless you get to the capture point to repair (if they get your engine you can't do anything), matchmaking is too compressed so sometimes you get games where your tank or your plane lacks too much compared to others and still with the compression  takes some time to get into battle depending on your Rank(if you don't get a small game with 6-8 people, wich are decided on the first 3min of the game), this game have become a P2W or even worst than that because at it current state premium isn't helping that much, a premium vehicle and account are a must if you want to grind anything or even play(keep in mind that you can only reasearch vehicles of the same nation that your premium vehicle is), can't recommend this game at all anymore if you want to have fun and even spend money into something i would recommend World of Tanks(Warships or Planes) those games aren't perfect too,  but are in a better state or even buy a game from steam that will be better."",0"

Not nearly as good as the game was, but you know all for the sake of """"beta"""" status most players went along and continued playing. 1.35 came along and is still to this day considered the best update. But that was autumn 2013. 3 years ago.Since 1.37 the betastatus has ended and the game is officially released. With that came a totally toxic gaming developer, mod/admin community and more and more restrictions on the forums. Which would have been manageable if the game wasn't brough to its knees...which it did, obviously.Bottom line, WT was promising to be a historical and graphical astounding game but it has been completely destroyed by its developer and toxic mods/admins. The player numbers have dropped from 120k online to 40k-ish which tells you something as well.If you want to get started, I can't recommend this game anymore, it has become too much of a moneygrab (the recent navy beta that has been introduced is the new utter low Gaijin has fallen too) where if you have to start right now, you'll be frustrated after less than an hour. And there's no reason why you would get frustrated over a game.TL"

I would have given it a 10/10, but now ever since a patch that came out around last December i would give it a 2or3/10. The gameplay is the same and is very fun to play whether alone or with friends but now you have to grind grind grind grind grind just to get 1 plane. Before i could just buy plane after plane in tiers but now i have to grind for research points (which are very hard to earn) to research a plane. Plus Gajiin went and had to make the game go from Free2Play (completely) (only buy if you feel like it) to having to pay if you want to unlock a new plane in less than 50 matches or more. You basically have to buy Golden Eagles so you can convert them all to research points to speed up the research of a new plane. I would still reccomend this game if you are into fun aviation type games and playing with friends but the free2play aspect is just no longer here."",0"

In the begining they said the focus would be realism and historical accuracy, but over the months more and more arcade elements were introduced and the realistic and simulator community completlyâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥on, simulator community in particular is good as dead, thanks to the complete negligence of developers.They exploit broken content to get moneys and realese an endless stream of clone premium vehicles that add nothing to the game.The worst moderating team and PR that i ever seen on any game, CEO comes to forum and said some of the most stupid things ever to the playerbase.It looks good, it plays worse then WoT when it comes to balance, match making and net coding, it is just a damned frustrating mess that shows no signs of clear direction or intent, every patch they tinker with stuff and that was uncalled for, it is clear they don't know what they are doing and they bit off more then they could chew.Patch after patch that is nothing more then content dumps, most of which always badly balanced or unfinished and then takes 3 to 4 mini-patches to get things to a minum acceptable level. Also they base their balacing around  player statistics and that is why this game is hopeless in that respect.Gaijin's motto: -We try fix what is not broken and instead break that also.Not worth the time.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update:As of 9/2016 this game is still a pile of garbage. If you are planning to give a try stay on arcade mode and nothing else. SB as been forsaken by Devs and RB is a waste of time, especially RB with planes. You will waste 20 mintues hunting a enemy fighter so that then he drags the fight to his base and have the Ai AAA kill you with super accurate fire.

"3489,War Thunder,2018.0,""It makes me sad to negativly review this game, because I really like what it is trying to do. I just wish the in game system was more dedicated to a player having fun than just milking them for money."",0"
"3490,War Thunder,2017.0,""I don't normally play shooters or action games but this is a good choice because it uses the historical tanks and airplanes of the period which builds some atmosphere. The gameplay is exciting and there are 1000s of players on whenever you join. Graphics are crisp and you get a good, authentic feel for fighting with a tank. I haven't played as an airplane or ship yet. Menus and options can be a bit overwhelming in the set-up stage but the actual fighting is fairly straightforward and easy to get into. Recommended. 8.5/10"",1"
"3491,War Thunder,2016.0,""This game is absurdly biased towards the Russian vehicles. I would not recommend it to anyone based on the fact that the developers will not admit that, and chose to cite sekret Russian dokuments as the reason why Russian vehicles are so absurdly OP.A prime example is the new TU-4, a Russian copy of the American B-29 with larger engines, cannons, and payload capacity. But is is impossible to shoot down compared to the B-29 which can be shot down simply by looking at it. Instead of removing the bias from the TU-4 they bumped it up to a 7.0 BR from a 6.3 BR. This does absolutely nothing, as the games horrible match making as of late will still put the 7.0 TU-4 against the 6.3 B-29 which may as well be made of card stock. Do not play this game unless you want to play Russian vehicles and be hated by everyone. You will get addicted and angry, and be posting a review of why people should not play this game."",0"
"3492,War Thunder,2016.0,""It might be free to play, but if you want to have fair chance against other players, then it won't be free anymore.Don't get me wrong, the game itself is quite good and well-done. There's not much to say here. The game might seem to be fun to play with friends but you soon realize that skills is not what you need in order to win. It is all based on how good your vehicles are. In the end the best way to win this game is to buy everything for real money. I can't recommend this game for anyone. I've wasted 22 hours of my life on this game.

It has Blown World of Warplanes out of the Water, and is probably going to desimate World of Warships once War Thunders Ships are released. Bug there are some downsides to this.

"3498,War Thunder,2017.0,""86/100 - Yeah's pretty good.I guess I should probably say something about this game since my play time.I'll try keep it short but here goes.Positives:-Lots to do, lots to achieve. Over 800 vehicles. If you're like me and enjoy games with a grind to them such as Warframe or Runescape (not as crazy as Runescape though) this is a great time sink. It's kept my interest for a while now.-Best Pre-WW2 to Cold war era + free to play tank, plane and ship game (soonâ„¢) out there. It has its faults but compared to other free to games out there I honestly feel like it's carved its own path, for instance it doesn't feel to arcade but it's not overboard realistic, once you get the hang of it, that's when the map knowledge and strategy come in. It becomes fulfilling -Good graphics, not insane but it's much better than other games like it. Runs well on most systems too.-Free to play may take a while to progress but you can get premium vehicles and items by playing. The options for free to play are quite forgiving.Cons:-IS6. (hate that thing) In all seriousness some battle rating changes do need to happen here and there. -Imbalances, with so many vehicles one small change can set off a chain reaction so be prepared for some annoyances and frustrations. It's all part of learning what works and what doesn't. Updates are frequent and the PR has gotten much better, Gaijin do try to keep the community happy despite what others say.-You must rely on teamwork for some game modes, epically with American mid-tier planes (my god.) Be prepared for people you can't rely on.Tips:-You must research on tanks and planes in game to see armour values and top speed etc. Or else you leave yourself at a disadvantage.-Don't claim Russian Bias when you die to a Russian vehicle (or any other nation), play that vehicle and learn it's weakness first hand. I guarantee other players will show you where you went wrong.-IS-6's, T29's etc. have muzzle breaks on their guns, shooting these breaks their guns and gives you time. Again, look at the vehicles thoroughly. -The Youtube community is great for tips, I recommend Slickbee, TheOrangeDoom, NapalmRatte, PhlyDaily, Squire, McChickenBites to name a few.It's hard to condense what I think about this game but if you truly enjoy historical and some protype combat vehicles then I do suggest at least trying the game, it doesn't cost anything and if you are seeking a time sink then this is the game for you. If you've played World of Tanks or other free to plays that are around ww2 era this will stand out for you.Thanks for reading this far. Feel free to murder me in the comments."",1"

"3502,War Thunder,2017.0,""Once installed I decided it was not for me. So I uninstalled it via steam. But this game is like the worst malware ever. It didnâ€™t uninstall, I canâ€™t uninstall from the â€œadd and remove programsâ€. There is also no uninstall.exe in the games folder. VERY POOR SHOW!"",0"
"3503,War Thunder,2017.0,""So let me start this off that I absolutely love this game but it has a lot of issues with it.I will explain the pros and cons and features the game currently needs below.I have been playing the game since 2013 and my hours are not correct as I have a pre-steam version of the game and only recently switched to a steam version.PROS:-The tank combat is outstanding and imo it is far superior then World of tanks in many ways.-The selection of tanks and airplanes is vast and they are constantly adding new ones into the game(currently adding French airplane line.)-Arcade Air combat is a lot of fun as it lifts most of the restraints that you wouldnt experience in realistic or simulator.You can make turns that would normally rip your wings off.-The maps and all the vehicles are absolutely stunning at max settings and I have no issue running it on either of my pcs, one has a single gtx 980 and my main pc has 3 980ti.-Gaijin is constantly updating the game and patching issues that are reported and doing rebalances of gameplay.-There is multiple game modes to choose from ranging from Arcade to simulator and even have events/tournaments.CONS:- Though the tanks/airplanes are fairly historical looking the actual function of the vehicles is not. German BF109s and FW(focke-Wolf) are absolutely nerfed beyond belief. In realistic they do not turn whatso ever and are just shredded 90% of the time by every nation. Now granted if you use stick and paddles you will be able to maneuver alot better and beat most with mouse and keyboard but if you run into someone else using same thing you stand no chance normally.  The german tanks are known for their power at the time and that does/doesnt show in the game. Many of the tanks that Germany used were powerful and heavily armoured but in War thunder it seems there is a bias by the developers about them. German tanks were very slow compared to most tanks yes but they were hard to kill from the front and even from the sides on some of them but in War thunder I have seen Tiger I destroyed in single shots through the front by light tanks. There is also a huge issue with the fact that a panther and Tiger are unable to penetrate the sloped front of the Sherman which was only 2 inches thick and with angle only made it 3.6 inches thick. Yes the armor was good to stop a panzer 3 but it could easily be penetrated by Tiger I and Panther.-Huge Russian biased for all of their vehicles!!!! The tanks seem to have twice the armour that is actually listed and bounce so many shots its unbelievable. I had a russian game where I bounce 13 shots in a row from 4 different tanks at different angles and was able to take all 4 of them out without taking any major damage. The Russian Air force was vastly out matched by the Luftwaffe for nearly the entire war but in War thunder once again Russian airplanes crush every other nations airplanes with ease. -People are able to turn the game settings to the lowest possible graphics that it gives them an advantage over those who play are higher details.At the lowest setting it removes bushes at longer distances and decreases the foliage on trees and even removes some boulders/rocks on the map. This allows people to shoot from farther distances and be hidden to those playing at a higher detail and is a very cheap tactic that is being taken advantage of for years now. Only recently has it become so bad that atleast 75% of the time you will be shot from across the map without seeing the enemy. I have even watched replays on maps were people are shooting through the ground and hitting people at the bottom of a hill.-The game has two different currencies being Silver Lions and Golden Eagles. Silver Lions are earn through getting kills,hits, capturing zones etc. while Golden Eagles are bought with real money. Now yes the game is a free game and has to have some way of earning income the way it is in place in War Thunder is fine 90% of the time until you figure out that it gives some nations an unfair advantage and screws over others. A good example is the Russians get a IS-6 in tier 4, to those who dont know there is 6 tier. Now you might think that isnt a big issue but it is when you look at the tanks it is facing which are far inferior to an IS-6. What makes it worse is the fact that the IS-3 is a tier 5 tank. Now historically the is-6 did was not better then a IS-2 or IS-3 and very few IS-6 were made because of this but once again Russian bias makes this tank over powered. Another good example is the only German tier 4 tank is the Ru-251 can only be bought with Golden eagles meaning Germany does not have a tier 4 light tank to use putting it at a huge disadvantage.-Another huge issue is uptiering, Everytime I play as a German in tier 3 with battle rating 5.7 in realistic I am instantly uptiered to battle rating 6.7. Going up in a tier makes a huge difference as you will go from fighting is-1s and t34-85s to is-6 is-2 etc which is hard for a tiger to take out due to the bias against German vehicles.There is so much more I could go into about Cons that I am just going to end it where I am at just because I feel the Cons alone are enough of a sign that the game is broken due to a Bias against German vehicles and the fact that Russian vehicles seem to be the greatest thing ever made. This game brough me alot of fun when I first started playing it but now days I get so angry due to being killed by people using low detail to have cheap kills or running into russian super vehicles. If you do decide to get into the game I suggest if you are going to play tanks to play simulator as it so far its the only game mode anymore worth playing imo."",0"

"3505,War Thunder,2017.0,""What's not to love in this game? Modelisation is good, physics and damage are really close to reality, graphics are good, plus the game itself is free to play.Unfortunately, hit detection is completely random. I can play 30 minutes destroying everything in my path with short burst, and then suddenly play for 3 days during which only 5% of my hits are recorded."",0"
"3506,War Thunder,2014.0,""A lot of people hate the game because Gaijin changed things for the worse. Arcade is increasingly unbalanced with premium planes, no one wants to do Realistic because if they go 2fast4u, the wings rip off, engine failures, ammo problems, spin outs, everything real planes are susceptible to, or because Germans get 1-shot by 'mericans. However, if you can look past the fact that increasing imbalance has caused the game to become more """"unenjoyable"""", I beg to differ all of these negative reviews.Firstly let's start off with my experience. I have at least 400 hours logged from the game before I joined Steam. I've played for about a year now, before steam, so I know what I'm talking about.Okay. So about the game itself - It's a WWII simulation. Arguably the best damn one out there that is and will be for a number of years. Mechanics in general are great, and you can fine tune your planes (And as of June, tanks) to however you want to have them. There is a higher level of customization in the game than people think - You can add decals, paint the vehicle (After getting all upgrades for it, which is kinda bs but whatever), select what bombs/turrets/bullets you want your plane to use (depends on the plane/tank), etc etc.Playing with friends is very easy. Just set up a squadron with them after finding them in the chat. Send them a mail, add them to your friends list, then you're good to go for playing together with them.Another thing is that the combat, while steadily becoming unbalanced from how it was over a year ago, is both intense and drawn out. Most of your time will be comprised of flying around actually looking for people until you're ~500km away from them. Ghost Shots can be an issue if someone knows what they're doing and can actually aim without having to use the target system that shows up on your screen. Overall though, when you do get into combat, it can be intense and very fun, and damage on your plane is very noticeable (Look on my video section for a War Thunder intro video, there are a lot of shots where my plane(s) damage is shown). There is little music in the game, if any. It is recommended that you just turn on your radio/pandora/personal playlist/MP3/iPod or whatever else you have and jam to your own tunes. Keeping sound effects is optional because 3/4 of the time all you'll hear is the engine sound. The other 1/4 are planes shooting and random radio calls that get annoying (""""The enemy has taken the base! We must get it back at all costs!"""" - Noâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥sherlock).Overall, the game is very enjoyable if you're not SUPERHARDCOREPVPMUSTWIN. Just be casual about it, enjoy it for what it is and you'll have a grand time on it like I do. Give it a shot and if you don't take it too seriously, you won't regret it."",1"

"3508,War Thunder,2018.0,""War Thunder is fun for the first few months, but then you start seeing just how broken the game is in terms of balance and accuracy. Some tanks are so inaccurately modelled that you're better off playing the other tank game instead. That one is at least somewhat balanced, while WT has some nations which basically serve only as cannon fodder to the nations that Gaijin favours.Countless bug reports have been posted on the War Thunder forums, but the devs just don't care.

"3514,War Thunder,2015.0,""I wouldn't have recommended War Thunder before the latest changes because the game is unbalanced in many areas. Some will find ways around it or just enjoyed the incredible vehicle models. But now Gaijin's answer to an unbalanced system is to make it worse.They admitted there was a problem with balance, they made small steps to fix it (such as moving the IS3 so it could no longer fight Panthers and Pershings). But with the 23/9/15 patch they brought the IS3 back so it could face Panthers and Pershings, as well as bringing back every single top tier tank down the same way.1960s Cold War vehicles are now matched against Tiger 2s, IS2s and M26s. Tanks like the Maus and T-10M are absolutely destroying entire teams-worth of players BY THEMSELVES. This whole review hasn't even touched on the mess that is endgame plane content either, with Tempest prop planes getting eaten alive by MiG15s and 1944-era Me262s fighting the cream of the crop from the Korean War the F86 Sabre and MiG15bis.These changes do have an effect on the low tiers but they are less noticeable than the devastating, game-breaking blow that has been dealt to mid-high tier gameplay. I was excited, I was happy, I almost had my M47 Patton. But the game is broken.Given Gaijin's track record it will take at least 3 months to touch on the subject again, and no guarantee to fix it.AVOID."",0"

"3520,War Thunder,2016.0,""Where can I start with War Thunder? Well, I'll start with the basics. I stopped playing about 3 months ago and the whole game has changed. When I stopped, you had 20 plane tiers. This meant that when you go into battle, you were fighting people in the tiers one below you, same as you, and one above you. What this did, was allowed you to fight planes of similar ability. Now, you have this 5 tier system, which isâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ No other word for it, it's justâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Seeing it on Steam, I redownloaded it and played in what is now called Tier 2. What happens now is that instead of playing 3 tiers out 20, you fight against 1 tier out of 5. This means you are fighting people in planes that could have been 4 tiers above you in the old system. For instance, you could be in a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ bi-plane just out of WW 1 and someone in a Mk 1 Spitfire can come up behind you and one shot you. I really did love playing the short time I played. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED IT! But the problem is, I can't love something that has been developed by people who don't listen and don't thinkâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥through. I cannot imagine playing it for more than 24 hours, which is incredibly short for a game. If you're bored and have an evening to yourself, definitely play it. It's f2p and good fun and the start.

At tier 4 and beyond the grind ramps up to a ridiculous level, but with premium you get double exp. Also silver is damn slow to get, but of course premium time gives you double silver too.And worse than just researching new vehicles, when you buy a new tank or ship you have to research fire extinquishers and repair kits for them, and the speed at which you do that also slows down at higher tiers. So once you get that shiny new vehicle all it takes is one touch to damage your weapon or engine or start a fire and there is nothing you can do about it unless you manage to reach your base or a cap point and live long enough to repair there, so most of the time the only option is to wait for death or suicide, because you will die anyway trying to reach a repair point.With ground forces specifically, there's the added grind to unlock new ammo types as well. Many tanks start out with an ammo type that is basically useless for what they will be going up against, and since you are unable to cause much damage it slows the grind down even more.But of course, if you buy gold you can instantly purchase these items and bypass the research time to skip the struggle!Got a new american tank destroyer and after about a dozen matches i still don't even have the repair kit because as soon as i see an enemy my inferior ammo bounces off them and when they return fire they can hit any part of my tank to put it out for the match instantly.Coming back to the game, I wanted to try out this new PvE tank mode, thinking it would be a good place to grind out repair kits and extinguishers for my tanks at least. The problem is that it's a wave assault purposely made to get your vehicles destroyed as many times as possible. And to respawn you need to pay silver... so it will just bleed you dry if you want to play it without premium.On top of this, the matchmaking and balance is totalâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ A 1.0 rating difference between vehicles can be insane, and when you are bottom rating in a match it's a massive handicap. In air battle enemies will be faster, more durable, and can have 2-3 times the weaponry. In ground battles, anything focused on armor will be nearly invulnerable. In naval battles, you will get shredded by a single enemy shot."",0"
"3523,War Thunder,2016.0,""Do you dream of flying a B-17 dropping bombs and coming back all beaten up.  Or go down in a blaze of glory while your gunners are firing at the enemy as your engines are shutting off while on fire and your doing your best to keep it in the air.. Or maybe fly in a huge formation over enemy territoy.Well keep moving this is not the game for you..  Bombers last about two seconds in the air. My last match literally 2 mins ago i lost 5 bombers, from 3 b-17s to a b-24 and a b-29 to a single bullet, and not pilot death no, as in my entire plane exploded,  5 different times, same match. And thats what this game is, over and over. No real team work at all. Bombers literally spawn and dive to go as fast as they can to the targets to bomb before they go 1 shot out the sky and hopefully just hopefully they can turn around after they drop the bombs.  So ya to get points you have to hell dive as a b-17.  Tier system is  horrible, the grind is so bad, bombers are useless.  Im serious a b-29 with no bombs in bay,  exploded one shot from a spitfire. And its really becoming play to win now.. Dont let the past reviews with the thumbs up fool you, this is not the same game."",0"

Now if they would just stop adding so many rocket/guided missile tanks, and get rid of some of the chat modderators that bully the players of the game (the people that usually get punished are giving constructive criticism).I still recommend it (if you really want to play a game in this genre) only becuase it is one of the only games in this genre and is the best that I have seen in this genre.

"3526,War Thunder,2016.0,""Product received for free        After playing this game for two years I sadly must give it a poor review. Although, let's keep it in perspective it is a """"free"""" game with options to """"pay"""" for upgrades. So is it really free then?         I have read the reviews about the different tanks and planes...blah blah blah....try the ones you like don't drive the ones you don't like, move on.  So my complaints aren't about the game when it works.         The key issues that have driven me to this poor review are as follows:         1) War Thunder downloaded many maleware files onto my computer, and continues to date, which drives my maleware detector crazy. Why would this gave try and install maleware on my computer unless it was trying to steal something from me. My question is this, why would Steam even allow a game that installs malware on its site.         2) War Thunder sends out daily downloads. Is their software so buggy they have to send out daily updates? Really! I understand wanting to fix bugs and add new feature but every day! Come on.         3) The straw that broke the camels back for me was constant drops from the War Thunder server. I checked my own settings to ensure it wasn't on my side and it wasn't. But after getting booted from a number of games because of servers disconnects, it has finally driven me away from War Thunder.         The moral of the story is this. You get what you pay for. If """"free"""" game performance is lousy and frustrating then it isn't really free. Oh and by the way, yes I did """"pay"""" for """"golden eagles"""" to improve my upgrade performance. So it wasn't really free for me.  "",0"
"3527,War Thunder,2016.0,""Product received for freeOverall: a good game, but it is the textbook definition of pay to win. You will get absolutely RAVAGED BY people that put money into the TANKS THAT CAN ONLY BE PAID FOR (most notably the Sherman Calliope and Panzerwerfer).Also, there is an extreme bias towards German and Soviet tanks. In the lower teirs, British and American tanks are simply no competition for Soviet T-34s and KV-1s and the Wehrmacht Panzers and Marders. To be fair, it is historically accurate, but in bad taste for a game that should be roughly equal opprotunity to all factions."",0"

Sorry, but it's true.EDIT, 27 May 2018: I have almost 1200 hours in-game?! WHY DO I KEEP DOING THIS TO MYSELFEDIT: With about 850 hours played at the time of this edit, clearly I am not paying attention to my own negative recommendation. I do enjoy the game, and recommend it to anyone playing WoT as the """"Next Step"""" in tank combat games. WoT feels pre-pubescent in comparison. If you want air combat or to blast people with tanks, or both, try this out. Many things have changed in War Thunder since I began, good and bad, but I keep coming back. The GUI is still garbage, but I know how it works now. I'm going to keep my recommendation negative, because WT is very hard for new players to get into.::::: What follows was my first impression after about 4 hours of play ::::: Yay, planes. Yay, tanks.Boo, matchmaking balance. Boo, one of the most unintuitive GUI's I've ever seen.It's fun the first few matches. The matchmaking system is merciful, and takes pity on the noobs. Suddenly, once you get a plane that happens to not be a biplane, regardless of whether you select a biplane to begin with, matchmaker decides that you are an elite ace pilot, and makes sure to never disappoint you by giving you any match that's too easy. Or fair.I can't for the life of me figure out this interface, either. If I want to do something like change a crew from Plane 1 to Plane 2, I apparently need to go buy some sort of manual for the game. Coming from certain other free games of this variety, I just cannot tell what they were thinking when they designed this thing.If I want to play in a match full of biplanes it seems I must send any higher tier planes on """"holiday"""" and then go into the match so I don't get placed in a game with jet fighters by accident. Problem? If I mysteriously decide I'd like to fly a higher tier plane I've sent on holiday, I must do some sort of 're-purchase' of the crew, as if they'd all died in a barracks fire or perhaps choked to death on their bloody tea and crumpets while I was out. Can I decide which crew goes to which plane? Seems not.I like the gameplay. I absolutely abhor the GUI. Matchmaking needs help.Enter at your own risk. Godspeed.EDIT: After over 200 hours, I'm still learning new things about this GUI. Stockholm Syndrome has set in. I see the reasons they've done things in particular ways, but there's still a ton of room for improvement.I still can't really recommend the game unless you're at least mildly masochistic. Come, join me in the darkness, but don't say I didn't warn you."",0"

"3532,War Thunder,2016.0,""This review is written during the introduction of the British tank line.I played this game during the sale of a package for 30$, it includes 3 months of premium time and crate load of premium currency. During 3 months of premium:-Fast progression through the tech tree but not blazingly fast that skill was inadequate for the next tier battle.-Small annoyance like clearly mandatory module was easily obtain.-Credit flows nicely.-Able to team up with 2+ players rather than 1.After premium: [mostly ground battle]-Progression slow down to a crawl.-In ground battle where repair tools and fire extinguisher is apparently lock behind unlock wall, so if youâ€™re tracked or on fire during a match you are SOL.-During my play, there is an exploit where user can turn down graphic to hide away all the foliage, other play that play at high setting like myself is at a disadvantage.-After unlocking tier 2, understand that you will fight against tier 3 tanks which clearly outclass the previous tier.Overall game:-Minimap is hard to read for first time, itâ€™s too complex to read at a glance.-Some texts do not stand out to alert the player of what is happening to their vehicles.-Battle tier [arcade] is ridiculous, how can a stock tank at tier 2 fight with any competence against a tier 3.-The grind is real, imagine Korean mmo grind real.-All tanks are not made equal, so your duel is already decided on who got the jump+rng favor first. Yes, rng is a factor in this game where a shell traveling through the tank, shattered, minor injury only.

"3536,War Thunder,2017.0,""Ok, i'll never wrote a review about any game before, but WT deserves one. First of all, ive been playing the game for a couple of years now, and it was amazing, the vehicles, the physics, the maps, everything, but suddenly, the game become a """"pay to win"""" game, since premium vehicles are SO op. The vehicles research is ridiculous, because it takes really a long time to be able to get a new plane or tank, and now, you can face a 50's or 60's tank with SABOT rounds, while you're driving a 40's tank (c'on guys), i wont even get to the """"Russian Bias"""" part, cause seems that gaijin still haven't overcome the cold war.

So i won't recomend the game, untill gaijin stops thinking only about money, and starts to think a little about the many issues that the game have.... Thanks for reading it."",0"
"3537,War Thunder,2018.0,""I would love to recommend this game but simply can't anymore. Multiple reasons this game has gone down the tubes because of a company that simply doesn't listen to its community.1) Community is ignored by Gaijin.2) That ignoring leads to things like terrible economy/maps/credit earnings/pay to win structure/ etcOn the topic of economy you may as well shoot yourself in the foot from the beginning. The reason why Youtubers who play this game with higher tier vehicles do NOT show you end game screen results is because even they know the game needs an RP increase yet refuse to show how much grinding it takes to earn one module/ tank.It infuriates me that this game has gone down the tubes so much in the last few months to the last year. With the addition of tier 6 all new and upcoming players have basically become ignored in every facet of the game. RP at low tiers used to be able to earn you a tank in less than 1-3 games depending on how well you do. With RP gains the way it is without premium players could expect to take upwards of 360 or more games to even earn a tier 6 tank with the RP gains currently. Since the average tank match takes more than 10 minutes you can expect to take upwards of 60 hours just to earn a single tank.In short, I love War Thunder, you are a great game. But I can no longer support a game in which puts its 1% and less than 1% of the community who already own top tier vehicles and can spend the time to grind the game the way they do. We will never see Gaijin fix the game unless they have an epiphany and realize that the main reason this game is losing popularity is because of the terrible support and mechanics you give your community.EDIT: Still a pretty awful game. Game engine was updated yet performance is slowly dropping. Game basically favors those who already have top tier. Forums are full of non-helpful people who if you could look up their account from the forums would basically have every vehicle in the game. In short its becoming an elitist community with a dwindling population and updates which don't announce changes like the recent drop in Silver Lion earnings which wasn't announced and dropped on all vehicles premium/talisman as well. They are becoming an increasingly greedy company and it's becoming confusing that they don't respond to the community basically at all."",0"

I pelted so many tanks with shells that there is no way they should have been able to move even without killing the crew. I put 15 shells into 1 tank (I did not aim at the same spot twice.

"3560,War Thunder,2015.0,""I'll cut to the chase: -Its a good game overall.-Has a great variety of Aircraft and Tanks, and when they add ships i know they will add a bunch too.-Graphics are Amzaing for a Free-to-Play Game very detailed even on minium graphic settings-Has a decent amount of Gamemodes rangeing from Arcade style dogfighting, to Realsitic and Simulator Battles-Great Variety of Maps in both Planes and Tanks-Its combined arms in Tank battles (meaning you can phly a plane in tankbattles) <--See what i did there... no...ok moving on-The gameplay is good... the battles look epic at times and they're fun, no denying that-Fast Paced Jet Battles <----But that grind tho-Somewhat friendly communityok while thats the pros of the game here are the cons-Russian Bias... where do i begin.... im not going to rant that much... wanna see whats bad read the other reviews you'll find your answer there-Although the game has somewhat decent flight models, the Russian vehicles tend to be greatly superior to that of thier Counterpart nations-America seems to be nerfed greatly, the planes preform very poorly to that of how they actually performed-its fact that German weapons were far superior in the begging of the war yet Gaijin neglects this fact and makes Germany underpreform as well-The British are meh imo, Spitfire is really good the only thing that bugs me is that my Bf109 E3/E4 20mm canons with air targets spark so much on Spits.... probably just me.... oh Hawker Hunter at stock is bad but then reks everything besides MiG-15s-Planes suffer Stock Syndrome meaning when you get a plane it underpreforms greatly at stock and will eventually get better after upgraded but even that takes a long time-Gaijin doesnt like new ideas, they do not listen to the playerbase and make things worse.... There are a few ups here and there but its mainly downs... They believe Russia is the best nation on earth and although nationalism is not bad they should at least look at historical facts and make a somewhat fair game.Im not gunna rant anymore.. the inbetweens includes:-Your typical a**holes who think theyre cool by shooting your teamates or Ramming at high tiers-Rams... the Rams especially tier 1 i cri evry tiem "
"3561,War Thunder,2016.0,""I would highly reccommend this game because simply it is a load of fun! What's great about it is that you can either play in arcade mode or in realistic and simulation modes for a greater challenge. New updates every 2 months or so with new aircraft and vehicles to try out. Great for people with a low budget (it's free!) who want to drive or fly vehicles from the Second World War and early Cold War. Although this is, in my opinion, a very fun and realistic game to play, it has moderately slow update speeds (for me anyway!) and some players  who are annoying if you wish to play the game properly and they are not.

"3565,War Thunder,2018.0,""Do not play this game. I have sunk enough money and time into it to know it is not worth it. The game is extremely unbalanced, Air Battles are completly broken since Gaijin has been ignoring them for a good 3 years or more and the newly introduced Naval Battles are completly boring and unbalanced.Russian Bias has been a meme in this community for a long time, but other than the """"Git Gud"""" arguments thrown about by people who deny it, there is no proof of Gaijin not buffing Russian Vehicles to become overpowered killing machines. Gaijin is known to censor its community and has already lost much of its support.Looking at the other negative reviews on this game you'll start to notice that most of them are written by people who have more than 1000 Hours in this game and this really speaks for it self. Gaijin has managed to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ over and completly insult the playerbase that has been giving them money and support for 6 years now, and yet there still is a fringe minority of extremely toxic players who defend this game (look at the comments in some of the negative reviews and you'll see what i mean). Why is it, that Gaijin still fails to realize their game is in a downward spiral? Adding new vehicles, while neglecting previously implemented ones, which desperately need fixing, is not a way to improve gameplay, but to increase revenue.In the 670 hours i've played, I only managed to unlock 2 Jet fighters in the german tech tree (One of which is the HE-162, which is so terrible it might qualify as the worst plane in the game), and a few Tier 4 tanks for the Germans and Russians (keep in mind I also paid about 50â‚¬ for this game, so I hope this shows how grindy this game is), and I can safely say that I am pretty familiar with the gameplay, which is so repetitive and boring, that I wonder why I even spent so much time on this game in the first place. Almost none of the Planes in this game actually perform like their real world counterparts, which would be fine if Gaijin didn't constantly propagate their focus on historical accuracy. American 50. Cals are ridiculously OP and have been for a long time in Air Battles, while german Machinecannons are absolutely useless in higher tiers, also the Yak-9T is ridiculously precise and one shots nearly every plane in its BR (Sometimes even bombers).Ground vehicles are a similar story when it comes to underpowered and overpowered armaments. The German 88s sometimes fail to pen even japanese tanks at close range while russian tanks used to (I dont know if it still is the case) benefit from a greatly increased chance to start a fire or to ammo rack an opponent, which had been proven after some people data mined the game files. There also is the T-34 meme going around, because that tank is basically a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing Tiger on steroids in this game, but even worse are all of the IS tanks, which are basically impossible to pen (when playing them I rarely had to worry about engaging an enemy at any range), and can kill almost all tanks in their respective BR with ease.The remaining community War Thunder still has is composed of people who either hate the game but cant quit, or people who are hopelessly defending Gaijins despicable acts as a company (Threatening Critics and Players, and openly mocking their own supporters) while deliberately ignoring all the shortcomings of this by now terrible game.Lastly I want to touch on the Gaijin.net agent which is basically spyware that reinstalls itself even if you set your settings so that it shouldn't. It also doesnt uninstall when you uninstall the game so you need to manually delete it. Gaijin purposefully hides this from its customers, because most of them dont seem to care about their own rights to privacy and choice.TLDR: This game is terrible, and the developers are even worse. DONT PLAY ITâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ Gaijin"",0"

"3571,War Thunder,2017.0,""This game was fun for me. At times I would get many kills and feel invinsible, then I would easily get killed too. I spent a lot of time in this game, and I am only researching my first jet. The grind is real, repair costs are incredibly high for ARCADE which doesn't make sense because its ARCADE. I kinda understand them in Realistic. I hate the blatant russian bias. I think the game is overall a good game. I would continue to play it, but it is incredibly annoying when I have been stuck at 85k SL for the past few months. (Only cuz I play like once a month now, but thats only because of the raging repair costs). Match making is also an issue, the part I am angered about is how they put me in matches with a majority of jets while I still had Rank 4 propeller planes.

"3572,War Thunder,2017.0,""Yet another game, which started very good and now coming into the state of Pay 2 Win or get out.I do not rememebr how many hours I did play. I would need to reinstal to check although I don't think I can be bothered.I went through planes because i was waiting for introduction of tanks. Comparing to WOT, visuals in WT are amazing and it was promising at the beginning.So then things just happened. Firstly, Russian stuff became better than any other stuff - same thing with planes and then tanks.Ok, Russian tanks were not too bad during WWII, but let's be honest - other were not so much worst. Anyways - WT is not a simulation, but an arcade game with some sort of reality approach. Therefore some sort of the balance would be required to make sure that players will use all osrt of stuff to play not only T-54...I still remember WOT when chinese Type 59 was introduced. Maps full of this small bugger. Nowhere to play.In WT things started to be similar. For me - even worst. I was waiting for British tansk because I love british tanks (I know - stupid me)In WT those are mopst of the time unplayable. And now the Pay to Win part. I do not feel i need to explain too much really.If you are not sure what I am talking about - try without premium account go therough level 4 to level 5 in British tanks (really any tanks).I loved the game. I am too tired and disappointed to install it again.Even to check how the ships are going..."",0"
"3573,War Thunder,2018.0,""It says I only have 24 hrs on this game, but in reality, I've been playing since February of last year.War Thunder is a game for VERY patient people. The first few tanks or planes to unlock are very easy to drive by, but once you get into Tier 4-5, it's the worst.Without a premium account, you can get an average of 1000-1500 RP per game (WHICH IS VERY SMALL) when the vehicles you're researching are around 70000-150000RP. That means it can take between a week or a month depending on how much you play to get ONE vehicle in Tier 3. The farthest I have gotten is Tier 4 Germany and that is with over 200HRS of gameplay. This game is really only for people who are willing to spend their lives on it. There is also an option to buy Golden Eagles to automatically gain RP, but that's just a scam by itself.Another problem is the terrible matchmaking.This game has ridiculous matchmaking. You can either get Downtiered (very unlikely) stay on your same tier (could happen sometimes) or get uptiered 1-2 BR's (WHICH HAPPENS TO ME ALMOST ALL THE TIME.) It's absolutely ridiculous and the Devs do this to really just get you to buy more tanks with REAL money so it's easier for you. I personally have been forced to spend $30 on this game because of how painful it is to research tanks. It's ridiculous how the devs expect a T-34 to pen a Panther D. Why Gaijin?!If you have all the time on your hands and have nothing else to do other than play games, then this game COULD be good for you. But if you have almost no time and have no money, then this game is ridiculous and don't bother playing it. If you dedicate your lives to games and spend as much as you can on them, then this game is fine. I'm not saying this game is bad, it's an excellent game, but what I'm saying is that currently, this game is out of balance and a pain in the a** to play. I will probably take a break from this game because of how bad it is right now."",0"
3574,War Thunder,,real grindy game that's pretty fun early to mid tier but falls off extremely fast late game due to it's unbalanced tiering system that places late WW2 vehicles with cold war era vehicles along side with teammates that will consistantly spam commands to attack objectives while they themselves are only out to get kills and never attempt to assist you in anyway shape or form.,0
"3575,War Thunder,2018.0,""In its current state, I cannot recommend it, mostly due to the sheer levels of BS levels of grinding. Not to mention the way they treat the community, they literally insulted the community by comparing the M1 Abrams, (a top tier tank) with Parts and FPE, which are essential to maintaining a combat functional tank, with one of their counter-arguments is that it was always there, as if that makes it okay. These people are hopeless.Grinding for Parts and FPE has been made SLITGHYL easier, by removing the need to research two modifications to get to rank two, which has FPE, it will also automatically research Tracks (or tires) which is one of the most idiotic things I have had the displeasure of experiencing. We have been waiting Italian tanks for a while now, yet we still only have two premiums. And helicopters can spawn camp from miles away. Not to mention how frustrating some of the tiering is, The KV-1B (And KV-1E but the KV-1B is the bigger problem) is just an up-armored KV-2 L-11 with a F-34 gun, yet it's a lower tier? and the Jumbo has no right to be able to get down tierd into 3.7. Recently they've also started making more and more Premium top tier vehicles, this gives any idiot with a credit card a ticket straight to top tier, for a while top-tier American teams were getting they crap pushed in due to  noobs buying the XM-1, filling a match that should be filled with people who know their stuff, with a bunch of noobs, making matches extremely unbalanced.I'm not gonna be surprised if Gaijin ends up censoring this review, but I'll keep playing it. Mostly due to how much I'm into WW2 Tanks right now, but if another game like this comes along, or I move on from Tanks, I most likely won't play it ever again.

"3582,War Thunder,2016.0,"" War Thunder  is a game that allows you to command planes, tanks (or other ground vehicles like trucks), and eventually naval vessels in PvP and PvE matches.The selection of vehicles you have range from pre WW2 (usually around the time of the Spanish Civil War) all the way up to the Korean War, and the nations that these vehicles can be selected from include the USA, Germany, USSR, Britain, and Japan (at the moment Japan only has aircraft, but will soon get tanks and will get naval vessels like the other nations too). There could possibly be more nations added in the future, but not much info has been provided on that. Additional vehicles are regularly added for the existing nations.The game has three realism levels you can choose to play in matches, these are  Arcade,   Realistic,  and  Simulator.  Arcade Battles  are the most popular, enemy nametags appear when in your line of sight, mobility characteristics are simpler so vehicles handle better, for aircraft a circle appears over a targeted enemy to help you lead your shots and for ground vehicles a colored marker appears when you're aiming at an enemy, with the three different colors (green/yellow/red) indicating whether or not the shot will penetrate.  Realistic Battles  has realistic mobility characteristics (though not at the same level of simulator mode), limited markers (nametags still appear, but the lead circle and the colored marker are gone), and realistic team matchups (you won't see all five of the nations on the same team like in arcade mode).  Simulator mode  does what realism mode does, but takes it up to eleven. You can only view your plane from inside the cockpit (some of the cockpit interiors aren't out yet, but you still get some kind of first-person view nonetheless) and for tanks you can only view the battle from above the turret (like if the tank commander were to open up the hatch to better survey the battlefield).The PvP portion of the game has you fight in teams to accomplish various objectives in a match.Aircraft will usually just destroy ground targets (generally the role of attackers/bombers) and destroy enemy planes (generally the role of fighters/interceptors/etc) in the common  Ground Strike  mode. There are also the game modes  Domination  (which involves landing on air fields to capture them) and  Air Domination  (where your team has to have the majority of planes in an air capture zone) The more realistic game modes tend to have better objectives, like the attacking side is helping an AI ground forces assault while the defending team trying to stop them.Tank variety in objective types isn't much better, which are usually just capture and hold points on the map. This is disappointing considering the many different kinds of ground vehicles you can use like heavy/medium/light tanks, SPAA, armored trucks... regular trucks with mounted machine guns  USSR plz . The realistic modes objectives don't change much for ground forces, but you can use your own planes and fight with ground forces at the same time.The PvE portion of the game can be done solo or with friends, at the moment you can only use aircraft to experience this content. The PvE content includes  Single Missions  where you control one type of plane and try to accomplish the given objective,  Dynamic Campaign  where you have a campaign map and fight several battles to conquer the whole map, and  Historical Battles  which you have to buy with the Steam Pack or in-game, which only seems to be a bunch of missions with voice acting and cutscenes added. Though there doesn't seem to be much of a point to doing these PvE activities because they don't provide much of a reward, which brings me to my biggest gripe with this game, the grind.This game is very grind heavy, especially if you decide to play without the premium subscription. If you really want to try out the jets you're going to need to sink in a lot of hours into this game.But I can kinda deal with that because this game is actually very fun to play. All of the vehicles are very well designed, while it may be challenging to play some vehicles if you keep practicing and make an active effort to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your vehicle and the vehicle you're facing will be what decides the outcome of a fight.The game isn't P2W either (well, I guess that depends on what your definition of P2W is), most of the stuff you can buy are cosmetics, or speeding up game progression. The only thing that might be questionable is that you can use money to level up your crew, which improves the performance of your vehicle, but if you're willing to grind it out you can also max out your crew.While this games combat is much more realistic compared to most games (in my opinion) it isn't the absolute best. If you want that go for DCS World.If you decide to play this I would recommend that you just play which ever nation looks interesting to start off with and go from there. Don't try to rush to the end game because it isn't that great. If you decide to stick around try to find a group of players to play with, and maybe you could end up playing in tournaments. Just try to have fun in the end.This review ended up being much longer than I expected."",1"

"3584,War Thunder,2014.0,""For what it's worth, this is probably one of the better flying and shooting games i've played that involve WWI and WWII aircraft. It's fairly realistic, easy to learn, and easy to find a game. The graphics are decent and you can change cloud density and ground texture. This is mainly a multiplayer game, but it does offer some single player missions if you can get into it. That's pretty much where the good stuff ends, though.Given that it's Free To Play, of course the game starts you out with literally the crappiest planes they have to offer. The planes you see on as the cover art and in the screenshots? Yeah, you can't have those. It wouldn't be so bad if the matches could be ranked. But every time I joined a session, there was always somebody on the other team with a faster fighter plane that takes more hits and can kill you in two shots. Why two shots? Because you're in a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing bi-plane from World War 1 (unless you play USA and why wouldn't you unless you're some kind of commie) and they're in a German Stuka, for example. And no, you can't fly away, because you are slow as hell. So you might as well just crash into the ground and save them the trouble. Trust me when I say the dogfights that the game hypes you up for aren't as exciting as they could be. It's usually just you being chased or the other way around and going in circles until somebody gets a lucky shot (or crashes) or the 15 other enemy players arrive to gangâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥you with endless tracers and bullets. And to top it all off, some people in multiplayer matches have come to believe that ramming their plane into yours is a viable strategy, even though they lose their plane in the process. The point is to NOT get shot down while shooting down enemies!It is unforgiving, and you will start out very slowly. Unless you have the time and patience like some people apparently do to eventually unlock an actual decent plane, I would not recommend this."",0"

"3587,War Thunder,2015.0,""War Thunder is a massive MMO combat game thing where you take WW2-era aircraft and tanks (eventually ships) into small online matches against other players where you try to complete map objectives, kill your enemies, or just die horribly because you don't know how to fly or drive. Fun!This game shares considerable resemblance to the games made by Wargaming, namely World of Tanks and World of Warplanes. However, Wargaming's products tend to be very """"arcadey"""" in their gameplay, require an obscene amount of grinding, and seem to be heading into the direction of e-sports. And while it is true that War Thunder also requires lots of grinding to unlock the best toys and has tournaments of its own, it also leans more towards realism than Wargaming's products, for better or worse. The mechanics of grinding to unlock new vehicles and upgrades for them is shared, but while World of Tanks forces you to play mediocre vehicles like the M3 Lee or Jagdpanzer IV to unlock the much better M4 Sherman and Jagdpanther respectively, War Thunder allows you to get experience towards unlocking your next vehicle of choice regardless of what you choose to use. In other words, you can use the F6F Hellcat and gain experience towards unlocking the F4U Corsair, B-25 Mitchell, or even stuff much later in the research tree like the B-29 Superfortress and F-86 Sabre. So in short, War Thunder is like World of Tanks/Warplanes, but with less BS, less moneygrubbing, and far less vehicles that saw no combat or never made it off blueprints.To answer the biggest question all people have about free to play games: No. War Thunder is not Pay to Win. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either a troll, an idiot, or a fanboy of the competition. And while you can spend money on War Thunder to increase your experience gain or to buy special vehicles, none of this feels like """"must haves"""" as Tier VIII Premiums do in World of Tanks when credit income starts becoming a severe problem in the light of rising repair costs. Some things will take a little longer, but you can easily get by in War Thunder without spending a dime. And besides, there are plenty of awesome vehicles to use in the early parts of the tech tree, so it won't take long to get to the good stuff. :DSince the game is Free to Play, I feel as if there is little more I ought to say here. If the idea of a game where you can fly around planes or drive tanks and make people explode sounds appealing, then go ahead and give this a try. Who knows? You may end up having lots of fun! :D"",1"

"3589,War Thunder,2017.0,""This game has the potential to be one of the greatest flight sims ever. The selection of aircraft and tanks is absolutely enormous. There is a diffuculty mode for everyone, the flight models are decent, the damage model kinda sucks but it's not terrible. The aircraft and especially the tanks are very well detailed.I just wish I had the ability to enjoy them all. Unfortuately, you can't. You will be stuck in the first and second tier early war stuff for hundreds of hours. I have a buddy who has been playing this game for years. He has over 1,300 hours in the game. He is a level 42. Herein lies the problem of the game.You start off with the worst pssible vehicles, which is understandable. These are the bottem of the barrel planes and tanks. They are slow, they can not turn worth a damn, they have guns that mearly tickle your opponent, and they blow up when someone looks at you funny. You are stuck in these until you can get enough kill assists to unlock a new vehicle. You aren't killing anything with a 37mm cannon on the early tanks, or the pair of .30 cals you get in the Peashooter. Once you get those, you continue the grind upwards. It seems your first vehicle in any tier is just asking to be blown up. And, at every tier, every vehicle cost exponentially more. You would think that at higher tiers this wouldn't be a problem as you would be making more money, but you'd be wrong. You can take out a Mustang, down two aircraft and return to base, only to find out that you still haven't broken even. At this point in the game, it can cost 100,000 lions to buy an aircraft and another 100,000 just to train the crew. It gets so goddamn grindy.Now, the lower tiers are more fun. Usually you can break even, fly against somewhat balance aircraft (panzer IV as a first tier tank. wut? I've put 5 HEAT rounds through the front, hitting crew every time, and they can still one shot me through the mantlet), and enjoy the game without having to worry about shelling out shekels to the jewish developers just to fly your planes. Grinding to unlock a plane in a a free to play game? Understandable. Grinding low tierâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥just to fly high tier stuff you've already got? Not understandable.Absolutely the most frustrating game I have ever played. And the worst part about it is how much potential it has. Potential wasted by money grabbing penny pinching jews that are Gaijin. "",0"
"3590,War Thunder,2013.0,""This game is very unbalanced, and yes i am one of them who doesnt realy like this game. This is my personal oppinion so dont rage as we all have different oppinons. F2p words just translate (try this out for fre unlimited time) As premium players can easaly dominate free users. As the game itself it takes hundreds of hours to finnaly achieve normal plane which will get destroyed by again premium players.  But the game itself is nice and polished. And im actuolly keen to try this with user release of """"Oculus Rift"""". But still, to fuly enjoy this game you have to spend extra money for joystick (joy-stick) and for """"Oculus rift"""". But you must agree, that you need fast PC in order to enojy this game even further. At the end, i wouldnt reocommend this game for f2p user.

"3591,War Thunder,2014.0,""*** I DO NOT PLAY THIS ON STEAM. THE HOURS ARE INCORRECT. ***As a life-long fan of aviation, This is of course right up my alley for a relaxed game, it's fun to play, especially with friends. And I believed the intial concept of War Thunder to be perfect, unfortunately, the beta progressed, and it began to show it's FUNDAMENTAL flaws. Mainly being jointly the developers and moderation team, especially in areas such as decision making.The developers will happily break something to change the game, and 'accidentally-on-purpose' increase the performance of something and then put it on sale for a while. So, so shameless. The moderation team, are truly exempt from rules, although they like to say that they're bound by their rules too, it looks good but it's not true. The people who hold authority over them speak Russian, in Russia. They trust that the English speaking staff will manage things accordingly, but that trust is misplaced. It's ran with a very """"You'll do as I say or else"""" atmosphere, Speaking out against their decisions results in a punishment, voicing an opinion, first-time offenses, and if they dislike you, they'll go out of their way to punish you. They particularly hire moderators that like to throw their weight around, watch general chat for a while, you'll see what I mean.The overall direction the game seems to be going in, is very + and -. The developers don't seem to review what we tell them directly is bad, yet force it upon us (20 Tiers to 5 Tiers ahem) Oh and that annoying self inverting camera angle. The USA seem to have it easy, probably because they pay the most. It wouldn't surprise me, these guys are shameless. Although I still have hope for this game, I must rate it negatively, this may change if THEY change.. But that's the problem. Until these catastrophic issues are resolved, I strongly advise you to play other games... Whilst we all hope that they get their @#!$ together.And yes, I'll speak out against their power abusive ways here because I can.. Or can I? Incoming ban."",0"

"3598,War Thunder,2018.0,""Sadly this game is turning into garbage. Its the basic definition of pay2win games, the grinding is insane and if you even want a chance to get to top tier you might as well pour your entire bank account into there game."",0"
"3599,War Thunder,2016.0,""War Thunder is sadly one of the game i decided to quit after following it over a long time. Playing a few hundred hours non-steam and 243 hours on steam i can safely say that i am done with it. Ive been a beta tester for planes & tanks and have had experience with early gameplay and the final gameplay - very often not a big difference between those two.The flight part is very good, might be even one of the best free flight games on the market. You have an enormous amount of planes over various nations with let you play in a lot of different ways. Bomber, Dive Bomber, Torpedo Bomber, Fighters, Attackers, Jets [...]. The matchmaking is okay, depending on the game mode you are playing. You have the choice between Arcade, Realistic, Simulation. The names indicate how realistic each mode is. A huge flaw however is the huge grind it takes once you reach slightly higher levels. The sheer amount of planes which you need to research to reach a new tier is insane! I would still recommend this for casual players.The tank part is incredibly bad. Many problems with it were addressed during the closed beta, but were never resolved. The Dev's were spamming unnecessary updates for stuff that did not need to get fixxed. While they tried to be realistic they went overboard and got too realistic. Tanks being able to fire rounds which were incredibly rare during WW2? Hey, doesnt matter, lets fully load them with it! Now every tank is gonna be a one shot easy kill. Bugs over bugs made this hugely anticipated game mode unplayable. Overall i do not recommend this game. The grind is just too strong and the overwhelming amount of bugs and problems within the game is too problematic."",0"
"3600,War Thunder,2018.0,""So this is the first time I leave a review ever since I feel it's really necessary for people considering playing this game and ESPECIALLY those looking to put money into it. It's a sinkhole, don't do it.Let's start off with the good stuff:- The game look absolutely amazing. Graphics and effects are pretty good.- Many different ways of playing this game. Realistic/arcade and it plays really smooth.- Support for a lot of controlers and VR.- There is no competition for this genre.On to the bad stuff:There is NO competition, which makes Gaijin free to turn this game into a freemium micro transaction nightmare (which it did). Higher tier vehicles are locked behind such a massive grind, you cannot even imagine. It will take you DOZENS OF GAMES if not HUNDREDS to unlock a single vehicle in tier IV and tier V.Premium tanks go for absurd amounts of money (20-50 euros for a single tank/airplane, think about that real hard for a bit). The grind is absolutely the worst I have ever seen in my life. You have to unlock them first by researching the vehicle, but then you also have to have enough silver lions to buy them, of which you earn very very little during games, combined with high repair and ammo costs, which leaves you with a couple of thousand of silver lions, while new vehicles cost 100k minimum. You do the math.This game used to be amazing. I remember sinking in hours and hours because I am in love with all WW2 related stuff. I even sank in some money from time to time because I think they deserved it. Then they went full EA and the greed took over. Treat this game as if there is no late tier III, tier IV and tier V because by the time you get there world peace will have happened.The moment a competitor comes along you lose me."",0"
3601,War Thunder,2018.0,Played probably over 2000 hours of war thunder on my ps4 and my steam account. Gaijin really only cares about money bags and made the game a lot moreâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥recently. Cant recommend this game anymore,0
"3602,War Thunder,2018.0,""Gaijin is possibly the most out of touch developer the gaming industry has ever seen.For instance, this is just one example of their poor decision making, they allow you to buy premium vehicles which decrease the grind by alot, but they periodically decide that people are making too much progress and nerf the gains of the vehicles. Now you've paid for something explicitly to help you grind and it's literally the same as a vehicle you can get for free or sometimes worse.If youre into multi-thousand hour grinds and a company stealing your money when they feel like you're progressing too fast, this is the game for you."",0"
3603,War Thunder,2017.0,I loved it and now i despise it.The lack of proper balancing and new game modes have sucked the soul out of this game for me.And the fact that gaijin is nearly as oppressive as North korea.. ,0
"3604,War Thunder,2014.0,""This game started out as a very fun, exciting game which had you leaning on the edge of your seat while playing. But now that they've patched and updated several more times, it has lost its fun factor, due to the creators having made the game extremely difficult to proceed (levels etc) without paying money. I started playing while they  still had levelled planes and such, and that was when you could buy the planes without research points (which now you have to buy with real money) and so you're stuck playing untill you have enough research points to buy ONE plane... ONE! You'd think that you could buy two or maybe three, but when you play a battle, your battle points go towards a single plane which is unlocked eventually after about six successful battles. So if you get this game and think you're going to coast through to the top level, be prepared to buy a premium account and dish out the money to get there."",0"
"3605,War Thunder,2013.0,""UNINSTALLED ON MY 2nd DAY OF PLAYING. I've already gotten fed up with being cannon fodders for the pro's.This MMO combat flight sim started out fun for me. I've played a good number of combat flight sim's, both realistic and arcade-ish, so I'm pretty experienced with them. This one has good graphics and different levels of realism and numerous control options and a plethora of aircraft to choose from and tinker with.When I first got started, I was flying a late WWI era plane, and so were pretty much all the other players in the matches. Most if not all of us were newbies at this game. At first, it was fun and challenging, and I found myself consistently ranking in the top #2 or #3 spot on my team (this, mostly due to my experience with other combat flight sim's). But after I reached level 3, I started getting thrown in to swim with the sharks - that is, the veteran players of this game - and it got un-fun real fast. At 3rd and 4th level,I found myself being shot down quickly and repeatedly by level 20-40 players. Not only were these players way more experienced with the game than I was, their planes were way better too! I would have to line them up with my relatively slow and jittery plane and fire away at them with my plinky little 7.62mm machineguns, trying to whittle them down, while they could swiftly turn around and get behind me with their faster and sleeker planes and blow me away with just a burst or two from their 20mm cannons."",0"
3606,War Thunder,2016.0,it was good until i realized how overpowered the tier 3 russian things were. the game has been out for so long and is still more broken than battlefield 1 beta. this game is absoulote trash and it deserves to be abandon by its players so maybe the devs will take some time and fix it,0
"3607,War Thunder,2015.0,""Being a real fan of WW2 games,this game took me away with it.War Thunder is absolutely the most realistic game of its kind.This game gives you chances to play WW2 tanks and planes.This game is free,but to get the fastest progress you have to buy a premiun account.But,since this game gives you a daily reward, in some days you can get free eagles.So the games gives you chances to make a good progress without buying anything.This game is supposed to be realistic,so that means harder to play.There's no HP,only true penetration and skill.Also this game is usually updating,wich makes the game better and better.Absolutely recommended.9,8/10"",1"

"3609,War Thunder,2017.0,""This game is fun... for a while. Then it devolves into a massive rage enducing s**t storm.I'll give the game credit where it's due. It looks very nice and it's more realistic compared to WoT.Sadly, the match making in this game is horrible. When you start out, the most you have to worry about is making sure you don't die and everyone is pretty much on the same level. The MOMENT you research a Tier 2 Tank/Plane however, it throws you in the deep end and puts you up against people who have unlocked Tier 4 and 5 Tanks/Planes, of which the Tanks can one shot anything ranked below them, and the Aircraft battles feel like you're a grunt going up against Team Starfox (and no amount of barrel rolls will save you).Plus, whenever you get a new Tank, it's a load of garbage, and the only way you can research the parts needed to make it better is to take it into battle, which means you're playing at a disadvantage till it's fully upgraded, and, usually, by the time that happens, you've researched a new (and probably better) tank to replace it.It's a shame it had to end this way, as I was really enjoying myself and felt like I was getting somewhere, but the minute the bulls**t hit the fan and the rage enducing Tier 5 Tank one shots started happening, I dropped this thing like a bomber payload, without the satifying explosion."",0"
"3610,War Thunder,2016.0,""I've spent some hours in this game and wont recommend the game to anyone.Sure there are some Pros:- Graphics- Details- Variety- CustomizationBut there are some Cons that are to heavy to ignore:- Hitbox: the Hitboxes are kind of a joke. You can hit the same point over and over, it wont mess up a tank or plane. That's kind of bullsh... You can empty your complete Ammo into the other plane or tank. They're still flying/driving without any problems. You get two or three hits and you're down (not all the time but most of it)- Aiming: you can aim however you want, if the rng don't say you hit, you wont hit.- Progress: Progress is so slow and takes way too long.- Exclusives: Some planes or tanks are only available for money. And this doesn't make any kind of fun. Customization and money okay,but that with planes/tanks is a no go. It's more like a DLC in a f2p.- Controls: Sure, controls are in arcade and """"realistic"""" good, but in Simulatorbatlles (what is the true realistic) the plane controls are complete messed up. I died lot of times in planes flying in circles and couldn't do anything.- Balance: Balance in this game is horror. Some tanks and planes are so unbalanced, that's kind of joke.- Matchmaking: Some people say there is something like matchmaking. In my opinion it's more like: Put some Tanks together on a map and let's have a look what will happen.If you're looking for a WW2 game this is a good game. For anyone else this game is nothing for you."",0"

"3626,War Thunder,2017.0,""Now personally i would rate is a yes, and i really want to give it that thumbs up, because the game is really well done, and I dont mind a good grind. flying some of the planes and driving some of the tanks that youve worked for is really fun and i enjoy the game. The only reason i dont recomend the game is because of something that the game has no real control over. The Community.The community that the game has with it is extreamly toxic, espcially if you just want to destress and have a fun time. With aviation specificly, i feel that seal clubbing happens, atleast as this reveiw is written, very common. I back this up with flying a plane can be easy, but pulling off some of the manuevers that are rather hard, even by todays pilots, is not something a first time pilot would know of, or even complete without some practice. To further back this up, I've ran into a lot of pilots who have DAYS recorded just playing fighters or attack planes, what is fine and all, but vs noobies... its like having stealing from a baby. The game rewards players, both tankers and pilots in a way for seal clubbing by letting them use the XP they gained to further the tank/plane that they are currently reseaching, but tanks can only research tanks and planes, planes, respectivly.I personally dont think i will stop playing the game after this reveiw, i really do like playing the game, its just if your looking at getting the game, know that some tanks and planes are sometimes put into games a teir ahead, or behind of what its ment to be, what is good if you are flying a C .50 with a BR rating just slightly under 2 at 1.7 (i want to say) and your facing biplanes with a BR rating of a flat 1.0 with rather flimy struts. Also know that you will be doing a lot of grinding for that plane or tank that you want to play, but like mentioned earlier, you dont have to buy the next tank to keep progessing down a line, or getting a better verient of plane.I think the game would improve more if instead of sprinkling in some planes and tanks here and there, and adding a new teir (what i have no XP and wont for a long time with), maybe increase the variety of planes, and add tanks (if they historicly had them) to the italian line. Another thing that i think might me nice, would be to group people up by if they are just starting a nation, and only have the starter tanks/planes. just so its more of a learning enviornment. I dont really know how to make the community less toxic though... maybe punish freindly fire or something, i cant suggest anything really, its more or a person thing, not a game mechanic thing...If you still want to give war thunder a try, i highly recomend trying it out, just be warry of things,-Wolftron"",0"
"3627,War Thunder,2016.0,""I pretty much exclusively play the Tanks now, but you'll probably see in many other reviews a common theme: Russian bias. The dev's are so offended by the fact that their technology was far inferior in WWII they feel the need to buff the s h i t out of them to make it """"fair"""". Don't you think it's great when you shoot at something with 45mm of armor, only for your shot to bounce (even though it's rated to penetrate over 100mm)? sure you could argue """"sloping armor"""", but sloping armor only applies when im SHOOTING THEM FROM A POINT WHERE IT ISN'T PERPENDICULAR TO MY SHELL'S TRAJECTORY. It's utter bulls hit, everytime you survive a russian shot, you should put a penny in a jar, that way, in 10 years, you will have 1 penny in a jar. The bias is ridiculous to the extent where the german captured KV-1 (a god d amn russian tank), where the ONLY change the germans made was putting a SUPERIOR GUN on it, will lose in a head-to-head fight with a regular, inferior, russian KV-1. The stats they show on the tanks when you hover your mouse over them may surely well be accurate, but that's just what they SAY the tank's stats are. For russian tanks, you can pretty much reduce the chance of fire to zero, double the armor, increase the penetration, all while nerfing the f uck out of all the other, far better tanks, and then you'll get a taste of that good old War Thunder """"Realism"""". Historically accurate my a$$. Yes, I've had fun with this game, and a majority of that was spent far away from the tank battles so I could shoot down planes. might be fun for a while, but you'll really start to get sick of it pretty quick."",0"
"3628,War Thunder,2018.0,""Been playing this game since early Beta, and all I can say is it started at the top of a hill, and rapidly begun to roll downwards.Stalinium is a thing. The game has an insane level of Russian bias in both the aircraft and tanks. If you're in anything not Russian, be prepared to have your bullets and cannon shells doing absolutely nothing, and watching as high velocity, high armor-penetration shells bounce off Russian vehicles with literally little more than paper for armor.This game has *amazing* physics and superbly accurate round mechanics (with some exceptions as noted above). If it didn't have the bias due to the devs being Russian, it would be a perfect game, especially with it being free to play.But as it is, if you're playing in anything not Russian, it's just a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing pain in theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ It's impossible to get decent matches or do well, and on top of that, the community is absoluteâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I'm talking League of Legends levels of salt and toxicity.Do not waste your time with this game."",0"
"3629,War Thunder,2016.0,""- World of oneshots- LOTS of grind- Lack of skill balance, 1lvl noob plays against 100lvl pro- Game has like 3 modes on 3 maps (there are more maps but you almost always will be playing on the same ones)- Repetitive gameplay- You have to put vehicles in slots BEFORE you know which gamemode you will be playing. Set the bombers in all slots and watch the game throwing you on a map without ground targets- You can't collect international team of your favorite warmachines. Everything is divided into nations and unlocking everything in every nation takes an eternity or lots of money. I thought this game was about military vehicles not about nations- You can't even try the vehicles you haven't unlocked yet, even in the singleplayer maps. You can try the next one to unlock, but you can't try rank 5 if you are on rank 1- The game is years old and there are no descriptions to a lot of vehicles yet- Cheaters (The devs say there are no cheaters but you can google cheats for Warthunder videos and find out yourself :))This game is really fun when you are just starting out, when everything is new and unlocks fast, and I had a lot of fun playing the first few ranks with friends. But then it quickly becomes repetitive and boring. Vehicles take ages to unlock, you are playing the same modes on the same maps, and it takes way too much time (and luck) to master your skill. I would recomend trying it since its free, but don't expect too much from it."",0"

"3635,War Thunder,2017.0,""+ Over 500 Aircraft, ranging from He-51 biplane, through carrier-borne F4U Corsair, to Hawker Hunter subsonic jet fighter, including bombers and attackers such as B-17 and IL-2. You can explore tech trees of 6 nations: USA, Germany, USSR, Great Britain, Japan and newly added Italy. Begin with early pre-war designs, fight using iconic aircraft of WW2 and ultimately end up with jet fighters of the 50s: Sabres and MiG 15 and 17 for example.+ Over 300 Ground Vehicles, Light Tanks such as Pz.38(t), Medium Tanks like T-34, Heavy Tanks like PzKpFw VI Tiger, Tank Destroyers and Self Propelled Guns, including StuG assault guns and Su-85s, and even Self Propelled Anti Aircraft Artilerry, for protecting your fellow tanks in mixed battles. Did I mention Main Battle Tanks, such as german Leopard and Anti-Tank Missile carriers (IT-1)? Begin with early 30s tanks, assume conrol of the famous WW2 military vehicles and get to Main Battle Tanks of the 60s.  Explore tech trees of 5 nations: USA, Germany, USSR, Great Britain, and newly added Japan.+ Mostly Free to Play game, with all features available to everyone. You can not buy any significant advantage in battles against other players, other than exclusive premium vehicles ( not superior to the ones in the regular tech tree but still unique ) and faster in-game progression.+ 3 Game Modes to choose from for both Aviation and Tanks. Jump into Arcade Battles for quick action, choose Realistic Battles to battle your enemies and end up in Simulator battles, where War Thunder shows its true superiority over other Free to Play WW2 titles.+ Choose your playstyle --- evade and come back for enemy in A6M2, descent on your enemies from above in P-47 or deatomize them in full head-on engagement with hevily armed Me-410. Bomb out enemy bases with fighter escort in Lancaster or rush them in your Do-217E. Will you mount rockets on your F6F and provide air support? Or take out Ju-87 and attack with amazing precision. Scount ahead in your Light Tank, spoilt superior firepower with your Medium Tank or soak up enemy shells with Heavy Tank. You can also lay back and snipe with you Tank Destroyer or secure air using your SPAA.+ Realistic damage models for all aerial and ground vehicles, with no exceptions and HP bars - to destroy and aircraft, you have to knock out the pilot, tear its wing or tail, or set it ablaze, but destroying the elevator will also get the job done.To destroy a tank, you have to knock out its crew, burn it down or destroy its ammo rack, but you can damage its cannon breach and threaten it by huge explosion if he tries to fire back.+ Excellent way, or at least first step to learn about history of WW2 aviation and tanks, while also having fun+ You can download incomplete client ( which is about 4GB large ) and try the game out prematurely if you are not sure about downloading it whole ( or you are impatient :) )+ Instructor makes flying with just a mouse easy - simply aim your mouse in whichever direction you want to fly and the plane will steer that way using the Instructor+ Naval forces are already in Closed Beta testing phase and you can participate by purchasing a naval battle back (Project 1124 armored river boat(USSR) or PT-119 torpedo boat(USA))+ Game is constantly in development and new content is released every few months in a form of a large update- To join the client, or even use the Single Player content of the game, you have to have internet connection- Sadly, not always enough players on servers to join battle quickly- Few balancing issues can occur with some vehicles- Vehicles of high ranks are slow to research, if you are planning on getting cold war jets and main battle tanks, you will probably have to buy a Premium account ( more Silver Lions(SL-non-premium in-game currency)  and Research Points(RP) made from battles ) or purchase a premium vehicle ( exclusive vehicle, that you can earn a lot of research points and Silver Lions with, you get it permanently )Overall, I recomment this game to even those not familiar with these type of games, as it is definitely a better teacher than school itself ( I mean with vehicles of the war )"",1"

This game is for you. Are you a weapons geek? A Vehicle expert? This game is somewhat for you. (Considering Gaijin needs to fix things here and there. Which they are.) 4: Stay away from the idea of National Bias (I.E Russian Bias, Japanese Bias, ect.)5: Watch out for people who judge your playstyle.

"3637,War Thunder,2017.0,""Lets start by saying, this is my most played Game, and my most favorite at that.So this is probably the best Free World War 2 Vehicle combat game you can find. It has really good graphics, fun gameplay, and easy to learn basics. This is also really realistic (atleast for physics) because sometimes WW2 Tanks face Post War Tanks. The HUGE amount of vehicle variety gives a replay value with i think over 400+ vehicles in the game across the 7 Nations.The Graphics for this game are REALLY good. You can get beautifull graphics with a good PC, but if you dont really have a good Computer you can still run this game, altough it is verry disguisting at ULQ.The Gameplay is really fun. Yes, there are premium vehicles, but every Tank and Plane has its weakness and ANY Premium or Vanilla vehicle can be destroyed if you know that weakspot, although some maybe harder to destroy. In my opinion this game is not P2W even though at times it may seem like it,but its really not.The community is verry active&helpfull altought the ingame community can sometimes be cancerous.My closing toughts are that this game is really fun and beautiful. I Would recommend this to anyone that likes World War 2 and Post War Tank and Air Combat. Even for the person that doesnt love WW2 combat i would still recommend you to give it a try!"",1"

Don't get me wrong, tanks are a blast, just don't commit to Germany because they constantly get nerfed and higher tiers is all but impossible. Don't even buy the Maus as you'll just face ATGM and APFSDS rounds that make anything but spaced armour useless. All in all, this russian dev company has an obvious hatred for the tanks that ruined their forces for a while."",0"
"3648,War Thunder,2018.0,""The game(Especially ground forces) isn't fun, at least for me anyways,95% of the time you get one shot by enemy tanks out of nowhere, The grind for new vehicles is excruciating, it's just...not fun"",0"
