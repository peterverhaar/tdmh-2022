"363,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""First of all I must say the plot is amazing. Its like you get The Last Of Us and Half Life and they had a baby, with beautiful graphics! But I must say the best part of all is the DLC I normally dont like DLC in games for I feel they should be free. But in this case that would be like giving an ethiopian 10 million dollars. I must say I do hate it when you want to reset so you can buy pets. because then it takes a while till I can get to the final mob """"The Owl"""" They should also add a Co-op mode. Thanks for the great game and keep up the great work."",1"
364,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,Sublimely Magnificent game which put your mind at ease!Can be played with 1 hand or no hand.Great for exercising your fingers while exorcising and purifying monsters yet getting lots of GOLD making you feel extremely rich just by sitting down looking at the screen.,1
"365,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""It's free & 'amusing,' but it's arguably one of the worst games on Steam. Boring as hell & basically plays itself. The -one- song is terrible & the art is really no better than free online galleries that have been out for decades. Devs need to step their game up. Taking one look at the steam community will tell you all you need to know about this game & probably give you a few good laughs."",0"
"366,Sakura Clicker,2018.0,""Sakura clicker is a game where you click on the screen to reduce the life of a """"monster"""" (an anime girl dressed up as something) until you defeat it. It is replaced by another creature, and you repeat the process gaining gold to buy allies who help deal damage to the monsters. It's an infinite cycle of the same thing. The game even plays for you so you can accumulate gold even when you are not playing.I kept playing wondering if there was anything else to it, but there really isn't. If you are into this kind of game (maybe an appropriate game for cell phones?), good for you. However, most people will probably not find any joy in playing this."",1"
367,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,I disappointed my family..my dad punched me already..my ma killed herself because im a woeful disgrace for my entire family..my brother became horny.. he is 9..i dont know if i can get my old life back..Otherwise its a great game..So 10/10.,1
"368,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""In terms of free idle games, you can get a lot better honestly. If you REALLY want THIS game in particular, then there's no real reason to get it other than anime tiddies.Also, DLC for an idle game? Seriously?"",0"

"371,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Omg, the few hours of Sakura Clicker i had were enjoyable ones! The franchise surprised us all with such a great, awe inspiring, master piece for the ages. This game will go down in history for it's stunning art style, and radiant voice acting. I would give this game 11/10 hentai babes. The constant release of new dlc keeps your character """"Fresh"""", and makes the replayability of the game that much higher. Great Game, Classic hit!!~"",1"
"372,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Well, This game doesn't offer much if imagination is not played into hand. Could have a lot of fun doing random stuff, spamming that mouse button and enjoying the sounds of the yuri ladies at the background.Not sure if a clicker is allowed or not, assuming most people would probably use one but it does seem to have a lot of levels  and hopefully it gets updated. In terms of DLC's they do offer a slight perversion side to the game allowing the imagination to grow and have more fun with it.Final Verdict 10/10 would fap, i mean click again!"",1"
373,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,SummaryAn idler clicking weeb game.My GripesNo Steam achievements gives no incentive to play but for a few moments.Requires a mod to make the ladies uncensored.RatingStale hentai idler. Nothing special here.2/10 ,0
"374,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Sakura clicker is a generation defining and groundbreaking videogame. On first glance, it may seem like a simple game where you click on images of lightly dressed cartoon women as they moan, but describing the game like that would be like judging a book by it's cover.Sakura clicker actually has more depth than the Mariana trench. The gameplay consists of clicking the fine women, and aquiring gold as you do so.You can use this currency to upgrade the damage you do as you click the ladies, or purchase items that do damage over time.the game also allows you to customize your protagonist with various clothing and hairstyles that you can purchasefor a dollar each as DLC. Overall, sakura clicker is the videogame equivalent of shawshank redemption.Also, KAWAII SENPAI TANOSHI DESU NE!!!~~"",1"
"375,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""Let me start off saying that this review will not mention all the boobs, cute auifits and almost nude anime girls that make this game a must have for any lover of anime.This game if first and foremost fot those that are looking for an excuse to buy a new mouse!10/10 best way to kill andy cheap mouse you may have and get yourself a great gaming mouse after!P.S. This game also kills time and is a great way to challenge yout buddies to see how long one can last before someone finds this a total waste of time.Update*** After all was said and done, I have yet to get away from this game and find myself still clicking away... <(ToT)>"",1"
376,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,My dads beat me. I thought if I showed them my progress in the game they would stop and finally love me like before mom left.They didn't... the beatings intensified... 10/10 for catgirls and parental dissapointment.,1
"377,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""I loved this game until the last update. Now the game is broken.- Clicking becomes litterally useless early game- Your powers once you unlock them are based on clicking power, so also useless right from the start since clikcing is already trivial when you get those.- Some upgrades are buggued- Ingame Bonusses are now so rare and worthless, you dont even want to pay attention to the game anymore to get those.The developpers took a great entertaining and addicting game, and made it a frustrating and anoying game. Until they fix this, if they do fix it, i do not recommend the game to anyone."",0"
"378,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Since I don't really know what to review in this, *eh-ehm*, """"game"""", here's a 4-ingredient Nutella Cookies recipe:INGREDIENTS:1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour1 extra large egg1 cup of Nutella (using dry measuring cup rather than the one used for liquids)1 teaspoon of baking powderDIRECTIONS:1. Preheat oven to 350F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silpat mat.2. In a large mixing bowl, combine all ingredients. Stir with a large wooden spoon until smooth batter forms and there are no flour or egg streaks.3. Form small round circles, slightly less than 1 1/2 inches in diameter. The dough should be enough for 12 cookies. Place on baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Split between two baking sheets so that the cookies don't stick together when they spread. Place in oven and bake for about 10 minutes. Let cookies cool on sheet before removing and eating.Bon appetit. "",1"
379,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,I still remember those innocent days in which I played cookie clicker and clicker hero. Never would I have imagined myself to reach a lower point in my life. I wonder to this day what I had done wrong in my life to get to this point of playing sakura clicker for hours non stop,1
380,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,How many Clicker games there will be on Steam? lol why did i started that Review With a Question goddamnit. well its their choice if they want to bring more then.Anyway...This kind of Clicking game is a Sexy one eh.Its about Anime Or hentai girls from the Sakura series and yeah its just about time that they have decided to make a Clicking game of the Sakura Series though.All i've have to say is this game is Great because its Clicking game and they have most popularity on Steam so far and yeah its about Clicking on some Great looking Sexy girls.Warning:The Ladies Moans actually give a Boner for those who turn in to the game.So Anyway.. This game is good no more to add.Rating:8/10,1

"382,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Once you get over the initial weirdness and """"sexiness"""" (which might take like, 15 minutes)  you'll realize its a hastily made and horribly slow-paced idle game.  I'd say skip on it."",0"
"383,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,"" Note: This is going to be a 'serious' review Normally I like Sakura games. They're fun perverted visual novels with absolutely Ludacris plots, dialogue, and situations that scream fan service with copious amounts of anime boobs, butts, and the occasional tentacle monster or two. However Sakura Clicker is anything but that. Yes, it does have Anime girls(dressed as animals and Ancient Egyptian gods for some reason - so I guess if you get off to Anubis or Osiris this is the game for you) but that's really it. You click on those Animal/Egyptian god Anime girls to do damage while your character stands awkwardly to the right and watches you. Each Animal/Egyptian God Anime Girl you defeat drops gold which you can use to hire Hero's to help you or upgrade stats and that's basically it. All you end up doing is basically click as hard as you possibly can until your wrist feels like it's about to implode and ending up on the next monster. The game is a never-ending grind fest of just doing that over and over again while facing the same 5ish Animal/Egyptian God anime girls over and over again. So why this game was made you ask? """"Oh it can't be that bad, it's free right?â€ One answer: To sell DLC outfits to thirsty guys that makes your character that stands to the right be wearing a bra made out of a ribbon or something. PROS It's freeThe girls moan when you click themI guess this game could finally quench someoneâ€™s thirst who has an ancient Egyptian God fetish CONS Pretty obvious the game was made to sell DLCDLC is overpriced (for a dollar it doesn't even change how the monsters look - just the outfit of your character who stands to the left and creepily watches you play this game)Grind fest Conclusion Skip over this one. If you really want to play a Sakura game, check any of the other Visual Novel ones out or wait for Sakura Fantasy Chapter 2. "",0"
"384,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""9/11 Could be better, but the graphics are very good. The sound track is amazing 10/10. One tip if you get this game is dont let your parents see you playing it, they might disown you for being a dirty weeaboo. "",1"
"385,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""This game consists of many half naked waifus and domestic violence disguised by the waifus moans, be it pleasure or pain, who cares right?It's quite incredible because you can beat yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥while you beat the waifu. A whole new level of """"next generation"""" gaming is now realised thanks to the perfection of """"Sakura clickers""""You can even expand the realism of this game by cuddling up to a body pillow of x hot anime grill and enjoy an evening of domestic violence and the moaning waifu together.This game is flawless, I give it a solidâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥10 because of it's perfection, and NOT because of the stiffy I got."",1"
"386,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,""This game. This game is absolutely beautiful. It is a piece of art. This a game that will be compared to games like The Last of Us and The Legend of Zelda, and will be remembered in multiple decades. Totally worth a try. Not cancerous at all"",1"

"388,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""It's basically the exact same thing as every other clicker game, except this time, it's anime. Also, mechanically, it's objectively the worst in every single way. So, if you like â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ games BUT it also has to be the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥iest one in the genre, OR you need it to have anime girls, download this. You will regret it."",0"
"389,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,""If you like playing a game with no point to it then this is the game for you. For those of you here for the """"nudity"""", there is none. There are characters with clothes who moan weirdly while you click on them in a game where you click on the screen that gets exponentially harder with no rewards. Where I'm at at the moment you make about 1/5,000,000th of what you need to buy the next character (with a number of bonuses, not exagerating, been at this point for more than a week). Furthermore, the math in this game makes no sense, if you have a character get say a 500% increace in their attack, it will increase more than 5X their original attack damage, but nowhere near 5X the attack danage they currently have...I'm not sure what sort of numbers they're basing the attack bonuses off of, but none of it seems to make any sense. If you have extra memory and CPU power and want to run it in the background for a while for no reason, then go ahead, but otherwise don't bother with this junk."",0"

"392,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""So I gave this game a try since it is free and kind of a novelty. The novelty being that is something of a """"sexy"""" clicker game. Also the amount of expected shame from playing such a thing. It works.It succeds at being a decent clicker game. It triggers that horrible compulsive behavior that many love and or hate. There are enough mechanics to keep you actively playing if you wish.The sexy part is as expected. It does have an endless slideshow of cute anime girls, all making the noises one would expect. I suppose if I played this when I was 14 I would be turned on. However I turned off all the audio pretty quickly.Because most clicker games are designed to play minimized, I like to imagine some people playing this a lot. Minimized on their desktop, listening to the random anime moans as they work on speadsheets or something."",1"
"393,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""A highly addicting game. In essecne, a NSFW version of cookie clicker. A down fall is that there is no objective really other than to see how strong and how far you can get. I think it would be a smart idea to add achievemnts for the game like 'Rebirthed without hiring anyone' or 'maxed out (enter character name here)' or 'hired all comapnions' and so forth."",1"
"394,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""So, this game is pretty fricken dumb, but extremely entertaining. Before I knew it, I was spending up to 5 hours clicking away at the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥s of anime chicks.

"399,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""What the â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ did I just spend the last 14 minutes of my life doing, I mean really. For one, you just click the screen.

I mean what the hell is she even doing there. Ever cat girl meowed, which was repulsive. Speaking of repulsive, i have never been so flacent in my life. My little guy litterally receeded back inside me. At one point I think one of the monster girls said hentai, and i didn't know how to fell about that (sexually and emotionally). At this point you're probably asking, """"What made you play this game in the first place!?!?! Did u do it just to â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥?!?!"""" that is part of it. The other half was, I was desperate. My wife left me and took the kids. She is now â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing the pastor at the local Protestant church. I saw it come up as a recomended game. Now yes, I was in a sleezy motel by myself, hopped up on pain killers and with the barrel in my mouth. I was just about to pull the trigger when it caught my eye. Now, when I first started playing, i sat their clueless. Nothing was happening, plus the pain killers began to kick in. But as my whole body began numb, I realized if i click theâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥of the monster girl on the screen, I attacked it. This was the full game. I even stuck my fingers halfway down my throat to get the pills out of my stomach so I can last just a little longer. And boy, do i regret it. I regret it more than marrying that â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ of a wife. Long story short, this game only kept me alive for an extra 14 minutes. By the time you read this review, I wil be gone. I feel bad for anyone who thought this game was the best game ever. What kind of broken household did u have to live in!And dont get me started on the creators. THEY HAD A â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ING PATREON ON THE SCREEN! WHO THE â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ WOULD PAY FOR THISâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ And the names of some of the monsters are so generic. One was straight up called mud.

"411,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Clicking Simulator? Yes.Bad? Not if you like that sort of thing.Sakura Clicker is a game about clicking on women, some of whom are dressed to look like certain animals, until they drop gold. Would this be a ripoff if it cost money? Yes. Does it cost money? No, but you can buy outfits for 79 pence (GBP) each to make your character more scantily dressed.It's definitely enjoyable if you like this sort of thing. My question, though, is why buy the auto clickers? Some of the fun of this game, at least for me, is, *cough* """"admiring"""" my adverseries before defeating them.

"414,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""This Game Is Actually Quite enjoyable, an pretty good time killer :)The game is way to easy tho, needs an update which hardens the game!I Dont Really Like The Thing About That U Need To Purchase Some Costumes, that is some real BSNOTE: i dont really support these kinda games, u dun this review for the lols .( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°)"",1"
"415,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""there is nothing much i can say aside from that there is a nude mod for this game and is surprisingly addictive. as the title suggests its a clicker and i recommend an auto clicker like 'GS AUTO CLICKER' which is free which gets you through the zones quicker however higher zones will slow you down even with an auto clicker. my other recommendation is once you buy one or a few helpers (with some levels) then you must save and exit and wait about one week which helps with grinding and then you can rinse and repeat, alternatively you can wait longer if you dont plan on coming back to this game frequently. Also there is a nude mod which makes dlc kinda pointless but to each their own."",1"
"416,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Don't expect to be provided with any context in this game. You don't even get a start menu, it just boots right into the game and you're immediately slapping anime girls around for coins. Basically Clicker Heroes or Tap Titan with bewbies.I recommend if that's what you're looking for, otherwise this isn't really much of a game and would be better suited for the mobile market with stuff like CandyCrush and FlappyBird."",0"
"417,Sakura Clicker,2018.0,""So after the 15 hours and having almost of all the DLC, I can say that it a decent game.

I will give this a 7/10."",1"
"418,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""General Synopsis: A clicking game that simply takes time to advance and has no real goal other than something to check up on in the background every now and then.Difficulty: 0 (of 10)Cost: Free (has extras you can pay for)Good: -No learning curve as long as you speak English. -Something resembling a tech tree / strategy of sorts with the """"Ancients"""" you can acquire over time.-Very low resource hog, no matter how far along you get-Runs in the background so you advance while ignoring itBad: -Susceptible to the Cheat Engine program for modifications (good to ruin what satisfaction you COULD get or to test higher levels on your system)-No real entertainment or excitement factor as you don't really have to /do/ anything-If you Google it, you can find a cheat manipulator to REALLY make the game boring-No end goal other than buying all the heroes and continuously leveling them and acquiring ancients/achievementsResults: As something to have running in the background, just for something to do every now and then when you check up on it, the game isn't bad. It's also something good to keep a very young child entertained for a few minutes before they get bored once they use up all the gold/money and then find themselves with nothing to do. As a game meant to entertain, no good.  But for what its intended purpose/type of game it is, is, it's a good play.Happy gaming,-Paladeus"",1"

"421,Sakura Clicker,2018.0,""Product received for freeSakura Clicker is a game where you click on various girls (named and costumed like """"monsters"""") to win and to get coins. You can click on any place on the girl. There's no difference in the results. With the coins, you can buy more levels and allies. The allies fight for you automatically. The higher levels and improved allies allow you to keep winning without having to wait forever for the enemy hitpoints to go to zero, as the later enemies have ever more hitpoints than the previous ones. They also have more coins. The enemies and looting appear in an endless sequence. But despite the millions you amass, some things can be only bought from the Steam store with real money, apparently. But the game developers have to earn somehow. Thats reasonable.Pros- Resembling """"Adventure Capitalist"""", this game crystalizes the shallowness of the hack&slash  """"RPG"""": you repeat mindlessly, some number increases somewhere ad infinum.- Revolutionary """"your damage only"""" mode: the enemies do not even fight back.- The graphic design is pretty enough. The background changes now and then too.Cons- There are no cutscenes or adult content (unless you consider whats visible on the Steam screenshots as such).- You might expect the girls to lose clothes when you click on them. They don't. They wince and make a hentai-type exclamation or moan, often quite agreeable of having been beaten. That might be considered a plus, based on viewpoint.- The gameplay is incredibly shallow, you can mainly decide which ally to upgrade and when to hire.- There is no story. While waiting for that free hentai mahjong with some serious amount of serious sleaze, there are better things to do in life than 'play' Sakura Clicker, even if it is free."",0"
"422,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""So here is a serious review about this game.Pros: It's good for passing time, there is no complex storyline (or no storyline at all), the art is good and the soundtrack is nice.Cons (or maybe some other pros): The characters are made to look sentual, and the sounds they make don't help much.7/10 Could be worse"",1"

I was scroling through the free games and i seen the word """"Sakura"""" I screamed with pleasure and installed it.

It started to work so i get my lube and clicked furiously while fapping off myâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ The skin flew everywhere as blood covered the hole of my hand. Unfortunatly at that moment my dad walked in and said to me """"You're a dissapointment"""" So i.... Jerk'd off more blood flew onto my computer and blew the socket.

"426,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,""Need to spend money for costumes. Very little variety in girls, just dressed up in different clothes, hair styles, arms, tails, ears, necklaces and a few eye colours. No variety is voices either which you will mute after an hour. Late game progress to almost a standstill. So it'll take you hours to get enough money for new fighters. A way to earn costumes would have given you a goal but as is there is no reason for the gold earned other than help with auto play. Try it for an hour or 2, because thats the entire game"",0"

"431,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Some folks are going to hate on this because I like this game Unironicly. No, I don't consider this a Hentai game. This is a hentai game in about the same way that the moon is made of cheese. From a distance, someone uneducated could percieve it to be true, but it's just not. At most it's Ecchi, but the scantily clad anime women don't actually undress, pose in any manner that is remotely provocative, or try to make romantic advances on the player. The moaning and whining sounds risque at best, but you'd have to be severely innocent to be able to get an honest fap out of this game. Yes, the game does move at a slow crawl, but it's an idle game. It plays it's damn self when you close it, and then you come back to it. And you do other things. Nothing terribly new here. Some folks complain about a lack of monster variety, but I'm guessing they only played a few minutes, and never got to higher levels where things like dragon girls, harpies, and bunny girls start to show up. Perhaps the pacing for revealing new monster types is too slow for folks? It's meant to be slow. Found it fun to play while doing a lot of other things, which I am pretty sure is the intent. The different moans, while amusing, do run a bit old after a while. Thankfully there are options to silence everything if you want to. There are in game purchases, but they don't in any way affect the gameplay, which actually strikes me as a very honest free to play model. Buying outfits is not to enhance the gameplay: it's strictly there to support the developer, and you don't have to do it to enjoy pretty much everything the game really offers you.I'll probably unlock everything on this game over a period of a month or two, like with Clicker hero, before I get bored of it.The game may also have interesting updates in the future. We'll see.Also, by all accounts, better than Gone Home."",1"

The character on the right that I suppose is supposed to be you just stands there completely useless and devoid of any life or charm.  Perhaps the worse offender of this poor excuse for a clicker activity is the UI.  It's awful.  There's nothing here except the ability to pay money to dress up a paper doll.  At least with an actual paper doll you could do something interetesting with.  You can't even wipe yourâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥with this game.

"461,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""This is yet another game that I wish Steam had a neutral rating for.

However that's about all it has to offer. Yes it's free but even so it seems hastily put together to capitalize on the clicker game trend adding nothing new to the formula besides breasts. If that's all you want then it's fine but it gets boring pretty quickly other wise. Oh, and it has DLC outfits for some reason because ya know money. Play it free and enjoy the jigglies and you'll be ok."",1"
"462,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,""As someone who is not a fan of anime, this was an odd experience for me.  I imagine a large amount of the supposed appeal for this game lies in an enjoyment of this particular art style.  However, I must evaluate this game based on the experience I had with it, not the experience the core demographic might have with it.  I do have a fair amount of time invested in similar clicker and idle games.  Based on that exposure, I can say with some certainty that this is one of the worst clicker games on Steam.First of all, the sound design (the audio of which I imagine takes up a large portion of the space required for this game) is grating, which is a shame, since the game's description proudly touts the """"included 800+ moans as you defeat the monsters"""".  Despite the apparent variety of """"moans"""", they all sound about how you might expect without even playing the game.  Why there had to be over 800 of these sounds which are almost indistinguishable from each other, I do not know.The music, which plays on a one minute loop (which is fairly standard for these types of games), is fine on its own.  They seemingly put in a lot of effort in the """"moan"""" audio library, so it's odd that they didn't put that kind of effort into the soundtrack.  That might have been a plus, since one minute loops do get tiresome after dozens of hours.  The other sound effects aren't particularly special and there are no volume sliders.Secondly: the art style.  It isn't terrible, but I'm not a fan of it.  A cursory glance at Steam titles with the tag """"Anime"""" on them all seem to have basically the exact same style.  The women all look like they had an unfortunate slip into a shallow puddle of vaseline.Every one of the """"monsters"""" are just anime women wearing fragments of clothing that suggest they are the creatures they are supposed to represent.  Anubis has dog ears and a tail, Bear has claws and a smaller tail, Boar has weird ears and a longer tail, and Aqua has...a sash?  Alright.  You might notice very quickly that the designs for these """"creatures"""" are very cut-and-paste and uninspired.  I suppose the goal was to make the women vaguely resemble the thing the title suggests they should be without sacrificing their appearance, in which case I guess they did that fairly well.  I don't understand it, but I'm not exactly the target audience for this game.Third, and most importantly: the gameplay.  The gameplay is beyond monotonous.  As someone who has a lot of experience with these types of games, a good degree of monotony is expected, but this is just ridiculous.  In other games, when you progress far enough to """"prestige"""" (or """"Rebirth"""" in this case), you are given a certain amount of a currency which you can spend to unlock new abilities or increase the speed in which you can reach the point at which you restarted.  Sakura Clicker has a similar system, except considerably slower and less interesting.  Your first Rebirth will probably be spent increasing either your gold gain or damage done by 10% which is almost negligible.  Your second might give you enough to get another 10% and so on.  There is nothing added to the overall experience.I'm getting ahead of myself.  The main gameplay loop is to click on a """"creature"""" until it dies, collecting gold which you spend upgrading your clicks or hiring auto clickers which do more damage for you, and repeat ad nauseum.  You can level these characters up, increasing their damage, and every once in a while hitting a milestone which gives a passive bonus like increasing their personal damage by 100%, total damage by 20%, or gold gained by 25%.  These are all well and good, but they are way too infrequent and the former boost is going to be useless by the time you can afford the upgrade.  See, these upgrades come at fixed intervals: levels 100, 200, 400, and 600.  By the time you can afford to buy 100 of the same character, their damage output is usually less than 1% of your total damage output even after the upgrade.  The only ones worth getting are the total damage or gold upgrades, but again, these are very infrequent.  Perhaps a dozen hours wasn't enough time to fully evaluate the gameplay aspect of this game, but if you've played a game for 12 hours and feel like you've ground to a halt even after multiple resets and you're making no tangible progress, perhaps your game needs to be rebalanced.  It seems like the developer tried to clone another popular clicker game and just stick his art in it, but didn't actually play said game.  That essentially makes this a shameless cash grab, and that becomes clear once you take a look at the 21 DLC options for this title.So if you're looking for a clicker game, there are much better entries out there.  If you want an anime game, I'm sure there are much better entries out there.  If you want both, you're going to have to be able to put up with a lot of tedium, but honestly, you'd be better off skipping this altogether."",0"
463,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,to describe this game i use one wordBORING!!!!not only does it not fulfill the tag of nudity unless you call very skimpy clothing nude. the games basic mechanics were boring there was nothing to the games design to keep your interest. there was about 20-30 characters that just repeated and their clothes changed colors occasionally i could remember.the only plus to the game was the characters were good looking anime chicks with changing facial expressions when you clicked and landed critical hits.,0
464,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,love how there was actually real live females that were willing to moan into a microphone for thisbut did they know what character they would be? because If I was that dragon chick I'd have been proud to do it XD11/10 would click my dragon waifu again,1
465,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,Yet another Clicker game without any special appeal. Nothing that sets it apart from say Clicker Heroes in a good way. You'll enjoy it if you're a horny teen who hasn't figured out where to access actual Hentai yet.,0
"466,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""the sakura games are pretty nice VNs but this one is just a clicker copy and a bad one.i had to actually play it for 5 minutes to review it , i just want to warn people its a waste time. and it kinda sucks many weebs will rate any anime game withâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥a 10/10. back then on steam an anime game was a rarity, so any anime game was like a gem to be able to play it on steam and get backgrounds for it. there wasnt much out there,but i think we reached that point where theres enough already.in short the game is very boring,i played it for 2 minutes and couldnt review it,so i left it idle for another 3 minutes just to give it a bad score."",0"
467,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,To the idiots who are posting negative reviews i just have this to say. Why are you surprised that a game called Sakura CLICKER is nothing but a clicker? Wtf did you expect? And no the nudity tag isn't misleading because the devs made a patch to add it in since Steam won't let them have it right outta the gate.Anyway there's nothing wrong with the game and it's free so it's not like you paid for it. If you did then I would have a problem.,1
"468,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""I don't know if Clicker Heroes is the first game of that kind, but it certainly is my first, so I consider it as it and compare all the other games to it.If there's one thing done right there, beside the many things, is that it feels honest to you: you never feel cheated on because everything's mathematically correct.Sakura Clicker feels like a rushed game because of many reasons but the progress is certainly one of the worst. You feel like the developers just tried something to see how it goes, without putting much thinking into it.Most of the game is a copy/paste of Clicker Heroes (ascensions included) but with all of the functional changes done wrong.This ends up in upgrade cost being too high for the damage dealt, so the only good thing to do is to upgrade each ally 3 to 5 times then wait to buy the next one, and that wait means close the game and come back later. I know that happens to Clicker Heroes too, but here I mean literally play 2 minutes then idle for 5 hours or more. All the time.Since the aug 3rd update this situation got better, because the devs raised the damage a great lot, but that also proves the fact that this whole thing was just badly planned at the beginning, and it still doesn't feel right.This game suffer from many problems, and even though the devs seem to listen to the players and actually implement stuff that most people are asking, that could have be done before releasing it, and anyway we're far from something working right.It all feels like a cardboard game, with little to no animations (the only one being the enemies closing their eyes when beaten), just a few 8-bit like sound effects, and a short looping music that will get annoying very soon. The character design is nice but  it is just an excuse to attract people, because that's really the only good thing of this game.That said, those girls are just random, and there doesn't seem to be any pattern in their dressing. Bosses are just the same girls, but stronger.Your character is shown on the playfield, and you can change its appearance in a specific tab of the game. Most stuff has to be purchased with real-world money before being able to wear it (like the most sexy dresses), and that's the only thing you can purchase. The problem is that it just stand there doing nothing, so it doesn't really make sense to even be there.This game really feels like a quick cash-grab as there's nothing interesting to do while it runs beside purchasing upgrades, which, as I said, isn't really anything strategical since you just purchase the best ally and forget about the rest, so for most of the time you'll just have the game closed collecting money for you.The progress is non-existant as you can't really see any beside the small number indicating the level, because the game is always the same: random girls with a new random background every 10 levels.The worst thing about this game, though, is that you don't know where you are going.On Clicker Heroes you always have a clear objective, which isn't only to get further than your last ascension but it also gives you some clear short/mid/long range objectives to achieve and a little bonus if you manage to complete them, which are the in-game achievements. You have a reason to go further and a clear objective, and you also see an ending point to reach.In this game you don't have any. You just beat these always-the-same enemies for no reason at all, forever.Reaching further bosses has no meaning either, as they are simply another randomly-dressed girl which gives you nothing more than some coin, as all the other enemies.I see it as if this game tried to be another clicker with its own identity, but this new identity failed to be attractive and don't even work right."",0"
"469,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,""Sakura Clicker: The Newest and Greatest chapter in the Fire Emblem legacy.I'm honestly surprised that they released the newest Fire Emblem exclusively to PC, and for free! I was flabberghasted, and promptly downloaded it and started to play. And what I played was the most gripping, emotional experience I've ever had with a video game. This game is up there with the greats. Shadow of the Colossus, Ocarina of Time, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (preferably with the '& Knuckles' addon), Paper Mario: Sticker Star, and many more.I've already beaten the game, and I cannot wait to do a New Game +.Do I recommend Shin Megami 5: Fire Emblem 15: Sakura Clicker?Yes."",1"

"472,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Sakura Clicker made me feel funny, I guess.You know god damn well why you downloaded this game.You see, I have a love/hate relationship with Winged Cloud. On one hand their visual novels aren't hard to read by any means. I mean, the girls are cute and it's light hearted enough to not take offense to anything. But then they do this thing where every point of view character irks me at a spiritual level.See, I'm noâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ I was only the Sex Offender world champion from 1975 to 1999. That being said, when women are pretty much rubbing their used panties against your face, I think you have the go ahead.  See, what Sakura clicker does right is that it just kind of gets rid of that fool they force you to learn about in their other products. This time they replaced the self insert male character surrounded by cute girls by making said character a cute girl. The game is a clicker, as it says in the title. What you do is click on """"monsters"""" until they're defeated so you can make gold to recruit more heroes to help you fight said monsters. Considering how the monsters react to your attacks I assume that spanking is involved in some way. There really isn't much to say about the game other than this. There's a little bit of customization that you can do to your avatar. I added cat ears and a tail to mine so that says something about me. Sakura Clicker isn't for me. I see the appeal in clicker games, and cute monster girls can really take something like this so far for me. My enjoyment of this game was directly tied to the condition of my doodle. Do you enjoy clickers? Then by all means, go nuts. Do you enjoy cute girls with cat ears? Well this will keep your attention for a little bit longer. Other than that, play about 30 minutes, write a fan fiction about the events, make a mess of your keyboard, have yourself a good ol time.

"477,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""TL:DR The new update annihilated the game, don't waste your time until the positive reviews start coming back.The long version is that the game had some minor balancing issues, it played less like a clicker game and more like a macro game until you got to higher zones, when finally your clicks mattered to how much damage you'd do. Additionally, Attack Speed was a little broken since (as far as I know from how far I got into the game, about zone 40-45) you could only get attack speed with Spirits, so you'd spend your spirits on Attack Speed and get Damage and Gold Gain from leveling your girls to level 200, 400 or 600.Taking this minor balancing issue into consideration, the devs decided to murk the entire game and put it into an unplayable state, your clicks matter more and you're able to use an ability to essencially get 100% crit chance (crits now do x10 damage instead of x2, HOWEVER the ability takes 30 minutes to refresh) but now leveling the girls gives barely any damage, and your click damage in the mid to late game is dependant on the damage of your girls (You gain a % of their damage towards your clicks). It now takes hours to defeat some of the earlier bosses that you'd previously be able to beat your first or second try after collecting a small amount of gold.The only positive thing I can say is that it's nice that the damage your girls deal to the enemy isn't 'chunky' anymore, and now the enemy health bar slides down. Legitimately the only positive thing I can say."",0"

NOPE, links to the store, still nothing.Until or unless the trading cards are relabeled correctly as """"collector items"""" specifically for this game, I can only come to the conclusion that Steamworks have been scammed into promoting this with certain features to get money for themselves and whomever they allowed booster ability.Unless you're a fan of the artist or clicker hero type games, which you honestly could be going elsewhere for anyway, this is the absolute WORST form of begging I've seen.Don't offer trading cards when you can't unlock booster.

Clearly, people have booster capability and the developer is ignoring questions on how others may also obtain it.Not being able to unlock booster while others obviously have seals the deal, I know a racket when I see one, but just when you thought broken and discontinued items on steam were bad enough, this is clearly misadvertised as having """"trading cards"""" when the low amount and high prices for the cards AND BOOSTERS clearly screams some of somebodies buddies were given the feature so they can sell the cards while others weren't. At a ransom price for cards in general. ...30 cents for one reg card.Is this a f2p that I can spend 40 dollars with my steam wallet or a hostage situation?I'm going to look around for someone to make this right, but for all intents and purposes, DO NOT BUY DLC IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO UNLOCK BOOSTER, SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY WRONG HERE AND IT STINKS.What the actual FDoes Gabe know you're side stepping steam sales and are technically mislabeling your product?"",0"

"513,Sakura Clicker,2017.0,""I think the best way to review a game like this is to break it down, in order to highlight everything properly:ART & DESIGN---------------Dude, 10/10 waifus. You got a huge array of waifus to punch, from the normal Cat, Fairy, and Dragon Girls, to the more out there Mud, Plant and Yuki-Onna Girls. And with each type of girl having a few different design assets, there's a surprising range of designs for the hoards of waifus you'll be clicking through. And if you're sad enough, you may even recognize a couple of assets, backgrounds, and girls from other Sakura games. And there's lots of diversity? You can also customize your player character, and if you shell out, you different little outfits for her, which, depending on the type of person you are, may interest you.SOUND-------I recommend playing this game 100% volume with no headphones to maximize the experience. The constant animu moaning that comes from this game is a wacky and fun thing to hear, and sometimes you get to hear Nya~!, which is, well, horrible, but the ironic charm is fantastic. This is all family friendly fun, you see.GAMEPLAY-----------It's your standard clicker game, where you click the waifus to add them to your harem (Yes, you punch monster girls to add them to your harem, it's â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing fantastic) and get currency to purchase automatic clickers, and upgrades for them to make your clicks do more damage/make the automated attacks stronger/have little power ups. It's nothing out of the ordinary, but why fix what isn't broken? The clicker model has been proven, and this doesn't look to screw it up. The real differentiator comes from...DIFFICULTY CURVE--------------------Yo, this game gets pretty difficult in the end game. This clicker separates the men who wanna look at anime t*tties from the men who wanna play a decent clicker game, and also look at anime t*tties. You'll have to learn to utilize the reset mechanic, as well how to distribute points in order to maximize profit and progress as far as you can, or else you'll plateu in progression. You'll have to take what you learn from previous runs in order to get better.OVERALL----------This game is a MASTERPIECE. Clicker games are tried and true fun times, and this game is no exception. But pair this with the dynamic, diverse waifu punching, the FANTASTIC sound design, and actual strategy involved, it takes the game from an ironic 7/10 meme to a fun 10/10 time waster clicker game. Also, the fact that you can turn it off and still get cash helps level progression, and will save you from racking up too many hours actually in game, sparing you from the embarrasment of your family, friends, and colleagues.

"550,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Compared to the other clicker, casual, upgrade DPS games, this one doesn't compare well.  Tap Tap Infinity allows both Left and Right Click buttons for massive manual damage.  Time Clickers has the cool gun stuff going.  Clicker Heroes has fast multiple level purchases.  This game though can be fun, doesn't play as well as the others.  The cosmetics are cheesy and too expensive in my opinion.  Perhaps some updates are needed."",0"

"552,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""This game is a â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing master piece, I have never played a game with such intuitive and amazing controls.

"554,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""This game was a gift from a frien---- wait.......In all seriousness, this is Clicker Heroes with the enemies replaced with ecchi-themed anime characters. You can purchase small 0.99 euro DLC's to snazz out your character with outfits and hairstyles(some more """"revealing"""" than others, for obvious effects), some even have references to the other """"sakura"""" games(of which I have not played, trust me .-.)Now there is a reason this game states right here in the Steam page that it has English interface and subtitle translations, but only Japenese audio, and that's for a reason. Attacks on the """"enemies"""" make them moan and sometimes say Japanese phrases, again for obvious effects...)You can support the company by either buyin' the small DLC's, or you can support them on their Patreon page!

"555,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Want to drown yourself and boobs and moaning sounds? Well this game is right for you!Pros: -Boobs-More Boobs-Can't have too many boobs- $1 DLC to dress up your heroineCons:-I can't find any since this game is so good. So good that's the only thing bad about it!I've spent 25 minutes on this game, and wish I could've spent more time on it. However the only thing that stopped me from playing more of Sakura Clicker is the sudden realization that I sadly had a life that I need to attend to instead of watching clones in skimpy clothing moan as I move my finger up and down the left mouse button. At least my friends know that I played this game and that I seem to have no life.I (don't) recommend this for sole reason that it (sadly) exists and that every game should be (not) like this.I have committed a sin, and that sin was to play this game, let alone install it.

"556,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""Has a linear story, but the combat is straight forward and somehow it has a lot of plot. You could see the plot, as it visibly thickens, assault you harder than John Cena RKOing a brand flakes cereal box. I couldn't say I didn't find the matters too pressing...but it really moused its way into the dark recesses of my brain. You could say something clicked, repeatedly, in my head as I focused all of my attention to the plot and all of its glory. Well...short version: my hand hurts now. GG 10/10 IGN."",1"

559,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,Its really embarrassing to play this game when someone other than you is in the room while you are playing this game. 10 out of 10 - real sh*t. PLAY THIS GAME when you dont have access to the internet to watch porn/hentai 
560,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,Game is sexist.Your character is female and there are no options yet on being a male.10/10 would still play to hear the screaming cries of the enemies I destroy with my amazing fast fingering technique of my mouse clicking.,1
561,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,sakura clicker or Waifu clicker will be the worst experience of pain you will have. it will leave you with a false sence of everything. you go into this game expecting something stupid. but what you get is your very own personal hell.this game is like a prostitute you will enjoy every moment of it. until the next day where you regret it all. 10T/10    would click my waifus again.,1

"563,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""This game has got to be a contender for indie-clicker of the year.I've never before been so invested in a game such as this, most just do the same old, click click, Sakura clicker offers a deep meaningful progression system, levels and abilities that add variety to the game.If you are bored of old clickers and want something fresh or new, or you just want to have a relaxing fun time instead of wasting energy on modern shooters or """"epics"""" like the terrible witcher 3, this is the perfect game for you."",1"
"564,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""For three days I was completely entranced by this game, then I finally managed to turn it off because I had to restart my computer.Clickers are not really fun but yet you still play them.And this game has ... interesting visuals so among the clickers it's probably my fav.

"565,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""This game is like any other clicker-game"
"566,Sakura Clicker,2016.0,""I like games like this personally. Not for everyone, but it's nice to pass the time with. Only thing I would like is if the outfits and weapons came in a pack like the hair instead of having to pay for them separately and also make it cheaper if kept individual. I would be more willing to actually buy them in support of the dev. Overall a fun and simple game."",1"
"567,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""Really cool and super addicting game. wasted 32 hours. restarted the game 4 times. that was my first time playing this type of game, i.e. """"Clicking Game"""" and i liked it very much. pros: girls moan very sweetlyyou can customise your characteryour supporters have cool buffsafter you reach a certain point you can restart the game with bonus point(+ x% all dmg/click dmg/ally dmg/gold shower)cons:i didnt like that on 600 lvl the dmg of your main character is only 15,5aa(quadrillions) but your supporters have 300aa on lvl 5!!!! its really unbalanced. sometimes it can be useful, but i like to be the main strength, rather than relying on support's damage per second."",1"
568,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,As a professor researching the anime females this game really helps me. My research managed to gather some things about these females. Depending on their facial expression they can ethier enjoy or hate getting hit. If you wanna learn more about the females of animes this game can help you learn which characters are masochists or sadists it's really effective. I indeed recommend this game as a professor of the anime females.,1

"572,Sakura Clicker,2015.0,""What most players care about: This game can be played with only one hand, leaving the other hand free to... attend to private matters...What some players care about: You literally can't mess up, only progress at different speed. There is no end goal, just a bunch of... well, you have eyes, right? Hopefully ears too, there is some real quality variation of audio to be enjoyed.What few players care about: Strategy! Here are a few pointers to get you going.> Save your finger and mouse by investing in sidekicks immediately. After a good while you'll be able to unlock an ability that gives you gold per click, save your strength for that one since it's a crazy powerful booster.> Check an extra time that you locked the door so nobody walks in, your activity can be hard to explain.> Anything other than half naked females that pops up on the screen should be clicked immediately, preferrably 5000 times per second.> Are you using speakers? Keep the volume down or your neighbours will think you're molesting a dozen underaged Japanese girls.> First always try to unlock a new """"ally"""", they are far more useful than investing in the same ones for long.> When you can't afford a new ally any time soon invest in the last one a few more times.> When you reach ridiculous numbers it's time to go back and upgrade allies but DO NOT attempt to get damage buffs that only affect themselves, this is a major trap with NO GAIN. Go for """"Gold Boost"""" and """"All Damage Boost"""".> Rule of thumb: every 100 levels of an ally increases their upgrade cost by 1,000 times, from level 200 to 400 is an increase of 1,000,000 times.> Once not even those cut it and you have even more ridiculous numbers, unlock your personal auto attack and unlock all bonuses from allies that give you a percentage of THEIR attack and all bonuses that increase odds of a critical hit.> When you really can't get any further you can boost your personal level to at least 450 and use """"Rebirth"""" to get spirits used to buy permanent bonuses from various pets, you get more spirits the further you have progressed and the higher your personal level is. Boosting the Attack Speed is expensive but super mega worth it, second priority: boosting Gold, Ally Damage and All Damage. Investing in the boss timer will let you get further before next rebirth, giving you more spirits, for more upgrades, giving more spirits, for even more upgrades.> This game is incredibly pointless, once you embrace that with your heart and soul you'll possibly be able to quit wasting your life. Haha yeah, that's totally gonna happen. At least you can switch to another game.Remember to close the game and put your pants back on when you're done for the day. Happy clicking!"",1"

I've gotten to the point where upgrading costs trillions so pacing has gotten quite slow.For a free game, it's ok.  Not gonna win any awards but then again, I don't think that was ever the case.
